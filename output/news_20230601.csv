42393451,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgBqB,1685661885,"Tether Market Cap Climbs to All-Time High of $83.2B, Even as Stablecoin Market Sinks","Stablecoin issuer Tether’s USDT has regained its previous all-time high market capitalization despite a shrinking stablecoin market.  USDT reached an $83.2 billion market capitalization on Thursday, the company reported, equaling its previous peak little more than a year ago. It has recovered all of the $18 billion it lost since the dramatic implosion of blockchain project Terra in May 2022 and following market rout.  Tether’s milestone is significant as it runs counter to a 14-month stablecoin market decline. Stablecoins are a $129 billion subset of cryptocurrencies and key plumbing in blockchain-based finance, bridging government-issued fiat currencies with digital assets and facilitating trading.  See also: Tether Reports $1.48B Profit in Q1, Reveals Bitcoin, Gold Reserves  USDT has greatly benefitted from the recent woes of its closest rivals. The second largest stablecoin USDC, which is issued by Circle, was hit by the implosion of banking partner Silicon Valley Bank in March, and subsequent wobbles in its price stability are still weighing on the token. The one-time $20 billion Binance USD (BUSD) was essentially given an expiry date when New York state regulators forced issuer Paxos to stop minting new tokens in February.  Tether has been criticized for years for lack of transparency about its reserve assets, including potentially risky loans to undisclosed debtors. Last year, a U.S. judge ordered the firm to produce documents about USDT’s backing as part of a lawsuit that alleged Tether conspired to manipulate the bitcoin (BTC) price with freshly minted tokens. A Wall Street Journal article reported that in the past, the company used falsified documents to get bank accounts.  Stablecoin holders, however, have flocked to USDT during this turbulent period due to its perceived safety from U.S. regulators and banks, propelling its market share to its highest level in at least 22 months.  “Tether’s rise suggests peg stability is far more important for most stablecoin holders than issuer transparency,” Conor Ryder, an analyst at digital asset research firm Kaiko, noted in a report.  A Kaiko report last month raised suspicion about what it termed USDT’s “inordinate” market cap surge because the increase was inconsistent with a plunge in trading volumes to multi-year lows. Other stablecoins’ market cap has generally correlated with trading volumes.  Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief technology officer, said in an interview with The Block that the difference comes from USDT’s growing use for payments predominantly in the developing world, which now accounts for about 40% of all token activity.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/01/tether-market-cap-climbs-to-all-time-high-of-832b-even-as-stablecoin-market-sinks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71a4dceed2838f54ff01dfda3f02196a67c71185-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13089909,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536075,1685660420,"The Bitcoin Bear Market Is Far From Over, Here’s Why","The recovery of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the start of the year brought about hopes that the bear market had finally come to an end. However, the market has since reversed with assets in the space losing a good portion of their Q1 gains. With the current trend, it is more than likely that the bear market is not over. Historical Bitcoin Trends Suggest Otherwise Over the last four bull markets that Bitcoin has seen since its inception, a number of things stand out. The first is that the bear market following a bull market does not seem to come to an end until the year of the halving. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run The Bitcoin Halving is an important event because it cuts down the BTC block rewards in half, hence reducing the number of new BTC being released into circulation. This is a bullish event and has always heralded the start of the bull market for the cryptocurrency. Currently, the market is still about a year away from the next Bitcoin halving set to happen in 2024, and if historical trends are anything to go by, then the bear market is likely to persist through 2023 and into early next year before the first hallmarks of the bull run are seen. Following previous trends, there could still be more pain for BTC to come. If it is to lose around 85% of its all-time high value as it did before the last bull run, then the bottom of the market has likely not been reached yet either. Each bull market began with a halving event | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Investor Sentiment Remains Low After the euphoria of the pump in the first half of 2023 died down, investors have been at a loss when it comes to pitching their tents. As a result, investor sentiment has drawn to a standstill as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index now sits at a neutral 52. This means that investors are not doing anything bullish like buying more Bitcoin at this time, so the bear market is persisting as sellers continue to dominate. A return back into the greed territory would see prices rise again but this is unlikely given that buyers are likely waiting for BTC to revisit $20,000 before getting back in the game. Related Reading: Optimism Crashes 33% Following Token Unlocks, Why There Could Be More Pain To Come For now, BTC is still ranging below $27,000, a support level that bears have successfully flipped into resistance. However, it is still trading above its 100-day moving average, which suggests bullish momentum in the short term, albeit a short-lived one.

Meanwhile, it has been a day of varying price actions for tokens like Uniswap (UNI) and Stellar (XLM) as both look to scale past their support level. More investors join the Sparklo (SPRK) project as the ongoing token presale gains more ground The Sparklo project has caught the eye of investors as more numbers join the project amid an imminent positive price trajectory. Sparklo is an innovative investment opportunity on the blockchain which allows investors to invest in valuable solid treasures like Silver, Gold and Platinum. These timeless treasures can be traded using fractionalized NFTs that act as digital placeholders. The SPRK token is looking to replicate the growth of Bitcoin as crypto experts suggest an over 2,000% growth in the price value of the SPRK token before the end of the year. Investors will get the SPRK token at the price of only $0.030 per token currently. Early investors will also get a 50% bonus offer which lasts until the 2nd of June 2023. This means you have unlimited time to join the project and benefit from this opportunity. It is worth noting that Sparklo has passed its audit with Interfi Network. The BlockAudit Report Team has also approved the project's KYC. To prevent a rug pull and ensure the safety of investors' assets, the liquidity of the SPRK token will be locked for 100 years. This is the time to invest in this project that has the potential to become the next blue-chip crypto. As such, we recommend you join this opportunity now.

Within the last 24 hours, Uniswap's (UNI) price has been stagnant, with the coin losing only 0.53% of its value. As a result, Uniswap (UNI) is currently trading at the price of $5.03. The trading volume of Uniswap (UNI) took a deep dive as it lost 23.32% in trading volume and is currently at $29,377,114. Uniswap (UNI) has shown stability in recent days, with the Uniswap (UNI) coin gaining 2% in the last 48 hours. Uniswap (UNI) is one of the few promising tokens in the crypto market at the moment. However, Uniswap (UNI) coin holders have joined the ongoing Sparklo presale, which crypto experts project will offer a better return on investment. Crypto experts already predict that the Sparklo token will rise exponentially in the year. Stellar (XLM) shines as it witnesses a significant price rally Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized network that works on a peer-to-peer basis to connect financial systems with individuals in need of it for swift payment transactions. Stellar (XLM) is gearing up to become the base layer for the thrilling-dollar stablecoin market which will see it provide fast and secure payments in real time. This development was made known in a published article on the Stellar (XLM) official website, which also highlighted fundamental ideas that should be considered when backing a fiat-backed stablecoin. Stellar (XLM) has seen a 2.06% price increase in the last 24 hours. This has raised the price of Stellar (XLM) to $0.092 currently. However, the trading volume of Stellar (XLM) declined to 16.12% within the last 24 hours. The last 48 hours' price chart of Stellar (XLM) is also bullish. While Stellar (XLM) investors hope that the coin continues its bullish price movement, some have joined the ongoing Sparklo presale to make gains.

42393456,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgCAh,1685655394,Bitcoin Lingers Under $27K to Continue Its May Sluggishness Amid Inflation Concerns,"May gray turned to June gloom on Thursday as crypto prices veered slightly into the red.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at about $26,950, down 0.5% over the past 24 hours and the second consecutive day BTC dropped below $27,000, according to CoinDesk Indexes. The inauspicious beginning to June carried over the downward trend from May when bitcoin’s price dipped almost 4% to break a four-month streak of gains.  Bitcoin soared more than 60% from January, reaching to about $31,000 at one point in mid-April as crypto regained its luster as a safe-haven asset following a string of U.S. bank failures that raised concerns about traditional finance.  “Anytime you have an asset that has a significant volatility such as cryptocurrency, any real monthly move that is under a safe flat fee of 5% is relatively muted,” CoinDesk Head of Index Research Todd Groth told CoinDesk’s ""First Mover"" program on Wednesday. “The broad CMI was down about 2% to 3%. In the context of how much these assets can move over historical basis, it's really a bit of a choppy month. Now we’re looking for that next big narrative to move higher.”  Groth noted optimistically that markets had recently priced in a resumption of more hawkish monetary policy after hopes rose in early May amid encouraging signs that inflation was waning enough to allow the U.S. central bank to halt its nearly year-long campaign of interest rate increases.  Read More: On Heels of First Losing Month of 2023, Bitcoin and Ether Flash Differing Signals  “We have repriced interest rate expectations to not be so dovish without any sort of big market correction lower, so that has been positive,” Groth said but added that the “repricing interest rates higher” has also been a sort of a headwind.”  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently trading at about $1,870, up slightly from Wednesday, same time. Other major digital assets were mostly down, albeit not by much, although litecoin was an exception as it recently rose more than 7% with investors seemingly buoyed by the network’s halving in two months and a jump in activity in May.  Groth noted that LTC and RNDR, the token of the Render Network, a provider of decentralized graphic processing units-based rendering solutions, ranked the CoinDesk Indexes biggest gainers for May. LTC and RNDR have risen roughly 20% and 7.5% over the past 30 days. “We’ve seen the narrative of GPUs broadly repurposed to be these big AI (artificial intelligence) clusters and Render is effectively a decentralized AI cluster,” Groth said. ""So there’s no surprise that on a relative basis, it outperformed, given the buzz and hype over Chat GPT, all these LLMs. That caught some of that Nvidia bump up.”  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, recently sank 0.4%.  Meanwhile, stocks rose a day after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the debt limit ensuring the government could meet its financial obligations at least for the near-term and avoid a shutdown. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, both rose about a percentage point. Gold inched up 0.6% to above $1,995, although it remains well below its near record high of nearly a month ago.  In an email to CoinDesk, Leo Mizuhara, CEO of institutional crypto management platform Hashnote, wrote that crypto markets had “dodged a bullet, thanks to the resolution to the debt ceiling crisis and a growing embrace of digital assets in Asia, particularly in Hong Hong, which has been trying to create easier access for retail investors.  But he added that he is “not expecting a huge breakout for Bitcoin at the moment, and compared the current stasis in markets to 2019 when investors were recovering from an extended bear market.  “We’re basically in a builder’s market,” Mizuhara wrote. “A lot of interesting protocols and companies are being launched. Venture funding is creeping back in. So, like in 2019, we’re likely in this build-up phase that sees a lot of positive energy flowing into the space that in turn sets the foundations for the next bull cycle. Despite the difficulties facing the crypto industry in the United States, what’s happening globally makes it hard not to feel optimistic right now.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/01/bitcoin-lingers-under-27k-to-continue-its-may-sluggishness-amid-inflation-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58c96f8f3f2c22c0f5b3dab889c5fe0e7f1ff9f8-1716x1072.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Both supply and demand valuation approaches suggest that Bitcoin is currently overvalued. The halving could be a tailwind over the next 1-2 years, but this is highly speculative and may be countered by soft demand and tight monetary policy. From a price perspective, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has performed quite well in 2023, particularly in light of persistent inflation and tight monetary policy. With a halving approaching in the next 12 months, speculation will inevitably shift to the potential price impact, and investors may begin positioning themselves in anticipation of this. Investors should not underestimate the extent to which cryptocurrencies are a risk asset that behaves like a proxy for liquidity, though. Absent a financial crisis, liquidity is likely to continue declining, due to both fiscal and monetary policy. This is likely to put pressure on Bitcoin's price, which may negate any potential price impact from the halving, particularly if sentiment becomes sufficiently negative. I have previously described supply and demand approaches to estimating a fair price for Bitcoin, and while these approaches are flawed, an indicator of relative value is needed. As an asset that does not produce any cash flows, Bitcoin's price is ultimately dependent on supply and demand. Metcalfe's Law values Bitcoin based on the number of users, an indicator of demand. The stock-to-flow method values Bitcoin based on supply. Both of these approaches have widely recognized flaws, but are probably as good as any other approach, besides trying to gauge sentiment. Bitcoin's price has increased significantly in the months following previous supply halvings, which some have assumed implies a cause and effect relationship. This may be the case, but it is questionable whether a relatively small shift in the issuance of new Bitcoins could have such a large impact. Given the extent to which Bitcoin exhibits momentum, it is possible that a small shift in the balance of supply and demand could trigger a price rise that investors begin to chase, resulting in a bubble. Figure 1: Bitcoin Supply Inflation (Created by author using data from Blockchain.com) Demand is also likely an important driver of Bitcoin's price, although difficult to measure. Bitcoin's price has moved broadly in line with search interest and active addresses in the past. Both of these approaches suggest that adoption has stagnated in recent years and that Bitcoin is overvalued at the moment. Demand also appears to be procyclical, with higher prices creating demand and lower prices destroying demand. The failure of demand to follow price in recent months suggests the current move-up is relatively weak. Figure 2: Bitcoin Active Addresses (Created by author using data from Blockchain.com) Figure 3: ""Bitcoin"" Search Interest (Created by author using data from Google Trends and Blockchain.com) Given the importance of liquidity, an approach that accounts for changes in liquidity could yield better results. Liquidity also calls into question the importance of Bitcoin's halving. Absent loose monetary policy in 2020 and 2021, Bitcoin's price may not have had a large price run. This is difficult to assess though as changes in liquidity are unlikely to impact all assets equally, and any relationship is likely to be dynamic and highly dependent on investor sentiment. This can be seen in past data, where there have been periods of close correlation between Bitcoin and liquidity, and periods where they have been uncorrelated. Figure 4: Bitcoin Price and US Liquidity (Created by author using data from Blockchain.com and The Federal Reserve) Modelling price based on supply inflation and liquidity results in supply inflation dominating price as liquidity does not exhibit a static relationship. This approach suggests that Bitcoin is currently overvalued, a situation that is likely to get worse as liquidity is withdrawn from the market in the coming months. Figure 5: Bitcoin Price Model (Created by author using data from Blockchain.com and The Federal Reserve) While the halving could provide Bitcoin with a tailwind over the next 1-2 years, from a demand and liquidity perspective Bitcoin appears overvalued. The path of liquidity is somewhat uncertain given the stress on the banking system, but it seems likely that liquidity will continue to decline as the government refills the TGA and the Fed continues QT. This is likely to put pressure on Bitcoin's price, given that liquidity appears to be driving the market at the moment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608886-bitcoin-liquidity-suggests-price-drop-coming?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13088287.jpeg

There are fears that the platform is centralizing Ethereum and could make the blockchain fragile. As of June 1, Lido is the largest decentralized finance protocol. DeFiLlama data shows that the platform manages $13.2 billion in staked assets. At this level, Lido has nearly twice the total value locked (TVL) as in MakerDAO, one of the original decentralized money markets in the sphere. MakerDAO has $6.29 billion in TVL and only serves Ethereum. Lido Is Ethereum’s Weak Point? Concern from critics is not only about the dominance of Lido in terms of TVL but the number of validators using the protocol. According to on-chain data, over 19 million Ethereum has been staked in the Beacon Chain, that is, the proof-of-stake network. However, out of this amount, 6 million Ethereum has been staked through Lido. This translates to roughly 36% of all staked Ethereum passing through the liquidity staking protocol. Moreover, parallel data shows that 32% of all Ethereum validators use Lido infrastructure. In Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system, validators are needed to verify transactions and secure the network against external attacks. Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout The distribution of validators, who now don’t have to run energy-consuming and expensive rigs, is critical for decentralizing the Ethereum network. Global distribution of Ethereum validators would translate to a robust platform where users and operators of protocols, presently managing over $26 billion of assets, don’t have to worry about a majority attack. It is this level of centralization that is emerging in Lido that some Ethereum community members are concerned could destabilize the network. In the past, Prysm, a client operator, lost a significant portion of its market share when it was discovered that over 66% of all Ethereum proof-of-work nodes were using their software. Could this same intervention be require to suppress Lido’s expansion? According to the critics, the current community is lacking in educational material and initiative to address problems as they emerge. Thus far, with 32% of all validators using LidoDAO infrastructure, it is more than twice the limit Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, had recommended for every entity wishing to host the network’s validators. LDO Prices Could Drop With centralization questions emerging, LidoDAO could be forced to decentralized, even by breaking down into multiple entities. However, for LDO holders, any action to break up the protocol’s dominance could have a drastic effect on prices. Related Reading: The $24,000 BTC Bullseye: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Summer Swoon?

This coin has been performing very well, and I believe it has huge upside potential. Adding this to my high-conviction portfolio, though, we could see lower prices. Overview Graphics processing unit ((GPU)) mining has gained popularity over the years, increasing the demand for high-performance graphics cards. Besides its use in crypto mining, gamers, content creators, and video editors also need high-performance GPU-based servers and PCs for rendering, authoring, and publishing their creative works. Procuring high-end GPUs can be challenging for creators because of the cost and energy consumption implications. Most times, the processing capability of the GPU is not fully utilized, leading to a waste of energy. The Render Network ( RNDR-USD ) provides a solution to the problems of the high cost of GPU procurement and GPU idle processing. Render revolutionizes the digital creation process by providing decentralized GPU cloud rendering solutions. Using the Render Network, a creator could run render or streaming jobs on the blockchain instead of procuring high-end, locally-run GPUs. The creator also has room to scale when their render job GPU demands increase. The use case for The Render Network cuts across various industries and applications, including media, augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, gaming, video editing, and the metaverse. Proof of Render and the Render Token Unlike traditional cloud rendering solutions plagued with scalability limits, the Render Network is more powerful and highly scalable. GPU computing power and jobs on the network are tracked, managed, distributed, and processed on the blockchain. How does The Render Network achieve this management, distribution, and processing of render jobs on the blockchain? Let's get a clearer picture by understanding the ""proof-of-render"" consensus. In a proof-of-work, (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, nodes on the network are responsible for validating blocks. In Render's proof-of-render (PoR) consensus, nodes are users with idle GPU resources. When a creator needs to run a render job, the network passes the job to available nodes, and the creator who requests the render job pays in RNDR, an ERC-20 token. Just as nodes in a PoW or PoS network pay nodes crypto rewards, nodes that provide computing power on the Render Network are paid in RNDR. Render's PoR mechanism then ensures that the job is run according to the specification set and the amount paid by the creator. PoR also mitigates any form of fraud on the Render Network. Creators and node operators have a reputation score on the network. Creators with higher reputation scores enjoy perks such as a faster render job processing time. The required render quality and the time it would take to render a job are written onto a publicly-verifiable smart contract when a render job is initiated. The price of a render job is determined in real-time, and it is based on the number of available GPUs on the network with the current demand for rendering jobs. The processing capability of GPUs and render jobs on The Render Network are measured in a benchmarking unit called OctaneBench. The more OctaneBench a user's render job requires, the more RNDR will be charged as payment. The time it would take to complete a render or streaming job also affects the amount of RNDR the user would pay to have their job processed. Users can apply a trade-off strategy between the OctaneBench value and the time it would take to complete a job. For example, a job-consuming two RNDRs could be modified to equal 128 seconds of work at 512 OctaneBench, or 64 seconds of work at 1024 OctaneBench. Recent Render Network Developments Render recently passed the RNP-002 DAO proposal . RNP-002 proposes that The Render Network transition from the Ethereum network to the Solana network. Render will also ditch Solidity as its smart contract language and adopt Rust as its smart contract language. The developers of The Render Network, who put forth the proposal, believe that Rust can provide the Render Network with more incredible speed and flexibility than Solidity. The Render Network has been built with a goal towards providing real-time, rendered, interactive holographic streams. This will require states to be updated dynamically, in real-time and on-chain. To do so, the network needs to be able to write high-performance code both on-chain and on GPUs. Rust can provide the Render Network greater speed and flexibility than Solidity, ultimately permitting the use of the same code for GPU render work and smart contracts. Source: Render Developers About 4,800,000 votes were ""yea,"" while only approximately 36,000 votes were ""nay."" The proposal has since passed, and the Render Network transition from Ethereum to Solana is underway. Render's transition to Solana has also resulted in a partnership with Metaplex, an NFT creator studio built on the Solana blockchain. Artificial Intelligence Models and the Need for Distributed GPU Artificial Intelligence ((AI)) has seen a massive explosion in the past year since the introduction of the Generative Pretrained Transformer ((GPT)) language model and applications based on the GPT model. GPT-based applications such as ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, and Midjourney require enormous computing power and GPU-equipped servers to deliver quality results from these AI-based apps. There is some prospect of the Render Network becoming a machine learning ((ML)) processor. In a blog post published on April 5, Render announced the integration of Stable Diffusion on its website. These integrations are the first of potentially more involving AI, with the Render Network possibly expanding out to include Large Language Model programs like ChatGPT, or users allowing their work to be used in training for large AI models and receive compensation in return directly through the Render Network interface using high throughput micro-transaction royalty flows, Source: Blog post Technical Analysis Here is my long-term analysis for Render: RNDR TA (Author's work) This analysis requires a bit of speculation, but we can roughly forecast a price of around $77 in the future. However, this could take years to materialize, perhaps even two halving cycles. If we measure the length of wave I, which should top around $3.8, and then take this and measure from the potential bottom of wave II, which again, should take us back towards $1, maybe a bit below, then we can roughly predict the coming EWT structure and levels. This is a bit more clear if we look at the smaller time frame chart. RNDR TA (Author's work) So, we can identify an initial three-wave impulse in wave (i), which could be the beginning of our diagonal.- This would put us now inside a final impulse to finish the larger I. The inverse 1.618 ext of wave iv implies a target of around $3.8413. So, if we calculate a retracement from the bottom at 27 cents to this top, then the 61.8% retracement lands us at $0.751, which we can see from the fibs on the right. Risks To an extent, Render has been caught up in the AI hype and has outperformed many coins this year. However, there are some risks. Regulatory risks are always present, and since Render did ICO, it could be flagged by the SEC for being an unregistered security. On another note, I am not particularly fond of Render picking the Solana network. This is a network that has faced problems in the past. If Solana goes down again, this could be a big problem for Render. Final Thoughts Render is a very interesting token, it has performed well, and though we could see lower levels in the future, I'm going to add this to my long-term crypto portfolio.",POSITIVE,ICO | RNDR,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MARKET | SOL | RNDR,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608881-render-ai-coin-huge-upside-potential?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13088142.jpeg

SEC: Here's What's New,"Summary The XRP-SEC lawsuit continues, with XRP scoring a win. The key of the matter remains whether XRP is a security or just digital code. Despite the chaos surrounding XRP, the technical chart looks good to me. Overview The long-lasting legal brawl between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, the firm behind the popular cryptocurrency XRP ( XRP-USD ), has taken interesting turns over time. Regulators, interested parties, and the crypto community have waited for more than two years to hear the final verdict. The outcome of the lawsuit is considered an important factor in determining the future of crypto regulation and giving a clearer picture of where securities laws apply in crypto token offerings. Analysts and top crypto lawyers suggest that a summary judgment ruling may be imminent. SEC's Motion Denied Yet Again In the course of the SEC-vs-Ripple legal battle, several motions filed by the SEC have been denied by the courts . The SEC had earlier filed a motion, in December 2022, to block Ripple Labs from having access to compiled documents related to the controversial June 2018 speech made by SEC's former Corporation Finance director William Hinman at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. The Hinman Speech Documents, which the SEC had sought to seal, are made up of internal emails, memos, text messages, and expert opinions that followed the Hinman 2018 speech, in which Hinman stated: Putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network, and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. Source: William Hinman The SEC has called the controversial speech ""Hinman's own opinion, which does not represent the opinion of the SEC."" The SEC has long argued that the Hinman Speech Documents are irrelevant to the case and should be sealed; however, Judge Analisa Torres, on May 16, denied the SEC's motion to seal the documents, meaning the documents will eventually be made public. Top Lawyers Weigh In Based on analysis by top crypto lawyers, the next logical step to follow Judge Torres' denial of the SEC's motion to seal the Hinman documents will be for both parties - the SEC and Ripple Labs - to reach an agreement on how and when the Hinman documents will be released. A notable Australian-based and pro-XRP lawyer, Attorney Bill Morgan, has asserted that XRP cannot be deemed a security by the SEC. Attorney Morgan hinted at the fact that Ripple Labs has transitioned from institutional sales of XRP to sales to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) clients. The attorney said XRP use in ODL does not satisfy any of the elements of the Howey Test. Attorney John Deaton, the founder of CryptoLaw, weighed in on the probable outcome of the lawsuit. Deaton pointed to the 2018 Hinman speech, calling it a speech that has a lot of input from top SEC officials to be called Hinman's personal opinion. According to Attorney Deaton, the Hinman Speech Documents comprise a total of 63 emails and 52 unique drafts from top SEC officials, which he calls ""a lot for a personal opinion."" Attorney Fred Rispoli, the founder of HODL Law, a law firm dedicated to the unique issues of digital assets and cryptocurrencies, believes that Ripple Labs has a better chance of winning the case against the SEC. He also believes that a summary judgment ruling is near. He shared his insights in an interview with Tony Edward of the Thinking Crypto podcast. Expensive Lawsuit According to a CNBC news report, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, revealed to CNBC's Dan Murphy in a fireside chat at the Dubai Fintech Summit that by the end of the legal brawl with the SEC, Ripple Labs will have spent $200 million. ...by the time all's said and done, we will have spent $200 million defending ourselves against a lawsuit, which from its very beginning, people were like, well, this doesn't make a lot of sense, Source: Garlinghouse, CNBC report. Crypto Tokens Can Evolve We have witnessed instances when a crypto coin or token supposedly transitions from being a security to a non-security. Polkadot, for example, is one of the tokens that have made this transition, according to the Web3 Foundation. In a Twitter thread posted on January 26, the Web3 Foundation announced that the Polkadot's native coin DOT ( DOT-USD ) had morphed into a non-security. So what is token morphing and how does a token go through this process? The DAO report, published in July 2017, made it clear that basically every token used for fundraising a blockchain project is highly likely to be a security in the eyes of @SECGov, this meant the @SECGov was likely to view the DOT token itself as a security, at least initially. But at the same time, the SEC also indicated that any given token could lose its characteristic as a security over time, and no longer be a security (aka to ""morph""),"" Source: Twitter Using a similar argument, Attorney John Deaton asserted in a Twitter thread , published earlier this year, that XRP remains a ""digital code"" even if it was sold as an investment contract. Technical Analysis As the Ripple and SEC legal battle continues, Ripple has been gaining traction, with the price making convincing moves off its low. XRP TA (Author's work) XRP reached a bottom just below 30 cents back in June 2022 and since almost doubled in price at its peak, though we are now back at around 47 cents. This retracement, which I have been expecting, has given us a perfect opportunity to go long. We retraced at the 50% extension of wave iii, exactly where you'd expect wave iv to land. We have then witnessed an impulsive move off the lows, and we should now be in a wave v to end the larger degree wave 3. The target for this wave would be somewhere around 70-86 cents. This is the 1.618 ext of wave 1 measured from the bottom of wave 2. Takeaway The legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs regarding XRP has attracted significant attention and has important implications for crypto regulation. The case could influence the future classification of cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the outcome of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit will have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry and the clarity of regulations surrounding digital assets. In the more immediate term, I see a good chance here to buy XRP before we have a significant rally.",NEUTRAL,DOT | XRP,DOT | ICO | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608875-ripple-vs-sec-heres-whats-new?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13088000.jpeg

These rumors have led to increased withdrawals from the exchange, with a net outflow of $131 million in the last 24 hours alone. To put this into perspective, the 7-day net outflow from Gate.io is $144.8 million, per data compiled by Nansen. Related Reading: The $24,000 BTC Bullseye: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Summer Swoon? Gate.io Denies Liquidity Issues The rumors about Gate.io’s insolvency stem from a tweet alleging a connection between the exchange and Multichain following the arrest of Multichain CEO Zhaojun. The tweet claimed that Gate.io was facing insolvency due to its involvement with Multichain and the potential impact of Zhaojun’s arrest on the Multichain treasury. Despite these rumors, Gate.io has disputed insolvency claims and reassured its users that all funds are safe. The cryptocurrency exchange has recently stated to address rumors about its operations and withdrawals. Gate.io has reassured users that its operations are sound, withdrawals are working properly, and there are no problems with rumored operations or withdrawals. Furthermore, Gate.io emphasizes its commitment to providing users with safe, fast, and reliable virtual asset services and encourages users to be cautious of any unsolicited calls or messages claiming to be from Gate.io. The exchange currently holds $2.4 billion in assets, including 18% in Gate.io’s native token GT, 15% in Ethereum (ETH), 15% in Bitcoin (BTC), and other cryptocurrencies. Despite these reassurances, the increase in withdrawals from Gate.io highlights the impact that rumors and speculation can have on the crypto market, particularly in times of uncertainty. However, Gate.io has stated that it has no direct connection to Multichain and that Zhaojun’s arrest does not affect its operations. The exchange has also emphasized that all funds are held in cold storage, providing an additional layer of security for user assets. Binance CEO CZ Issues Warning Binance CEO CZ has recently advised investors to Secure Asset Fund for User (SAFU) after citing a tweet from Multichain, which reported multiple issues with their protocol due to unforeseeable circumstances. The tweet stated that the team had done everything possible to maintain the protocol running but could not contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance. The tweet also mentioned an issue with the scanning node network of Router5, which affected the normal cross-chain service of some chains. To protect users’ interests, the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain was suspended on the User Interface (UI). This issue was also reported to have occurred on Router2 the week prior. Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout The timing of CZ’s advice to SAFU and the issues reported by Multichain has led to speculation that this may be an early warning to investors about the potential dangers associated with Gate.io. However, it is important to note that CZ did not explicitly mention Gate.io in his tweet, and there is no direct connection between Gate.io and Multichain.

At launch, the marketplace supports the MetaMask wallet as well as payments with fiat currency via credit card.  The marketplace, called ANA GranWhale NFT Marketplace, was released through its subsidiary ANA NEO, which focuses on creating immersive digital experiences across the ANA ecosystem. The first NFT collection on the site will feature work from aviation photographer Luke Ozawa, who has been taking photographs of planes for half a century.

It continues a period of overperformance for litecoin, which is up 7.5% over the last 30 days, the third-best result among crypto assets over that period, and topping bitcoin, which is down 6.2% and ether, which has edged lower by 0.5%  Litecoin’s network activity has been picking up all year and more intensely since the beginning of April. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the total of addresses holding a balance has now pushed to nearly 8.5 million.  Litecoin is also approaching a halving in August which analysts are deeming a significant event for both the network and the price of LTC. Similar to the oft-noted bitcoin halving, the litecoin halving will see its block reward (paid in LTC) slashed by half.  Litecoin is a lot cheaper in terms of units compared to bitcoin, which attracts investors looking to position themselves ahead of the halving, according to Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform. “From investors I'm speaking with, they anticipate the halving to push the price of BTC, LTC and the market,” said Storry.  Litecoin might also be benefitting from the congestion that the Bitcoin network has been witnessing due to the recent burst of activity related to the Ordinals protocol, and leading to soaring costs for users.  “Because of Ordinals and BRC20 tokens taking up large shares of transaction volume on Bitcoin of late, fees have increased as well as the time to process transactions on the network,” said Brent Xu, chief executive officer and co-founder of Umee.  “Litecoin, in a sense, is an old-school clone of BTC and in turn serves a similar purpose,” added Xu. “And this is why you’re probably seeing more people transact in LTC at the moment – it’s serving as an outlet of sorts during a time of BTC congestion,” he said, though cautioning that this has happened before and LTC’s outperformance may thus not be sustainable for the long term.  Nauman Sheikh, Head of Protocol and Treasury Management at Wave Digital Assets, agreed that the halving is influencing the current price performance, noting a 30% rise in open interest for litecoin futures and perpetual contracts during the last week of May.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/01/litecoin-starts-june-strong-as-investors-eye-august-halving-uptick-in-activity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec092fe5f8f910a687d62f7d1313fc308096955b-1141x671.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kris Marszalek said at the time: We grew ambitiously at the start of 2022, building on our incredible momentum and aligning with the trajectory of the broader industry.

42393462,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgCVD,1685645944,Why Elizabeth Warren Is Wrong About Crypto and the Fentanyl Epidemic,"For a while, crypto's role in the illegal and gray area drug trade seemed swept under the rug. Or, at least, it was not getting the attention it could have, which is good and bad for an industry still looking to shed its early associations with the Silk Road digital marketplace, which the Feds shuttered in 2013.  It’s good because people have a tendency to moralize about drug use, and the less crypto is linked to crime in general, the less the entire industry will be stigmatized. However, it would arguably be better to be upfront about such things (assuming they’re going on, as data now suggests), if crypto ever has a shot of finding a killer use case or mass user base who understands why blockchains are important.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is calling for a greater crypto crackdown following new research from blockchain analytic firms Chainalysis and Elliptic that found bitcoin and tether (USDT) have become cornerstone to the global fentanyl trade. These are the same research companies that put out annual reports showing a fraction of a fraction of crypto transactions can be tied to illicit use.  See also: Designer Drug Markets Get Boost From Crypto  “Crypto is helping fund the fentanyl trade, and we have the power to shut that down,” Warren said. “It's time.” The Senator is a long-time critic of crypto, who recently made an incomprehensible “anti-crypto army” campaign part of her re-election bid.  Does the Senator have a point?  I already know what the crypto faithful will say: Chainalyis estimates less than 1% of total crypto transactions are related to crime, so it doesn’t matter if Chainalysis is now saying there’s evidence at least $37.8 million worth of crypto was sent to drug manufacturers in China since 2018.  Hold that thought, we’ll get back to it. First, let’s try to place crypto's alleged use for drug sales in the context of the global drug trade.  To start, it’s difficult to judge how large the fentanyl economy is, because it is by nature kept mostly out of sight. But if Chainlysis and Ellipse’s figures are to be meaningful, they need context. According to one source Chainalysis cited, total “chemical exports” from China (assumed by most authorities to be the largest manufacturer and exporter of black and gray market drugs) surpassed $100 billion in 2021 alone.  But looking at the webpage, I’m pretty sure that figure refers to literally All Chemicals Exported From China, not just the funny ones that make you feel good – but also the ones that are prescribed, used to clean your floor and otherwise. Not to sound like a living Galaxy Brain meme but...your body is chemistry, the Earth is chemistry. It's a broad category.  More context: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it seized a record 14,700 pounds of fentanyl in 2022. At a street price of ~$1,500 per pound (with an actual dose measured in milligrams or micrograms, depending on the fentanyl analogue in question), that’s a little over $22 million worth of the synthetic opioid that otherwise would have been sold.  But like the time when the U.S. Navy measured the success rate of WWII planes solely on those that returned from a bombing campaign, this figure is an example of selection bias. The U.S. government can count the pounds of fentanyl it catches, but not those that slip through its grasp.  Elsewhere, depending on where you look, the total global illicit drug trade ranges anywhere from tens of billions to hundreds of trillions of dollars. The important thing here isn’t to get hung up with the numbers, but to show that Chainalysis’ estimate is likely contingent on a number of factors that always come into play when trying to find the absolute value of something.  Notably, the drug industry does and does not include everything from the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of illicit substances, depending on your chosen frame. The headline number Chainalysis supplies, $37.8 million, is severely limited in scope. It’s based on a predictive map using four identified shops that sell fentanyl precursors in China (precursors are not the drugs themselves, but seem like a fair proxy).  In other words, it says almost nothing about the scope of crypto’s use in the global drug trade – it barely says anything about crypto’s use in the fentanyl industry in just one country.  I’ve argued in the past that Chainalysis’ often cited figure that “less than 1%” of crypto transactions are connected to crime is likely incomplete. It’s based on a sampling of addresses the analytics firm can actually identify or a probabilistic mapping of addresses. That leaves room for unidentified alphanumeric public keys to be kept out of the count. (This, I think, explains why Chainalysis often retroactively increases its reported statistics, because it is literally mapping more crypto addresses giving a better sense of how much illicit activity is happening.)  See also: DeFi 'Rug Pull' Scams Pulled In $2.8B in 2021  As far as I can see, the company does not talk openly about what percentage of crypto addresses it can link to known entities. (I’ve asked, too, without detailed response.) And that’s fair. It’s not in its corporate interest to reveal such information – Chainalysis sells its analytics tech and knowhow to government and corporations that want to Know Things about the blockchain.  There are a lot of people in crypto who view Chainalysis with contempt, because it is a company expressly working against people’s privacy. What’s more important, however, is that Chainalysis showed that the idea of on-chain privacy is a joke. There was a time, I’ve read, when people genuinely thought Bitcoin was a way to transact privately online, which could not be further from the truth.  Being honest about the industry and the limits of this technology is the best thing crypto can do for itself. This includes being honest about crypto's use in online drug markets, rather than sweeping the story under the rug.  At an anecdotal level, almost all clearnet drug marketplaces now have an option for paying with crypto. Many even offer discounts on sales made in crypto, to encourage its use. We also all know that person whose first use of bitcoin was to buy pot or a fake ID. I’d wager, most transactions like this are not swept into analytics firms’ accounting, though, as know-your-customer (KYC) and other data surveillance and sharing rules come into play, that may change.  None of this is not to suggest that crypto plays a superordinate role in the modern illicit drug industry. Or that it should be targeted out in particular, as Sen. Warren suggests. If it wasn’t crypto being used, it’d be a different payment technology. Similar to how some have incorrectly argued that crypto is unlocking a wave of ransomware attacks, the rise in online drugs markets, online crime and crypto are all data points in a larger story: greater and greater internet use.

Voters unanimously favored opening a new real-world asset (RWA) vault named BlockTower Andromeda, according to a vote concluded on Thursday. The vault is dedicated to investing a maximum of $1.28 billion in short-dated U.S. Treasury bonds funded by Maker’s overcollateralized DAI stablecoin, according to the proposal.  Maker will pay a 0.15% arranger fee to BlockTower. Celadon Financial Group will act as a broker and Wedbush Securities will custody assets.

If an ongoing bullish breakout attempt is successful, it could revitalize cryptocurrency bulls across all assets. Why LTCUSD Is Poised To Lift The Crypto Market Back in early 2019, LTCUSD would often lead Bitcoin rallies. If Litecoin was pumping, you could be sure that BTC was about to follow. At no point was this more obvious than ahead of Litecoin’s halving, which was nearly a year ahead of its bigger brother’s. LTC outperformed BTC by a ratio of roughly two to one. However, the coin has since fallen out of favor, and out of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. It was labeled a huge failure during the 2020 and 2021 bull market, lacking a significant new all-time high. At the time, it offered little when compared to layers 2s which were buzzing with NFTs and DeFi built on their backs.

42393464,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgCfT,1685644469,CoinDesk Turns 10: The ICO Era – What Went Right?,"At Consensus 2023, a few CoinDesk staffers came together for a panel reflecting on major events in crypto history. When we were polled on the most important of these big moments, the plurality of votes went to what might seem an odd choice – the chaotic, fraud-filled period of “ICO mania” spanning from early 2017 to mid-2018.  That’s not an obvious choice, because these “initial coin offerings” (ICOs) were not unambiguously a Good Thing. Many of the downsides and threats they brought into crypto have remained big problems – problems like investment fraud and securities violations. One retrospective study found that 80% of all ICOs during the boom were outright scams.  This feature is part of our CoinDesk Turns 10 series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history.  But there was a lot more going on than grifting and rug pulls. Some of the most important projects in present-day decentralized finance launched as part of the ICO bubble, including key pillars like Aave and 0x. Speculators who were informed, careful and very lucky could have walked away with serious returns based on backing real, productive projects.  And the historical significance of the ICO boom goes far beyond the relative handful of actual winners who got funded. Most importantly, if you were one of those informed, careful and lucky investors, you were able to profit from your insights regardless of your geographic location or citizenship. ICOs fulfilled crypto’s promise of cutting out financial middlemen – in this case, the venture capitalists and investment bankers who have long dictated the terms of startup investing.  “Looking back on that period, we were building infrastructure,” says one prominent speculator who first dallied with crypto during the ICO era and went on to work in crypto trading professionally. “You can’t build something, and build the [underlying] infrastructure at the same time. I think of all that as trial runs.”  What was an ICO?  An ICO at the time looked a good deal like an initial public offering in equities markets (and they still do). From a buyer’s perspective, the main difference is that they’re accessible to any individual who can set up a digital wallet and fund it with a smart contract token like ETH, SOL, or ATOM.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10 – The Legacy of Mt. Gox: Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  But there are major differences between what investors in ICOs and IPOs are actually buying. An IPO buyer gets a legal claim on a portion of a company. An ICO buyer gets tokens – and that’s all. Tokens do not formally represent any ownership in a company. While IPO investment gains are premised on growing corporate revenues, ICO tokens only rise in value because people want to use them. Broadly, this is the “utility token” thesis that was believed by some to separate token sales from securities offerings.  That’s why I, and many others, at the time felt the designation “ICO,” so close to “IPO,” would obscure what makes ICOs and tokens unique, especially in the eyes of regulators. Five years later, with a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crackdown ongoing, the nomenclature indeed seems foolhardy.  Because there really is an argument that “utility tokens” are not securities – it’s just an argument that has been abused into almost unrecognizable shape. ICO tokens were intended to grow in value, not because they represented a claim on revenue on a common enterprise, but based on the arguments in Joel Monegro’s “Fat Protocols” thesis (Monegro is a prominent VC with Union Square Ventures). Very roughly, the argument is that tokens issued to fund the creation of a decentralized service would also be required to access that service, and gain value based on the demand for it – but such demand would be driven as much by a broad ecosystem as by any particular designer or administrator.  Would-be ICO investors could read a white paper for a proposed tokenized project, and decide whether the idea seemed to fit this model. They might also examine whether the founders seemed trustworthy. And because public smart-contract blockchain platforms like Ethereum were and are universally accessible and uncensorable, buyers didn’t have to be wealthy accredited investors to put money into good deals.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  But while on-chain anonymity and universal access blew a hole in the fortress of venture investing, they also made some basic due-diligence processes unreliable or impossible. Far more than even during the 2021 crypto boom, transparency during the ICO craze was severely lacking; anonymous founders could easily steal investor funds; and hype often overshadowed any rational approach to evaluating proposed services.  Five years later, with an SEC crackdown ongoing, the ICO nomenclature indeed seems foolhardy  The ICO era was, by most objective measures, a disaster for investors and a huge waste of capital for crypto. But it remains endlessly fascinating – and perhaps not as much of a catastrophe as might appear.  What started of the ICO boom?  It’s hard to nail down a clear starting point for the “ICO era,” but one signpost might be with the $60 million failure of The DAO in 2016. That decentralized organization was intended to act as a collectively managed investment fund for Ethereum-based projects, with a balance of power that privileged major holders.  That project’s investing model balanced the input of experienced large investors with that of less expert funders. As The DAO co-founder Cristoph Jentzch recently put it to me, that model could have bent the whole ecosystem towards deeper, more expert vetting of proposed projects. It might still be the right way to balance the expertise of traditional venture capitalists with the open nature of DeFi.  But The DAO was catastrophically hacked before it could launch, resulting in an extended state of emergency for Ethereum as a whole. Meanwhile, projects that had expected to take funding from The DAO were left high and dry, searching for an alternative model.  Also in this series: 2016 - How The DAO Hack Changed Ethereum and Crypto  For better or worse, that model was close at hand. Ethereum’s token presale, conducted in 2014, became a powerful vehicle (it raised $2.2 million in 12 hours). By the time Ethereum launched in 2016, it had proven not only that a token sale could fund the development of important projects, but that it could make early investors rich.  But the true madness of the ICO era wouldn’t be unleashed until the introduction of the ERC-20 token standard. The standard lays out specific features that ensure tokens operate uniformly across the Ethereum ecosystem, including external tools like wallets and exchange APIs. It was first introduced as early as 2015, though not fully formalized until September of 2017.  Whatever their galaxy-brain promise, the actual results of the ICO free-for-all are not easy to defend  Creating ERC-20s was and remains far less technically and socially challenging than launching a new “layer 1” blockchain. Instead of having to recruit its own miners or validators, a project could rely on the existing security of the Ethereum blockchain. On the other side of the market, ERC-20s were far less technically challenging than standalone blockchains to integrate into exchanges, wallets and other services. It was during the ICO boom that the benefits of smooth interoperability really became clear.  “People started to [adopt] the shipping container worldview,” says our anonymous trader. “Which is that, if these things fit in the same [ERC-20] container, it’s much more efficient.”  The good ICOs  There were unquestionably some huge successes to emerge from the ICO era. Near the top of that list are Aave (AAVE), Filecoin (FIL) and Cosmos (ATOM). Each is a substantial part of the blockchain ecosystem nearly six years after their initial fundraising push, and have generated huge returns for ICO investors.  Another project that emerged from an ICO to produce an actual successful product is Brendan Eich’s Brave Browser, which raised $35 million worth of ETH when it ICO’d in 2017, and has continued to build since. The BAT token that provides various services through the browser certainly hasn’t mooned, but it has largely held value against broader crypto indices.  But those positive examples must be cherry-picked from a much bleaker big picture dominated by fraud, theft and failure. The takeaway seems to be that ICOs can be very effective fundraising tools in individual cases where founders are trustworthy and well-intentioned, but that overall they invite massive fraud.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10 – 2020: The Rise of the Meme Economy  The libertarian ideal of a completely unregulated financial market, in short, did not quite deliver on its promises, in what was arguably the biggest controlled economic test of the idea in modern history.  Why did ICOs fail as an investment model?  A large amount of ICO investment proved unproductive because investors themselves didn’t understand the novel financial and technical theory that made tokens investable. The “fat protocols” thesis fundamentally only makes sense if a protocol or contract’s function is truly native to or tightly integrated with its token. Good examples include ether’s role as “gas” for Ethereum transactions, or filecoin’s use to pay for verifiable on-network storage. These use cases make sense because they leverage the three blockchain pillars of decentralization, open access and trustlessness.  But the further you get off-chain with any feature of a distributed ledger, the more this model breaks down, for at least two reasons. First, because there’s less and less on-chain verification that goods or services are actually being provided, inviting fraud. This was seen repeatedly in scam ICOs, where entrepreneurs claimed their tokens were “backed” by real estate or diamonds – claims that couldn’t even be verified, much less redeemed, on-chain.  Similarly, “fat protocols” can’t hold when there’s no *exclusivity* to the relationship between a token and a service. You can’t use anything but ETH to run smart contracts on Ethereum, so ETH has economic value. But you can take your pick of currencies to pay a dentist, so dentacoin (a “blockchain solution for the global dental industry”) doesn’t have economic value.  Investors missing these fundamentals enabled a huge amount of low-IQ mis-investment and fraud. And we’ve seen it continue into the present day, such as with various “exchange tokens.” There is no rational investment thesis for a nominally decentralized token attached to a fully centralized exchange, yet traders treat tokens like Binance Coin and FTX’s FTT as similar to equity.  But even for those with full comprehension and the best of intentions, ICOs had major downsides. The capital structure, which often led to startups getting huge blocks of cash up front, remains its most profound drawback. If you raise several hundred million dollars to start a project, you no longer have much incentive to actually build it.  “If you were a builder then, you had a choice,” says our ICO veteran. “You could cash in quick with bananacoin, or you could go start something like Maker or ENS and work hard for years and make a lot more money.”  Read more: CoinDesk at 10: 2019 - The Ghost of Libra Lives On  Further, the necessity of high-stakes treasury management was basically detrimental. Most ICOs raised in ETH, which crashed dramatically in dollar terms soon after the ICO bubble died down. So when it came time to actually operate, the U.S. dollars available to hire developers and pay for offices were far fewer than the initial headline fundraising number might have suggested.  At the same time, the temptation of speculating with ICO funds was too much for some founders. A project called Substratum was found in 2018 to be actively trading with its treasury, with a full-time trader on staff. (Substratum is no longer active, but it at least seems to have been a legitimate project. It was reportedly acquired in 2021 by Epik, a domain registrar, and the token now trades at basically zero.)  Even happy versions of this story conceal this shadowy underbelly: A successful startup called Monolith, for example, managed to turn a $16 million raise into $25 million using a DeFi-based hedging and leverage strategy. The problem here, even leaving aside hidden risks, is that this activity meant time-and-effort not spent developing the actual product pitched to investors.  Here we see just one way 2017 ICOs created a misalignment of interests. Because they exist outside of any real legal framework, ICO tokens didn’t give investors any direct exposure to the upside of treasury speculation. Holders benefit if a project is finished and finds real users (or if investors can find a “greater fool” to sell their tokens to in the meantime). Building is obviously easier with 50% more funds, but there’s no true, enforceable obligation to actually spend those funds on the project.  On the other hand, major treasury *losses* are almost guaranteed to harm investors by slowing or stopping development. And those are infinitely more likely if a project is gambling with its own funds.  The end of the ICO era  It’s impossible to pinpoint a real “end” for the ICO era, because while they’re less visible in the U.S. and similar jurisdictions now, they still happen frequently. But one kind of end to the ICO era can be marked to the moment existing large companies tried to get in on the action – and hit a brick wall.  Most notably, Telegram’s plan to tokenize the network and sell a TON token was a technically defensible idea that might have been transformative, but serious pressure from the SEC in 2019 led to its cancellation. Also in 2019, the SEC sued messaging platform Kik for its 2017 token sale, eventually leading to a $5 million settlement.  I would nominate a less obvious 2019 event as also marking the end of the ICO Era: Facebook’s proposal of the Libra stablecoin. Libra likely would not have been issued or sold as an ICO. But as the highest regulatory and legal bodies in the U.S. scrutinized it, their blunt hostility made clear that they were horrified by Facebook’s adoption of norms and practices that had become standard in crypto. The regulatory backlash we’re facing five years later still seems fueled by that incredulous outrage.  Can we do better?  There may someday be a regulatory regime that successfully imposes good transparency and controls on ICOs while retaining their advantages of accessibility. But that’s likely many years, or even decades, away. In the meantime, though, is there a way to bend the moral arc of token launches towards rationality and honesty?  It can be difficult not to regard those who lose money on ICOs cynically. Many ICOs were and are so obviously scammy that it can be hard to feel bad for people who fall for them. That’s especially true because so many token traders are self-described degens and gamblers.  But free market economic theory sees a longer-term upside. A true Wild West like the ICO scene can be seen as a process of education and hardening, with every loss a lesson. It is the precise opposite of the infinite-bailout mentality that people fear in the current mainstream banking environment. Over time, in theory, it should make participating individuals much smarter investors, ultimately leading to a “safer” market than any regulation could impose – at least after a sufficient period of hard lessons.  That, at least, is the theory. ICOs are the financial equivalent of Darwinian evolution, slowly weeding out both fraudulent founders and uninformed speculators. Maybe the carnage of the ICO era made traders smarter. Maybe over time, this radically free transnational investment market will become a global positive for humanity.  On the other hand, five years after it first bloomed, the persistence of degeneracy and ignorance among crypto speculators can overpower that optimism. Whatever the theory, real-world outcomes are hard to dismiss – and as of right now, whatever their galaxy-brain promise, the actual results of the ICO free-for-all are not easy to defend.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42393457,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgCFp,1685643632,"For Financial Advisors, Real World Assets Could Be a Safe(r) Path to Crypto","One of the most exciting use cases for blockchain technology is commonly referred to as Real World Assets, or RWA. Based on a report from Boston Consulting Group, the on-chain RWA market is expected to reach between $4 trillion and $16 trillion by 2030.  We spend so much time talking about the value of crypto assets like bitcoin and ETH, especially when it applies to financial advisors, but RWA can drive trillions of dollars in adoption, is touted by some of the biggest names in finance (JP Morgan, Citi, Boston Consulting Group, Blackstone) and will be extremely important for advisors to understand.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Are Real World Assets like crypto assets?  Most assets we talk about with regard to blockchain are chain-native assets like bitcoin, ETH, SOL, or UNI. This means they are native to a public blockchain and derive their value from the use or performance of a protocol.  For example, bitcoin is an incentive for miners to continue processing blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, while ETH is used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum network.  When we talk about Real World Assets, we usually mean the integration of using on-chain databases to track the assets, with performance and valuation coming from outside the blockchain.  For example, I could have a token that represents equity in a real estate investment, or in a pool that lends money to entrepreneurs in the developing world. While the token is on a blockchain, the assets and payments are in the real world.  The Real World Asset tokens are simply representations of assets that are not necessarily blockchain-native, and are NOT volatile assets like we think of in crypto. These RWA tokens, like all cryptographic tokens, are programmable, so we can encode lockup periods, and accredited investor requirements.  Why use a blockchain?  Public blockchains are simply decentralized databases, good for storing information in an immutable manner. We currently store our data – money, private company equity, loans, financial records – in centralized databases with names like Google, Amazon, Chase, Schwab and your local county title database. Therefore, we have to ask permission every time we want to access that data, and the data from one silo doesn’t easily or natively work with data from another.  When we move that data onto a public blockchain, we can control it using a wallet, a self-custody technology that works hand in hand with blockchains. Once it’s there, we can take advantage of many of the benefits of public blockchains:  Transparency: for understanding the true value of an asset  Efficiency: for making distributions to owners via their wallets  Liquidity: the on-chain nature allows for marketplaces so we can buy and sell previously illiquid assets.  Self-custody: I can maintain control over my assets.  Collateralization: I can use my assets as collateral, possibly even through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Why should advisors learn?  Clients are increasingly interested in alternative assets – private credit, real estate, collectibles. Often RWA tokens will represent some of these alternatives.  We already see private credit from Maple Finance and Goldfinch, as well as collectibles from Rally Road and 4K. For years, we haven’t seen many options for clients to find income in their portfolio. As interest rates have risen, many of the RWA options offer double-digit returns through interest, without the crypto volatility risk. They can make low-risk loans in markets where Traditional Finance can’t or won’t go, and keep the process efficient.  Advisors will need to understand the increased transparency and liquidity. Your clients may have the chance to sell half their real estate tokens after 12 months, and use that money to invest in a pool aimed at providing invoice factoring.  Advisors should also have a good knowledge of self-custody, and the efficiencies and security risks inherent to it, so they can help clients invest in these alternatives.  Additionally, the increase in activity around RWA will drive more use of the networks. For blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon, this may also trigger higher token prices since the native token – ETH or MATIC – is used to pay for the transactions.  The promise of blockchain technology has always been about increasing inclusion and efficiency through public databases. Unlike addressing native crypto assets, which can be volatile and subject to new regulations, Real World Assets on-chain are simply more efficient, transparent ways to denote what people are already comfortable investing in.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/01/for-financial-advisors-real-world-assets-could-be-a-safer-path-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/830dfe343fa5e6ba6305a5648872768892e194bf-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite similarities in performance, the CoinDesk Indices Trend Indicator for both assets implies differences in their near term direction.  While the Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) is flashing a “neutral” signal, the Ether Trend Indicator (ETI) implies that token is in a “significant uptrend.”  The gauges are designed to convey the direction of price and strength of momentum for the assets. Daily signals are generated with BTC and ETH being associated with one of five distinct categories, ranging from “Significant Downtrend” to “Significant Uptrend”.  The methodology underpinning signal generation involves moving averages of different lengths, and the extent to which shorter duration averages cross above or below longer duration ones.  Ether’s trend is relatively young, having moved from neutral to significant uptrend three days ago. Bitcoin, meanwhile, flipped from downtrend to neutral just four days ago.  A longer look at ETH’s chart shows a general uptrend since November 2022 and a gain of 55% so far in 2023. Bitcoin’s 62% advance this year continues to outperform, but the gap has narrowed over the past month as bitcoin dipped nearly 8% in May while ether was roughly flat. That relative bitcoin weakness led to an 8.2% increase in the ETH/BTC ratio since April 30.  Ether bulls would also likely point to the 274,000 ETH contraction in supply since September, as an indication of value and beginning to show effect..  On-chain data suggests that investors remain bullish on ETH. The funding rate for ether futures has been positive since April 7, with the exception of just two days. Funding rates represent payments made between holders of perpetual futures contracts, and when funding rates are positive, it implies that investor sentiment is bullish; when negative, bearish..

Recognizing developers' pivotal role in driving adoption, the IoTeX community has voted massively in favor of IoTeX's Improvement Proposal 15 (IIP-15) for Sharing of Gas-Fee with dApps (SGD). With its groundbreaking IIP-15, IoTeX aims to unlock a new era of high-level innovation, engagement, and sustainable growth. By sharing a portion of transaction gas fees with dApp developers, IoTeX sets the stage for an ecosystem where creativity thrives, users are captivated, and developers are incentivized like never before. The IoTeX community has passed the groundbreaking IIP-15 with 98.5% in favor, and 1.5% against the proposal. A total of 224 wallets participated with nearly 157.4 million IOTX staked. The IoTeX Foundation will distribute 224 Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to reward those who participated in the IIP-15 DAO governance vote. Becoming the DePIN leader “The significance of IIP-15 cannot be overstated,” said IoTeX CEO and Co-Founder Raullen Chai. “For IoTeX, it represents another step toward becoming the leader within the burgeoning Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) space. It also represents a paradigm shift in how blockchain platforms value and compensate their development community.” “By proposing the revenue-sharing mechanism through SGD, IoTeX opens the doors for community members to actively participate in shaping the platform's future and fostering a vibrant ecosystem,” Chai said. Striking a fair balance As users interact with dApps on the IoTeX blockchain, a portion of the transaction gas fees is automatically accrued in the SGD treasury. The proposal recommends that 30% of the gas fees be reallocated to the SGD treasury to strike a fair balance and incentivize sustainable growth. At the same time, the remaining portion continues to contribute to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewarding pool. The actual ratio may be subject to adjustment through governance voting. DApp owners can withdraw their accumulated revenue by initiating a claim action. The SGD treasury verifies the eligibility criteria, including transaction volume and time deployed on the chain, through the SGD registry. Once the criteria are met, the treasury issues the corresponding rewards. To maintain the integrity and quality of the ecosystem, the IoTeX Foundation implements a review process, approving dApps based on their performance and adherence to guidelines. Transparency and efficiency The SGD initiative comprises two main components to ensure transparency and efficient management: the SGD Treasury and the SGD Registry. The treasury module handles gas fee distribution, accounting, and the SGD rewards claims process. The registry consists of a system contract and an indexer. dApp owners utilize the system contract to register their dApp contracts and reward addresses, while the indexer keeps track of SGD contract addresses, owners, and the number of contract calls. Implementing this fee-sharing model requires careful consideration to prevent potential abuses. To address this concern, the IoTeX Foundation has set eligibility criteria to qualify for revenue sharing. DApps must have completed at least 100,000 IoTeX Layer 1 blockchain transactions, have been deployed and running smoothly for at least one month, and receive approval from the IoTeX Foundation. The Foundation reserves the right to disapprove dApps involved in spam transactions or illegitimate activities, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the SGD program and protecting users' interests. Driving innovation Implementing the SGD feature will be part of an upcoming hard fork, ensuring backward compatibility with existing applications and infrastructure. With this forward-thinking proposal, IoTeX joins a growing movement for blockchain platforms to actively reward their dApp creators, driving a virtuous cycle of innovation, user engagement, and overall ecosystem growth. As IoTeX continues to expand its reach and influence, IIP-15 solidifies its position as a trailblazer in blockchain technology. Through this revenue-sharing model, IoTeX sets the stage for a new dApp development era that rewards creativity, nurtures innovation, and fosters a new and exciting design space for Web3 applications.

13085721,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608836-bitcoin-investment-case?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1685642400,The Investment Case For Bitcoin,"Summary Bitcoin's limited supply and increasing adoption make it a potential store of value and hedge against inflation. Bitcoin's divisibility and transparency make it a superior alternative to gold for investors. Bitcoin's low correlation to traditional asset classes can enhance portfolio diversification and improve risk-return profiles. Please note that VanEck has exposure to Bitcoin. We often refer to Bitcoin as “digital gold” because, like the metal, it is a potential store of value. Like gold, bitcoin’s characteristics include: Limited supply: Maximum supply of 21 million. This scarcity means that the price could move upward as adoption increases. Increasing adoption: Bitcoin has been gaining traction in terms of the number of merchants that accept it as payment. In 2021, El Salvador made headlines by declaring Bitcoin as legal tender. As the first country to do so, El Salvador serves as a good macro case study for Bitcoin as legal tender. Potential inflation hedge: Monetary stimulus is currently eroding purchasing power globally and Bitcoin might outperform as it’s not subject to the same inflationary manipulation as traditional currencies. Portfolio diversification benefits: Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset. However, unlike gold, bitcoin is: Divisible and transparent. Bitcoin’s Limited Supply Creates Scarcity and May Increase Its Value Over Time There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin in existence. This supply cap was designed intentionally and is one of the primary characteristics of Bitcoin. Furthermore, Bitcoin has “halvings” programmed into it. A halving is defined as a 50% block reward cut to the Bitcoin production rate, and they occur roughly every four years. This means that the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation slows down over time until it eventually reaches zero (estimated to occur around the year 2140). Furthermore, these halvings increase the difficulty of mining Bitcoin and will occur until the supply cap is reached. In addition, the built-in finite supply of bitcoin means that it is not subject to inflation in the same manner that fiat currencies are. Central banks around the world have ushered in unprecedented growth in money supply, effectively eroding their currencies’ purchasing value. In comparison, Bitcoin’s limited supply and increased mining difficulty over time may support the idea of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and as an alternative to gold. Bitcoin Adoption Continues In its early years, bitcoin was largely used by a small group of tech enthusiasts. It was difficult and cumbersome to obtain with limited use cases and very few merchants accepting it as a form of payment. In 2023, bitcoin adoption has grown substantially as it has become more mainstream. Now, more than ever, merchants and businesses are accepting bitcoin as a form of payment and infrastructure has been built to make it more convenient for the average person to use. The development of user-friendly wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces has removed the technical barriers to entry that existed in bitcoin’s early years. Bitcoin interest among institutional investors has also increased. Hedge funds, asset management firms, and endowments are increasingly recognizing bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and as an effective portfolio diversifier, specifically, when looking through the lens of an uncorrelated asset that has the potential to hedge against inflation. Bitcoin transactions have exceeded 570,000 permission-less transactions per day, exhibiting significant network value. 1 Daily Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Transactions (12/1/2012 - 5/8/2023) Source: Y-Charts as of 5/8/2023. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Layer 2s (such as Liquid by BlockStream) may be the next step in boosting Bitcoin adoption as they allow for scalability and customizations while retaining many of Bitcoin’s security properties. Built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, we believe the Lightning Network pushes the boundaries of Bitcoin payment capabilities with lower costs and faster speeds. One notable upcoming layer 2 development on the bitcoin network is RGB. This development is important because it enables the creation and management of digital assets on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or even other cryptocurrencies can be issued and traded on top of the Bitcoin network, adding a new layer of functionality. The RBG protocol is designed to be scalable and not resource-intensive, allowing users to create and manage digital assets without requiring extensive changes to the underlying Bitcoin network. It can be integrated into existing bitcoin wallets and infrastructure, thus making it easier for developers and users to create and manage digital assets. RBG has the potential to expand the use cases of bitcoin, making it a more versatile and useful platform for developers and users alike, ushering in new opportunities for innovation and growth within the ecosystem. Potential Hedge Against Inflation The unprecedented worldwide growth in money supply following the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread inflation, eroding the purchasing power of established fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s role as a potential hedge against inflation has increasingly become a talking point central to investment decision-making. As previously eluded to, the cornerstone of this idea lies in its limited supply and decentralized nature. Unlike fiat, which can be printed by governments and central banks, bitcoin has a fixed supply, with supply growth decreasing by 50% every 4 years with the halving events. Bitcoin is not subject to the same inflationary pressures caused by fiat money supply growth, making it an attractive option for investors concerned about the impact of inflation on their portfolios and their subsequent purchasing power. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it impervious to geopolitical events or economic policies that may lead to currency devaluation, such as QE (quantitative easing) or excessive government spending. Bitcoin’s Role in an Investment Portfolio If Bitcoin is increasingly used as an asset with monetary value, what role might it play within an investment portfolio? Bitcoin may potentially increase portfolio diversification because of its low correlation to traditional asset classes, including broad market equity indices, bonds and gold.

While bitcoin shares some of the characteristics attributed to gold, below are differences that, in our view, potentially make it superior. Divisible: As a physical asset, gold can only be divided into smaller units to a certain extent, making smaller transactions cumbersome and, in some instances, impractical. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is divisible up to eight decimal places (with the smallest unit called Satoshis), making it easier to use for microtransactions. Transparency: All transactions that have ever occurred or will occur are publicly available on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature makes it difficult to manipulate and impossible to counterfeit bitcoin, increasing trust in the network. Gold lacks the same level of transparency – when it is traded, the details of the transaction, such as the buyer, seller, and price, are often not publicly available. This lack of transparency may make it more difficult to verify the authenticity of the gold being traded and may lead to an increased risk of fraud and manipulation. Overall, while gold has been used as a store of value and in transactions for centuries all over the world, its lack of transparency can make it more challenging to verify and track compared to digital assets like bitcoin. As inflation poses challenges to investors globally, both gold and bitcoin are likely to come front and center as potential hedges to protect purchasing power. With bitcoin’s benefits like divisibility and transparency, we see it as a competitor to gold, and believe it is likely to garner even more adoption to retail and institutional investors alike.

Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading, and accordingly, may have undercompensated or overcompensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors such as market disruptions and lack of liquidity. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading (for example, the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses). Hypothetical or model performance is designed with benefit of hindsight. Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3 products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. There are inherent risks with fixed income investing. These risks may include interest rate, call, credit, market, inflation, government policy, liquidity, or junk bond. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This risk is heightened with investments in longer duration fixed-income securities and during periods when prevailing interest rates are low or negative. Emerging Market securities are subject to greater risks than U.S. domestic investments. These additional risks may include exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls; less publicly available information; more volatile or less liquid securities markets; and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic or social instability. Gold investments are subject to the risks associated with concentrating its assets in the gold industry, which can be significantly affected by international economic, monetary, political developments and other risks specific to the gold industry. Foreign and emerging market gold security investments may entail heightened risks, such as adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic or social instability. Hard assets investments are subject to risks associated with real estate, precious metals, natural resources and commodities and events related to these industries, foreign investments, illiquidity, credit, interest rate fluctuations, inflation, leverage, and non-diversification. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

42420315,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0Qv,1685641853,"Bitcoin Miners Gain Support From Texas With Two Bills Passed, One Halted","Texas legislators are throwing their weight behind bitcoin mining with two bills passed in the latest legislative session that are signaling support for the industry — and one thwarted for the time being.  In the past few weeks, two bills — SB 1929 and HB 591 — that show support for miners have made it through the legislative stage and are awaiting Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. If signed, they take effect on Sept. 1.  The bill SB 1929 requires miners whose energy capacity is larger than 75 megawatts (MW) to register with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) of Texas as large loads operators, which then shares their data with the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator. The bill is in line with the March 2022 interim interconnection process formed by ERCOT’s Large Flexible Loads Taskforce, which is responsible for drafting policy to manage big electric loads such as bitcoin miners.  Meanwhile, HB 591 was sent to the governor on April 18, and will introduce tax exemptions from companies that put to use otherwise wasted gas, including data centers.  “These bills signal that Texas remains the jurisdiction of choice for bitcoin, blockchain, and digital assets,” said Lee Bratcher, president of local industry group Texas Blockchain Council (TBC).  Read more: Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol Piloting a Waste Gas Methodology With Miner Crusoe Energy  The third bill, SB 1751 — dubbed by some the ""anti bitcoin mining bill"" and which would have capped the industry’s participation in cost-saving demand-response programs — was stopped at the committee stage. Demand-response programs are various schemes in which miners get power credits for curtailing their operations at times of peak energy demand.  State Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, the bill’s lead sponsor did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on this story.  ""More miners in the [demand-response] program means more load can be reliably called on to help balance the grid,"" said Dennis Porter, who leads another industry advocacy group, Satoshi Action Fund. ""We are increasing communication with the PUC and ERCOT which will improve transparency and publicly available data on mining which ultimately is good for the industry,"" he noted.  However, the opposition of SB 1751 isn't what defeated it, said Jackie Sawicky, who has brought together hundreds of Texas residents in an activist group called Concerned Citizens of Navarro County. ""The house just didn't prioritize it and the session ended/ran out of time,” so the bill can be reintroduced in the next session, she said. The next session will start in January 2025.  Bill SB 1751 would have taken the threshold for registering with state grid authorities to 10 MW.  “Texas is setting a standard for how to adopt this new and innovative technology,” said Porter.  Texas innovation  Texas is one of the largest bitcoin mining hubs in the world due to cheap energy and friendly regulators. As policy on bitcoin mining at the federal level has lagged, the state, the largest by energy production in the U.S., is marching on with its own rules.  However, it's not the only state that’s pro-mining. Legislation protecting mining was passed in Arkansas and Montana. Similar bills in Missouri and Mississippi have died.  By contrast, New York imposed a two-year moratorium on new fossil fuel-based bitcoin mines. Oregon is currently considering legislation that would require data centers, including miners, to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  Meanwhile, a 30% tax on bitcoin mining proposed by the Biden administration appears to have stalled. The tax didn’t make it into a bill on the debt ceiling, which passed on Wednesday. According to Rep. Warren Davidson, the tax will likely not return as part of the U.S. budget.  “With policy stagnation at the federal level, the states are stepping up to be the incubators of innovation,” TBC’s Bratcher said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/01/bitcoin-miners-gain-support-from-texas-with-two-bills-passed-one-halted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/601587e4b509b316d0e787496c33ce983b0778f5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420323,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0ZB,1685640427,CoinDesk Turns 10: 2022 - How Crypto Gods Turn Into Monsters,"2022 for crypto was an unprecedented hellscape of disasters – and the collapse of FTX was its culmination.  It was also unprecedented for CoinDesk. Unlike any previous moment of failure in crypto history, this time we found ourselves at the epicenter, as our reporting triggered the events that unfolded.  This resulted in a weird mix of bad and good news for CoinDesk itself. On one hand, Ian Allison and Tracy Wang’s coverage of FTX – including its egregious balance sheet and chaotic corporate governance – brought CoinDesk its first prestigious journalistic prize, the George Polk Award. CoinDesk received more mainstream recognition than at any time during the company’s 10 years of existence.  This feature is part of our ""CoinDesk Turns 10"" series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history. This feature about FTX, and other scandals, is our choice for 2022.  On the other hand, the tsunami wave triggered by the FTX collapse shook pretty much every significant company in crypto, including CoinDesk’s parent company DCG and its trading subsidiary Genesis. That unraveling has led directly to talks about CoinDesk’s potential sale.  With major companies like Celsius, Terra/Luna and Three Arrows Capital also collapsing, 2022 was quite a year.  Out of the blue  Before his disgrace, Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the biggest names in crypto, a fixture on the Washington D.C. lobbying circuit and a regular on the front pages of the financial press.  “Sam Bankman-Fried was a true celebrity in crypto, and once you’re that level of famous, people kind of assume: yeah, he must be legit,” says Tracy Wang, one of CoinDesk’s award-winning journalists who, together with Ian Allison, lead the coverage of FTX’s crash.  Read more: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet  On Nov. 2, 2022, Ian Allison’s revealed the weak balance sheets of the FTX-affiliated trading firm Alameda Research, which started both companies’ undoing. It turned out Alameda, despite SBF’s repeated claims it was absolutely separate of FTX, relied heavily on tokens created by FTX and, more importantly, on its unassuming users’ money.  Until that moment, most stories about FTX revolved around the founder’s prolific lobbying activites and FTX’s plans to launch its own stablecoin.  The exchange's revenue was off the charts the previous year and it made regular headlines after partnering with sports and music events, buying stadium naming rights and hiring celebrities as brand ambassadors. Meanwhile, FTX grew into a formidable force in crypto politics, with SBF making rounds in D.C. and FTX joining mainstream finance trade groups, like the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.  All that made FTX look like a big and reliable institution, and at first, CoinDesk’s findings of Alameda’s misdeeds did not seem like something potentially “cataclysmic,” Allison says now. It did not feel like he was revealing anything that seismic. Even as the dominos started falling, it seemed like “Sam could fix it,” Wang said.  “We thought that it was interesting that so much of Alameda’s balance sheet was the FTT token, but then we did not expect the company to go to zero,” Allison said.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10 – The Legacy of Mt. Gox: Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  Yet, it did. Following Allison’s scoop, the CEO of Binance, FTX’s archrival, said he was going to sell all the FTT Binance owned, pushing down its price (FTT plunged from $25 to $1 in a matter of two weeks) and prompting fears of an FTX insolvency. What followed was akin to a bank run on FTX: users withdrew $6 billion from FTX in 24 hours starting on Nov. 8.  The rest is history: in a little more than one week, FTX turned from a crypto powerhouse buying troubled competitors to a failing company desperately trying to sell itself to Binance and then promptly filing for bankruptcy.  To end insult to injury, it turned out that both FTX and Alameda had been led by a close-knit group of SBF’s friends, sharing the same mansion in the Bahamas with no clear delineation between personal, business and romantic relationships. That “gang of kids in the Bahamas,” as Tracy Wang put it in her piece, ruled FTX and Alameda as they saw fit, with little transparency and accountability.  Read more: Bankman-Fried’s Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire – and Dated. Other Employees Have Lots of Questions  Later, the new FTX CEO John J. Ray III said in the bankruptcy proceedings that “the FTX Group was tightly controlled by a small group of individuals who showed little interest in instituting an appropriate oversight or control framework.”  They “commingled and misused corporate and customer funds, lied to third parties about their business, joked internally about their tendency to lose track of millions of dollars in assets, and thereby caused the FTX Group to collapse as swiftly as it had grown,” Ray wrote.  “We were shocked when FTX collapsed: wow, there was this fraud going on in front of our faces, and all we knew about FTX had been a lie,” said Wang. FTX staffers “were as shocked as the rest of us,” and “a lot of employees felt betrayed by Sam.”  Read also: 8 Days in November: What Led to FTX’s Sudden Collapse  Well-kept secret?  Although things looked bright for FTX even right before its downfall, at least some players on the market could smell something suspicious around the workings of Alameda, Allison says. It was not a secret that Alameda did market-making for FTX, he said, showing that the two companies, if technically separate, were at least working closely together.  Around September 2022, one of Allison’s sources briefly mentioned that Alameda’s balance sheet is “weaker than everyone thought it was.” Allison started talking to more sources about this and soon enough, “one of those people who had obviously been trading with Alameda provided more recent snapshots of the balance sheet,” he says. Those snapshots revealed how weak that balance sheet was was and how much Alameda and FTX had been intertwined, Allison said.  It was not entirely surprising in a way. “The whole crypto market was at a very precarious point at that moment,” Allison said. The market crash and multiple crypto bankruptcies of 2022 came as a tough hangover after the intoxicating bull market of 2021, when ambitions and arrogance in the crypto-verse went off charts.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  Back then, founders of Three Arrows Capital fund (now bankrupt) teased the public with promises of infinite growth in crypto, or so-called “supercycle,” and terraUSD (UST) stablecoin founder Do Kwon (now under arrest) trolled prominent VCs on Twitter.  The awakening was harsh. In May 2022, Do Kwon’s algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its peg to dollar and crashed, revealing the poor design of the coin and throwing a shade on algorithmic stablecoins as a concept. In July, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which bet heavily on UST and its sister cryptocurrency LUNA, filed for bankruptcy.  Soon, it turned out some major players on the crypto market trusted and invested in 3AC success too much, so companies like Voyager, Genesis, BlockFi and Celsius also went underwater and filed for bankruptcy. FTX was the latest addition to this list, but the most spectacular one, given the fame and ambitions of Sam Bankman-Fried.  Wang says before the crash, some people on the market could see that Alameda might also fall in the ongoing industry purge: “A lot of people have been thinking that Alameda might have been more levered than they assumed and they were scared that it could have been another 3AC scenario,” she said.  There was another, as Wang calls it, “orange flag” (not bad enough to be red, but still worrying, she explained): SBF’s “effective altruism” showed his larger-than-life ambitions and willingness to make FTX a success at any cost.  “Sam was definitely an envelope-pusher. That kind of risk-taking helped FTX become wildly successful in a short amount of time, until it all caught up to him,” Wang said.  The aftermath  The consequences of the FTX collapse were as big as its success used to be – or even bigger. It definitely frustrated the regulators, who had been talking to SBF and, like almost everyone else, assumed FTX was a well-run, responsible business. As lobbyist Kristin Smith said on stage at this year’s Consensus Festival, after the failure of FTX, decision-makers in D.C. ""realized they couldn’t tell a good guy from a bad guy.""  Some people connected the FTX collapse to the recent wave of de-banking in crypto, when the financial institutions the industry relied on – Signature Bank, Silicone Value Bank and Silvergate bank – were shut down by the regulators, leaving crypto clients scrambling for alternatives.  The chain of shutdowns, dubbed “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” was the Securities and Exchange Commission's “chemotherapy for a $14 billion ‘Ponzi cancer’,” which hurt even the healthy parts of the system, said another Consensus speaker, founder and CEO of BCB Group Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie.  Also in this series: 2016 - How The DAO Hack Changed Ethereum and Crypto  FTX made people pay attention to crypto even if they had no intention to before. Its failure made them question the merits of this industry before they learned anything good about it. But the context of this story is also important.  Wang believes the FTX story was CoinDesk’s true time to shine because over the years, the newsroom accumulated all the unique expertise needed to assess the situation when stakes got that high.To any mainstream reporter, Alameda’s balance sheet might not have told anything, because few people actually know what FTT, SRM, MAPS, OXY and FIDA were – and why having these non-liquid tokens dominating your balance sheet might be a bad idea.  “It was CoinDesk [that broke the story] because we knew what to do with the balance sheet,” she said.  And we also knew that FTX was not the first giant to fail in crypto and won’t be the last – just take a look at other stories in CoinDesk’s 10th anniversary series. And the death of companies doesn’t mean the demise of the underlying technology and its revolutionary value to the world.  But crypto skeptics have been proven right this time for a reason. How many crypto companies might actually operate on the same flimsy terms as FTX and Alameda did and would fall apart immediately if someone exposed their doings the way CoinDesk did?  Allison laughs, and says: “Don’t ask!”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/01/coindesk-turns-10-2022-how-crypto-gods-turn-into-monsters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff906d47ed0f6e4b0d240bc77bcb3abc3a0d20a6-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Avalanche's achievement not only solidifies its position as a major player in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape but also signifies the growing popularity and adoption of its innovative blockchain technology. Avalanche's Meteoric Rise Since its arrival on the scene, Avalanche has revolutionised the blockchain industry by addressing the scalability and speed limitations that have plagued other platforms. With a strong emphasis on decentralisation, scaling, and incredibly fast finality, Avalanche has managed to capture the attention of users and developers alike. Scalability One of the primary factors propelling Avalanche's success is its ability to handle a massive number of transactions per second (TPS). By utilising a unique consensus protocol called Avalanche Consensus, the platform achieves impressive TPS rates, ensuring smooth and efficient operation even during peak network activity. Interoperability Avalanche's interoperability capabilities have played a vital role in its growth. The platform enables seamless communication and asset transfers between different blockchains, unlocking cross-chain liquidity and expanding its potential use cases. This flexibility has garnered significant interest from developers and users looking for a comprehensive blockchain solution. User-Friendly Avalanche has prioritised user experience, making it accessible and intuitive for both crypto veterans and newcomers. The platform's user-friendly interfaces, robust development tools, and extensive documentation have lowered entry barriers, attracting a diverse user base and driving widespread adoption. However, a big issue still to be solved is the high cost of becoming a validator. Until this cost is lowered dramatically, smaller projects are being priced out. The Path Ahead With Avalanche crossing the one million MAU milestone, the platform's trajectory looks promising. Avalanche continues to foster innovation through ongoing partnerships, collaborations, and development initiatives. If the platform can resolve its issues of high costs if will climb to the next million users in a far shorter time scale. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

13084916,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536081,1685638813,"The $24,000 BTC Bullseye: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Summer Swoon?","Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a rollercoaster ride for weeks. However, the largest cryptocurrency in the market seems poised to breach the $30,000 mark again if it continues its bullish momentum. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency experts are eyeing a key technical price level that could signal further volatility for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. According to crypto expert and Economist Mr. Ben Lilly, the $24,000 price level is acting like a bullseye for Bitcoin, signaling a potential price dip in the coming months. Lilly’s analysis is based on Bitcoin’s 200-day moving average (200d MA), which he believes is a key technical indicator of the cryptocurrency’s price cycles. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Frenzy: More Than 15 Billion Tokens Scorched In May Bitcoin Braces For Volatility Each halving cycle for Bitcoin, which occurs roughly every four years, begins with the 200d moving average (MA) failing, as shown in a chart shared by Lilly. This failure tends to dictate multi-year price cycles, and Lilly believes history repeats itself. Based on this theory, Lilly predicts that the failure of the 200d MA level could happen sometime between June and August of 2023, which could result in a dip below $24,000. This prediction is supported by the fact that low-leveraged liquidity pools are building at the level where the 200d MA will likely be in June, which Lilly has marked with a bullseye in his theoretical analysis. If the history of Bitcoin’s price cycles is any guide, then this retest is likely to fail, which could result in further volatility for the cryptocurrency. Lilly expects this failure to occur with end-of-June options, citing the recent unwind of May contracts as a subtle sweep lower. However, it’s important to note that the 200d MA is rising faster than before, as each passing day removes one day from the November lows and replaces it with a recent price. This acceleration can be seen in the last week on the 200d MA, which is ticking up faster. Still On The Path To Higher Prices? On the other hand, despite recent volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, one expert remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Jackis believes that the current market conditions indicate a long re-accumulation period before Bitcoin moves higher. According to Jackis, Bitcoin is still making higher lows and is above all critical moving averages, which is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency’s long-term growth. While there may be short-term downside movements, Jackis believes these are simply shakeouts and that the big picture remains bullish. Jackis sees a big move coming in the future, which he has mentioned in previous posts. His bet remains on the upside, and he now sees no clear signs of bearishness in the market. One key factor that Jackis points to is the monthly close, which recently occurred with a sweep. This provides the biggest market picture; for now, Jackis does not see any bearish signs.

Voters unanimously favored to decrease the debt ceiling for USDP to zero from $500 million, according to a vote concluded Thursday.  The decision has a significant impact on embattled stablecoin issuer Paxos, as Maker’s treasury holds roughly half of USDP’s $1 billion supply. This comes after New York state regulators forced the company in February to halt minting Binance USD (BUSD), another Paxos-helmed stablecoin. The market capitalization of BUSD has cratered to $5 billion from $16 billion since then, according to CoinGecko data.  MakerDAO, issuer of the $5 billion DAI stablecoin and one of the largest lending protocols in DeFi, is aiming to boost its revenues by investing its vast reserves in yield-generating strategies.  Gemini, issuer of the GUSD stablecoin, pays an incentive to MakerDAO for holding its stablecoin, while MakerDAO will soon earn a 2.6% yield on as much as $500 million of USDC from Coinbase Prime. The protocol also increasingly invests in real-world assets (RWA) such as tokenized short-term U.S. Treasury bonds via investment management firms.  The proposal for booting USDP argued that holding the stablecoin does not accrue revenues for MakerDAO, hurting its capital efficiency as the protocol prepares to hike rewards rate for its own stablecoin, DAI.  “While Paxos has raised the possibility of a marketing fee scheme, to date there has not been concrete progress towards implementing this,” per the proposal. “If marketing payments are eventually implemented, Maker would be able to increase USDP debt ceilings in response.”",NEGATIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MKR | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/01/makerdao-votes-to-ditch-500m-in-paxos-dollar-stablecoin-from-reserve-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18ef337a31bd946b429e310d0344f3ee8dfabdd1-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm previously locked the coins in the escrow system to ensure the XRP ecosystem and market stability. Ripple’s Monthly Unlock Of 1 Billion XRP Tokens According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Whale Alert, Ripple Labs unlocked 1 billion XRP tokens on June 1, corresponding with its unlocking schedule. Whale Alert captured the three transactions that completed Ripple’s token unlock plans. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wealth Is Transferring From Old To New Hands, Why This Is Positive Firstly, Ripple unlocked 300 million XRP tokens worth over $154.58 million in the current crypto market prices. The second transaction involved the release of 200 million XRP tokens from Ripple’s escrow worth $103.19 million. And in the last transaction, Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP coins from its escrow system worth over $257.99 million. A Brief On Ripple Escrow System Ripple developed the escrow system for locking XRP tokens in 2017. The firm locked 55 billion XRP in a “series of escrows” on the ledger, making up 55% of the token supply. Each escrow contains 1 billion XRP, which the blockchain firm plans to unlock monthly over 55 months. According to XRPL.org, the aim is to provide predictability to the token supply. As such, the ledger mechanics are enforced by consensus to enable the release of 1 billion tokens at the scheduled time. The blockchain company releases the token periodically in a controlled method. This serves as a measure of maintaining stability in the XRP market. The latest unlock of XRP is part of Ripple’s vision of satisfying investors’ demands and supporting the growing XRP ecosystem. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes Hit – Upsides Turn Attractive To Sellers Also, the firm ensures that all unused XRP tokens are moved back to the escrow system, which helps extend the runway for the rest of the tokens to be unlocked. XRP Price Action The latest release of XRP tokens has not impacted the price of XRP in the market. At the time of writing, XRP price trades at $0.5080, indicating a surge of 0.1% over the past 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP saw more than a 15% increase over the past 7 days.

42420317,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0Sz,1685634927,"As Multichain Wobbles, Some Fantom-Based DeFi Projects Flee Bridged Tokens","Takeaways  The chaos at bridge-builder Multichain (MULTI) is stirring concern in the Fantom (FTM) ecosystem despite assurances from the Fantom Foundation.  DeFi protocols are trying to insulate themselves from a potential bridge outage that could devalue or even strand wrapped assets – including USDC, ETH and many others – issued by Multichain.  A handful of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on the Fantom blockchain (FTM) began moving crypto to other networks this week out of fear that Multichain’s (MULTI) mounting bridging crisis could imperil their tokens’ value.  On Wednesday, the decentralized exchange (DEX) Beethoven X sent $300,000 in treasury stablecoins from Fantom to Ethereum; protocol builder Byte Masons did the same with ether (ETH) and USD coin (USDC) it used in trading pools. Earlier this week, DeFi yield farm Beefy sent $200,000 in tokens owned by Binance from Fantom to BSC at the request of the world’s largest exchange.  Disclosed on Discord servers, the actions showcase how Multichain’s faltering infrastructure and AWOL CEO are sending shockwaves through Fantom, the blockchain most heavily dependent on Multichain’s bridges for moving popular cryptocurrencies into and out of its on-chain economy.  For now, the moves appear precautionary: Multichain’s Fantom infrastructure worked fine at press time even as its routes to other, minor chains were failing. Michael Kong, the CEO of the Fantom Foundation, told CoinDesk the “Multichain bridge is fully operational and safe.”  ""Fantom bridge uses router1, which is older and not impacted by ZJ’s absence. ZJ does not have admin control over it,"" Kong said in a telegram message, referring to Multichain's absent leader.  But fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) is spreading fast. “The current FUD surrounding Multichain has severely impacted the entire Fantom ecosystem,” a contributor to the Mummy (MMY) exchange told their Discord community early Thursday, “and Mummy is not exempt from this wave.”  Multichain's vital role at Fantom  The fears stem from Multichain’s importance to Fantom. Nearly 40% of cryptocurrencies on the Fantom network (excluding FTM itself) got there by way of Multichain’s Fantom bridges, according to quant trading firm Thanefield. If anything were to happen to that connection, those wrapped assets could de-peg and in the worst case get stranded.  A CoinDesk review of nine Discord servers for Fantom-based DeFi projects found community members and project leaders are growing increasingly concerned with the state of Multichain – the bridge-builder who can’t maintain its servers because its CEO has disappeared – and how its crisis could batter Fantom.  No one is talking about abandoning Fantom outright. On the contrary, the messages reviewed by CoinDesk showed that even those teams taking the most aggressive measures remain publicly committed to the ecosystem, a major outpost for DeFi traders. They’re looking to Fantom Foundation to broker new partnerships that would solve the current dependency on Multichain.  One surefire way to solve the crisis would be to bring a native form of the USDC stablecoin to Fantom, thereby eliminating the need for wrapped versions whose fates are dependent on the bridges who issue them. But that hasn’t happened yet, leaving Multichain’s bridged stablecoins (80% of stablecoins on Fantom are bridged in via Multichain, according to Thanefield) as the predominant trading pairs in the ecosystem.  Leaving Multichain-linked assets  Some protocols are moving away from Multichain-linked assets even now. The DEX Equalizer (EQUAL) has begun incentivizing traders toward USDC issued by bridge-builder Axelar over that of Multichain, the ecosystem’s predominant stablecoin.  The team building Hector (HEC) has told its community that stablecoin airlifts to other chains are on the table. At decentralized lending protocol Tarot (TAROT), the team said Thursday it is “reevaluating” its risk framework for integrating bridged stablecoins.  A depegging of USDC could spell trouble for derivatives protocols reliant on tokens meant to trade for $1 staying at that level, said GrapeHayz, a pseudonymous member of Equalizer’s Discord.  “I hope you can think about the domino effect if the bridged USDC token is not worth 1 dollar but maybe 60-70 cents,” he said in a Discord message invoking the fallout from Terra Luna’s collapse. “I don’t think we will get there but this is the elephant in the room.”  Beethoven X (BEETS), the decentralized exchange that’s already moved $300,000 in Fantom-based stablecoins to Ethereum, is now scrambling to further insulate itself from a potential breakdown of Multichain’s Fantom bridges. This morning its key contributors submitted an emergency governance proposal that would move $1 million in treasury-owned liquidity to other blockchains.",NEGATIVE,ETH | FTM | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FTM | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/01/as-multichain-wobbles-some-fantom-based-defi-projects-flee-bridged-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63abca00262f630d183540dc8c3ee736119cd7aa-3106x1747.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the most notable altcoins to get a significant level of attention due to the bullish outlook of Google Bard is Shiba Inu, and today, we will explore why it thinks that the crypto has high-growth potential. The presale-stage project Tradecurve has increased by 25% in the past week, and it has its own AI system as well that can change the way investors make decisions when trading. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Google Bard Makes Prediction Surrounding Shiba Inu’s Future Value Google Bard was consulted to get the price predictions for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, as users on a global scale are using AI to check the future value of their favorite cryptocurrencies. Note that the price predictions that are made by the Google Bard AI might not always be 100% accurate or correct. However, they will provide much-needed insights into the potential future direction a cryptocurrency's value might be headed to. When Shiba Inu was released in 2020, it was dubbed the ""Dogecoin Killer"" and experienced a massive 1,500% increase after it was released. This excessive increase resulted in the crypto community speculating on the different scenarios, and one of them predicted that SHIB could climb to $1. However, according to Google Bard, $1 is highly unlikely at this point. Bard's projection for the future of Shiba Inu is still optimistic, however. As of May 29, 2023, Shiba Inu trades at $0.00000883. Bard predicts that the maximum value for the cryptocurrency in 2023 is at $0.0000259, an increase of 193.32%. Aside from Shiba Inu, one other cryptocurrency caught the attention of crypto traders as well, and that project is Tradecurve. Tradecurve Already Sees an Increase of 25% And Can Spike By 100x At Launch Tradecurve has transitioned from Stage 2 of its presale, where one TCRV token was worth $0.012, to Stage 3, where its price increased by 25%, and now trades at $0.015. Analysts and investors are eyeing the Tradecurve platform as it also implements AI to make trades, users can access hundreds of algorithmic and AI-driven trading systems and create AI-oriented bots to optimize the performance of their portfolio. This hybrid platform requires no KYC, features Proof of Reserves (PoR), and allows anyone to make trades just by depositing crypto and then using it as collateral when trading other cryptocurrencies or any other derivative. According to the Tradecurve whitepaper, the platform will feature high leverage beginning at 500:1, a VIP account service, zero requirements for FIAT payments, exclusive deposit bonuses, a dedicated Trading academy, and negative balance protection. The team estimates that they will make $20 million during the presale and that they can onboard 100,000 new users at launch. TCRV will also get listed on Tier-1 exchanges and on Uniswap, and as a result, Google Bard predicts that TCRV can climb 100x by the end of 2023.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) urged the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) to be more proactive in identifying and sanctioning virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that breached its crypto prohibition in a report, which accused the country of being too lax on terrorist fundraising.  “Qatar has not demonstrated that the competent authorities proactively identify and take enforcement action for potential breaches of this prohibition,” on crypto firms announced by the Qatar Financial Center Regulatory Authority in 2019, said the report, though it cites 2,007 transactions that were rejected and 43 accounts closed for digital asset links.  “No formal sanctions have been applied on a natural or legal person for contravening the prohibition,” even in a case where an unlicensed crypto provider was allegedly found operating in the country, it added.  “There are major inconsistencies between Qatar’s risk profile and the type and extent of terrorist financing activity prosecuted and convicted,” added FATF, a Paris-based global watchdog, which seeks to monitor and mitigate flows of dirty money, including through a controversial “travel rule” requiring the identification of participants in crypto transactions.  Though less crypto-friendly than neighbors such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar's central bank governor has pointed to the potential benefits of faster payments, and has said the bank was exploring a digital riyal.  In a statement posted on its website, the central bank said the assessment – which found the country was compliant or largely compliant with each of forty technical requirements – “demonstrate the country’s commitment to combatting illicit financing.”  “The State of Qatar continues to improve and continuously strengthen its combatting system based on international standards,” the statement added.

Earlier this month, Changpeng Zhao-led Binance said it will exit Canada given the country's new guidance on stablecoins and investor limits provided to crypto trading platforms. It disclosed Wednesday that the Ontario Securities Commission sent an order to the platform just two days before the announced departure to probe whether it tried to circumvent the country's regulations and compliance controls. As such, Kraken has been reaping the benefits of staying in Canada given a 25% jump in customer deposits in the country following Binance's exit, a Kraken representative told CoinDesk in an emailed statement . The company has been in Canada for more than 10 years. Canada's increased scrutiny of the crypto space also prompted fellow crypto exchanges Blockchain.com and Bybit to pull out of the country . But Kraken isn't alone in willing to abide by the stricter rules.

The intention of such burns is to reduce the total supply of the coin from market Blaze Token is the top SHIB burner of the month, with MARSWAP (MSWAP) and Coinbase 10 among the top burners. According to Shibburn, 15.36 billion SHIB, were burnt in 191 transactions in May 2023. Top SHIB Burners Blaze Token emerged as the top SHIB burner for May 2023, with its largest burn executed on May 29, seeing over 3.60 billion SHIB tokens sent to the dead wallet. Also, Blaze token burnt 2 billion SHIB on May 2, 1.69 billion SHIB on May 8, and 1.23 billion SHIB on May 22. Related Reading: Did The US SEC Just Endorse Ethereum After This Settlement? A new crypto project, MARSWAP, ranks second on the top SHIB burners list. The crypto project launched on ShibSwap DEX burnt 1.35 billion SHIB in 100 transactions on May 24. Additionally, a Coinbase-affiliated wallet tagged Coinbase 10 contributed 200.58 million SHIB burns to the total burns on the network. However, the increased burn rate did not affect Shiba Inu’s price as it still displays volatility. SHIB Price Prediction SHIB is trading in a downtrend today, forming a fourth consecutive red candle on the daily chart as it forms lower lows. It is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Block Size Surges To 1-Month High – What This Means For ETH Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 35.64, close to the oversold region of 30. This also confirms the bearish sentiment as the indicator moves downwards. SHIB’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line but shows a negative value, and the histogram bars are fading, hinting at a bearish trend. These indicators imply that SHIB will likely continue in the bearish phase till the bulls rally again. SHIB is approaching the 38.2% Fibonacci level ($0.00000839), its closest support level. Hopefully, if SHIB doesn’t fall below that support level, it can rally to the 23.6% Fib level ($0.00000869), its nearest resistance level. A move above the $0.00000869 resistance level will mean a price recovery for SHIB. Shiba Inu Reclaims Security Rating, A Plus For Its Network Shiba Inu reclaimed the top security rating on blockchain security audit company CertiK’s list. Previously, the company reduced Shiba Inu’s rating from AAA to AA, a second-class rating. Shiba Inu reclaimed the top security (AAA rating of 94 out of 100), which was its former security level. Also, CertiK hosted an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session on Twitter spaces to respond to questions from the community. The focus of the discussion bordered on the upcoming Shibarium mainnet, security ratings, and network tokenomics.

13082541,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536043,1685627116,"XRP Hype Spikes As Price Surges 12%, Is This A Top Signal?","Data shows the hype around XRP has spiked as the asset has registered a 12% gain during the past week, something that may lead to a top. XRP Social Dominance Has Surged To High Values Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, crowd optimism around XRP has shot up recently. A relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which measures the total number of unique social media text documents that are currently making mentions of a given coin or topic. These “social media text documents” refer to text-based posts or threads sourced from various popular social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Telegram. Since this metric only measures the unique number of such documents, it means that even if a post mentions the cryptocurrency in question several times, its share of the social volume still only remains one unit. Because of this restriction, the indicator can provide a reliable picture of whether the users in the wider social media platforms are discussing the asset or not right now. Another indicator, called “social dominance,” is also of interest here; this metric compares the social media of the cryptocurrency (which would be XRP in the current case), to that of the combined social volume of the top 100 assets by market cap in the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP social volume, as well as the social dominance, over the last year: The two metrics seem to have observed some pretty high values in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, both the XRP social volume and the social dominance have spiked to high levels recently. At the peak of this surge, the latter indicator had hit a value of 16.2%, which means that 16.2% of all discussions on social media websites related to the top 100 assets were about the token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wealth Is Transferring From Old To New Hands, Why This Is Positive These elevations in the social metrics of the cryptocurrency have come as the price has outperformed all the largest coins in the market after registering a gain of more than 12% during the past week. Generally, whenever the social volume rises along with a price rise, it means that the investors are becoming more optimistic about the near-term outcome of the asset. While such positive attention can sometimes help fuel the price rise further, it’s also true that too much of it can actually have the opposite effect on the cryptocurrency. Historically, digital asset markets have tended to move against the expectations of the opinion of the crowd, so a large amount of hype and euphoria can offer the perfect recipe for the formation of a top to take place. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes Hit – Upsides Turn Attractive To Sellers The latest spike in the social dominance of XRP doesn’t necessarily have to be bearish, but it’s still something that can increase the probability of a top taking place. Though, there has also been a bullish sign for the asset recently, as the number of active addresses has rapidly increased. Such a trend is usually a sign that a large number of users are participating in the blockchain, which is something that can help the price rise to be more sustainable. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.5047, up 12% in the last week.

The announcement comes shortly after Hong Kong announced the introduction of a new regulatory framework for digital assets in its jurisdiction. The First Digital USD The new stablecoin christened the “First Digital USD” or FDUSD, is intended to be backed on a 1:1 basis with the USD or an asset of equivalent fair value. First Digital also added that the reserves backing the stablecoin would be held in segregated accounts at different institutions in Asia. This is to prevent the co-mingling of assets. The FDUSD stablecoin will be backed by “high-quality reserves” and issued by the First Digital Trust, a trust company registered under Hong Kong’s Trust ordinance. The stablecoin has been issued on BNB and Ethereum, with the company in discussions with major exchanges for a listing. First Digital, in its statement, added, “First Digital Labs will work closely with local and overseas regulatory authorities to ensure full compliance with current and future applicable laws and regulations, and First Digital Labs will participate in the shaping of their evolution, including the shaping of any regulatory regimes that FDUSD and/or First Digital may fall under in the foreseeable future. Stablecoins provide increased stability, a form of remittance, a hedge against central bank policymakers who seek to influence their domestic currencies.” The CEO of First Digital, Vincent Chok, stated that the launch represented a major stride forward in providing an efficient and secure digital currency integrated into transactions. “The launch of this stablecoin represents a major stride forward in our mission to provide a secure and efficient digital currency that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday transactions.” Hong Kong Enacts Guidelines The announcement comes at a time when Hong Kong’s “Guidelines for Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators” that are becoming effective on the 1st of June 2023. The new rules define clear standards for the safe custody of assets, avoidance of conflict of interest, segregation of client assets, and cybersecurity standards that are expected from licensed trading platforms. “Providing clear regulatory expectations is the key to fostering responsible development. Hong Kong’s comprehensive virtual assets regulatory framework follows the principle of ‘same business, same risks, same rules’ and aims to provide robust investor protection and manage key risks. This will enable the industry to develop sustainably and support innovation.” The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will also provide additional guidance on the new regulatory requirements and other implementation details, such as license application procedures and information about transitional arrangements. Regulators in Hong Kong have stated that stablecoins should not be allowed for trading by investors until the proposed rules for the asset class are implemented in its jurisdiction. Regulatory Uncertainty In The US Continues Meanwhile, regulatory uncertainty in the United States is continuing and has pushed major players to warn regulators that it could lose its position as a leader in the sector. The warning comes as many firms in the country are weighing their options and looking to shift to friendlier jurisdictions. According to Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, with the regulatory uncertainty in the US, it was not surprising that Hong Kong was positioning itself as a crypto hub.

The machines will add 1.76 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power, or hashrate, to CleanSpark's operations, bringing them closer to their target of 16 EH/s for the end of 2023. As of the end of April, the firm's hashrate stood at 6.7 EH/s.  The first 6,000 Bitmain Antminer S19 XP machines will be shipped by the manufacturer in June, and the remainder in August, the press release said.  CleanSpark has been buying assets from distressed miners during the crypto bear market that has seen a number major mining firms declare bankruptcy or otherwise restructure. In April, for instance, the miner purchased 45,000 Antminer S19 XPs – enough to double its hashrate – and in February, it acquired 20,000 rigs at a 25% discount.  The machines were bought at a price of $23 per terahash (TH) versus a market rate of $23.27/TH for models with efficiency under 25 J/TH on May 31, according to mining services firm Luxor Technologies. The S19 XPs purchased by CleanSpark, however, have an efficiency of 21.5 J/TH, making the market price likely higher than what Luxor is quoting. Compass Mining lists a price of $37/TH for the model.

13081320,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536049,1685622129,"Ethereum Fees Plunge 69% From Yearly High, What This Means For ETH","In a significant development for the Ethereum network, average transaction fees have witnessed a sharp decline. This plunge comes shortly after the Ethereum network recorded a significant spike in fees in May driving it to a yearly high. According to the latest data from the popular market intelligence platform Santiment, Ethereum fees have now settled somewhere below $5 from the yearly high of above $10 per ETH transaction in early May. It is worth noting that this latest update marks a positive shift for Ethereum users and the broader ecosystem. The Return To Normalcy: Ethereum Fees Reclaim Stability On the last day of May, Santiment data revealed Ethereum fees have dropped by roughly 69% from their yearly high of $14 per ETH transaction in early May. The data shows ETH fees have now settled at $4.28 per transaction in the past hours. Related Reading: Did The US SEC Just Endorse Ethereum After This Settlement? Notably, the surge in Ethereum fees during the meme coin frenzy, fueled by the popularity of the frog-themed meme coin Pepe (PEPE) token, had initially led to inflated transaction costs for Ethereum users. However, recent data highlights a welcome reversal of this trend, with fees plummeting back to more reasonable levels. The 69% decrease in transaction fees over a mere 25-day period signals a positive outlook for Ethereum’s network adoption and user engagement. According to the Santiment team, the decline in fees is a promising sign that Ethereum is becoming more affordable for users, consequently encouraging greater utility and activity within the network. Lower transaction costs not only attract new users but also incentivize existing participants to make full use of Ethereum’s capabilities. As fees normalize, it paves the way for enhanced accessibility, making Ethereum a more considerable platform for various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Self-Custody Trend And ETH Supply Another noteworthy trend accompanying the fee reduction is the declining percentage of Ethereum supply held on crypto exchanges. Recent data also from Santiment reveals that the Ethereum supply on exchanges has reached an all-time low of 10.31%. This decrease is a result of the growing preference for self-custody solutions among Ethereum holders due to security concerns related to centralized exchanges. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties surrounding the classification of ETH as a security or commodity have contributed to this shift. For context, Self-custody refers to the practice of holding one’s assets in secure wallets and personal accounts rather than relying on third-party exchanges. The increased self-custody of ETH indicates a rising level of confidence among holders and a desire to retain control over their digital assets. This development aligns with the ethos of decentralization and further strengthens Ethereum’s position as a trusted and secure platform for value transfer and smart contracts.

These developments not only foster confidence among existing users but also attract new participants to join the Ethereum ecosystem. Meanwhile, ETH hasn’t shown any noteworthy spike in the past weeks aside from a 4.3% increase over the past 7 days. The second crypto asset by market capitalization has surged nearly 5% in the past week. And over the past 24 hours, ETH has seen a 0.4% loss in value. At the time of writing, Ethereum currently trades at $1,860 as its trading volume has also plummeted from nearly $8 billion last Thursday to $6.4 billion in the past 24 hours.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin and the broad cryptocurrency market sold off for the second consecutive day on Thursday with fears over inflation and continued rate hikes resurfacing. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the debt ceiling deal Wednesday night and the bill now moves to the Senate for its approval. Bitcoin was down 1% on the day to $26,800 and has lost more than 6% over the past month. While new eurozone data showed that inflation fell more than expected to 6.1% in May from 7% in April, European Central Bank President, Christine Lagarde signaled that additional interest rate rises are needed. “We need to continue our hiking cycle until we are sufficiently confident that inflation is on track to return to our target in a timely manner,” she said in a speech on Thursday.  Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is reaping the benefits of staying in Canada after rivals such as Binance and OKX set withdrawal plans. Kraken told CoinDesk its customer deposits in the country grew by 25% in the weeks following Binance’s announced departure in early May, and the exchange saw a fivefold increase in downloads of its two mobile apps for Canadian clients within a week of OKX saying in March it planned to leave. Canada tightened its regulatory framework for digital asset trading earlier this year, resulting in an exodus of some of the largest crypto exchanges. Alongside Binance – the globe’s largest exchange by volume traded – and OKX, Paxos, Blockchain.com and Deribit also all announced their departures. The most recent exit announcement was from Bybit earlier this week.  Bankruptcy claims exchange OPNX – founded in part by the principals of failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) – has issued a new governance coin dubbed ""Open Exchange token"" (OX), which is designed to reduce trading fees on the platform. The exchange's existing native token, FLEX, surged by 16% after it was revealed in the whitepaper that FLEX can be converted for OX at a ratio of 1:100. OX is an ERC-20 token with a maximum supply of 9.86 billion. At press time, around 100 people have either minted or bought the asset, according to Etherscan. The OPNX exchange was co-founded by 3AC’s Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, along with executives from failed crypto lender CoinFLEX.

The dLIMIT platform is built atop Orbs’ unique Layer 3 infrastructure, which provides a separate decentralized execution layer between existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions and the application layer. The new dLIMIT platform joins a chain of new products launched on Orbs to enhance decentralization, privacy, and security. Additionally, the platform will guarantee users an optimal and reliable execution layer for limit orders on decentralized exchanges. ""The Orbs dLIMIT smart contract offers DEX users an unprecedented ability to execute limit orders at optimal prices with fair fees,"" says Ran Hammer, Vice President of Business Development for Orbs. Notwithstanding, the novel technology also provides a user interface template, “designed for seamless integration and customization by any DEX” building an intuitive, user-friendly and informative trading experience, Hammer added. dLIMIT platform joins novel technologies built on Orbs infrastructure including the decentralized time-weighted average price platform (dTWAP) that provides a decentralized algorithmic TWAP order tool for DEXs. The latest innovation is built on Orbs’ dTWAP protocol and leverages the latter’s price oracles, which have previously been used on several top DEXs such as Quickswap and Spookyswap. ""dLIMIT, backed by Orbs' robust network infrastructure and smart contract, offers DEXs an optimal limit order solution that ensures decentralization, redundancy, reliability, and user protection,"" a spokesperson from the Orbs’ team adds. Orbs launched in 2017 intending to offer users a public, open, decentralized blockchain infrastructure powered by a network of permissionless validators (Guardians) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs L3 infrastructure is the backbone of the dLIMIT solution. It allows developers to design applications that extend the capabilities of their smart contracts without relying on traditional centralized server solutions. Additionally, the Guardians on Orbs will validate and approve transactions on dLIMIT. Simply, the Guardians run a tailored function utilizing ORBS-Lambda that acts as the single honest bidder, or ""taker"", required for the dLIMIT protocol to run optimally. To enhance decentralization, the validators will monitor and validate the transactions on the dLIMIT smart contract and submit an honest bid when an order is open for bids. This will enable traders and users to get minimal transaction and gas fees while the platform finds the DEXs with the best prices. This provides assurance that the limit order set will track spot market prices as closely as possible when being executed. Lastly, the statement confirms that the latest innovation from Orbs is gaining “significant interest” from leading DEXs with multiple integrations in progress Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A mainstream media narrative Mainstream media generally appears to back the narrative that crypto has no intrinsic value, and that it will go to zero much sooner than later. This is the narrative put out by governments, bank leaders, and global traditional financial agencies. Everyone has their view of crypto, and both sides of the argument have prominent economists and financial experts with widely differing opinions. However, what is not in doubt is that the large mainstream media outlets are gunning for crypto, often with little fundamental sense behind their articles. For example, an article published today by a Reuters columnist expounds the view that the current “AI craze” leaves crypto for dead, and states how AI is gathering momentum while crypto is gathering dust. No one can deny that artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the biggest technological breakthrough that the human race has ever seen. The potential for this technology is as breathtaking as it is alarming. Crypto and AI complement each other However, comparing it with crypto is quite ridiculous. It’s like comparing apples and oranges. Both have their place, and the two of them complement each other, as can be seen with crypto projects such as Render, Ocean, SingularityNET, and others that are harnessing the power of AI. Crypto is either extremely misunderstood, or there are malicious actors involved in trying to drive this anti-crypto narrative out to the masses. Of course, in calling a spade a spade, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies will probably eventually fail and go to zero, but some of these projects are revolutionary, and this space is coming up with financial innovations such as DeFi, NFTs, payments, and many other uses that can change our world for the better. Bitcoin is an exit from debasing fiat currencies Bitcoin is the preeminent cryptocurrency, and it serves as a hard money exit out of the failing fiat-based monetary system. Artificial intelligence with properly defined boundaries can complement this people’s money and be used to make life easier for all. Just throwing mud at a technology is never a good idea. Balanced arguments are always needed. Crypto is a technology that seems to threaten governments, banks, and central planners in general. Being able to have total control has become the raison d’être of governments instead of being a servant of the people. Crypto challenges this misuse of power, and it is to be hoped that AI will not be used to strengthen governmental oppression of freedoms.

13079938,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/eu-officially-enacts-new-crypto-regulations,1685616300,EU Officially Enacts New Crypto Regulations,"The European Union (EU) has formally signed new legislation on crypto licensing and money laundering rules into law. MiCA Signed Into Law After months of discussions and negotiations, on May 31, 2023, the EU formally signed the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) into law. The legislation introduces a comprehensive framework for licensing and regulating cryptocurrency businesses operating within the EU member states. The goal is to establish clear guidelines for crypto-related activities and strengthen the integrity of the digital asset ecosystem. It marks the beginning of a new era of crypto regulation and is expected to enhance consumer protection, prevent money laundering, and foster a more transparent and secure crypto market. These developments signal a notable shift in the EU's stance towards digital currencies. AML Laws Also Enforced The European Parliament President, Roberta Metsola, and Swedish Rural Affairs Minister, Peter Kullgren, signed the MiCA law into action. They also formally enacted another law on anti-money laundering (AML), which mandates cryptocurrency providers to authenticate their customers' identities when conducting fund transfers. The Swedish government, currently holding the EU presidency and overseeing legislative discussions, made the announcement on Twitter. A spokesperson from the parliament verified that the laws mentioned encompass MiCA, the transfer of funds regulations, and two additional regulations unrelated to trade with Ukraine. EU Regulating Exchanges And Wallets Crypto exchanges and wallet providers looking to operate across the 27-nation bloc will be able to do so with a license issued under MiCA, which will likely be truly enforced in June after being published in the official EU journal. The MiCA rules also mandate that stablecoin issuers must hold appropriate reserves. Proposed by the European Commission in 2020, MiCA sparked controversy due to lawmakers considering environmentally focused provisions that could have effectively banned Bitcoin's proof-of-work technology. While the industry largely welcomed these provisions, there is now a growing focus on the next phase of EU crypto regulation. Future laws may include other elements of the industry, like staking, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized finance. Critics Question “Excessive Regulation” The EU's move to regulate cryptocurrencies reflects a growing recognition of the importance of digital assets and their potential impact on the global financial system. Other regulatory bodies like the SEC have already applauded MiCA. However, critics argue that excessive regulations could stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses away from the EU. In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential burden of compliance costs and the impact on smaller crypto startups. Striking the right balance between regulation and innovation will be crucial in order to support the growth of the digital asset industry while addressing legitimate concerns regarding money laundering and consumer protection.

42420310,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0Ll,1685615759,"Treat Crypto as Securities by Default, European Parliament Study Says","Crypto assets should be treated as securities by default, and the autonomous organizations that govern decentralized finance (DeFi) should be granted legal status, according to a study commissioned by lawmakers at the European Parliament that was published Tuesday.  The report comes as the European Union finalizes its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, and considers whether a sequel will be needed to cover extra areas like DeFi, staking and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  All crypto assets should be deemed a transferable security – implying they would fall under the EU’s tough governance and authorization rules that apply to traditional stocks and bonds – unless and until a national regulator says otherwise, the report says.  That default rule “shifts the onus of gathering the technical facts and arguing the scope of regulation” from regulators to industry, said the report, drafted by a panel of academics from universities in Luxembourg, Sydney and Hong Kong, on request from the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.  Without changes, “we are skeptical that MiCA will have positive short-term effects given the difficulties of enforcing its rules in an opaque cross-border context,” in which 10,000 crypto protocols vie for the lightest possible regulation, added the document, though its findings aren't a formal position of the European Parliament.  The crypto industry has been plagued by a lack of clarity on whether rules designed for traditional financial securities apply to digital assets. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission's Chief Gary Gensler has declined to say whether major cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH) constitute securities under his jurisdiction, but a series of legal actions against companies such as Ripple have led to accusations of regulation by enforcement.  With MiCA signed into law on Wednesday, EU agencies responsible for banking and securities markets must now set out the detailed rulemaking to put it into effect. Even before then, the European Systemic Risk Board, an EU panel responsible for monitoring financial stability risks, has called for further laws to fill in what MiCA leaves out.  U.K. experts have also been studying the legal status of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a potential precursor to regulation of a sector which the report says is a “Wild West” of “fraudsters and thieves.”  Read more: EU Formally Signs New Crypto Licensing, Money Laundering Rules Into Law",NEUTRAL,ETH,ASIA | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/01/treat-crypto-as-securities-by-default-european-parliament-study-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4ebe49e67cc83c1192b0be9e714cae879276a59-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With its latest monthly candle, Shiba Inu has recorded its most dismal performance since November, igniting a wave of speculation and raising important questions about the future of this meme coin. As the cryptocurrency market closely watches this unprecedented downturn, the fate of Shiba Inu hangs in the balance, leaving investors and meme enthusiasts pondering what lies ahead for this intriguing coin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: What’s Stifling The Meme Coin From Entering A Bullish Market Phase? SHIB’s Value Plummets, Casting Doubt On Its Future The value of SHIB has witnessed a substantial decline, exceeding 16% since the beginning of May, thereby enveloping its future in a bleak haze. Should the ongoing trend persist, May has the potential to emerge as the most disastrous month for SHIB since November 2022. During that period, SHIB experienced a staggering 25% drop following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Source: Coingecko According to data from CoinGecko, the current price of SHIB is resting at $0.00000849. Although it faced a marginal 0.9% dip over the past 24 hours, it still managed to achieve a very minimal gain of 0.1% over the course of seven days. SHIB market cap still pegged at $5.06 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Amidst the uncertainty surrounding SHIB’s trajectory, two significant factors come into play. First, the weakness exhibited by altcoins during the spring season adds to the apprehension. Second, the price action bears an uncanny resemblance to a technical rebound from the fall experienced in 2022. These factors combined amplify the likelihood of an ongoing downward spiral for SHIB, albeit the extent of the decline remains uncertain. SHIB Perpetual Futures Listed On Kraken Pro, Boosting Exposure In a much-needed glimmer of positivity, SHIB enthusiasts can heave a sigh of relief as SHIB perpetual futures have been officially listed on Kraken Pro, the advanced cryptocurrency trading platform offered by Kraken. Just in: Kraken has added a new perpetual for $SHIB 🔥🔥 — $SHIB BPP (@ShibBPP) May 30, 2023 Perpetual futures contracts serve as derivative financial instruments that grant traders the opportunity to speculate on the price fluctuations of various assets, all without actually owning them.

As the SHIB community grapples with concerns surrounding its price decline, the listing of SHIB perpetual futures on Kraken Pro opens doors to new trading opportunities and expands the reach of this meme-inspired digital asset.

Jimbos Protocol was hacked on the 28th of May and saw 4000 ETH (roughly $7.5 million) stolen via a flash loan exploit. The team behind the protocol also noted that the Department of Homeland Security had arrested several other exploiters in the past and that it believed they would be able to arrest the protocol’s hacker as well. According to reports, the Department of Homeland Security has worked on several crypto cases, such as 2013’s Mt. Gox seizures and the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attacks. The Jimbos Protocol team took to Twitter to address the hacker, stating, “They’re behind finding and arresting many of these exploiters. We don’t think this case will be an exception to the rule. To the attacker: We warned you. We’d prefer to give you the bounty so we can focus on our protocol. Instead, we will deal with law enforcement to find you.” The protocol also revealed that the hacker ignored the bounty offer, stating, ” We’ve spoken about our bounty before, 10% of stolen funds (~$800k USD). We’ve given the hacker time to comply for the bounty, but evidently, they’re not interested.” Bounty Offered To General Public The Jimbos Protocol has now offered the bounty to the general public instead. This means any user or community member that provides any information that could lead to the hacker’s arrest or recovery of funds would receive the reward. The protocol team had previously stated that they had found several promising leads regarding the hacker but did not wish to harm anyone’s reputation by making assertions before verifying all the facts. “In order to speed up the investigation and return of funds, we’re offering the 10% bounty (~$800K USD) to the general public. Anyone who provides information that leads to: 1) catching the exploiter, or 2) all funds being returned, is eligible for the reward.” However, the protocol also left the door open for the hacker to return the funds, stating that they were willing to give the hacker the opportunity to return the funds right until they are arrested, at which point the offer will no longer be on the table. “The door remains open for the hacker to return the funds until they are arrested, at which point the offer will be rescinded. Because then, we will be getting 100% of the funds back, and they will go to prison.” The Jimbos Protocol also added that it would soon publish an analysis of the hack. It also revealed that it would be publishing a plan for a future version of the protocol, which would include a recovery plan for users impacted by the attack.

42420309,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0Kj,1685607297,Crypto Exchange Kraken’s Canada Customer Deposits Rose 25% After Binance Announced Departure,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is reaping the benefits of staying in Canada after rivals such as Binance and OKX said they plan to withdraw.  Kraken’s customer deposits in the country grew by 25% in the weeks following Binance’s announced departure in early May, and it saw a fivefold increase in downloads of its two mobile apps for Canadian clients within a week of OKX saying it planned to leave back in March. A Kraken representative shared the data with CoinDesk via email.  Canada tightened its regulatory framework for digital asset trading earlier this year, resulting in an exodus of some of the largest crypto exchanges. As well as Binance, the largest exchange by volume traded, and OKX, crypto firms Paxos, Blockchain.com and Deribit all announced their departures. The most recent leaver was Bybit, earlier this week.  Like Kraken, Nasdaq-listed exchange Coinbase (COIN) said it was happy to commit to Canada’s enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking (PRU). When compared with the lack of clarity in the U.S., Coinbase went as far as saying it loved working with a regulator the firm could engage with.  Kraken has been in Canada for over 10 years, has more than 250 staff there and has been a money services business in the country since 2019, the firm’s managing director for Canada, Mark Greenberg, pointed out.  “I think the Canadian regulatory approach works for us,” Greenberg said in an interview with CoinDesk. “There are things we really liked about it; things we’ve been doing forever, like the focus on security on customer assets, for example. And then there are things we don’t like as much about it, such as some of the limits on trading and margin.”  One of the demanding new provisions for crypto exchanges set out by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) earlier this year, is the requirement that firms hold a large proportion of client assets with a third-party custodian.  “We’ve all committed to using a third-party custodian as part of the commitments we’ve made, and I think we will continue to have that discussion with the regulators,” said Greenberg. “It’s one of those things where there are pros and cons, and I think the regulator is aware of the pros and cons and options around this. At the end of the day, what matters most for us is that our clients’ assets are safe and secure and not open for rug pulls or other types of things.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/01/crypto-exchange-krakens-canada-customer-deposits-rose-25-after-binance-announced-departure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49c97b760995e9971f0c2a28e11a0eb900f8a59a-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, when a prominent trader like DonAlt raises the possibility of the crypto reaching the elusive $1 mark, it piques the interest of investors and enthusiasts alike. The last time XRP saw such heights was back in November 2021, and since then, the digital asset has experienced a rollercoaster ride.

Is $XRP finally going to $1? — DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) May 31, 2023 In recent developments, XRP, the native coin of Ripple, has been displaying promising signs, as evidenced by remarkable spikes in address activity observed over two consecutive days. This surge in address activity indicates a heightened level of interest and engagement with the cryptocurrency. Such an occurrence potentially signifies an upward trend for XRP, suggesting a possible decoupling from the broader altcoin market. Source: Coingecko According to data from CoinGecko, the current price of XRP stands at $0.505016. However, the past 24 hours witnessed a minor setback for the cryptocurrency, as it experienced a slump of 2.1%. BTCUSD falls back into the $26K region. Chart: TradingView.com Despite this temporary dip, XRP has demonstrated resilience and noteworthy performance over the last seven days, recording impressive gains of 12.0%. This positive trend indicates the potential for XRP to rebound and regain its value. Potential Implications For XRP’s Future As SEC Battle Nears Conclusion The long-awaited conclusion of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, the company behind XRP, appears to be just around the corner. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, recently expressed his belief that the lawsuit will reach a resolution in “weeks, not months.” This news has generated significant excitement and anticipation among XRP holders and the broader cryptocurrency community. Related Reading: XRP Flows Strong With 13% Gain, Fueled By Bullish Market Indicators With the lawsuit’s conclusion looming, market observers and investors are eagerly awaiting the outcome and its potential impact on XRP’s price and market dynamics.

Positive Market Sentiment And Investor Confidence The conclusion of the SEC lawsuit could also have broader implications for the market sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, particularly in relation to regulatory clarity. A favorable outcome for Ripple would signal a more positive regulatory environment for digital assets, potentially boosting investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market as a whole.

13076886,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/multichain-ceo-unreachable-as-protocols-problems-continue,1685604300,Multichain CEO Unreachable As Protocol’s Problems Continue,"There seems to be no end to the problems at Multichain, with the team unable to reach the protocol’s CEO and gain the necessary server access for maintenance works. The Multichain team has been trying its level best to keep the protocol running. Where Is The Multichain CEO? Last week, rumors that Chinese authorities had arrested several Multichain executives began doing the rounds. According to the rumors, the arrested executives included Zhaojan, the protocol’s Chief Executive Officer. While the integrity of these reports has not yet been confirmed, and the authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the reports, Binance responded to the news and suspended specific token deposits. Multichain has been facing days of continued outages, with several transactions in limbo due to multiple cross-chain pathways that are offline. Furthermore, it was also rumored that law enforcement officials have taken control of a wallet containing $1.6 billion belonging to Multichain, according to several Twitter accounts. “According to the rumors earlier today in the Chinese community, it is said that the core members of the Multichain team were arrested by Chinese police, and the cold wallet was controlled, involving about $1.5 billion in funds.” Problems Continue According to Multichain’s Twitter account, the problems currently facing the protocol began on Monday, with the team stating that the protocol has been experiencing several issues thanks to unforeseen circumstances. The team stated that despite the team’s best efforts to maintain the protocol and keep it running, they could not reach their CEO to access critical servers and carry out maintenance. “In the past two days, the Multichain protocol has experienced multiple issues due to unforeseeable circumstances. The team has done everything possible to maintain the protocol running, but we are currently unable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance.” According to the team, the latest set of issues was triggered by problems arising from a network of nodes within the Multichain protocol. This was impacting cross-chain services for several blockchains, including PublicMint, Dyno Chain, Keychain, Dexit, Red Light Chain, Ekta, ONUS, HPB, Omax, Planq, and Findora. “This afternoon, there was an issue with the scanning node network of Router5, which has affected the normal cross-chain service of some chains. Furthermore, this problem is beyond the team’s current permissions and ability. In order to protect the interests of our users, we have decided to suspend the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain on the UI. Last week, the same issue happened on Router2.” MULTI Token Relatively Unaffected Over Past 24 Hours The Multichain team has asked partners to stop calling smart contracts running on Multichain until they can get the permissions to access the protocol servers. Despite the gloomy news, the protocol’s MULTI token has fared relatively well, reporting an increase of over 3%. Currently, the token is trading at $4.07. However, the token has lost over 19% of its value since Multichain’s problems began. Multichain was previously known as Anyswap before suffering a major exploit in 2021. However, it made a strong recovery, becoming one of the largest blockchain bridges in the crypto space, with transaction volumes hitting the $100 billion mark. Multichain facilitates the exchange of tokens across several major networks, including Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Avalanche. Head of product at Coinbase, Conor Grogan, tweeted that the problems at Multichain will impact only a small number of users, highlighting the low transaction outputs on the networks. Crypto Twitter is also nervous about rumors that Gate.io is facing liquidity issues, although the company has denied the reports. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin settled above $27.1K after Cleveland's Federal Reserve Bank president spooked investors with hawkish comments and China reported dispiriting manufacturing data.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading near $27,100, down more than 2.2% over the previous 24 hours, after spending much of the previous four days comfortably above $27,500. BTC finished May (UTC) with its first losing month of 2023 after soaring by more than 60% over the first four months.  “Bitcoin encountered selling pressure in response to comments made by a prominent Federal Reserve official, indicating a lack of compelling reasons to pause liquidity tightening measures,” Mikkel Morch, chairman and non-executive director at crypto investment fund ARK36, said. “These remarks have had a disruptive impact on various risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Morch added: “Simultaneously, the release of discouraging manufacturing data from China has added to the bearish sentiment surrounding bitcoin and other risk assets.”  In an interview with the Financial Times published Wednesday, Fed Cleveland bank President Loretta Mester said that she did not see any reason to cease the Fed’s nearly year-long streak of rate increases, although she was open to changing her mind if the current hot employment market, a characteristic of high inflation periods, and prices cool. “We may have to go further,” she told the Times. “At this point, I don’t really necessarily see a compelling reason that we wouldn’t want to take another small step to counter some of that really embedded, stubborn inflationary pressure.”  Crypto markets have struggled in recent weeks amid uncertainty about the U.S. government’s ability to extend the debt limit and meet its financial obligations, and inflationary concerns. House lawmakers finally passed the bill late Wednesday via a bipartisan effort that overcame strong opposition from far-right Republicans. Meanwhile, the anticipated rebound of the Chinese economy slowed at least temporarily as the official manufacturing purchasing managers index declined to 48.8 in May from 49.2 in April, according to the country’s National Bureau of Statistics said  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,875, off 1.4% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of Wednesday in the red with AVAX, the token of the Avalanche base-layer network, and UNI, the native cryptocurrency of the Uniswap decentralized exchange, both recently off more than 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently down over 2.1%.  Equity markets sank with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 both closing down 0.6% as investors recoiled following a strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) report showed openings increasing to 10.1 million instead of an expected 9.3 million in April, and breaking a three-month streak of declines that had offered hope for monetary policy observers hoping for a dovish turn.  In a Telegram message to CoinDesk, Strahinja Savic, head of data & analytics at crypto-focused, institutional capital markets and advisory platform FRNT Financial, noted that stocks and cryptos had fallen together instead of diverging as they have over the past couple of months. “Today crypto dips with risk assets, tomorrow it may not,” Savic wrote. “What we can say is that the technical range has been clearly set between a downside range of $25K to $26K, and a breakout would occur decisively above $31K. Most other activities are likely noise.”  Have bitcoin and ether bottomed out? Dave Weisberger, the CEO of CoinRoutes, which provides algorithmic trading strategies in the crypto space, noted to CoinDesk TV that bitcoin holding is at an all-time high while BTC to be sold on exchanges and volume on exchanges are at low levels.  Weisberger said the trends tell you “that speculators are moving into pricing and moving out but the long-term buyers seem happy to buy in this below $27K range and cushion in any downdraft. So it feels like we’re in the bottom of a trading range.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Stellar XLM +1.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Loopring LRC −5.0% Smart Contract Platform Decentraland MANA −4.5% Entertainment Terra LUNA −4.4% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  A Whale Risk Reduction Strategy Ahead of Debt Deal  By Glenn Williams Jr.  On-chain data shows that large holders of bitcoin reduced their bitcoin holdings in the days leading up to the debt deal. Additional data shows an increase in BTC sent to centralized exchanges. What happens next should be monitored closely as an indication of overall sentiment.  The supply of bitcoin held by addresses with balances exceeding 100K BTC declined from 663,306 to 543,958 on May 22, right ahead of the debt deal. A key question is whether the reduction was tied to short-term fiscal concerns, or longer term questions about BTC prices.  While the number of addresses holding more than 100K BTC is small, the activity of whales can sometimes create cascading effects if they exit their positions en masse. The number of addresses with 1,000 BTC or more sending bitcoin to exchanges has increased as well, showing that smaller whales may also be unloading risk.  What happens next is most important. An increase in bitcoin supply for large holders following the debt deal will signal their renewal of bullish sentiment. A continued decline would imply that they have larger concerns.

42420312,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0Np,1685584800,First Digital Unveils USD Stablecoin as Hong Kong Crypto Rules Kick In,"First Digital Group announced today that it’s launching a USD stablecoin, FDUSD.  The stablecoin is issued on Ethereum and BNB, a spokesperson told CoinDesk, saying that First Digital is in discussions with all major exchanges for a listing.  First Digital says FDUSD is backed by “high-quality reserves” of cash and cash equivalents in regulated financial institutions around Asia, and will be issued by First Digital Trust, a trust company registered under Hong Kong’s Trust Ordinance.  Part of the requirements of Hong Kong’s Trust Ordinance is to keep all reserves in segregated accounts, which prevents co-mingling of assets.  “The launch of this stablecoin represents a major stride forward in our mission to provide a secure and efficient digital currency that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday transactions,” Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, said in a release.  But as the stablecoin launches, it won’t be available to retail users in Hong Kong.  Regulators in Hong Kong have said that stablecoins should not be allowed for public trading by retail investors until the proposed rules for this asset class are officially implemented in the territory.  As CoinDesk reported in February, The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the special administrative region’s central bank, and one of its financial regulators are weighing new regulations for stablecoins, which could mandate local incorporation, require real-world asset backing (disallowing algorithmic stablecoins) and mandating separate operations for issuers and virtual asset exchanges.
