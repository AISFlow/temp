13220984,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=483809,1644969584,Bitcoin Mining Stocks Lose 50-60% Value Since Crypto Price Peak,"Bitcoin mining stocks have drastically collapsed since November following the effect of the hashrate&apos;s 23% growth and bitcoin&apos;s downtrend on the miner&apos;s rewards. Mining Stocks Sharp Decline Arcane Research data shows that the largest bitcoin mining stocks have collapsed since November after being caught up in the market&apos;s volatility. The miner giant Marathon Digital Holdings&apos; (MARA) stock first plummeted on November 9th falling from over $81 to $79, followed by more dramatic drops and little upward movement. MARA is at $28,63 at the time of writing, a 66% drop since November. The other large miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) has gone from its November high of $45,97 to $19,73 at the time of writing, a 55% drop. Meanwhile, Core Scientific (CORZ) plummeted from $14,5 in November to a low of $6,99 mid-January but recovered over 70% of its value in February now trading at $10,54 with a positive response from investors to production and operations updates.

42396012,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Uhn,1644968294,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Soars Past $44K as Ukraine Tensions Lessen,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin and major altcoins rose after Russia said it was receptive to a diplomatic solution to tensions on the Ukraine border.  Technician's take: BTC's price jump occurred on low volume, indicating weak buying strength.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $44,402 +4.0%  Ether (ETH): $3,170 +7.9%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polygon MATIC +9.6% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO +7.0% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +6.9% Computing  Top Losers  ""There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,471 +1.5%  DJIA: 34,988 +1.2%  Nasdaq: 14,139 +2.5%  Gold: $1,853 -0.9%  Market moves  Russia took a baby step back from invading the Ukraine, at least it said it had. So investors were feeling more confident on Tuesday, which was good for stocks and for crypto.  Russia's statement that it had removed some troops from the Ukrainian border and would be receptive to a diplomatic settlement of the conflict it created at least temporarily removed the threat of higher oil prices. The price for crude fell on Tuesday.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading over $44,400, a 4% increase over the previous 24 hours. Ether, the second-biggest crypto by market cap, pushed past $3,150 and was up almost 8% over the same period.  Crypto's advanced dovetailed with the performance of major equity markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 2.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 increased 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively.  Investors remained concerned about an increase in the U.S. producer price index (PPI), which hit 9.8% in January, a continuation of the inflation that has hurt the country's economy and spurred the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish monetary policy. OANDA Americas senior analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email that ""factory-gate inflation remained very hot, prompting expectations for inflation to run hotter a little longer, and supporting the case for the Fed to kickoff their rate hiking cycle with a half-point rate increase.""  Yet, Seth Ginns, managing partner and head of liquid investments at crypto investment firm CoinFund, struck an optimistic note for crypto during a discussion on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show. Ginns noted that the Fed had proceeded cautiously after a stronger-than-expected jobs report earlier this month and that crypto markets on Tuesday ""shrugged off"" the high PPI number. ""Things are not slowing as much as expected, which meant there's no reason to think that the Fed is going to be data dependent at this point,"" Ginn said. ""If they see things slowing, they're going to back off of tightening. If they see things [the PPI] continuing to remain strong, they're going to fight inflation.""  He added : ""We're in a fairly constructive risk-on regime right now.""     Technician's take  Bitcoin Rally Stalls; Support at $40K, Resistance at $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) rose as much as 4% over the past 24 hours after buyers held support at $40,000. The cryptocurrency was trading near $44,000 at press time and appears to be overbought on intraday charts.  Pullbacks could be limited around $40,000 over the short term.  The latest rally occurred on low volume, similar to previous price jumps, indicating weak buying strength. Still, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is not yet overbought, which could keep buyers active on dips.  The RSI on the weekly chart continues to rise from the most oversold level since March 2020, which preceded a strong price rally. Momentum signals are also improving on the weekly chart, which is constructive so long as support above $30,000-$40,000 holds.  On the monthly chart, however, momentum signals remain negative, suggesting limited upside for BTC around $46,000-$50,000.

While every major traditional financial player of note has developed some version of a crypto working group, he said, the “institutional wallet really has not arrived in our sector yet in any meaningful way.”  Don’t confuse lack of activity in coin segments as lack of willingness or sophistication, continued Vanderwilt, who spoke at Canaccord Genuity’s Digital Assets Symposium on Tuesday. When regulatory issues become more settled, knowledgeable institutional investors will be ready to capitalize.  Vanderwilt said his conversations with investors suggest many are seeing the recent plunge in crypto prices as a buying opportunity. He said everything is connected these days, and leveraged hedge funds often need to lessen their exposure to crypto during equity market sell-offs.  Galaxy, he said, estimates the current market cap of all coins in the crypto ecosystem to be just under $3 trillion, excluding areas such as venture investment. Compared with estimates of global wealth of around $450 trillion, that means the total market cap of crypto, excluding venture capital, is only about 40 basis points of total global wealth.

42410919,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGYH,1644961746,Why Are Fees on Ethereum Dropping?,"The recent market downturn has taken a toll on crypto markets, with ether (ETH) off its November high by 36% at the time of writing. Perhaps more notable, however, has been the impact on network activity, such as transaction fees, decentralized finance (DeFi) trading volume and borrow rates across lenders.  Simple ether and ERC-20 wallet transfers are being included in blocks for a fraction of the cost seen during December and January. While this is a more computationally intensive form of transaction compared with wallet transfers, here is a user swapping one asset to another, paying just 0.0064 ETH ($20.04) for the transaction fee. A similar transaction during March of last year cost a different user 0.04 ETH ($125.18), over six times as much as the Feb. 15 transaction.  The comparison is, of course, not apples to apples, with contracts becoming more gas efficient over time and different levels of activity throughout the day, but studying it can demonstrate how far transaction costs have dropped.  How EIP 1559 has affected fees on Ethereum  Since EIP 1559 was activated in early August 2021, every block now has a set base fee that must be paid in ether in order to be included in a block. To prevent volatility in these base fees, they can only be adjusted by 12.5% up or down after each block, depending on whether the previous block was above or below the gas target set by Ethereum core developers.  The base fee paid on every transaction is sent to a burn address, a mechanism that allows the native asset, ether, to practically behave like gas in a car. More importantly, the burn counteracts the inflation caused through block rewards and helps support the longevity of both the Ethereum network and its native asset.  By reducing fee volatility, the network has shielded itself from transaction fees being sent through the roof in a short period of time by non-fungible token (NFT) mints or token launches. However, the same is true in reverse and it may take weeks at a time for transaction fees to fall significantly in longer periods of low activity.  The charts below highlight this muted volatility, but also show falling gas prices month over month and daily transactions trending downward since November of last year. The larger effect on the network is lower fee burning and increasing ether inflation, which has only been seen to this extent two other times since the implementation of EIP 1559.     Falling transaction fees are great for user experience, but maybe a not-so-great signal for the network as a whole. Network activity will always be correlated to crypto asset prices, but an overly strong relationship between the two could signal that the majority of Ethereum applications are focused on asset speculation rather than on real world adoption, through decentralized products like insurance, gaming, payments and more.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Edward Oosterbaan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/15/why-are-fees-on-ethereum-dropping,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7b26cf52801763dc1aa72db9ead417de79de279-2048x1366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A copy of the bill was provided to CoinDesk.  The bill was introduced on Feb. 15 by Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), a member of the Blockchain Caucus, and would ban agencies from “restricting the use of convertible virtual currency by a person to purchase goods or services for the person’s own use, and other purposes.”  The legislation also prevents agencies from prohibiting users from “conducting transactions through a self-hosted wallet.”  Self-hosted or unhosted crypto wallets have been targeted by U.S. regulations over the course of the past year.  In late 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department proposed a controversial rule that would require crypto exchanges to collect personal details, including names and home addresses, from users wanting to transfer their cryptocurrency into a private wallet.  The unhosted crypto wallet rule was driven by then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, since succeeded by Janet Yellen, though she hasn’t killed the possibility of the rule being implemented.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a news conference on Tuesday he is “ready to work further” with the West to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine. Russia also decided to partially pull back troops from military districts bordering Ukraine.  Equities and cryptocurrencies rose, while traditional safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar declined over the past 24 hours.  Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) led the rally on Tuesday, indicating a renewed appetite for risk among crypto traders. ETH was up 8% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% rise in BTC over the same period.  Still, trading volume in the bitcoin spot market remained weak relative to previous price jumps on Feb. 4 and Feb. 10. That could point to limited gains around $46,000-$50,000 BTC according to some technical indicators.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $44172, +4.73%    ●Ether (ETH): $3115, +7.60%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4471, +1.58%    ●Gold: $1855 per troy ounce, −0.67%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.04%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The chart below shows the decline in BTC trading volume over the past few months.  ""Currently, traders look indecisive, shown by the market sentiment hovering between fear and greed and bitcoin ranging between the $42,000 support and the $46,000 resistance,"" Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report. ""If bitcoin breaks out of this range, we might see increased market activity going forward.""  Over the past 24 hours, the volume of sell orders exceeded the volume of buy orders in the BTC perpetual swaps market, according to market data compiled by CryptoQuant. That indicates short-term selling pressure.  Over the past year, ""trading volumes as a percentage of market cap in many of the major cryptocurrencies are lower compared with previous months,"" CoinDesk's Lawrence Lewitinn stated. ""The end result is that it may take smaller amounts of capital to move the markets wildly.""  Bullish sentiment wanes  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index dipped back into ""fear"" territory as traders reacted to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The current reading of 46 is neutral, however, which means there is no strong bullish or bearish bias among market participants.  The Fear & Greed Index can oscillate between extreme lows and highs for many months, similar to the erratic signals during the 2018 crypto bear market. Frequent shifts in sentiment could signal short-term opportunities for buyers and sellers, while those who are more committed to a trading position would rely on smoother indicators such as cycles and trends.  Some technical indicators show long-term trend weakness, which could limit potential upside in BTC.  Still, over the past month, sentiment has improved as the crypto sell-off stabilized.  For tactical traders, one positive blockchain indicator to monitor is the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), which shows when there is enough liquidity available to buy into the market (locked into stablecoins) or, on the other hand, when the buying power is not enough to move up the price relative to BTC's market cap, according to CryptoQuant.  SSR recently triggered a positive signal, similar to what occurred during the July and October price rallies.

42421670,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovNd,1644958851,What Are IPFS and Filecoin and How Can They Be Used for NFTs?,"What do you actually get when you buy an NFT?  You own a unique token on a blockchain that references some off-chain data. The token is non-fungible (unique) and immutable (being on a blockchain). That’s all that an NFT guarantees: You own a unique and unchangeable reference to some data.  Focusing on this core NFT definition, two main challenges arise.  First, an NFT is only as good as the link to its data. This reference is just a line of code, but for an NFT to have value others have to agree it refers to valuable data.  Second, the off-chain data itself has to exist, it has to be stored somewhere and it has to be accessible. There are many instances where NFT links return 404 errors later on – making those NFTs worthless.  InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Filecoin, open-source protocols originally created by my employer, Protocol Labs, provide potential solutions. However, understanding how to correctly leverage these solutions is often what trips users up in practice. There are nuances that need to be accounted for when using them directly or building services on top of them.  We work for Protocol Labs on a product called NFT.Storage and spend a lot of time thinking about how to make sure NFTs are as useful as possible. It’s still early days in the industry, and the NFT space really is the Wild West right now. We want to help educate people on what NFTs are, the challenges of NFTs, the technologies that exist to solve these challenges and how we can drive culture around NFTs to take full advantage of these technologies.  A recent CoinDesk op-ed suggested that IPFS isn’t a “permanent” solution for NFTs. This is a mischaracterization of what IPFS is. For NFTs to become truly “immutable” digital records, the community must develop better practices around linking to data, and its underlying storage – of which IPFS and Filecoin can be a significant part.  Strengthening references to off-chain data  An NFT’s reference to off-chain data can be anything written in code. Most commonly, an NFT contains an HTTP URL that points to a location of data somewhere on the internet. This is problematic for supposedly immutable assets. Who is running the server? What happens if that server goes down? What if that data is deleted? What if it sends the incorrect data?  With HTTP URLs, there must be trust that the service provider remains uncompromised and that the content they serve is actually the content being searched for. Even though the token part of an NFT is on a blockchain, the asset is only as good as its weakest link.  This is where IPFS can help. IPFS enables users to store and retrieve content based on a “fingerprint” of the content itself (a cryptographic hash called a CID). By putting an IPFS CID in an NFT, that NFT directly references the data itself rather than a brittle HTTP link.  IPFS itself is not data storage – it’s a layer on top of data storage. Anyone can ask for a CID and get the uniquely corresponding content back as long as someone is broadcasting it to the network.  Further, IPFS is universally compatible with any data storage system. It can retrieve data off of a centralized provider, a local computer or decentralized storage protocols – whatever is broadcasting the CID to the rest of the network.  A common misconception of IPFS is that it is supposed to provide “permanent” storage. Within NFTs, its purpose is actually to prevent a type of link rot that afflicts so many NFTs’ off-chain data. But it doesn’t necessarily solve where off-chain data is stored.  Improving availability of off-chain data  For an NFT to be useful, not only does it need to have an immutable pointer to its data, but the data must be stored and accessible.  The beauty of IPFS is that it doesn’t require users to specify where data is but rather what data they’re looking for, as long as there’s at least one copy of the data being broadcasted to the network. So when we think about resilience for NFTs, IPFS means that anyone can download, serve and replicate off-chain NFT data in as many places as they’d like using whatever tools they prefer.  We call this a “maximalist” approach to storage. Anyone with any association with an NFT can store its data locally, pay a provider (e.g. Pinata, Infura), rely on a decentralized storage network (e.g. Filecoin, Arweave) or use a combination. With IPFS, users can hedge against one solution breaking by simultaneously using others.The problem around NFT persistence is very much technically solved. Anyone with a vested interest in an NFT should just make sure it’s stored in whatever ways make them comfortable. One big part of this is driving a culture where people are responsible for their own NFTs by downloading a local copy and ensuring the data is hosted in places they consider safe.  We must shift the conversation away from guarantees of “permanence” and towards a better understanding of persistence and resilience.  See also: Arweave-Based 'Permanent Dropbox' Raises $1.6M Seed  It’s true that this sort of culture, where people have more responsibility for their NFTs, is hard to develop. Most people don’t want to take on that added responsibility. However, Web 3 tools like NFT.Storage are trying to mitigate this issue by enabling multi-generational off-chain storage as public goods using IPFS and Filecoin.  The illusion of permanence  Filecoin’s critics point to the challenges of decentralized storage to say that “NFTs are no more permanent than any other part of the web.” But this oversimplifies the project, by insisting data be “permanent.” Of course, nothing is truly ""permanent”; every system comes with its own set of tail risks and disclaimers. If we truly want to protect against even the 0.01% chance that any single system fails, we want to take a more comprehensive, layered approach.  Any solution to off-chain data storage will be multifaceted and should be engineered to be swappable. This might look like marketplaces, artists and collectors all storing data in many places, where the responsibility for storage and accessibility extends beyond a single protocol. As our colleague Mikeal Rogers said, “Put your data in as many providers as it takes for you to feel confident you have permanence.”  And Filecoin is one of these storage options but is often misunderstood. Filecoin’s primary benefit is trustlessly guaranteeing that someone out there is actually storing the data they say they are for an agreed upon amount of time (what Filecoin users call a “deal”). The system is designed to be inexpensive and scalable ($0.01/TiB/year, 15EiB+ capacity).  But this doesn’t prevent it from being able to offer guaranteed storage beyond the duration of a single deal. New developments like the Filecoin Virtual Machine enable automatic deal renewal and repair, creating a powerful foundation for multi-generational storage.  Improving education and changing the culture  It’s important to be honest about NFTs’ limitations. Because NFTs are not the underlying data they represent, it’s important to understand their nuances. Thankfully, there are solutions like IPFS and Filecoin today to solve their shortcomings.  However, we must shift the conversation away from guarantees of “permanence” and towards a better understanding of persistence and resilience. No storage system can truly guarantee permanence, but content addressing allows for anyone who cares about an NFT to store it themselves in their preferred systems.  What can the community do to help the NFT space mature when it comes to storage? A few ideas:  Wallet providers should make it easy for their users to store their NFT data locally and pin it to IPFS to make it easy for them to take ownership of their NFTs  More decentralized storage networks should use IPFS CIDs as the primitive for their URIs - CIDs are designed to be universal, interoperable and backward-compatible - read here to learn more  Have more conversations about NFT storage!

The two appointments deepen “the board's expertise in digital assets, regulatory compliance and bank operations as the bank nears the conclusion of the conversion process to a federally chartered national bank,” Protego said in a press release.  The OCC granted Protego Trust a conditional federal charter in 2021 allowing Protego to custody digital assets.  Brooks is currently the CEO of mining firm Bitfury Group and was previously the head of Binance’s U.S. division for a period of just four months. He served as acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency from May 2020 until January 2021; before that he was chief legal officer for crypto exchange Coinbase.  Carpenter previously led digital bank Ally Financial for six years through its initial public offering in 2014. He is currently on the board of CIT Group and CIT Bank N.A., which were recently acquired by First Citizens Bank, creating a bank with more than $100 billion in assets.  Protego’s five other independent board members include retired Rear Admiral Danelle Barrett; Brian Golob, the former CEO of Russell Capital; Windham Capital Management President and CEO Mark Kritzman; David Straus, founder of Seattle’s Fortune Bank; and Jamie Selway, former head of institutional markets at Blockchain.

42394292,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbPy7,1644956205,Humans Are the Last-Mile Problem of Bitcoin Crowdfunding for Canada Truck Protest,"Bitcoin has come a long way since its pseudonymous founder warned against people sending the nascent digital currency to the notorious data leaker WikiLeaks. “WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us,” Satoshi Nakamoto said on the Bitcointalk forum. It was his or her or their last public message before stepping away from the project.  Cut off from its banking account and other crowdfunding platforms, WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange put out a call for BTC donations. This was precisely the type of situation for which Bitcoin was invented. A distributed financial network, Bitcoin enables people to transact a digital asset without divulging personal information and without the possibility of financial censorship.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The Bitcoin network does what it’s supposed to do – this much is made clear by the recent fundraising effort to support a convoy of truckers in Canada, who are protesting coronavirus-related restrictions. Whatever Satoshi’s concerns were for the nascent monetary network at the time, they are now certainly resolved.  Monday night, crowdfund organizers behind “HonkHonkHodl” announced they surpassed their goal of raising 21 BTC for the Ottawa Freedom Truckers Convoy. Donations are still coming in on the crowdfunding platform Tallycoin and are approaching the $1 million mark. Some 5,511 donors contributed, including the founder of the crypto exchange Kraken, Jesse Powell. To date, the two biggest donations, totalling more than $300,000, were made anonymously.  To some extent, today’s convoy faces a much tougher situation than WikiLeaks. The Canadian government has temporarily broadened the scope of its anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules to stymie donations (including crypto) to the protestors.  On Monday, after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enacted the never-used “Emergencies Act,” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said banks are allowed to freeze accounts related to the protestors without a court order and will be shielded from lawsuits for acting “in good faith.” Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank had already started freezing accounts, reportedly.  “If your truck is used in these blockades, your corporate accounts will be frozen. The insurance on your vehicle will be suspended. Send your rigs home,” Freeland, a former senior editor at the Financial Times, told Freedom Convoy members. “Consider yourself warned.”  See also: Bitcoin, Warts and All | Opinion  Bitcoin facilitates cross-border transactions that cannot be intercepted by corporations, the police or other institutional bodies. The initial call for crypto donations was made after centralized crowdfunding platform GoFundMe closed an account that had raised over $7 million, citing “violence and other unlawful activity” during the demonstrations.  (Meanwhile, last night, alternative crowdfunding site GiveSendGo announced it suffered a data breach that exposed “gigabytes of data about donors to the Freedom Convoy, including photos and passport scans,” according to The Verge.)  Still, questions remain. For instance, what is the best means of distributing bitcoin to protestors? Could donors or receivers face criminal liability for financially backing this controversial protest? Could the crowdfund’s organizers take the bitcoin and run?  Human concerns  “Your support for this mission has been incredible and these courageous truckers deserve every sat [satoshi, a unit of bitcoin] for the sacrifice they have made to hold the line in Ottawa,” said the people behind Bitcoin Stoa, which is facilitating the donations and keeping a regular diary of the protests, said in a blog update Monday night.  The donated funds are intended to pay for “immediate needs including food, hotel rooms, legal aid and fuel.” But there’s no apparent plan for how to actually get bitcoin (or the equivalent amounts converted to Canadian dollars) into truckers’ hands. Organizers said they are considering credit card payments, e-transfers, direct bank deposits and gift cards, depending on truckers’ “wishes.” The site also suggests handing out Opendime hardware wallets – “although no decisions have been made,” the site reads.  “Bitcoin funds are secure and our plan is to distribute all funds to truckers by end of week P2P [peer-to-peer] on the ground in Ottawa. Stay tuned for more details (re: transparency and verifiability) when this is completed,” the Bitcoin Stoa site reads.  The promise of later “transparency and verifiability” comes at the cost of confusion and opacity today. “For security reasons, we found it to be important that the key holders are not publicly identifiable,” Bitcoin Stoa wrote, citing “points of failure” and potential “coercion.”  The “fundraising committee” said they are “currently aggregating funds from the various wallets that have been created since the beginning.” An “interim [two-thirds] multisig wallet” was set up that will be managed by “reputable bitcoiners and a director of the freedom convoy nonprofit corp registered in Canada,” called the “Freedom 2022 Human Rights and Freedoms.”  See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) | The Node  “Hardware,” such as cold storage wallets, is also in transit and “once it arrives” a “board of directors” will initiate a “5/7 multisig wallet” to store the funds “until they are distributed to truckers or needed to cover emergency expenses including legal protection.”  Some bitcoiners have followed their own track to get donations directly to people, thereby bypassing Bitcoin for Truckers. Some took to Twitter to ask for names of protestors they could send sats to directly – a viable option for the P2P Bitcoin network – but one that may not scale.  Then there’s the fact that not all Canadians are happy about the protests. After weeks, the 35,000-50,000 truck convoy (reportedly the longest in history) is beginning to affect the economy by blocking the busiest passway between Canada and the U.S. At least one Canadian I know is dismayed as foreign money (not just bitcoin) “pours into a fringe movement that is intent on imposing its will on the rest of the country.”  Bitcoin, being a value-agnostic technological solution for digital payments, does not care about the larger societal debate playing out around this issue. Publications like Bitcoin Magazine are happy to print stories showing how bitcoin is funding a movement of “freedom-minded folks” upholding “their natural and legal rights.”  But people are not machines – no matter the “game theory” behind their case, or how “decentralized” the movement may be. Bitcoin has solved the issue of how to send money anywhere at any time – but it seems like humans, for now, are still the “last mile” concern.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/15/humans-are-the-last-mile-problem-of-bitcoin-crowdfunding-for-canada-truck-protest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b4c4c50323b706899424527f58aedf48dcb0891-1920x1286.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Sharply Falls Down Over The Past Week According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC futures open interest leverage ratio has decreased in the last week as investors de-risk their holdings. The &apos;futures open interest leverage ratio&apos; is an indicator that&apos;s defined as the ratio between the market open contract value and the total market cap of Bitcoin. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is the degree of leverage that an average user is currently making use of in the BTC market. When the value of the ratio increases, it means users are increasing their leverage as they take on more risk. High values of the indicator may imply that the Bitcoin market is overleveraged at the moment. And thus, it may be more prone to a liquidation squeeze event. On the other hand, low values of the metric mean investors are keeping their positions at low risk right now. The market is generally more stable during these periods as probability of deleveraging events decreases.

42416727,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulXRae,1644950310,The Bitfinex Laundering Story Continues,"The U.S. Congress is holding a slate of hearings right now on cryptocurrencies across different committees. I want to write about them but I think I need some more time to speak to people and put thoughts together. As such, we’ll talk about last week’s House Financial Services Committee stablecoin hearing, Senate Agriculture Committee CFTC hearing and today’s Senate Banking Committee stablecoin hearing next week.  Instead, let’s talk about the story that has everyone else captivated: The alleged Bitfinex hack launderers.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Misfit launderers  The narrative  Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, married New York residents, were arrested last Tuesday on charges of money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. in connection with allegations they laundered roughly 25,000 BTC and had access to another 94,000 BTC stolen from Bitfinex in 2016.  Why it matters  We might soon see some $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin reenter the market. The recovery of 94,000 BTC and the arrest of two individuals allegedly tied to the Bitfinex theft was arguably the biggest story in crypto last week, and only partly because of the money involved.  Breaking it down  Where do I even begin with last week?  Last Tuesday, federal officials announced they’d arrested two individuals on charges of money laundering conspiracy in connection with the 2016 Bitfinex hack, which saw just under 120,000 bitcoins (worth around $60 million at the time) stolen in a sophisticated attack.  Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan then made headlines for being a seemingly (mostly) normal New York couple, just one that happened to have access to what’s now worth more than $4 billion in bitcoin.  Bitfinex used BitGo at the time as its wallet provider, with a multi-signature security setup. (Multisig means you need at least X of Y people with keys to access something, where X > 1. It’s supposed to be more secure than a system where a single individual can access a company’s billions.)  While initial reports suggested there was a server breach at BitGo at the time, the company said it found no evidence of such. Further, Bitfinex held two of the keys. The precise details of the hack itself seem to still be unclear. Worth noting: Federal officials are not charging either defendant with the hack itself, a stance prosecutors reiterated during a pretrial detention hearing on Monday.  Is it possible the two were responsible for the initial hack? Who knows? Anything’s possible. Morgan gave a talk on social engineering and wrote an op-ed on protecting yourself from cybercrime. Lichtenstein appears to have commented about using bitcoin in crime on HackerNews years ago. Nothing here is definitive.  What we do know is the specific allegations laid out and the subsequent testimony from prosecutors. According to the allegations, Lichtenstein and Morgan both had access to some 94,000 BTC (worth around $3.5 billion) that federal officials were able to seize at the end of January.  The two also allegedly had access to much of the remaining 25,000 BTC, which was laundered through various wallets and darknet marketplaces before being cashed out.  Despite these allegations, the part that seemed to get the most attention was the fact that these two just kind of existed in the way they did. Morgan was an aspiring rapper under the moniker “Razzlekhan.” Lichtenstein tweeted complaints about CoinDesk’s coverage.  They took the world by storm. And look, I wasn’t immune, it was a very odd day week but it does also feel like this part is a distraction from the part where they allegedly had ninety four thousand bitcoin at hand.  The questions I have now:  What will happen to the bitcoin seized by the feds?  Bitfinex said in a statement it expects to recoup the coins. Former Bitfinex customers will likely also lay a claim. The timeline here is a bit unclear to me.  Will we see charges related to the actual hack?  Israeli authorities arrested two individuals three years ago on charges they were behind the Bitfinex hack. I couldn’t find an update on their status. It’s also, again, feasible that our new defendants are behind the hack. It does stretch credulity a bit to suggest that someone hacked Bitfinex and then gave the keys to all 120K BTC to a pair of Wall Street residents.  What happened to the 25,000 BTC not already recovered?  Some of these coins have been disposed of to purchase things like gift cards and PlayStations. Some are in different wallets. Prosecutors alleged that some $300 million are still accessible by the defendants. That leaves a ton of BTC not yet recovered.  Who locked down Morgan’s YouTube and Instagram accounts?  Her videos are gone, including a Nov. 20, 2021, video of her wedding. November is also when Morgan and Lichtenstein found out their internet service provider had been subpoenaed. Their attorney told a judge they’d been married for three years but the timing is interesting (even if coincidental).  I also want to leave you with CoinDesk’s (in my biased opinion) outstanding coverage of the past week, spearheaded by my colleague Cheyenne Ligon, who not only read the filings but traveled to both hearings to provide on-the-ground reporting:  Someone Just Moved $3.55B Worth of Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack  US Officials Seize $3.6B in Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack  'Like Genghis Khan, but With More Pizzazz': What We Know About the Accused Bitfinex Money Launderers  Crypto Analytics Tools 'Wave of the Future, Dude,' Judge Quotes Cult Film in $3.6B Bitcoin Seizure Case  Judge Stops Release of Bitfinex Hack Laundering Suspects  4 Unanswered Questions About the Bitfinex Hack  New Documents Detail Prosecutors’ Concerns That Bitfinex Hack Laundering Suspects Would Flee  Were the Alleged Bitfinex Launderers Planning an Escape to Ukraine?  Federal Judge Releases 'Razzlekhan,' Orders Other Bitfinex Hack Laundering Suspect to Remain in Jail  Super Bowl LVI  Because I watch a lot of football and I make the rules for this newsletter, I’m going to not talk about regulations for a minute. Instead, let’s talk Super Bowl crypto ads. My colleague Will Gottsegan already provided his own ranking of the ads. I’m going to take a different tack: I want to walk through the reactions my friends, who are not into crypto, had.  eToro: This was basically a standard ad, I think. No one really said anything about it. The focus on the ad itself was more on the brokerage business rather than the crypto-specific components.  TurboTax: I won’t lie, I thought this ad they began airing before the Super Bowl was funnier than the one they ran during the Super Bowl. None of my friends commented on the ad.  Crypto.com: Crypto.com has annoyed basically all of my football-loving, crypto-agnostic/crypto-skeptic friends with the Matt Damon ad. The new version, featuring Lebron James and not even mentioning crypto, garnered a lot more praise.  Coinbase: I saw mainly two reactions to the floating QR code. Information security types expressed concern that asking people to scan a random QR code might reinforce less-than-ideal practices. This seems a valid concern, but realistically there's a difference between a QR code paid for by a real, legitimate company advertised during the largest U.S. sporting event of the year and other places. Those QR code menus restaurants have are probably more obvious attack vectors.  The other reaction seemed to be largely curiosity (which seemed to have crashed Coinbase’s website).  FTX: Wait, is Larry David still a crypto skeptic? Or..?  Closing thoughts: Something that struck me was the lack of explicitly marketing crypto. eToro listed crypto as something to invest in like stocks, but FTX and Crypto.com mainly focused on marketing their own services, despite concerns seen on Twitter. This would have seemed unthinkable a year ago. Some of you may remember there was an immense amount of excitement over the possibility of a crypto ad in Super Bowl LV (there ended up being no crypto ads). This year, it was basically seen as inevitable. I’m not sure if this is an Overton Window shift or just a sign of how much money has poured into the industry over the past year. The important part now will be ensuring people don’t get hosed if they decide to invest in a speculative asset that sometimes gets very volatile at 11:00 p.m. on Fridays just as they are ready to wind down for the weekend. My favorite ad had to be Reddit’s. And, like everyone else, I was immensely disappointed we didn’t get a Kenobi ad.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  There will be a full Senate Banking Committee markup for the Fed nominees today at 2:15 p.m. Eastern (so presumably shortly after the stablecoin hearing ends).  Elsewhere:  Drained Crypto Accounts at IRA Financial Leave Victims Searching for Answers: Some $36 million in retirement funds kept in crypto have been drained from IRA Financial or Gemini, the company’s custodian, reports my colleague Danny Nelson. What’s more, neither IRA Financial nor Gemini have provided a full accounting of what’s happened.  BlackRock Planning to Offer Crypto Trading, Sources Say: BlackRock has some $10 trillion in assets under management, and it appears it will start offering crypto trading to clients sometime in the near future, reports Ian Allison.  Young, Crypto-Savvy Voters May Hold Key to South Korea's Next Election: South Korea’s presidential candidates are hoping to gain voter support through crypto-friendly policies ahead of the nation’s upcoming election, reports Lavender Au. Still, any such policies probably won’t be properly defined until after the election.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Verge) The Verge’s Corin Faife reports that government agencies are still using biometric (read: face scanning) startup ID.me for official business. The company in question also seems to be struggling a bit due to the amount of work.  (Vice) This is a good profile of the overall Web 3 zeitgeist by Motherboard’s Maxwell Strachan. It’s always worth reading and engaging with the criticisms, a lesson some parts of the crypto industry could perhaps learn.

The company last month purchased technology and other assets from Diem, the ill-fated stablecoin project from Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook).  Silvergate will seek to launch and grow its stablecoin project in similar fashion to its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), Reynolds said. The SEN allows the bank’s digital currency and institutional investor clients to send U.S. dollars and euros 24/7 between their Silvergate accounts and the accounts of other Silvergate depositors.  The initiative won’t require a massive new engineering or software investment to launch, Reynolds noted, but instead just incremental additions to those teams.  Silvergate’s strategy remains the same, said Reynolds: a focus on working with larger companies like Coinbase, Gemini, Square (Block), and other members of the Diem Association. Those platforms will enlist Silvergate to manage the reserve and invest it “appropriately,” and in return have the tokens ready for their users’ digital wallets.

Coinbase said Tuesday that users in Mexico can now convert crypto sent to them by other users into Mexican pesos at more than 37,000 physical retail outlets and convenience stores across the country. The company added that users can also save or invest their crypto in a Coinbase account.  If they choose to cash out any part of their balance, they can generate a redemption code from their Coinbase app that can be used to receive cash at those physical stores located across Mexico.  The cash-out service will remain free of charge between Tuesday and March 31. After that date, an undisclosed nominal fee will be applied, which will remain between 25% and 50% cheaper than traditional cross-border payment solutions, the company added.  “We recognize this is a global issue.

In a Feb. 3 ruling, Judge Eason Rajah found in favor of Bitstamp Holdings NV, a holding company owned by NXMH, the firm that acquired Bitstamp in October 2018.  Rajah will require Kodrič to sell his remaining 9.8% stake in the company, The Block reported Tuesday. Kodrič has transferred the shares to White Whale Capital, which he owns.  With the ruling, Bitstamp Holding's call option on the remaining shares – negotiated when it acquired the exchange – is upheld. A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the shares at a predetermined price on or before a specified date.  Kodrič sought an injunction against the option, claiming it to have been terminated automatically when he transferred his shares to White Whale. The option would see Bitstamp Holdings acquire the shares for $13.46 million, a figure Kodrič claimed significantly underprices them.  Following its purchase of Bitstamp, NXMH initially retained Kodrič as CEO to manage the firm's operations. Two years later former Gemini managing director Julian Sawyer was hired as CEO, and Kodrič moved into a non-executive role with a seat on the board of directors.  The court ruling fully terminates Kodrič's role in the crypto exchange he founded in 2011.  ""Bitstamp’s two major shareholders – NXMH and Nejc Kodrič – have a private shareholder matter which is being worked through,"" Sawyer said in an emailed comment.

42394295,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQ8N,1644945450,ETHDenver Agenda: 3 Big Themes in 2022,"I’m spending this week at ETHDenver, an Ethereum-focused conference in … well, Denver. I expect to be publishing regular updates from the Mile High City. First impression after landing last night: Denver, keep your bars open later.  I’m excited, partly because ETHDenver is an excellent conference, but mostly because in-person conferences have been few and far between for most of us over the past two years. That means crypto as a whole has been largely missing one of the most important parts of its development ecosystem.  That importance may be surprising to some new entrants. Blockchain and crypto are, after all, about being able to do things on the internet, pseudonymously, and without having to trust the people you’re trading, communicating or competing with. But the last few weeks have shown that, at best, we’re not quite there yet: Bad contracts, bad guys hiding behind pseudonyms and NFT rug pulls – Oh my!  These tragedies are bad enough when you’re a yield-farming pleb. But if you’re a businessperson or designer looking to actually create something in crypto, getting caught in the blast radius when someone else’s grift, laziness or incompetence detonates can be career ending. Hence the importance of a near year-round conference circuit that creates (or created) a tight-knit community of developers and fellow travelers who know one another’s faces, not just their avatars.  And ETHDenver stands as an event with strong – though not bulletproof – hype protection. It’s full of builders and techies and rigorous critical minds, not hypebeasts. The atmosphere of rigor won’t completely protect you, but it will sure boost your chances of interacting with non-sociopaths. It’s also, incredibly, FREE, and online participant slots are still available though in-person passes are now being waitlisted.  Equally important, conferences like ETHDenver will just plain expose you to more technical information than you’re likely to see anywhere online. The presentations and conversations are largely between developers, not pointed at the public. While non-devs will find themselves in the dark pretty frequently, close listeners will wind up with a much-enhanced grasp of technical nuance. And, ultimately, in crypto if you don’t grok the tech, you’re just throwing darts blindfolded.  Major themes  Big crypto conferences tend to work a bit like transaction blocks, consolidating months (or in this case years) of inchoate sentiment and discourse on important topics into a documented and memorialized Big Event. Here are some of the big topics on the table at this year’s ETHDenver.  Layer 2s, multichain and bridging  As I wrote after the Wormhole attack, it’s still unclear whether there’s a path to a future in which multiple layer 1 blockchains (think Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche) can smoothly and safely interact. This question has immense market and development implications. It will be discussed at length, onstage and off.  The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade/scaling  Goes without saying. The monumental task of transitioning the Ethereum network from Bitcoin-like proof-of-work mining to less energy-intensive proof-of-stake mining is expected to reach the finish line later this year, and the process itself is pretty well mapped out. But there will still be tons to figure out about the impacts, particularly how projects that build on Ethereum will need to adjust to the new reality. And then there are the future upgrades to ETH 2.0 – particularly sharding, currently slated for 2023 implementation. How much extra throughput will we get and, most importantly, whither these crippling transaction fees?  The bear market/the BUIDL market  Despite a recent bounce, upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes could really hammer crypto prices. That will impact on the strength and stability of a lot of crypto businesses and projects, as well as slowing down user growth. In past crypto cycles these have been shockingly fruitful times because teams are able to turn down the noise of public hype and focus on their own work. There will certainly be strategizing around a potential bear market, which for the first time seems likely to include acquisitions and consolidations, not just between startups but also between DAOs, a potentially fascinating development.  Event and schedule sampler  ETHDenver and other large crypto conferences are a lot like South by Southwest – there’s the official event but also dozens of unofficial “satellite events.” Here’s a potpourri of highlights from both, courtesy of my eagle-eyed colleagues here at CoinDesk.  Metapod DAO Accelerator Pitch Contest – Wednesday, 2/16 4:30 p.m. Mountain time (MT)  Schelling Point – Economics, Governance and Society miniconference. Looks incredible – Thursday, 2/17, all day.  Decentralized Social Media – A particularly powerhouse panel on a crucial subject – and notably free of some eager beavers who have mishandled its promise.

The new law essentially grants DAOs the same privileges as limited liability corporations (LLC), allowing them corporate personhood and the ability to hold real estate, done through a modification to the nation’s Non-Profit Entity Act.  DAOs having to register separate LLCs to fully operate is an issue for the sector’s crowdfunding genre (think ConstitutionDAO, LinksDAO, BlimpDAO, etc.) because registration makes it difficult to keep business decisions truly decentralized.  Read more: LinksDAO NFT Sale Books First $10M Toward Buying an Actual Golf Course  What's new  Under the Marshall Islands’ new law, however, DAOs incorporated within its territory would not have to register separate LLCs.  The Central Pacific island nation is hoping to become a hotbed for DAOs in the same way that Delaware has become a mainstay for U.S. business incorporation, David Paul, one of its Parliament members, told CoinDesk.  “Our laws have actually been tailored all of these years to be able to cater to this kind of service,” Paul told CoinDesk in an interview. “So making an amendment to the existing framework to include DAOs didn’t take much for us. Of course, we still have a long way to go, but we are excited to keep expanding.”  The first DAO putting the new legislation to the test is Admiral DAO, which has registered its company Shipyard Software, a decentralized exchange software developer, under Marshall Island jurisdiction (despite its name, Shipyard Software is unrelated to any maritime venture).  “We think of [decentralized exchanges] and DAOs as ships. They live in international waters, right?” Mark Lurie, CEO of Shipyard Software, told CoinDesk in an interview. “So when trying to figure out where to incorporate [Shipyard Software], we realized, Oh, let’s look at ships. And it turns out ships are all registered in the Marshall Islands. And that’s what led us here.”  The islands’ advantages  The islands have several advantages over individual U.S. states as a potential DAO domicile, namely not being subject to U.S. federal laws while still having access to the U.S. Postal Services, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Military, according to a press release.  MIDAO Directory Services has been tapped by the Marshall Islands to help prospective DAOs with the registration process, led by Adam Miller.  The Marshall Islands’ initial foray into cryptocurrency came in 2019 when it passed the Sovereign Currency Act to make its legal tender digital. The movement never got off the ground, however, due to what Paul called “regulatory obstacles.”  The Marshall Islands is not the first island nation to enact legislation to advance its crypto ambitions – the Republic of Palau, also located in the Pacific Ocean, launched the first digital residency program in January, allowing anyone from around the world to apply to become a digital resident of the country.

42416717,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulXR7l,1644943184,"JPMorgan Is the First Bank Into the Metaverse, Looks at Business Opportunities","JPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S., said it has become the first lender to arrive in the metaverse, having opened a lounge in Decentraland, a virtual world based on blockchain technology.  As well as the unveiling of the Onyx lounge (the name refers to the bank’s suite of permissioned Ethereum-based services), JPMorgan also released a paper exploring how businesses can find opportunities in the metaverse.  ""There is a lot of client interest to learn more about the metaverse,” Christine Moy, JPMorgan’s head of crypto and the metaverse, said in an email. “We put together our white paper to help clients cut through the noise and highlight what the current reality is, and what needs to be built next in technology, commercial infrastructure, privacy/identity and workforce, in order to maximize the full potential of our lives in the metaverse.”  With the mainstream acceptance of things like non-fungible tokens (NFT), the past year has seen a breathless advance into the metaverse, a catch-all for immersive gaming, world-building and entertainment, fueled by integrated commerce applications. In January, electronics giant Samsung opened a version of its New York store in Decentraland, and in November Barbados established a metaverse embassy, also in Decentraland.  JPMorgan begins its assessment of “metanomics” by pointing out that the average price of a parcel of virtual land doubled in the latter half of 2021, jumping from $6,000 in June to $12,000 by December across the four main Web 3 metaverse sites: Decentraland, The Sandbox, Somnium Space and Cryptovoxels.  “In time, the virtual real estate market could start seeing services much like in the physical world, including credit, mortgages and rental agreements,” said the JPMorgan report. It added that decentralized finance (DeFi) collateral management could well come into play, and that rather than traditional finance companies this could be done by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  Work in the metaverse will also be gainful, said the report, pointing to a range of entertainment providers, as well as apps like RTFKT, a virtual shoe designer recently acquired by Nike.

(VYGVF) reported operating income of $3.2 million for its fiscal second quarter versus a loss of $2.9 million a year earlier, according to its earnings statement Tuesday morning.  While fiscal second quarter revenue of $164.8 million was shy of analyst estimates for $178.1 million, it more than doubled from the first quarter, and was up 4,400% from the previous year. Of that $164.8 million, $149 million was from the company’s historical crypto trading business, and $15.8 million from the Coinify merchant operation.  “We are a product delivery organization and are taking the necessary steps to continue our revenue diversification strategy,” said CEO Steven Ehrlich. Next up, he said, is the launch of the Voyager Debit Card. The company also has plans to add equity trading to its platform, expand to Europe and Canada, and offer a non-fungible token (NFT) product and wallet.  Looking at other metrics, Voyager reported total verified users of 3.2 million as of Dec. 31, 2021, up 49% from 2.15 million three months earlier; total funded accounts of 1.074 million, up 25%; and total assets on platform of $5.9 billion, up 37%.  Company headcount rose to 250 as of Dec. 31, 2021, up from 231 in the previous quarter.  Speaking on the earnings call, management said it expects to be more active in mergers and acquisitions, but will be focused on finding the right cultural fit. Asked about buybacks given the more than 50% decline in the stock price over the past three months, the team declined to comment.  “Overall, it was a solid quarter for Voyager in our view as revenues continued to expand/diversify, account growth was strong and the gap between lending/staking revenues and rewards tightened,” said Compass Point analyst Chris Allen in a note to clients.

Other investors in the round included Variant Fund, Slow Ventures and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman’s Table Management, as well as Rick Wagoner, the former CEO of General Motors, among others.  DIMO is a decentralized software and hardware internet of things (IoT) platform that lets users create verified streams of their vehicle data to share privately with applications, which can allow users to negotiate for better services such as auto financing and insurance.  The funding round will help Digital Infrastructure and its partner companies make the core software open source and launch a software development kit (SDK) for developers building apps for the network.  In December, Digital Infrastructure launched the App.Dimo.Zone for users to connect their vehicles; 17,000 vehicles have been added to date, according to the press release. The company also offers hardware data miners the ability to securely connect car owners to the DIMO network.  Users connecting to the network are rewarded in the native DIMO token for participation and referrals.  “DIMO Proof-of Movement has the ability to better coordinate connected vehicles with the world around them,” said Alex Felix, CIO of CoinFund, in a press release. “Empowering users to own their data is a powerful use for Web 3 technologies, and the network is designed around a positive feedback loop that redraws stakeholder lines and rewards users in more productive ways.”  Read more: CoinFund’s President Working on Assembling ‘Regulatory Legos’ for His Firms to Succeed",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/15/coinfund-joins-9m-round-for-digital-infrastructure-incs-bid-to-decentralize-vehicle-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e8f0427f83015576cc5cdf99c7f22ba3cb884dd-2034x1474.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In no surprise, Deutsche found that most investors got into the space primarily to make money. However, 34% said their main motivation was curiosity or exploration, and a similar proportion gave portfolio diversification as the key reason.  A quarter of respondents said they expected bitcoin to be trading over $110,000 in five years, and more than 70% said they planned to increase their crypto activity in the next 12 months.  We’re not talking whales here – a full 61% of investors had committed less than $10,000 to crypto, with 38% less than $1,000.  Men are much more active in crypto than women, according to the survey, with 29% of males having used or invested in digital assets in the last 12 months versus only 14% of females. Men are also more bullish going forward, according to the data.  Looking at those in crypto for transactions, the survey showed 26% perform fewer than five per month, and just 5% more than 100 per month. Transaction size is small, with 67% of them under $100.

BSC is rebranding to BNB Chain, which stands for Build and Build, in an effort to draw a connection to Binance’s BNB token, the governance token for the protocol, the press release said.  The BNB Chain will be made up of two parts: BNB Beacon Chain, previously Binance Chain; and BNB Smart Chain, formerly BSC. BSC is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), where smart contracts are executed, and serves as a hub to access other blockchains.  Binance has committed over $1 billion to support the BSC ecosystem as it competes with the Ethereum network and other layer 1 blockchains. BSC has drawn criticism for being too centralized and for the rug pulls taking place on its ecosystem.  In designing BSC, Binance had to sacrifice some decentralization to compete with Ethereum, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told CoinDesk in September 2020.  The BNB Chain will also increase the number of validators on BSC to 41 from 21, said Samy Karim, BNB Chain ecosystem coordinator, in the press release. The 20 additional validators will function as candidate block producers, Karim said.  By expanding validators and improving scaling, BNB Chain will “embrace” large-scale applications in GameFi, SocialFi and the metaverse, Karim added.

Each loot box contains early access to one of the 17 tracks from B.O.D.R. There will be 1,470 NFTs minted for each song. The NFTs do not confer any sort of IP rights.  On Tuesday, Gala also announced another Galaverse festival set for June in Copenhagen. The previous Galaverse event, held in December in Las Vegas, was one of the first major concerts to occur post-COVID-19.  Other major metaverse tokens such as MANA and SAND also posted gains.

In fact, customer acquisition for BNPL services surged by 162% between 2018 and 2019 alone.

Surely, as with any new payment method, some backend integration is necessary to present this option to customers. However, BNPL connections are simple and technically similar to other popular alternatives such as credit cards, debit cards, or digital wallets.

Buyers tried to take control of an important range of $225. For a while, the ELGD price broke this range and stopped at $270. However, this buyers advantage could not be maintained. In the end, the weekly candle closed below the $225 range. A large pin, which occupies most of the weekly candle, indicates the aggressiveness of sellers. https://www.tradingview.com/x/LDp2GjCx/ In addition, last week&apos;s trading showed that a second test of the $225 range is likely to activate sellers for another fall wave with a target of $150. This mark is a critical point of the EGLD growth scenario. The fact is that on the weekly timeframe you can see a clear growth channel, in which the EGLD price moves from April 2021. After setting a new high in November, buyers with a weekly pin tested the top trend line of this channel. Then in January the test of the lower trend line of the channel took place.

""This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting peoples' jobs and restoring faith in our institutions,"" said the prime minister. Though the Emergencies Act allows for the military to be called in, Trudeau, for now, said he has no plans to do so.  The government instead appeared set to take aim at protester finances. Speaking alongside Trudeau, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said banks can immediately freeze or suspend bank accounts without a court order and without fear of civil liability.  In addition, the government is broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules to now cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use.
