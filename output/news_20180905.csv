42381139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94CIb,1536181205,High Times Now Says It's Accepting Crypto Payments For Its IPO,"It turns out that the cannabis publication High Times is accepting cryptocurrency for its ongoing initial public offering (IPO) after all.  The publication announced at the beginning of August that it would accept bitcoin and ethereum for its IPO, but later walked back that announcement in an August 13 filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Despite the move, however, bitcoin appears to have remained as a payment option on the company's investment page.  When reached for comment, High Times representative Jon Cappetta confirmed that the company is, in fact, accepting bitcoin and ethereum as payment options. Cappetta told CoinDesk that the regulatory filing was made ""to make the SEC happy.""  ""Yes, technically we are accepting bitcoin and ethereum,"" Cappetta told CoinDesk. However, High Times is not taking or holding any cryptocurrencies – rather, a third-party processor called Fund America is taking the two cryptocurrencies and converting into U.S. dollars, which the company will then receive.  ""On the legal side, it's a lot of jargon. There's no real easy way to spell it out. They issued the release to make the SEC happy,"" he said.  He explained:  ""We're accepting [cryptocurrencies] as a payment option, but technically Fund America takes the bitcoin and ethereum ... It's similar to the way if we were doing an international IPO, and we were accepting the pound or the euro, those guys aren't accepting that money, they're converting it to [dollars].""  The reason for the earlier walk-back was due to concerns expressed by the SEC after the company initially said it would accept bitcoin, which mainly revolved around whether High Times would directly receive cryptocurrencies, he said.  ""The reason we got slapped by the SEC last time is because we were accepting it ... similar to a credit card processor ... [however], it gets transferred to cash and we get that, we're not explicitly holding [cryptocurrencies],"" he said.  High Times' IPO itself is going well, Cappetta said, and the company is looking at a direct listing as a result.  ""The Regulation A [fundraising] is going to close on the 12th of this month, and then from there we will begin the listing process,"" he said.  Hat tip to Scott.

Dorsey was responding to a question Democratic committee member Doris Matsui posed during an U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing that focused on user privacy protections, misinformation, content moderation and alleged bias against political conservatives on Twitter.  ""You previously expressed interest in the broad applications of blockchain technology, including potentially in an effort to verify identity to fight misinformation and scams. What potential applications do you see for blockchain?"" asked Matsui, the representative for California's 6th congressional district.  Dorsey replied:  ""First and foremost we need to start with the problems that we're trying to solve and the problems we're solving for our customers and look at all available technology in order to understand if it could help us accelerate or make those outcomes much better. Blockchain is one that I think has a lot of untapped potential, specifically around distributed trust and distributed enforcement potentially.""  ""We haven't gone as deep as we'd like just yet in understanding how we might apply this technology to the problems we're facing at Twitter, but we do have people within the company thinking about it today,"" Dorsey continued.  That the company is examining possible fixes for double-checking user identities and policing content legitimacy to shore up digital trust is unsurprising, given recent events on the social media website and at Dorsey's other company Square, where he is also CEO.  As reported by CoinDesk and other outlets, Twitter has been ground-zero for identity scams that have tricked users into sending their cryptocurrency holdings to fictitious, lookalike celebrity and influencer profiles. Researchers say the copycat accounts are part of massive botnets that may have likewise attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  In 2014, payment processor Square deployed Square Market, a merchant point-of-sale system that transacts in fiat and bitcoin. Another Square product, the Cash mobile wallet, tested bitcoin buying and selling in late 2017, rolling out complete access to all 50 U.S. states last month. Dorsey has said earlier this year that he hopes bitcoin will become the Web's ""native currency.""  Prior to asking the 41-year-old technology CEO twice-over about Twitter's work with blockchain technology, Matsui also highlighted a pending piece of legislation that calls for the U.S. Department of Commerce to create a blockchain working group.  ""As I previously announced in this committee, I am soon introducing legislation to direct the Department of Commerce to convene a working group of stakeholders to develop a consensus-based definition of blockchain,"" Matsui said.

The report says the EU should enforce common regulations on crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well, according to Reuters.

Ashley Fox, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), has submitted a draft proposal for creating a common standard for ICO regulations within the EU and select other nations.

The firm also announced a slower but free service along the same corridor, that also uses Ripple payment rails. Offering ""zero fees and a mid-market rate,"" payments will arrive in 2-3 business days, according to the release.

Users who are interested can purchase the domain through any Domain Name Service registrar and use it like any .eth domain, meaning users can associate it with their wallets, name smart contracts, create subdomains and more.  While EasyDNS – one such DNS registrar – has created a simplified wizard for adding the domain, users can also manually add .xyz, he wrote.  Johnson added:  ""We're rolling out our ENS support initially on .xyz to give it a test-drive, but the best thing about this is that it doesn't require any cooperation or permission from each DNS [top-level domain]. Once we've had a chance to see how it works, we plan to roll it out to all other DNS TLDs that support the necessary features — which is almost all of them.""  ENS  allows ethereum users to put ""human readable names"" in place of long wallet or service addresses, making it easier for individuals to transfer funds, use smart contracts or otherwise develop projects, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The new .xyz domain is the second top-level domain that ENS supports, following .luxe earlier this year.

A Business Insider report on Wednesday, citing ""people familiar with the matter,"" said the decision has been made as the regulatory situation in the U.S. is still a gray area when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  However, per the sources, the banking giant hasn't abandoned the idea completely, but is rather pushing the possibility lower down on its priorities list and could still move to open the desk at a later date.  Further, Goldman Sachs' plan to start offering a cryptocurrency custody service is apparently still on the table, with Business Insider citing the need for ""reputable custody offerings"" to bolster confidence around involvement in cryptocurrency at Wall Street firms.  As reported by CoinDesk, the bank was first revealed to have an interest in a crypto trading venture back in October 2017, though it was said to be in the very early stages of exploring the idea.  In May, however, it was also suggested, once more via anonymous sources, that it would use its own money to trade bitcoin futures products from Cboe and CME on behalf of its clients. Goldman was also preparing to launch ""its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients,"" according to the New York Times at the time.  The latest piece of Goldman's crypto jigsaw came into place in early August, when it followed up the futures plan with the possibility of a crypto custody service aimed to protect institutions' holdings from hacking and accidental loss.  So far, though, little has been said publicly by the bank on these potential moves into the crypto space.

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Argentinian startup Ripio is making peer-to-peer microloans available today to all its 200,000 bitcoin wallet users in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. The Buenos Aires-based company raised $37 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) last year to build the Ripio Credit Network, which matches individual lenders and borrowers across the globe through ethereum smart contracts.  Today's full rollout of that marketplace follows a closed beta in which more than 800 loans were facilitated to customers in Argentina. Ripio said it now has 3,000 lenders on the network, many of them located in Asia, issuing loans for up to $730, though so far the average loan size is $146.  Ripio CEO Sebastian Serrano told CoinDesk:  ""We have people from Asia funding people in South America, which is something you cannot do with another [app].""  Previously known as Bitpagos, Ripio is one of the longest-running startups in the crypto space, with well-established merchant processing, exchange and wallet services. It entered the credit business in 2016, lending its own funds to consumers in Argentina, before pursuing this more ambitious vision for global p2p lending.  While the borrowers receive their loans in fiat, the new network is powered by an ethereum-based token called RCN. Lenders send the funds in RCN, a cut of the tokens goes to third parties involved in the lending process – such as identity verifiers, credit scorers and co-signers of the loans – and Ripio (and, potentially, other wallet providers) converts the RCN to fiat before disbursing the money to the borrower.  Unlike most exchanges and mobile lending services, Ripio's offerings are available to unbanked crypto users. This is essential for Latin American markets where people have diverse but overwhelmingly complicated histories with the banking industry. For example, according to World Bank statistics from 2017, around 30 percent of adults in Brazil are unbanked, compared to 54 percent in Colombia.  Although the startup doesn't have data on how many unbanked users are on its platform, a survey of 1,000 Ripio users revealed 19 percent didn't have a credit card. They often fund their wallets by depositing cash at convenience stores that partner with Ripio.  With the credit network, however, they now have a way to build a track record of repaying debts, which could help them obtain financial services in the future. Further, ""the entire lifecycle of the credit and the loan"" is contained in the smart contract on the blockchain, Serrano said.  ""It gives the user credit history. Even if the marketplace disappears the code will continue to execute,"" he said.  To make credit histories recorded in smart contracts widely useful, Ripio has proposed a standardized way to present claims about an identity (e.g. ""Joe made all his car loan payments on time"") on ethereum. Serrano explained:  ""In order for it to work across products and networks, ethereum needs to get a standard for identity claims so that every project uses one or two claim standards, kind of like we have ERC-20 [for tokens].""  Cross-border markets  Over the next year, Ripio plans to expand services to Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay.  ""Every market has these different characteristics, regulations, things you have to comply with,"" Serrano told CoinDesk, ""Things you have to do to make it easy for users to deposit cash.""  Political instability can create roadblocks, however. For example, Ripio once operated in Venezuela and still maintains staff there, but security concerns and opaque regulations forced the startup to halt operations.  ""We hope to extend service there as soon as this madness ends,"" Serrano said. ""It's become very, very difficult to maintain operations in Venezuela, legally.""  In order to expand, Ripio is looking for more fiat-centric partnerships like the ones it established in Brazil with Neon Bank and Banrisul. Since users are handing over cash, Ripio needs banks for storage. Plus, expanding such partnerships in each nation could provide crucial liquidity.  Santiago Siri, the Argentinian founder of a blockchain governance project called Democracy Earth, told CoinDesk that Ripio's partnerships are already making an impact across the continent.  For example, through its partnership with the e-commerce giant Mercado Libre, shoppers and sellers can transfer funds between their e-commerce accounts and Ripio wallets, offering new avenues for people to earn or spend crypto.  ""Large populations in countries like Brazil and Mexico are unbanked,"" Siri said. ""So companies like Mercado Libre have to find ways to do business without credit cards. Ripio has been leading this, allowing people to do payments [indirectly] with bitcoin.""  Serrano said 15 percent of Ripio wallets' transaction volume, millions of dollars per month, now comes from Mercado Libre. Rosine Kadamani, the founder of the educational Blockchain Academy in Brazil, praised this partnership with the largest e-commerce platform in the region, as well as Ripio's crypto-powered loans, saying:  ""When we're trying to get people in the crypto space, it's a good strategy to reach people where they are already comfortable... Why not provide a space for peer-to-peer loans? I see no reason at all for credit to be monopolized by banks.""  Speaking to the demand for such cross-border conduits, Siri added: ""Latin America is a very fertile region for the deployment of cryptocurrency infrastructures.""

42429631,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0D5h,1536152405,Blockchain Startup Founded By Deloitte Vets Unveils Supply Chain Platform,"A blockchain startup headed by a group of former Deloitte employees is launching a new supply chain platform.  Citizens Reserve announced the SUKU ecosystem on Wednesday, positioning it as ""an industry agnostic supply chain solution"" that seeks to improve how shipments are coordinated and tracked around the world. As far as technology goes, SUKU will leverage both the ethereum and quorum blockchains.  Separate from the company's previously reported Zerv network, SUKU aims to provide trading partners with real-time data on the location of goods, along with functionality that lets them use a bid-and-order marketplace and create automated contracts. At the same time, the platform is designed to offer privacy to those users, and will effectively serve as a ""supply chain-as-a-service"" hub.  CEO Eric Piscini, Deloitte's former global blockchain lead, said in the announcement that recent events have proven the need for improved supply chain systems, citing this summer's pharmaceutical scandal in China as one example.  He added:  ""The current supply chain environment is complex and difficult to navigate. Almost all enterprises require a supply chain to some extent, but the technology supporting them remains expensive, inefficient and fragmented.""  The SUKU decentralized supply chain platform will be built to work across different industries, Piscini said, ""enabling our trading partners to interact in a way that's been all but impossible up until now.""  As envisioned, SUKU would use the ethereum component to run its smart contracts, with the terms of a transaction stored on the blockchain and payments automatically executed as the requisite criteria are fulfilled. The quorum blockchain would be permissioned, acting as a private marketplace for vendors and bidders.  An accompanying SUKU token will be used to reward the platform's partners and serve as the basis for an incentive mechanism.

42429621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Cnh,1536148788,Polychain Leads Blockmesh Developer Spacemesh's $15 Million Fundraise,"Blockchain development startup Spacemesh has just raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital, the firm announced Wednesday.  The project is taking a novel angle on blockchain tech, working to develop a ""blockmesh operating system"" using the proof-of-space-time (PoST) consensus protocol. As previously reported, the goal is to be able to run PoST on any computer, while making it resistant to powerful mining chips called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).  Polychain joined MetaStable, Paradigm, Coinbase Ventures, 1kx, Arrington XRP Capital, Danhua Capital, Electric Capital, Collaborative Fund, Jack Herrick and a number of other funds in contributing to the Spacemesh round, according to a press release.  Spacemesh  co-founder Tomer Afek said the funds would be dedicated to growing and compensating the development team, as well as for an open-source bounty program to pay voluntary contributors. To that end, the company is now hiring in New York City and Tel Aviv, although applicants do not necessarily need to live in either city to be hired. At present, the team comprises 10 full-time employees.  A testnet is planned for launch by the beginning of 2019, according to the company, with the genesis block expected by the second quarter of next year.  Afek explained:  ""We are iterating on the protocols as well as the full node implementation, and [are] only going to release a mainnet and the Spacemesh programmable cryptocurrency once we have done extensive security and critical bugs audits and have published the full Spacemesh protocol and its rigorous and peer-reviewed security proofs.""  PoST is being designed to allow participants to store data on their computer over a period of time. This system would be less energy-intensive than proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms, such as used by the bitcoin protocol, and more accessible than proof-of-stake (PoS) systems, Spacemesh believes.  ""PoST is early, thus yet to be proven, but on paper [it] meets criteria [neither] PoW nor PoS can allow for – a low barrier for entry (no bonds) with linearity in rewards, aka fairness. So I think it is a worthy attempt for sure,"" Afek said.  Spacemesh raised $3 million in seed funding back in early May.

42429632,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0DBh,1536146026,Bull Trap? Bitcoin Price Slides Below $7K Despite Strong Indicators,"Bitcoin dropped below $7,000 a few minutes before press time, in a move that warrants caution as a possible bull trap.  The leading cryptocurrency closed yesterday (as per UTC) above the trendline sloping downwards from the March 5 high and May 5 high, seemingly confirming a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  However, the follow-through has been disappointing. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,965 on Bitfinex – down 3.5 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The negative price action reminds us of a failed long-term bullish breakout seen in July, although the long-term bull reversal is likely to be intact, according to technical studies.  Daily chart  As seen in the above chart, bitcoin's move above the falling channel hurdle (or falling trendline) on July 24 trapped the bulls on the wrong side of the market.  During that event, BTC had crossed the long-term falling trendline hurdle to print a high of $8,507 only to fall back below the psychological support of $6,000 by mid-August.  The bull breakout was short-lived, possibly due to overbought conditions indicated by a relative strength index (RSI) of 77.00.  More importantly, the BTC market was rocked by the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rejection of the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the end of July and that played a big role in pushing prices below $6,000.  As for today, the RSI is located at 64.50, meaning there is plenty room for an extension of the rally towards the immediate resistance lined up at $7,806 (200-day moving average). Further, the markets seem to have priced-in the ETF-related bad news in the first half of August.  And last but not the least, BTC's recovery from $5,859 (August low) has produced the first higher price low of the year, which indicates the tide is turning in favor of the bulls.  As a result, it seems that despite today's dip, BTC's bullish move above the falling channel hurdle looks legitimate and the rally is sustainable.  While the cryptocurrency is losing altitude at the time of writing, the pullback will likely be short-lived as both the short-and long-term technical studies are biased toward the bulls  4-hour chart  The 4-hour chart too, suggests the outlook remains bullish, with the rising channel still intact.  Further, the stacking order of the 50-candle, above the 100-candle, above the 200-candle moving averages (MAs) is a typical bullish signal.  However, the bull case would weaken if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the rising channel.  View  BTC's long-term bullish breakout looks more legitimate than the one seen in July.  The pullback witnessed today could end up recharging the engine for a stronger rally toward the 200-day MA of $7,806.  A UTC close below the 10-day MA would abort the short-term bullish view.  Acceptance below the 100-day MA located at $6,895 would invalidate the long-run bull breakout.

And, according to Civic co-founder Vinny Lingham, while the technology is all in place for the system to work, it's this network of users that the company is still struggling to achieve. In an effort to spur this adoption, Civic announced Wednesday that it will be paying for all identity checks for users and business partners from now until the end of the year.  Well, at least, $43 million worth.  All told, Civic is allocating 333 million of its total 1 billion supply of CVC tokens, a third of which it sold for $33 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in June 2017. The tokens will be transferred to Civic to pay for the cost of the identity checks, serving to bootstrap growth and stress-test the protocol.  ""We basically said we're going to reserve a third of the tokens to drive network effects,"" Lingham told CoinDesk.  For Civic, every new user that's had his or her identity verified on the platform makes it a little more attractive for the next company looking for an identity solution. In this way, Civic is creating incentives for more people to join.  Lingham has been thinking about the challenge of reaching critical mass since before his company conducted an ICO in 2017.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Paypal got it right with the whole $10 free if you invite a friend and it nearly bankrupted the company. They managed to crack the chicken and egg problem doing it that way.""  Fortunately for Lingham, in the new world of crypto, it's possible for a company to create their own money supply as long as the market sees future potential. So, Civic – being the only entity, currently, that provides the know-your-customer (KYC) verification within the system – will be paying itself in CVC tokens for the service.  Why now?  Civic has built up a lot of partners, companies and entrepreneurs that need to verify a user's identity, the most well-known of which is Annheiser-Busch.  The two companies verified the identities of users at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 in New York City to distribute Budweiser beers from a vending machine to attendees of legal drinking age.  It also has a lot of partners in the crypto space, including ShapeShift, Hilo, 0x and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, according to its partners page, and it's been able to enlist a lot of ICO projects who need to run KYC before selling tokens.  ""We're at the point now where the product is actually – we've tested it,"" said Lingham. ""A hundred companies have signed up to use Civic. It's working.""  But it's hoping that more will consider joining this year on the promise of saving a little money onboarding their customers.  And they're preparing for that influx by investing in the future of the business.  For instance, the company also recently acquired the URL ""identity.com,"" the place that will eventually serve as the meeting place between companies that need KYC services and the ones that provide them. That part of the protocol hasn't been rolled out yet, though.  Once Civic knows that its system is working with high volume, they will open up the platform to other verifiers.  When gone, sir?  So, how many identity verifications can $43 million pay for? The general average cost for identity verification is $2, Lingham said, but there's a wide spread.  ""We're offering this for all our services, including the accredited investor test, which is like $60,"" Lingham said.  So on its face, it could be feasible for the supply to max out before the year's end. If in theory, the company ran out of all 333 million tokens before New Year's Day, the promotion would stop early. Lingham argues, though, there's really almost no chance this will happen.  ""We don't expect to use all the tokens in the next couple of months,"" he said.  That's because he argued, all those CVC transactions would register to the network as demand for the product. Then increased demand would drive up the price of the token, so each additional verification should cost slightly less in CVC terms.  While Lingham thinks the promotion will succeed in enticing more users, he expects to end the year with lots of tokens left in the reserve. If it came anywhere close to running out, though, the blockchain's ability to handle all those transactions would present more of an issue.  ""The bigger problem would be ethereum. It would make CryptoKitties look like a walk in the park,"" Lingham said.  On Identity.com, ""it's literally just the verification you're being charged for,"" Lingham explained. Whereas, ""the central identity vendors of the world, the credit bureaus, etc, they resell your information at a profit,"" he argued.  If a new entrant comes into the space and offers consumers a different deal and it catches on, that's something that could ripple out.  As Lingham put it:  ""The number of big multibillion companies in this space right now, if we start putting margin pressure on them, we disrupt the whole industry.""

According to a report on Wednesday from local financial news source Securities Times, the lab has launched a fintech center in Nanjing, the capital city of the eastern Jiangsu province, in partnership with the municipal government.  The goal is to apply technologies developed by the lab in pilot programs with banks and academic institutions such as the PBoC's Jiangsu branch, the Bank of Jiangsu and the University of Nanjing – all of which also co-founded the center.  Newly created municipal fintech centers will also serve as hubs for testing the PBoC's planned central bank digital currency when it goes from prototype to production in the future, the report adds.  The Jiangsu entity has been announced just months after the Digital Currency Research Lab established a fully owned subsidiary in the southern city of Shenzhen. According to a Chinese business registration database, a firm called Shenzhen Fintech Limited was incorporated by the lab on June 16 with an initial starting capital of around $300,000.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the research lab, led by Yao Qian, has filed more than 40 patent applications relating to the creation of a central bank digital currency incorporating core features of a cryptocurrency.

42429623,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Cjh,1536134445,R3 Rebuffed In Attempted Bid for Settlement Coin Blockchain Project,"Enterprise blockchain is a tough old game.  R3, one of the most prominent startups in the sector, tried unsuccessfully this summer to muscle in on another blockchain consortium, the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) project, which is managed by U.K. technology vendor Clearmatics, CoinDesk has learned.  In early June, R3 proposed to the USC's bank members that the project be built on the startup's Corda platform, instead of Clearmatics, which has been building the platform since the project's inception in 2015, according to four people familiar with the situation.  To entice the banks to make this switch so late in the game, R3 offered to fund the technical development itself and to pay a share of legal fees, the sources said.  However, the idea was unanimously rejected by the now 17 consortium members when put to a vote later that month. This happened close to a pivotal time for USC, as the project moved into ""Phase IIIb"" at the beginning of August.  Charley Cooper, a managing director at R3, said the company could not discuss individual discussions with prospective partners for confidentiality reasons. But as a general matter, he said, ""We believe in open standards for critical parts of blockchain market infrastructure, such as cash and value on ledger, because such standards will benefit the whole industry. Part of our role is to identify opportunities for discussion with potential partners.""  R3's overture to USC was an attempt to leverage work already done on cash settlement on its Corda platform. In order to execute this goal, R3 asked the USC banks to combine efforts and to bring all previously developed legal and regulatory intellectual property (IP) related to USC to a new proposed project. To this, R3 would contribute its sharable IP from projects done in collaboration with over 50 central banks, regulators, and commercial banks – over 20,000 lines of code and dozens of reports on implementation models.  The startup appears undeterred by the rejection. In late June, it came back with a revised proposal that would keep Clearmatics in the picture as a partner.  At the same time, R3 argued to the USC members that they and Clearmatics were at risk of forgoing an important opportunity to pool resources and create standards in a critical area of future market infrastructure, according to one source familiar with R3's position. It proposed going forward by way of a collaboration with Clearmatics to demonstrate that the two vendors' technologies were interoperable.  Bad timing  The USC project began life back in 2015 as an initiative of Swiss banking giant UBS and Clearmatics. It has the audacious goal of applying distributed ledger technology (DLT) to the way central banks move funds around and manage liquidity, and so addresses fundamental questions related to credit risk in the financial industry.  Over the past three years, the project has seen a brace of banks join and it was last publicly reported to comprise 11 financial institutions: Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, MUFG, State Street, UBS, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and NEX.  Since then the consortium membership has grown to 17 banks, according to a banker involved in the project, who characterized R3's bid to bring USC on to Corda as an ""aggressive"" move.  ""This is a tough business environment and R3 is a business like any other and it probably didn't cross the line of sharp business practice,"" said this source, adding that it highlights the importance of the USC project.  Provided the USC project gets the full go-ahead from central banks and regulators, it could become comparable with SWIFT was 50 years ago or CLS was 20 years ago, said the banker.  As such, it's understandable that other technology vendors might want to pitch to the project's members, added the source, and going forward, it would not be surprising to see vendor selections being conducted in a manner that's common in the financial industry.  However, because the USC project is at such a pivotal stage, this ensured a unanimous vote from the members declining R3's approach.  ""I think the reason for the unanimity was less about the technology and more about the timeline of the process,"" said the source, concluding:  ""The vote came like literally a week or two before the closing of the legal documents for Phase IIIb and I think pretty much the attitude was, 'Let's not allow this approach by R3 to derail going into that phase or delay the project.'""

42429615,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0Cbh,1536129013,ASX Probes Penny Stock Seeking to Raise $15 Million in an ICO,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has launched a probe into an IT firm behind a listed penny stock seeking to raise $15 million via an initial coin offering (ICO) for the launch of a cryptocurrency exchange.  Called Byte Power Group (BPG), the public firm issued a statement on Wednesday with answers to a total of 17 questions raised by the ASX requiring the firm to provide details on its intended token sale, disclosed on July 19.  Based on a release at the time, BPG aims to issue a total of 1 billion Byte Power X Loyalty Tokens (BPX Tokens) and plans to sell 25 percent of the amount to private investors at a price of US$0.06 per unit.  The goal is to raise as much as $15 million for the firm to fund the launch of the exchange, where the BPX Tokens can be further traded and used to offset transaction fees. The remaining 75 percent will be allocated for ""pre-registered users of the exchange, company special releases, pre-opening and future marketing drive,"" according to the plan.  As BPG aims to become the first publicly traded company in Australia to launch a cryptocurrency exchange via the ICO funding model, the move sparked concerns from the ASX over whether it is ""in compliance with the ASX Listing Rules.""  On Aug. 1, the ASX's compliance team sent a letter to BPG, requiring the firm to justify the legality of the planned operation, listing the 17 questions that asked about the status of the ICO, whether it had obtained any legal advice and more.  In today's written response, BPG said it had already started selling the tokens to private investors in Australia and Singapore with a plan to further roll out the scheme in Hong Kong. It has not responded to a CoinDesk enquiry on how much it has raised so far, or whether any of the 75 percent of the total tokens would be further sold to investors.  In both of the jurisdictions in which it has started selling tokens, BPG claimed it received legal advice that the tokens are not deemed as securities, claiming they are not regulated as a financial product under the Corporations Act of Australian law.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) issued regulatory guidance for ICOs in September 2017.  The financial watchdog said at the time ICOs that offer financial products should be regulated under the Corporations Act and gave further details on how it defined such financial products, stating:  ""If the value of the digital coins acquired is affected by the pooling of funds from contributors or use of those funds under the arrangement, then the ICO is likely to fall within the requirements relating to MISs [managed investment schemes]. This is often the case if what is offered through the ICO has the attributes of an investment.""  As of press time, the ASIC has not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment on the BPG case.  It now remains to be seen how the ASX will respond to the letter and whether it will take any action over the listed firm's ICO activity.

The All-Party Innovation Group within the EU Parliament met to examine the potential benefits and issues with rules for ICOs that would form part of a wider crowdfunding framework.  As CoinDesk previously reported  , the proposal was written by Ashley Fox, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Fox called for an 8 million euro cap on token sale proceeds as well as know-your-customer/anti-money laundering requirements.  Perhaps more significantly, if the regulations are adopted by the European Parliament, it could create a standard for token sales, allowing projects to raise funds and conduct business in any of the 28 member-nations.  ""Be assured, that as legislators we're trying to make ICOs more possible and more successful, that certainly is our objective,"" Fox remarked.  Hogan Lovells financial institutions technology partner John Salmon said during the meeting that ""there is an emergency to act"" to create such a standard, explaining that ""the market wants legitimization … from every jurisdiction. In the UK it's particularly bad, none of the banks will bank you if you have crypto.""  He went on to say:  ""Having the certainty, but also having that legitimization, I actually welcome having a European-wide proposal because it gives people the certainty to know. I think we need to be clear whether this is a utility token or a transferable security, or how the regulator regime looks at that, but I think this can be done because an ICO is another form of crowdfunding. It's different, but it is a form of crowdfunding.""  That said, the meeting also saw many of the representatives and regulators highlight the need for stricter scrutiny of ICOs, given the prevalence of scams that employ the blockchain funding model.  Laura Royle of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that ""we certainly do see a huge potential benefit in this space for firms to raise capital from a broad array of investors and without the cost of an intermediary, but there are risks associated [such as] the potential for fraud, with a lack of transparency and the volatility.""  The FCA, in particular, has seen a ""high proportion"" of fraud, she continued, though exact figures are difficult to establish. The regulator estimates that anywhere from 25 to 81 percent of ICOs may result in fraud.  While no clear consensus on a path forward was reached during the meeting, European Parliament members can submit amendments to the proposal by September 11 – thus setting the stage for further debate.
