Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37651618,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52174,1734217208,"XRP Crash Alert Drives Whales to A Hidden Altcoin With 35,000% Upside Potential","The recent XRP price turmoil has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, prompting investors to seek refuge in a hidden altcoin that promises extraordinary returns. As XRP struggles to maintain its market position, with its price plummeting to $2.36 after a 3% drop, many are paying attention to RCO Finance (RCOF) , a hidden altcoin in the market. With predictions of a staggering 35,000% upside potential, RCOF has become the focal point for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the market’s shifting tides. XRP Price Faces Renewed Pressure as Ripple Sells $500 Million The XRP price momentum has taken another hit as Ripple initiated the sale of 200 million XRP from its December reserves, valued at $500 million. This significant sell-off comes at a critical time, with XRP struggling to maintain its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following a sharp correction from its brief ascent to the third spot, the XRP price now battles to regain ground behind Tether’s USDT. Ripple’s substantial selling activity introduces additional downward pressure, potentially dampening the XRP price ability to recover from its recent crash. Despite reaching an all-time high of $2.90 in late November, the token has since slipped to $2.00, driven by dismissed rumors and bearish technical indicators. As Ripple cashes in on its reserves, investors are wary of the token’s ability to rebound. Meanwhile, whales are increasingly shifting their focus to RCO Finance (RCOF), a hidden altcoin with transformative growth potential. What Makes RCO Finance (RCOF) the New Whale Favorite? RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly building attention in decentralized finance (DeFi), capturing investors’ engagement, particularly those looking to pivot from the projected XRP price drop. The platform’s innovative approach combines cutting-edge technology with user-centric features that cater to traders. The RCOF’s AI-powered robo-advisor is arguably the crown jewel of RCO Finance. This sophisticated tool leverages historical data, live market trends, and news events to craft personalized investment strategies tailored to individual users’ financial goals and risk appetites. Unlike traditional advisors, which often require significant fees and human oversight, RCOF’s robo-advisor operates autonomously. It monitors market conditions, adjusting portfolios in real time to mitigate risks. This feature democratizes access to advanced trading strategies, allowing even novice investors to make profits. RCO Finance’s automated market-making (AMM) system complements the robo-advisor. This fully decentralized trading platform utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to execute trades without manual intervention. RCO Finance also addresses a significant gap in the crypto market through its real-world asset integration feature. This functionality allows users to invest directly in stocks, bonds, and real estate using their cryptos, bypassing fiat conversion. Through RCOF bridging the divide between digital currencies and tangible assets, the platform opens up new avenues for portfolio diversification and investment opportunities previously inaccessible to crypto holders. In addition to these standout features, RCO Finance prioritizes security and privacy. The hidden altcoin has undergone rigorous audits by SolidProof , ensuring its smart contracts adhere to industry standards. Furthermore, RCOF does not require KYC procedures, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while trading. RCO FInance (RCOF) Presale Opportunities While the future of the XRP price is currently unknown, savvy investors are excited about the possibilities of the RCOF hidden altcoin presale, which is currently underway. Currently priced at $0.077 per token during Stage 4 of the presale, RCOF offers the substantial potential of up to 700% when the token hits the anticipated $0.6 on the exchanges. Participating in this presale grants access to RCO Finance’s innovative features and positions investors favorably within a rapidly evolving market. Token holders will enjoy various benefits, such as reduced transaction fees, quarterly dividends ranging from 1% to 6%, and exclusive access to AI features. Moreover, early investors can take advantage of promotional bonuses by using codes during their purchase, an initiative to incentivize participation in this promising project. With over $9 million already raised in its presale phase and a growing community of supporters, RCO Finance is poised for explosive growth. For those seeking an opportunity that combines cutting-edge technology with significant upside potential, now is the time to consider investing in RCO Finance (RCOF). As the XRP price faces challenges, RCOF stands ready to deliver unmatched ROI for every investor in the market.

37650097,https://thecoinrise.com/sui-blockchain-and-ant-digital-to-boost-tokenized-esg-assets/,1734216329,Sui Blockchain and Ant Digital to Boost Tokenized ESG Assets,"Sui Blockchain, a top Layer-1 blockchain platform, has teamed up with Ant Digital, the technology division of China’s Ant Group. This partnership aims to use blockchain technology to turn real-world assets (RWAs) into digital forms, focusing mainly on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assets. A Strategic Partnership to Provide Secured Tokenized Assets According to a release , the partnership’s first project involves creating tokenized assets called “notes” linked to a Chinese solar material manufacturer. These notes aim to show the value and sustainability of the company’s operations. This project offers investors a clear and efficient way to support ESG-focused initiatives. Additionally, this initiative responds to the growing demand for sustainable investments, which require transparency and accountability. Meanwhile, Ant Digital, through its blockchain brand ZAN, will play an important role in this effort. ZAN offers advanced blockchain infrastructure and tools that make tokenizing assets in many industries easy. Likewise, the partnership shows how blockchain is changing traditional asset management. By turning real-world ESG assets into digital tokens, Sui Blockchain and Ant Digital use advanced technology to promote sustainability and build trust with investors. Zodia Custody and Securitize to Boost Tokenized Asset Custody Similarly, Zodia Custody formed a strategic partnership with Securitize , a renowned tokenization platform. This partnership is a step towards providing institutional investors with secure, compliant, innovative solutions for managing tokenized assets. Zodia Custody’s CEO, Julian Sawyer, expressed his enthusiasm for the possibilities that tokenization brings to the table. He highlighted that tokenization has the potential to redefine how institutions approach investments. Securitization will play a pivotal role in the partnership, allowing institutional investors to access and trade tokenized assets. Notably, the platform is familiar with facilitating the digital transformation of traditional financial markets. In an interview, Carlos Domingo, the CEO of Securitize, emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and established financial practices. Tokenized Finance: The Future of Asset Management Tokenization transforms financial markets by converting assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. This innovative process introduces higher transparency, faster transactions, and lower costs, appealing to traditional and new-age investors. The tokenized money fund is accessible on a distributed ledger, enabling institutions to conduct real-time transactions and lower settlement risks. Despite these benefits, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have issued critical warnings regarding the pitfalls of tokenization .

37649620,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662561,1734215416,Toncoin Consolidates: Could A Breakout Push TON Higher?,"Toncoin has entered a period of consolidation, with its price moving within a narrow range of $6.2 and $6.5 as the market weighs its next move. As the cryptocurrency stabilizes, will Toncoin break to the upside, setting the stage for a fresh rally, or will it falter and dip lower, testing crucial support levels? This consolidation phase is more than just a pause in price action; it represents a pivotal moment that could determine TON’s next major move. A breakout to the upside could signal renewed positive sentiment, attracting more buyers and fueling a strong upward trend. On the other hand, a breakdown could shift the market sentiment to bearish, with the price heading lower to retest key support zones. In this article, we will explore both scenarios in detail, analyzing the key levels to watch and what a breakout in either direction could mean for Toncoin’s future trajectory. Toncoin Current Range: Understanding The Consolidation Phase As Toncoin consolidates, current price action suggests the potential for a breakout to the upside. The price has shown signs of bullish momentum within the consolidation range, with gradual upward movements indicating increasing buying interest. Related Reading: Toncoin’s 90-Day Returns Turn Positive: Is A Massive Rally On The Horizon? Furthermore, this upward pressure within the range is often a precursor to a breakout, as market participants accumulate positions, anticipating a rise above resistance levels. If this momentum continues to build, it could signal that Toncoin is preparing for a strong move on the upside once the price breaks free from its current consolidation zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently trending above the 50% threshold, indicating that Toncoin is in positive territory and buying pressure is starting to outpace selling activity, which is often a sign of bullish momentum. When the RSI remains above the 50% mark, it suggests that the asset is more likely to experience upward movement as it reflects an increasing number of buyers compared to sellers. Typically, this level is often seen as a key indicator for possible future gains, showing that market sentiment is leaning toward optimism. As the RSI trends higher, the likelihood of a breakout to the upside increases, reinforcing the optimistic outlook for Toncoin. What Happens After A Breakout? Possible Price Targets And Next Steps After a breakout, TON’s direction will hinge on whether the move is upward or downward. If the price breaks higher, it could target the $7.2 resistance level, which could act as an initial hurdle. Breaking above this level successfully would indicate strong bullish momentum, potentially triggering upward movement. In this scenario, the next key resistance level to watch would be $8.3. A move past this point could set Toncoin on a path for additional gains, as it would signal that the bulls are in control and the price may continue to climb toward new highs. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Explodes With 17% Rally — Can TON Sustain The Momentum? On the other hand, if the breakout is to the downside, the price will likely test the $6 support level. A breach of this level could lead to more declines, with subsequent support zones becoming crucial. Conclusively, increased volatility is common, so traders should watch for confirmation signals after a breakout, such as volume and momentum indicators, to gauge the sustainability of the move. The broader market sentiment also plays a significant role in determining the direction and strength of the breakout.

37649920,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52179,1734214657,This Chart Says XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again,"Renowned cryptocurrency analyst XRP Captain has shared an optimistic projection for XRP, suggesting that the digital asset is on the brink of a significant price breakout. In a tweet accompanied by a detailed technical chart, XRP Captain stated, “#XRPHolders It’s Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again.” The chart depicts a series of corrective price movements that culminate in a symmetrical triangle formation, a technical indicator often associated with impending volatility. XRP Captain highlights the completion of Wave E within the triangle, suggesting a bullish move may be imminent. The key resistance level at $2.60 is critical for confirming an upward breakout, while $1.70 is a solid support level to watch in case of a downward move. #XRPHolders It's Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again pic.twitter.com/GQowgoRyi0 — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 13, 2024 Elliott Wave Patterns Signal Potential Breakout The 4-hour chart shared by XRP Captain employs Elliott Wave theory to analyze XRP’s recent price action. This approach categorizes market movements into repetitive wave cycles, providing insight into investor sentiment and potential future trends. The chart indicates two descending structures preceding a symmetrical triangle, a consolidation pattern that precedes a breakout. With Wave E nearing completion, the formation suggests a high likelihood of price expansion. If XRP can surpass the resistance level at $2.60, it could signal a significant rally, while a fall below $1.70 would invalidate this bullish thesis. This technical setup has drawn considerable attention from the XRP community, many of whom view the chart as confirmation of long-term bullish potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Debate Over XRP’s Market Dynamics XRP Captain’s analysis has sparked conversations within the cryptocurrency community about whether XRP will adhere to standard market patterns or diverge due to unique factors. James Hernandez, a prominent member of the XRP community, commented on the tweet, expressing a different view. He argued, “I don’t think standard market trends apply to XRP. I mean they did before, but XRP is about to revolutionize the global financial world. Other factors are going to determine its growth from here.” James’ perspective reflects a broader belief among XRP supporters that the asset’s value is increasingly tied to fundamental developments. Ripple’s progress in securing global financial partnerships and the anticipated conclusion of its legal battle with the SEC are seen as key drivers of XRP’s price, potentially overriding traditional market indicators. What’s Next for XRP? With the start of 2024 approaching, XRP enthusiasts anticipate regulatory clarity and increased adoption to play a pivotal role in determining the asset’s trajectory. XRP Captain’s technical analysis provides a compelling case for bullish momentum. Time will reveal whether the token will adhere to these patterns or if external factors will shape its future. For now, traders and holders are advised to stay vigilant as XRP nears a decisive moment in its market cycle.

37649074,https://crypto.news/?p=14319508,1734214236,MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge,"MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, will officially join the Nasdaq-100 index effective Dec. 23. The company’s inclusion follows an eventful year that saw its stock value increase more than sixfold. The Nasdaq-100 index is up 29.4% in 2024. You might also like: Saylor’s MicroStrategy added $2.1b in Bitcoin What does it mean? Joining the Nasdaq-100 index ranks MicroStrategy, the software company turned Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury, among some of the biggest corporations, including Apple Inc., with a market cap exceeding $3 trillion; Microsoft Corporation, valued at over $2 trillion; NVIDIA Corporation, boasting a market cap surpassing $1 trillion; Amazon.com Inc., with its market cap of around $1.5 trillion; and Alphabet Inc., which has a market cap nearing $1.8 trillion. Other newcomers to the index this year include Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise. This inclusion typically leads to increased stock purchases as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, tracking the index adjust their holdings to reflect the changes. To be included in the Nasdaq-100, a company must meet specific criteria and maintain a position of prominence in the stock market. For MicroStrategy, it’s among the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange based on market capitalization. Inclusion also signifies that the company is among the most valuable and must maintain its stock performance to stay included. Poor performance or a drop in market cap can lead to exclusion, as was the case this year with Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna. MicroStrategy’s transformation The firm began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 as a treasury reserve asset amid declining software business revenue. The strategy has proven remarkably successful, with the company’s market capitalization now approaching $97.94 billion. The firm recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings further, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor announcing the acquisition of 21,550 Bitcoin for approximately $2.1 billion between December 2 and December 8, bringing their total holdings to 423,650 BTC. Bernstein analysts view the Nasdaq-100 inclusion as a stepping stone toward potential S&P 500 inclusion in 2025, suggesting further upside for the company’s stock. The analysts anticipate improved visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows as a result of the index inclusion.MicroStrategy’s stock performance has closely tracked Bitcoin’s price movements, benefiting from the cryptocurrency’s recent surge past $100,000. This rally has been partially attributed to optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s victory and expectations of more favorable regulatory conditions for the crypto sector. The company’s success has redefined corporate treasury management strategies, showcasing the potential benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. MicroStrategy’s approach has lured attention from institutional investors and corporate treasurers. This development represents a major milestone in the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin-focused business strategies, as MicroStrategy becomes one of the few companies with substantial cryptocurrency exposure to join a major stock index. The inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 validates the company’s Bitcoin-centric approach and could encourage other corporations to consider similar strategies for treasury management.

Peter Schiff doubts,"Peter Schiff doubts that 1 million Bitcoins could ever pay off the U.S. national debt, as Bitcoin’s market cap would need to increase by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. He also questions Bitcoin’s global adoption and sees its value increased more by speculation than real demand. Some Bitcoin fans believe that if the U.S. government buys 1 million Bitcoins, it could eventually pay off the massive $36 trillion national debt. However, Peter Schiff doubts this idea, in a recent X post he questioned whether Bitcoin could eventually pay off the $36.25 trillion national debt. For this to happen, Bitcoin’s total value would have to increase significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is priced at around $100,000. So, 1 million Bitcoin at $100,000 per Bitcoin would be worth $100 billion in total, not enough to pay off the U.S. national debt, which is around $36.25 trillion. Peter Schiff doubts Bitcoin’s ability to pay off U.S. National debt Schiff says this isn’t possible, as Bitcoin would have to increase in value by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. Even if Bitcoin’s value increases, the U.S. debt keeps growing. The U.S. government borrows money yearly, so the debt is expected to continue rising. This makes the idea of Bitcoin paying off the debt even harder to believe. Plus, by then the National Debt will be much more than $36.25 trillion, requiring a much higher Bitcoin price to pay it off. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 13, 2024 Peter Schiff has long criticized Bitcoin, saying it lacks value and won’t replace traditional money or assets like gold. He points out Bitcoin’s extreme price swings, making it unreliable for saving or buying everyday things. He believes most Bitcoin buyers are speculating, not using it as money. Schiff also doubts Bitcoin will ever be widely adopted. While its price has grown, Bitcoin still needs to be used as a global currency. Only some countries have accepted it as official money, and most governments resist replacing their currencies with Bitcoin. Schiff believes Bitcoin will always remain the world’s main currency. Some Bitcoin supporters think the cryptocurrency will keep increasing in value as more people adopt it. They believe it could even reach $1 million per coin, making it an alternative to traditional money. However, Schiff sees the idea of Bitcoin paying off the U.S. national debt as highly unlikely. The market cap required for such a scenario is too large, and the growing national debt makes it even less possible. As Peter Schiff says, “ Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and its value is driven by hope, not real demand.” While Bitcoin might continue to grow for some, Schiff believes that paying off the U.S. national debt is just an unrealistic dream.

37648794,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98884,1734213469,Japanese Lawmaker Makes Push For Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"A Japanese lawmaker has called on the government to adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve to be at the fore of global financial innovation. This follows similar efforts by legislators in the United States, Russia, Argentina, and other jurisdictions. As a finite asset, a strategic Bitcoin reserve is key for consumers’ economic benefits and utility in cross-border payments. According to the House of Councilors document, Satoshi Hamada moved towards a Bitcoin Reserve for the government. He described the importance of the country having the top crypto as its national asset. Hamada proposed converting foreign reserves to crypto assets like Bitcoin, pointing to global jurisdictions. The lawmaker cited neutrality and its decentralized nature to prevent any form of control within a particular country. Global trade with Bitcoin is possible without the influence of specific countries. Crypto enthusiasts argue that it creates a fair financial environment for participants. The initial reaction from the crypto community was positive, as holders lauded the recent push by governments toward digital asset adoption. This could spur institutional investment, raising asset prices and driving market innovation. Although Hamada’s party holds only two seats in parliament, there is growing optimism of other lawmakers supporting his views. Japan has taken a mixed approach toward digital asset regulation. Last month, the country proposed a lightweight regulation for crypto intermediaries. As global regulations ramp up, crypto enthusiasts believe the country will be more positive to virtual assets. The United States Effect Recent moves by US lawmakers inspired Hamada to pitch a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ahead of the US elections, Donald Trump backed the crypto industry, pledging positive regulations and ending the present administration’s “ war” on the market. Amongst others, Trump noted that his administration would stop the sale of the nation’s Bitcoin, creating a reserve. US Senator Cynthia Lummis rolled out a bill for a strategic Bitcoin reserve in a related effort. The bill seeks to make the country a Bitcoin power nation as it will acquire 1 million BTC for five years and hold for 20 years. This will offset the growing national debt, which continues to hinder macro conditions in the market. Sen Lummis proposed selling gold reserves to acquire more Bitcoin, sparking an upward trend among bulls. This has led to several jurisdictions setting sights on a strategic BTC reserve to boost fair competition.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/japanese-lawmaker-makes-push-for-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

The complaint names Pinillo and his associated businesses, Solanofi, Solano Partners Ltd., and Solano Capital Investments, collectively known as the Solanofi entities, as the defendants. Details of The Lawsuit According to a December 10 release from the CFTC, Pinillo targeted at least 1,515 individuals in the United States, including members of his Spanish-speaking congregation. The complaint alleges that he misused his position as a trusted church pastor to promote his deceptive scheme. He claimed to be the CEO of Solanofi, an automated trading platform that offered risk-free profits through high-performance trading of crypto assets. Pinillo falsely advertised guaranteed monthly returns of up to 34.9% and assured participants that the platform was secure and reliable. The pastor gave participants access to an online dashboard showing fake account balances and profits to make the scheme appear legitimate. He also encouraged customers to involve friends and family by offering a 15% referral fee for recruiting new people. However, the document states that there was no trading platform, no trades occurred, and no profits were generated. Instead, Pinillo allegedly misappropriated all funds provided by customers. The lawsuit further claims that the accused failed to disclose critical information when seeking clients. Among the omissions, he did not inform customers that the Solanofi entities were shams, the trading platform was non-existent, and the online account statements were falsified. Additionally, he used the funds from new participants to pay earlier ones in what the CFTC described as a classic Ponzi scheme. Restitution and Similar Cases Following the enforcement action, the regulator is seeking restitution for defrauded participants, the return of misappropriated funds, civil monetary penalties, trading bans, and a permanent injunction to prevent further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and related rules. The case against Pinillo is the latest in a growing number of such schemes in the crypto industry. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that 17 individuals were responsible for a $300 million Ponzi scheme that targeted more than 40,000 Latino investors through a program called CryptoFX. In August, the financial watchdog also brought complaints against two Georgia brothers accused of defrauding over 80 investors in a $60 million bogus multilevel plan. The same month, NovaTech Ltd. was charged with operating a fake operation that raised over $650 million from more than 200,000 investors, including many in the Haitian-American community.

This month, the spotlight is shining on three heavy hitters: BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Bone ShibaSwap. These projects are stirring up FOMO across the crypto space faster than a Tim Hortons queue on a Monday morning. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just looking to park your loonies somewhere promising, you’ll want to stick around for this. Let’s start with a quick hat tip to BTFD Coin , the absolute headliner of meme coin presales this month. Sitting pretty in its 10th presale stage, this rising star has already raked in over $3.8 million, sold 54 billion tokens, and amassed a loyal community of over 5,100 Bulls. When a project hits a cool million in under ten days, you know it’s not just riding the hype—it’s making waves. BTFD Coin: A Movement Wrapped in Memes If there’s one word to describe BTFD Coin, it’s “momentum.” Short for “Buy The Dip,” this Ethereum-based gem champions a fearless approach to market downturns, rallying a community ready to seize the dips like a Canuck hitting the slopes. The Bulls Squad—four vibrant mascots, including Baby Bull and Nerdy Bull—aren’t just cute branding; they’re symbols of a strong community that’s already carved out its space in the meme coin cosmos. Add to that a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game where players earn BTFD tokens and a staking APY of 90%, and you’re looking at utility far beyond the average meme coin. But let’s talk tokenomics, because this isn’t some fly-by-night operation. With nearly half its supply allocated to presale and a long-term liquidity lock of three years, BTFD Coin is structured for sustainability. And the best part? The presale isn’t slowing down. With every stage bringing fresh buzz, the FOMO here is as real as watching your favourite poutine joint run out of gravy. Dogs: Barking Up the Right Tree Ah, Dogs, a meme coin that’s all about man’s best friend—but with a crypto twist. While Dogs hasn’t reached the mainstream heights of some of its canine counterparts (looking at you, Dogecoin), it’s carving its niche by sticking close to its community. Dogs boasts a decentralised governance model that gives its holders a real say in the project’s future. It’s like having your hockey team consult you on the line-up—pretty unheard of, but definitely appreciated. Plus, its meme-worthy charm is backed by utility, including partnerships with animal welfare organisations. Now, isn’t that a tail-wagging bonus? Its roadmap hints at future integrations and even NFT opportunities, which could set it apart in the crowded field of dog-themed cryptos. If you’re looking for a coin with heart, Dogs is worth a shot. Bone ShibaSwap: The Utility Powerhouse If Bone ShibaSwap were a weather forecast, it’d be calling for a blizzard of utility. As part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone plays a pivotal role in ShibaSwap, the ecosystem’s decentralised exchange (DEX). This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the backbone of a project that already commands a cult-like following. Bone isn’t just about trading on ShibaSwap; it’s also a governance token, giving holders voting power on ecosystem proposals. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is. And with the upcoming launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, Bone’s role is set to expand even further. The presale might be over, but the buzz around Bone hasn’t cooled off. Its steady climb in utility and demand makes it a standout in a market full of flash-in-the-pan meme coins. For those who believe in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone is the kind of token that feels more like an investment than a gamble. What’s the Best Move This Month? When it comes to the best new meme coin presales to invest in this month, each of these contenders brings its own flavour to the table. Dogs offers charm and philanthropy, while Bone ShibaSwap is all about utility and governance. But if we’re talking about all-around potential—community, momentum, and unique features—BTFD Coin takes the crown. This is a presale that’s already proving its worth, with strong tokenomics, a thriving community, and features that promise long-term engagement. Whether it’s staking, gaming, or just vibing with the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin has positioned itself as the meme coin to beat. The clock’s ticking, and the BTFD Coin presale won’t last forever. So, grab your chance to ride the wave while the price is still low—because when it takes off, you’ll want to be on board. Don’t miss the boat, eh?

37648791,https://thecoinrise.com/morocco-shifts-to-crypto-embrace-after-years-of-ban/,1734212261,Morocco Shifts to Crypto Embrace After Years of Ban,"The government of Morocco has strategically pivoted from a strict crypto ban to an embrace of digital assets. This surprising turn of event was after the government outlawed the use of crypto in the country in 2017. The decision was part of a global trend in which many countries were skeptical about crypto’s volatile and unregulated nature. The nation is now laying the groundwork to embrace crypto assets and regulate the sector. Morocco Shift in Strategy: From Crypto Ban to Regulation Back then, the government cited financial instability, terrorism financing, and money laundering as the reasons for banning crypto in the country. The decision seemed like the best way to protect the country’s economy. In 2024, Morocco’s financial landscape is now undergoing a profound transformation. The announcement by Bank Al-Maghrib, Morocco’s central bank, to draft crypto regulations marks a pivotal moment. Central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri has confirmed that the draft is under review, signaling a commitment to bringing crypto into the formal economy. This change aligns Morocco with a global trend of evolving digital asset regulations. Countries that were once critical of crypto, including China and Bolivia are now developing frameworks to harness its potential . Interestingly, over 130 nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Morocco’s shift to crypto aims to boost financial inclusion. This is because 42% of the population are still unbanked. Crypto and a future CBDC can bridge this gap. Also smartphones, crypto wallets can enable savings, investments, and cross-border payments. Crypto’s Underground Rise in Morocco Despite the 2017 ban, cryptocurrencies found fertile ground in Morocco’s informal economy. In 2023, the country was ranked among the top 20 globally for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis. It was also listed 13th in Bitcoin usage by Insider Monkey. Ownership of cryptocurrencies steadily climbed, rising from 2.4% of the population in 2021 to 3.1% in 2022. The ban didn’t stop crypto but pushed it into unregulated underground markets without protections. This exposed the need for formal rules to manage risks and unlock its potential. Challenges on the Road Ahead While Morocco’s embrace of crypto holds promise, it comes with significant challenges. The government must establish clear regulations to govern transactions and exchanges. This includes efficient Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures to prevent misuse. Many citizens remain unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies. This makes public education essential to promote understanding and responsible use. To support adoption, Morocco needs reliable technological infrastructure. This includes securing platforms for transactions and better internet access in rural areas. The authorities need to integrate crypto with traditional banking systems to ensure stability and consumer protection. Additionally, stringent cybersecurity measures need to be in place to protect users against fraud and hacking. Also, international collaboration will help Morocco align its policies with global standards and maintain financial integrity.

37647137,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662534,1734210051,Bull Flag Formation Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.15 This Cycle,"Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has highlighted a bullish pattern that has formed on the Dogecoin price chart. Based on this pattern, the analyst predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach as high as $2.15 in this market cycle. Bull Flag Puts The Dogecoin Price Target At $2.15 In an X post, Trader Tardigrade revealed a bull flag that had formed on DOGE’s daily chart. He stated that there is a tight consolidation within the bull flag. The analyst added that a long flagpole projects the Dogecoin price target at $2.15. Interestingly, his accompanying chart showed that the rally to this target could happen before the year ends.

In another X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that a possible Dogecoin scenario has come up with a double-bottom chart pattern. He added that DOGE had formed two equal lows with a resistance at the neckline, which is at around $0.46. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst also recently stated that the Dogecoin price has gained more buying power with a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD). His analysis suggested that Dogecoin could break this resistance at $0.46 and rally to around $0.5 on the next leg of the DOGE bull run. This rally to $0.5 could just be the start of the projected rally to $2.15 based on the bull flag on the Dogecoin price chart. It is worth mentioning that Trader Tardigrade has before now provided more bullish predictions for Dogecoin in this market cycle. The analyst predicted that DOGE could reach as high as $30 in this cycle while advising market participants to start taking profits around $10. What The Next Move Could Look Like Crypto analyst KrissPax provided insights into what the next move up for the Dogecoin price could look like. He stated that following the double-bottom pattern on DOGE’s chart, a fractal from past price action shows a possible move up through Monday, followed by an upward trend until Christmas. However, the crypto analyst cautioned that there will be dips along the way. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market Meanwhile, like Trader Tardigrade, KrissPax also highlighted the bull flag that has formed on DOGE’s daily chart. He stated that this bullish pattern points to the Dogecoin price reaching $0.69 by the end of the year. This would break Dogecoin close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.73. Crypto whales look to be positioning themselves for this Dogecoin price rally. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that these investors bought 160 million DOGE in 24 hours. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.4, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

37650398,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319551,1734209957,"Japanese Lawmaker Named Satoshi Proposes BTC Reserve – Is $150,000 Bitcoin Price Possible in December?","Bitcoin price remains on a strong upward trajectory, currently trading around $100,860 and reaching an intra-day high of $102,577. This growth reflects broader market bullishness and increased institutional interest in Bitcoin as a financial asset. Key drivers include MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 and global discussions on national Bitcoin reserves. Moreover, Japan is considering creating a national Bitcoin reserve, signaling that countries are starting to see Bitcoin as an important financial asset. This recognition could increase demand for Bitcoin and strengthen its role in global financial strategies, further supporting its price growth. National BTC Reserves: A Global Push Underpin Bitcoin Price A notable development comes from Japan, where lawmaker Satoshi Hamada has proposed establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Submitted to Japan’s National Diet on December 11, this initiative aims to position Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. JAPAN IS CONSIDERING A STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE PROPOSED BY MP NAMED SATOSHI pic.twitter.com/n93vixWPm7 — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) December 13, 2024 While Hamada’s party holds limited influence, support from key political figures like Yuichiro Tamaki, leader of the Democratic Party for the People, could lend momentum. Tamaki has previously advocated for crypto-friendly tax reforms and regulatory improvements, signaling a potential shift in Japan’s stance on Bitcoin. #メタプラネット #metaplanet @Metaplanet_JP #BTC Japanese lawmaker asks government yo create national bitcoin reserve pic.twitter.com/YfTHp1eJgt — meow (@foorpfokrow) December 13, 2024 Globally, other nations are also exploring similar initiatives. In the U.S., discussions include proposals like Senator Cynthia Lummis’s plan for the Treasury to acquire 1 million Bitcoins within five years, and Texas’s push for a state Bitcoin reserve. Brazil and Poland have introduced similar legislative efforts. These moves signal Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a strategic asset, driving demand and enhancing investor confidence. MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq-100 Inclusion and Implications MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, will join the Nasdaq-100 on December 23, becoming the first Bitcoin-focused company in this elite index. This milestone aligns MicroStrategy with major firms like Apple and Tesla, increasing Bitcoin’s visibility among institutional investors. MicroStrategy joins Nasdaq 100—passive index funds are coming for bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/VSF8vIuIef — Joe Burnett, MSBA ( )³ (@IIICapital) December 14, 2024 Analysts estimate that ETFs linked to the Nasdaq-100, such as Invesco’s QQQ, could allocate up to $2.1 billion to MicroStrategy, boosting its stock price and indirectly increasing exposure to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, led by Michael Saylor, has positioned the company as a key advocate for Bitcoin adoption. The firm holds $42 billion worth of Bitcoin, and its Nasdaq-100 inclusion is seen as a validation of its approach. However, experts caution that MicroStrategy’s heavy Bitcoin exposure could lead to a reclassification as a financial firm, potentially disqualifying it from the index. Despite this risk, the move has already pushed Bitcoin price above $102,000 and MicroStrategy’s stock past $400. Broader Implications for Bitcoin The growing adoption of Bitcoin as a national reserve and increased exposure through institutional channels like the Nasdaq-100 highlight its evolution into a mainstream financial asset. These developments are driving demand and reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in global financial strategies, making it a central figure in the cryptocurrency market’s ongoing growth. As nations and corporations deepen their engagement with Bitcoin, its trajectory as a valuable and strategic asset appears increasingly solidified. Bitcoin Price Holds Key Support Near $100,860; Rising Channel Pattern Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $100,860, showing a minor decline of 0.46% in the last session. The chart reveals a rising channel pattern, with Bitcoin testing key support near $100,800. A break below this level could lead to further downside toward $99,736 and $99,000, with stronger support seen at $97,349. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $101,404, followed by $102,617 and $103,661. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53.13 indicates neutral momentum, though a dip below 50 could signal increased bearish pressure. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $99,689 is acting as a dynamic support level, reinforcing the ongoing trend. For now, Bitcoin’s technical outlook suggests cautious optimism, as it remains within its ascending channel. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 $STARS Presale Surges Past $16.8M: Final Days to Participate Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is redefining staking for meme coin holders with its innovative MemeVault platform.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

In a recent statement, Morehead outlined the advantages of Bitcoin over traditional reserve assets and highlighted its potential role in US economic policy. Morehead began his remarks by addressing the US’s dependence on gold as a reserve asset. “The United States stores $600 billion worth of gold,” Morehead said, adding that this amount is equivalent to 11 million years of American wages. Despite its historical importance, Morehead argued that gold is becoming obsolete as a reserve asset in the digital age. Turning to Bitcoin, Morehead described it as a “much better” store of value than gold. He noted that Bitcoin’s digital nature, rarity and global accessibility make it a more efficient and forward-looking reserve asset. “Go to digital gold, go to Bitcoin, it’s much better,” he said. Related News: Donald Trump's Altcoin Portfolio Has Major Shifts - Here's the Latest After the Volatility Morehead also explained that the US currently owns about 1% of the world’s Bitcoin supply, which he believes is both a strategic and rational position. “Keep it, increase it,” Morehead advised, adding that it would be a positive policy decision for the US to expand its Bitcoin holdings. He also noted that other countries have already started owning Bitcoin, indicating that the US should take the lead in adopting BTC as part of its reserve strategy. *This is not investment advice.

37646737,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627631,1734208241,Why is Bitcoin superior to gold in every way? Saifedean Ammous explains,"American economist Saifedean Ammous argues that Bitcoin is superior to gold because it has a fixed supply, is digital, and is not controlled by governments, making it a better store of value and a solution to inflation and debt issues in today’s financial systems. Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard , argues in a recent interview that Bitcoin is superior to gold. He believes Bitcoin is a revolutionary form of money. Its fixed supply and decentralized nature make it more reliable than gold. “That’s what #Bitcoin fixes. If we go back to having a HARD money where money is no longer debt, we no longer need to be monetizing debt. We no longer need to get everyone to become a debt slave in order for us to have a form of money.” – @saifedean w/ @JoeSquawk 🎯 pic.twitter.com/Tb3HLT2n4o — Walker⚡️ (@WalkerAmerica) December 13, 2024 Bitcoin vs. gold Ammous explains that while gold has historically been used as money due to its scarcity and store of value properties, Bitcoin has taken these qualities to a new level. “Gold has been used for 4,000 years because it stores value well. But the problem with Gold is that it’s not as scarce as Bitcoin,” Ammous states. “The annual increase in gold supply is around 1.5% to 2%, whereas Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million, and its annual supply growth rate is even lower—about 0.8% during its current four-year period,” he added. On e of the advantages Bitcoin has over gold is its fixed supply, which is set in stone. “ There’s only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoin. That’s it. It’s a simple fact, and no other form of money can claim such a property,” Ammous continues. This scarcity makes Bitcoin a somewhat deflationary asset, unlike fiat currencies that governments can print in unlimited quantities. Am mous believes this unique property makes Bitcoin a much stronger store of value compared to gold or any government-issued currency. Another key difference is how Bitcoin operates. While gold relies on physical storage and transport, Bitcoin is purely digital, meaning it can be transferred and stored globally without needing physical handling. “Bitcoin is just software. It doesn’t require a legal framework that is tied to government-backed currencies. It’s decentralized and automated,” Ammous points out. He contrasts this with fiat money, which is deeply intertwined with government control and monetary policy. Why Bitcoin is the future of money Ammous also highlights the importance of Bitcoin’s ability to prevent inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which lose value over time as central banks print more money, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it impervious to inflationary pressures. “In the world of fiat, governments continuously increase the supply of money, which leads to a decrease in its value,” he explains. “In the case of Bitcoin, no one can just print more. It’s a money that cannot be inflated.” Ammous stresses the issue of debt in today’s financial systems. “Fiat money is built on the concept of debt. Every time the government needs more money, they increase the currency supply, essentially creating more debt,” he states. This creates a cycle of borrowing and inflation that benefits the government but harms everyday citizens who watch their savings lose value. In contrast, Bitcoin provides a way out of this system. “With Bitcoin, you don’t need to be in debt to participate in the economy. It’s a form of money that doesn’t require borrowing or printing,” he says. The economist believes that Bitcoin’s technological advantages and fixed supply make it the ideal money for the modern age. “B itcoin is a form of money that is more scarce, portable, and secure than gold,” he concludes. “It offers a solution to the problems caused by fiat currencies and offers a future where money is no longer tied to government debt and manipulation.” With more people realizing Bitcoin’s revolutionary potential, its value continues to rise as a monetary asset that will outlast and outperform gold in the coming years.

In a recent statement, the company has made its intentions clear. The Fake Filing That Fueled the Hype In a dramatic turn of events last year, the XRP community was electrified when a supposed XRP ETF filing attributed to BlackRock surfaced on the State of Delaware’s website. The news sent XRP’s price soaring by over 13% in a matter of days . However, BlackRock quickly denied the claim, reaffirming that the filing was untrue. Despite this hoax news, the idea of BlackRock entering the XRP ETF market has remained a point of speculation within the crypto community. BlackRock Remain Focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum In a recent interview, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s Head of the ETF Department revealed BlackRock’s stance on launching an XRP ETF. Jacobs mentioned that for now BlackRock’s focus remains firmly on its existing crypto ETFs. Earlier this year, the company launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Impressively these investment products have achieved massive inflows of $35.88 billion and $3.19 billion, respectively. These numbers shows BlackRock’s dominance in the ETF space and its ability to attract institutional and retail investors alike. Jacobs pointed out that despite the significant success of these ETFs, it is yet to be widely adopted. He noted that only a small percentage of BlackRock’s clients currently hold shares of its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As a result, the firm’s immediate priority is expanding the accessibility of these products. While Jacobs did not rule out future altcoin ETFs, he made it clear that XRP is not on the company’s current radar. XRP ETF Applications and the SEC: What’s Next? While BlackRock may not be interested in an XRP ETF at the moment, other firms are pushing ahead. Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares , and WisdomTree have all filed applications with the SEC. These firms are hoping to pioneer the first XRP ETF in the United States. The growing anticipation for an approval is fueled by the potential for a pro-crypto shift in the U.S. government. This is particularly after Donald Trump’s reelection and his appointment of a new SEC chairman with a more favorable stance on cryptocurrencies. These developments have fueled speculation that an XRP ETF could be approved as early as next year. However, whether the SEC will give the green light to any of the current XRP ETF proposals remains uncertain. Given the SEC’s previous cautious approach to cryptocurrency-related financial products, the approval process could take longer than anticipated. The XRP community is closely watching how the situation unfolds and whether BlackRock might change its stance to join the XRP ETF race.

The December 11 ruling by the United States District Court for the Central District of California also included prison sentences for three of the defendants. Operating between 2018 and 2019, IcomTech marketed itself as a cryptocurrency platform offering daily returns of up to 2.8%. Investors were convinced their funds were being used for cryptocurrency trading and mining, facilitated through “Icoms,” a proprietary token. However, investigators found no evidence of such activities. Instead, the defendants misused the funds for personal expenses, including luxury goods and high-end vacations. David Carmona, the leader of the scheme, alongside his partner David Brend, received 10-year prison sentences. Another conspirator, Marco A. Ruiz Ochoa, was sentenced to five years. Two additional defendants, Juan Arellano Parra and Moses Valdez, were held accountable through financial penalties and were permanently banned from engaging in any CFTC-regulated activities. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began its investigation into IcomTech in 2023 after complaints from defrauded investors. The case highlighted a common pattern in cryptocurrency fraud, where victims are enticed by promises of outsized returns and persuaded to recruit others, fueling a cycle of deception. The court also ordered the forfeiture of more than $1.2 million in assets linked to the defendants. Despite this recovery, many victims are unlikely to recoup their full losses.

Render ($RENDER) and Altura ($ALU) are two popular tokens attracting significant attention. While both projects show great promise, understanding their strengths, growth potential, and market positioning can help investors make informed decisions. Let’s dive into the unique qualities of these tokens and why Altura could be the better investment for those looking for massive upside potential. What is Render ($RENDER)? Render Network is a decentralized GPU rendering platform built to provide creators and developers with cost-effective, scalable rendering solutions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Render allows users to connect their idle GPUs to the network, facilitating 3D rendering tasks for industries like gaming, film, and virtual reality.

Adoption in Web3 and Metaverse: As the metaverse grows, Render is well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand for 3D content. Potential Upside: While Render has a strong use case and established market presence, its current market cap suggests that it’s closer to maturity compared to smaller-cap coins. This positions $RENDER for a likely 2-3x return in the next market cycle, a solid but relatively moderate gain for crypto investors seeking exponential returns. What is Altura ($ALU)? Altura is a blockchain platform designed to enable game developers to integrate blockchain-powered features like NFTs and in-game assets into their games. Altura’s platform has gained traction for its ability to simplify smart contract integration, making blockchain adoption easier for game studios. Strengths of Altura ($ALU): 1. AI-Driven Innovations: Altura’s integration of AI within gaming and NFT ecosystems sets it apart, allowing developers to create more intelligent and adaptive in-game experiences. This AI focus places Altura in a unique position within the Web3 gaming market.2. Gaming Industry Focus: As the gaming industry continues to grow and embrace blockchain technology, Altura is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend.3. Smaller Market Cap: With a significantly lower market cap compared to Render, Altura offers higher upside potential for investors looking to maximize returns. Why Altura ($ALU) is More Bullish: While Render is a more established project, Altura’s lower market cap makes it a much better opportunity for exponential growth. With innovative use cases in gaming, NFTs, and AI, Altura has the potential to 8x, 10x, or even achieve 20x returns during the next bull market. The growth potential is amplified by the increasing adoption of blockchain within the gaming industry, making Altura one of the most promising tokens in the space. Head-to-Head Comparison: $RENDER vs $ALU Why Altura ($ALU) Offers Greater Investment Potential Altura’s smaller market cap and focus on blockchain gaming, a rapidly growing industry, give it a significant advantage for exponential returns. Unlike Render, which is already well-established, Altura is in its early stages and has the potential to capture significant market share as blockchain gaming adoption accelerates. Furthermore, Altura’s integration of AI into its platform makes it a pioneer in bringing cutting-edge technology to the gaming and NFT ecosystems. This innovative edge, coupled with its current undervaluation, positions Altura as a standout choice for high-risk, high-reward investors. Final Verdict: $RENDER or $ALU? While Render ($RENDER) is a solid investment with a proven use case and steady growth potential, Altura ($ALU) is the clear winner for those seeking 10x or higher returns. Altura’s lower market cap, focus on AI-powered gaming, and immense growth potential make it a more attractive investment for the next bull market. For investors with a higher risk tolerance and a desire for exponential returns, Altura($ALU ) offers an unparalleled opportunity to capitalize on the growing blockchain gaming and AI integration trends. However, as with all investments, proper research and risk management are essential. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

You Get a Do-Over With BTFD Coin,"It’s the classic crypto tale: you heard whispers about Shiba Inu’s ICO but didn’t pounce. Fast forward to today, and those who did are out there buying Lambos while you’re here shaking your fist at missed opportunities. It’s the kind of “what-if” that keeps you up at night. But here’s the thing—crypto has a knack for giving second chances. Enter BTFD Coin, making headlines with its presale, already raking in over $3.8M in under two weeks and selling billions of tokens. Think you’ve missed your shot at crypto greatness? Think again. BTFD Coin is here, armed with utility, an army of Bulls, and a presale price that screams, “Get in now!” Shiba Inu: The FOMO Factory Let’s rewind to Shiba Inu’s ICO. Back then, it was just another “joke” coin with big dreams. It hit the market quietly, and those who scooped it up for peanuts are now the legends of Reddit threads and moonshot memes. It wasn’t just about timing—it was about seeing potential where others saw absurdity. But here’s the cruel twist: not everyone believed the hype. While Shiba Inu was busy turning early adopters into overnight millionaires, the rest of us were on the sidelines, watching in disbelief. What started as an investment of $0.000000000056 per token (a fraction of a dollar), ballooned to $0.00003791 within only one year! It’s the quintessential crypto heartbreak—a potent cocktail of regret and FOMO served with a side of hindsight. BTFD Coin: Your Comeback Story Starts Here If you missed out on Shiba, don’t sweat it. The universe is handing you a redo in the form of BTFD Coin. This isn’t just another meme coin riding the crypto wave—it’s a full-blown ecosystem designed for investors who know how to spot value. Between its 90% staking APY , a Play-to-Earn game that’s actually fun (and profitable), and a presale price sitting pretty at $0.0001, this coin isn’t playing around. Let’s talk investments. Say you throw $5,500 into the presale. That nets you 55 million BTFD tokens. Now, here’s where it gets exciting. If BTFD Coin hits its projected post-launch price of $0.0006, your $5,500 investment rockets to $33,000. That’s a 6x return for believing in the power of the dip. And with a community as dedicated as the Bulls Squad backing this project, that projection doesn’t feel far-fetched—it feels inevitable. The presale is just the beginning. With a fixed percentage of tokens reserved for this stage, every dollar invested now could grow exponentially as demand soars. It’s not just an investment; it’s your ticket to the next big thing in crypto. Why BTFD Coin Is Different (Top Reasons to Invest) What sets BTFD Coin apart from the meme coin herd? First, it’s a meme with meaning. The whole “Buy the Dip” ethos resonates with anyone who’s been in the market long enough to see red days as opportunities, not setbacks. Add in Ethereum-backed security, a meticulously planned roadmap, and a bullish community that’s ready to take this token to the stratosphere, and you’ve got a recipe for success. And let’s not forget the Bulls Squad —a cast of characters that bring personality and fun to the project. From Baby Bull to Raging Bull, these mascots aren’t just cute; they’re part of a brand strategy that’s building loyalty and excitement around the coin. Final Thoughts: The FOMO Cure You’ve Been Waiting For BTFD Coin isn’t just a second chance; it’s a whole new ballgame. With features that cater to both seasoned investors and crypto newbies, it’s carving out a niche that’s equal parts fun and functional. So, if Shiba Inu’s rise left you feeling like you missed the train, consider this your golden ticket. Don’t let this one pass you by. The BTFD Coin presale is live now, and those $0.0001 tokens aren’t going to stick around forever. Secure your spot today, and who knows? You could be the next big success story people are kicking themselves for not joining sooner.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is charging Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MSSB) for failing to adopt measures and policies that could have prevented four ex-financial advisors from draining client funds. Between May 2015 and July 2022, the SEC says the former financial advisors in question initiated hundreds of transfers from customer accounts to accounts they controlled for personal gain. The SEC says MSSB had no system in place to catch financial advisors that control clients’ accounts from fraudulently listing their own names as beneficiaries of Automatic Clearing House (ACH) payment instructions. The deficiency allowed the former employees to extract millions of dollars from client accounts without getting detected. According to the SEC, MSSB’s failure to reasonably supervise its former employees constitutes a violation of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Says Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, “Safeguarding investor assets is a fundamental duty of every financial services firm, but MSSB’s supervisory and compliance policy failures let its financial advisors make hundreds of unauthorized transfers from their customer and client accounts and put many other such accounts at significant risk of harm.” MSSB agrees to pay $15 million in fines without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations. The firm also consents to a cease-and-desist order and a censure while allowing a compliance consultant to review the policies and procedures involved in the release of funds from customer accounts. Morgan Stanley also compensated all customers affected for their losses.

37645768,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627628,1734206449,XRP leads the Trump trade bull run. But can it actually sustain it?,"XRP has skyrocketed 370% since Donald Trump’s election victory, taking the lead in what’s now being dubbed the “Trump trade bull run.” Bitcoin, for all its clout, has only climbed 46%, and the broader crypto market, measured by the CoinDesk 20 index, has risen 93%. XRP blew past Solana, claiming the third spot in market value, sitting behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Matt Hougan from Bitwise Asset Management called it logical. “The asset that’s been at the front of the Peloton taking the regulatory headwinds has been XRP,” he said, adding that if regulation flips from a headwind to a tailwind, XRP stands to gain the most. Whether you’re an XRP fan or not, the numbers don’t lie. But the rally is more than numbers; it’s a loud victory lap for XRP’s hardcore supporters, who stayed loyal even when Ripple, XRP’s parent company, was locked in a brutal legal brawl with the SEC. From courtroom clashes to ETF dreams XRP was created in 2012 as the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain powering Ripple’s cross-border payments system. The irony? While Ripple focuses on global transactions, 95% of its business happens outside the U.S. Ripple also happens to hold the majority of XRP’s supply, which makes things interesting when regulation gets involved. The SEC battle has been a headache for years. Last summer, the drama hit its peak. A judge ruled that XRP wasn’t a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges but was an unregistered security offering when sold to institutional investors. It’s a win, sort of, but it cleared the air enough for XRP to thrive. Now, heavy hitters like Bitwise, WisdomTree, and 21Shares are lining up to launch XRP-backed ETFs. That’s one reason XRP is now the third-largest crypto, but size alone doesn’t guarantee a future. Alex Thorn from Galaxy Digital isn’t sold. He called XRP a “blast from the past” and questioned whether it’s anything more than clever marketing. “It’s never really had a clear product-market fit,” he said , pointing out its low liquidity and bloated valuation. What’s driving XRP’s wild ride? XRP’s secret sauce might be its unique consensus mechanism. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-hogging proof-of-work or Ethereum’s proof-of-stake, XRP uses a cheaper, more efficient method. Hougan pointed to this as a core strength, saying it’s a reason XRP has survived boom-and-bust cycles that would’ve buried less resilient projects. “This technology works and functions with a low underlying cost,” he said. The problem? XRP’s real-world use hasn’t taken off like its backers hoped. Critics argue that Ripple’s focus on business-to-business solutions puts it in a weird spot, especially when regulators had a sword hanging over its head. Now that the SEC drama has cooled, XRP has a rare chance to show what it can do in an “unfettered environment.” But as Hougan put it, nobody knows for sure what that will look like — or if the market will even care. On the charts, XRP is testing nerves. After hitting resistance on December 12, it fell back to $2.11, its 20-day EMA. Bulls quickly stepped in, snapping up the dip and pushing prices toward $2.65. If it breaks that level, the next stop could be $2.91. Above that, the rally could extend to $3.50. Bears, however, are circling at $2.91, ready to fight tooth and nail to keep it from going higher. On the flip side, XRP’s 20-day EMA and the $1.90 Fibonacci retracement level are acting as strong safety nets. If the bears manage to drag it below those levels, things could get bad fast.

For the past few days, the overall cryptocurrency market has been quite confusing, raising concerns about whether the price will rally or decline. However, at this moment it is unpredictable for forecasting price, although the DOGE daily chart has formed a bearish price action. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, DOGE is currently at a crucial support level of $0.383, after breaking out from an ascending triangle price action pattern. With the recent ups and downs, along with significant volatility, DOGE has successfully retested the breakdown level and is currently receiving support. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, if DOGE fails to hold this support level and closes a daily candle below the $0.38 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 15% to reach the $0.31 level in the coming days. However, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 50, which is far from the overbought region, indicating a potential price reversal in the coming days. 83.68% DOGE Traders Holds Long Positions Besides the bearish technical analysis, it appears that traders are the ones keeping DOGE at the $0.383 support level, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the Binance DOGEUSDT Long/Short ratio currently stands at 5.13, indicating strong bullish market sentiment among traders. Source: Coinglass Additionally, data reveals that currently, 83.68% of top Binance traders hold long positions, while 16.32% hold short positions. When combining these on-chain metrics with the technical analysis, it appears that bulls are currently trying to keep the price above the crucial support level and prevent further price decline. DOGE Current Price Momentum At press time, DOGE is trading near $0.39 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.65% in the past 24 hours.

Analysts have noted that MicroStrategy’s decision to purchase bitcoin to protect the value of its reserve assets has enhanced the appeal of its stock, which also aligns with Bitcoin’s performance. Bernstein analysts expect that the market will likely set its sights on S&P 500 inclusion for MicroStrategy in 2025 following the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Further, the brokerage also sees the company’s prospects continuing to improve next year, and it also expects more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Is MARA Next In Line? Interestingly, Michael Saylor shared his insights on the X platform, forecasting that the Bitcoin mining company MARA could be the next addition to the Nasdaq 100 index. Saylor’s statement highlights the growing influence and recognition of cryptocurrency-related companies in traditional financial markets. Congratulations to $MSTR and @saylor for being the first #bitcoin treasury company to join the NASDAQ 100. https://t.co/UFvbPFFhr2 — Fred Thiel (@fgthiel) December 14, 2024 Notably, Fred Thiel, the Chairman and CEO at MARA Holdings congratulated MSTR on the listing. He highlighted MicroStrategy as the first bitcoin treasury company to join the NASDAQ 100. In response, Saylor noted that he expects MARA Holdings to join the prestigious Nasdaq-100 list soon. Are MARA’s Chances Higher? Both companies are strengthening their treasury reserves with large Bitcoin purchases. Despite having different business models, their strong focus on BTC connects them. This month, MARA Holdings has raised over $700 million through a private note offering. Although MARA Holdings is relatively far from bagging such a listing, CEO Thiel noted that the firm is working hard to achieve a similar landmark. Shift in Investor’s View Despite numerous firms now embracing a Bitcoin-first strategy, Michael Saylor likely sees MARA’s chances of meeting the goals as high considering its current stock performance. The potential inclusion of MARA in the Nasdaq 100 would mark a significant milestone for the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry, reflecting its integration into mainstream financial indices. As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, the inclusion of companies like MARA in major indices could signal a shift in how traditional investors view and engage with digital currencies and their infrastructure.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/mara-next-in-line-for-nasdaq-listing-michael-saylor-hints/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

BONK: Solana’s community-focused Shiba Inu meme coin BONK is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens to users. The coin surged over 100% following its listing on Coinbase. As a “community coin,” BONK airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi ecosystems. By October 2023, BONK had become a significant player among meme coins, integrating into the Solana ecosystem and contributing to the development of decentralized applications. The launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, showcases its technological potential. BONK’s active role in a growing dApp ecosystem may make it an interesting option in the current market cycle. Floki: From meme coin to utility token with real-world applications Floki is a cryptocurrency inspired by Elon Musk’s 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu dog “Floki”. Although it started as a meme coin, Floki has developed into a project with real utility and charitable aims. The Floki ecosystem includes projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and the DeFi service FlokiFi. These additions enhance its use beyond speculation. Floki has partnered with NOWPayments and offers a prepaid Floki Card, allowing users to make real-world transactions with FLOKI tokens. Its efforts to build schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria reflect its commitment to social impact. Considering its expanding ecosystem and recognition as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki may be attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion BONK and FLOKI may have less short-term potential, but Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale, it starts at $0.0002 and rises to $0.0016 over 14 stages.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-gold-elongold-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-and-shib-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Expect a 30% correction, warns VanEck","VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, has outlined a detailed forecast for the cryptocurrency market through 2025. Sigel predicted Friday that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will reach $180,000 in the first quarter before experiencing a correction. The analysis projects Ethereum ( ETH ) reaching beyond $6,000, while coins like Solana ( SOL ) and Sui ( SUI ) could achieve $500 and $10, respectively. Sigel anticipates this initial peak will be followed by a market correction, with Bitcoin pulling back 30% and altcoins experiencing deeper declines of up to 60% during the summer months. To identify potential market tops, Sigel highlights several key indicators for investors to monitor. The research points to sustained high funding rates as a crucial signal. You might also like: NFT sales spike to $224m, Pudgy Penguins sales surge 50% He noted that when traders consistently pay funding rates above 10% for three months or longer to bet on Bitcoin price increases, it typically indicates excessive speculation in the market. The analysis also emphasizes the importance of tracking unrealized profits among Bitcoin holders. When a large proportion of holders maintain paper gains with a profit-to-cost ratio exceeding 70%, it often signals market euphoria. Bitcoin’s market dominance serves as another critical indicator. Sigel warns that a drop below 40% could signal excessive speculation in altcoins, typical of late-cycle market behavior. The research attributes current market momentum largely to Donald Trump’s election victory and his administration’s projected appointments. The anticipated crypto-friendly leadership team, including JD Vance as VP and Paul Atkins as SEC Chair, suggests a shift from previous restrictive policies toward a framework that positions Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Following the summer correction, Sigel forecasts a market recovery in fall 2025. Major cryptocurrencies will likely reclaim their previous all-time highs by year-end. This projection assumes continued institutional adoption and supportive regulatory developments under the new administration. This market outlook provides investors with specific price targets and warning signals to monitor, while acknowledging the impact of political developments on the crypto market.

The firm expects market dips mid-year but forecasts a recovery by late 2025. Growing institutional adoption, government Bitcoin reserves, stablecoins, and AI-powered tech will drive further integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. VanEck, an asset management firm, predicts strong crypto growth in 2025, with Bitcoin reaching $180,000 and Ethereum surpassing $6,000. Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) could also see major gains, with Sui potentially hitting $10, which reflects a bullish market outlook.

By late 2025, the market is expected to recover, with major cryptocurrencies hitting new highs. VanEck highlights key signs of a market peak and possible correction. High funding rates in Bitcoin futures, staying above 10% for three months, could signal the market is overheating. Similarly, if many Bitcoin holders have over 70% unrealized profits, it may indicate market excitement and a likely price drop ahead. VanEck points out more signs of a market peak. If the MVRV ratio goes above 5, it could mean Bitcoin is overvalued. A drop in Bitcoin’s market shares below 40% might show investors are favoring riskier altcoins, signaling the end of a bull run. Lastly, when inexperienced investors pour into speculative assets, it could mean a market bubble is nearer. VanEck 🤝10 Crypto Predictions for 2025 Prediction #1: Crypto bull market hits a medium-term peak in Q1, sets new highs in Q4. We project Bitcoin to be valued at around $180,000, Ethereum to trade above $6,000, Solana to exceed $500, and Sui to surpass $10. — VanEck (@vaneck_us) December 13, 2024 Bitcoin’s acceptance Bitcoin’s acceptance could increase the crypto market, especially in the U.S., VanEck predicts that governments and institutions might start holding Bitcoin reserves. Donald Trump is poised to lead Bitcoin-friendly policies in the United States when he assumes the office of the president. States like Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania are already showing interest in exploring Bitcoin investments. The shift toward Bitcoin isn’t just in the U.S. Countries like Russia and Canada are also exploring Bitcoin reserves to protect against unstable fiat currencies. Vancouver has even approved a Bitcoin reserve to guard against inflation and market changes, showing growing global trust in Bitcoin’s value. The role of stablecoins and institutional adoption Stablecoins, digital currencies backed by assets like the U.S. dollar, are set to drive significant growth in the crypto market. VanEck predicts that daily stablecoin settlement volumes will increase from $100 billion to $300 billion by the end of 2025. This surge will encourage the broader adoption of blockchain technology in payments and financial services, making it a key component of the global financial system. Institutional interest in Bitcoin is also accelerating, with major players like ARK Invest projecting its value could surpass $1 million by 2030. Financial giants such as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin, also signaling its transition into mainstream investment portfolios. This growing adoption highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term asset for both individual and institutional investors. Bitcoin and the future of finance By 2025, the U.S. is expected to become the leader in Bitcoin mining, with lower energy costs and favorable government policies. Bitcoin’s use in the financial world will grow with the development of Layer-2 solutions which will make transactions faster and support decentralized apps (dApps). Additionally, tokenized securities, which are digital versions of traditional assets like stocks and bonds, will become more popular, reaching an estimated $50 billion in value. As the crypto space evolves, AI-powered agents will change how decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming work, further integrating Bitcoin into digital platforms. By 2025, it’s expected that 100,000 BTC will be locked in Layer-2 solutions, showing how important Bitcoin will become in the wider blockchain ecosystem. VanEck’s 2025 crypto prediction is bullish, with Bitcoin and Ethereum expected to hit new highs.

Specializing in bringing US Treasury Bonds onto the blockchain, ONDO is positioning itself as a leader in bridging traditional finance and decentralized finance. This innovative approach has fueled tremendous growth for ONDO, the project’s native token, which has surged over 235% since November 5. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon – Top Trader Sets $2 Target The momentum hasn’t slowed as ONDO continues breaking all-time highs, with a remarkable rally since early December captivating investors and analysts alike. Despite this bullish trend, the market is eyeing potential volatility ahead. Recent data from Santiment highlights an increase in ONDO exchange inflows, often an early indicator of significant price movements. As Ondo Finance captures market interest, its focus on tokenizing US Treasury Bonds aligns with the growing narrative of connecting traditional finance with blockchain technology. This convergence of utility and innovation makes Ondo a compelling project in this market cycle. While the price action remains strong, the rising exchange inflows suggest that ONDO could be gearing up for a pivotal phase. Investors are now closely monitoring the token for signs of its next big move. ONDO Testing Price Discovery Ondo Finance’s native token, ONDO, has been in a strong upward trend, testing price discovery since early December after breaking its previous all-time high (ATH) at $1.48. This rally has propelled ONDO to new heights, with the token recently peaking at $2 just a few hours ago. The consistent upward momentum highlights growing investor interest, but the current price levels signal that volatility could soon make a return. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared revealing data on X; Martinez pointed out that ONDO’s exchange inflows have been steadily increasing. Historically, spikes in exchange inflows for ONDO have been correlated with sharp price movements, both upward and downward. These metrics serve as a critical warning to traders and investors about the potential for significant volatility ahead. Martinez emphasized the importance of monitoring these inflows closely. According to his analysis, a spike in inflows typically reflects heightened activity, with holders potentially preparing to sell or new buyers entering the market in anticipation of further gains. “Watch out for the next move,” Martinez cautioned, indicating that ONDO’s price could either correct sharply or extend its rally further into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon As ONDO continues to test price discovery, the next few days will likely be pivotal. If the token sustains its momentum above key support levels, it could push higher, solidifying its position as a top-performing asset in this market cycle. However, traders must remain vigilant, as increased exchange inflows suggest that dramatic price swings are imminent. Technical Analysis: Levels To Watch ONDO is currently trading at $1.90 after a failed attempt to break above the $2 mark earlier today. The price briefly touched this key psychological level before retracing, signaling a potential resistance zone. Despite this setback, ONDO remains one of the market’s standout performers, showcasing impressive strength as it continues to outperform most other assets. This recent pullback could be a setup for a larger move upward, as the price has consistently demonstrated bullish momentum over the past weeks. If the token manages to hold above the critical $1.83 support level, it could pave the way for another rally, potentially breaking past the $2 mark and entering a new phase of price discovery. However, traders should be cautious as volatility appears to be on the rise, with increased exchange inflows indicating heightened market activity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought 210 million DOGE During Recent Correction – Bullish Signal? As the price hovers near its recent highs, the coming days will likely determine its short-term trajectory. Holding the $1.83 level will be crucial for bulls aiming to sustain the uptrend.

The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has allocated 40.1% of the firm’s portfolio to Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP), according to new SEC filings . Berkshire initiated its investment in Apple back in 2016 and has adjusted its holdings multiple times, including significant reductions this year.

37644761,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52177,1734203986,Ripple CTO States Stunning Fact About XRP Burning Via RLUSD Transactions,"The XRP community has recently been abuzz with discussions regarding the burning mechanism on the XRP Ledger, particularly about RLUSD transactions. A question posed on X by a user—“What happens when trillions of RLUSD tokens move daily on the XRP Ledger? Does XRP get burned during these transactions?”—prompted Ripple CTO David Schwartz to weigh in with an explanation. Understanding XRP Burning David Schwartz provided a detailed breakdown of the XRP burning mechanism, a core feature of the XRP Ledger. He explained that every transaction on the ledger whether involving XRP or other assets like RLUSD, incurs a fee. This fee, unlike traditional transaction costs that are redistributed to validators or miners, is permanently removed—or “burned”—from the total XRP supply. The primary purpose of this system is to maintain the network’s efficiency and security. While the fee for each transaction is minimal—typically around 0.00001 XRP—it adds up over time. This gradual reduction in supply ensures that the ledger remains functional and discourages spam transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Minimal Supply Impact Over Time Schwartz addressed concerns about the long-term impact of burning on XRP’s supply, emphasizing that the effect is minimal. Even under scenarios involving extremely high transaction volumes, the reduction in supply would remain negligible. For instance, if payment systems like SWIFT, Visa, and Mastercard adopted XRP for billions of transactions daily, the annual burn would account for just 0.0075% of XRP’s supply. This demonstrates that while the supply is technically reduced, the decrease occurs at a slow rate that does not significantly alter XRP’s overall availability. Implications for the XRP Ledger and RLUSD Adoption Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, set to launch soon, is expected to play a significant role in the evolving stablecoin market, which analysts predict could reach a valuation of $2.3 trillion. As RLUSD gains traction and sees higher transaction volumes, its use will naturally lead to additional XRP burning. Despite this, Schwartz reiterated that the impact on XRP’s supply will remain minimal in the near term. Instead, the consistent but modest burning contributes to the long-term efficiency and sustainability of the XRP Ledger, further reinforcing its value proposition as a scalable and secure payment network.

37644210,https://crypto.news/?p=14319480,1734203931,Bitcoin blitz: Odell Beckham Jr. and 6 other NFL stars betting big on blockchain,"When NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. decided to make a bold statement about his financial future in 2021, he didn’t just catch passes — he caught Bitcoin fever . Partnering with Square CashApp, OBJ proudly announced he’d take his entire $4.25 million Los Angeles Rams salary for the 2021-2022 season in Bitcoin ( BTC ). Skeptics scoffed. Bitcoin was trading at a respectable $57,400 in November 2021, and the move seemed like a moonshot. But for Beckham Jr., it was a “new era.” See below. It's a NEW ERA & to kick that off I'm hyped to announce that I'm taking my new salary in bitcoin thanks to @CashApp . To ALL MY FANS out there, no matter where u r: THANK YOU! I’m giving back a total of $1M in BTC rn too. Drop your $cashtag w. #OBJBTC & follow @CashApp NOW pic.twitter.com/ds1IgZ1zup — Odell Beckham Jr (@obj) November 22, 2021 You might also like: Top UFC Star to Receive Fight Wages in Bitcoin To celebrate both his new crypto-friendly paycheck and his move to the Rams, he promised to give away $1 million in Bitcoin to fans via X (formerly known as Twitter). Cue the avalanche of “thank you” tweets from followers thrilled by their newfound digital riches. Fast-forward to earlier this month: Beckham Jr. made clear he was happy with his decision. https://twitter.com/obj/status/1864750907914613246 Beckham Jr. wasn’t alone in this cryptocurrency craze. He’s just one athlete on a growing roster of NFL players keen on swapping greenbacks for so-called digital gold. Russell Okung Before Beckham Jr. was Russell Okung. The offensive tackle got heat in 2020 with the Carolina Panthers by converting half his $13 million salary into Bitcoin. Okung’s announcement, “Paid in Bitcoin,” went viral, positioning him as the NFL’s crypto pioneer. Little did he know he’d inspire a tidal wave of blockchain enthusiasm among his gridiron peers. NFL executives and financial advisors — even his mother — reportedly tried to block Okung from taking the crypto plunge. But his insistence paid off. Today, he is one of the founders of Bitball, a sports league venture that pays participating athletes in crypto. https://twitter.com/RussellOkung/status/1857071839240916997 Sean Culkin In 2021, Sean Culkin — a tight end with the Los Angeles Chargers and Baltimore Ravens — became the first NFL player to convert his entire NFL salary into Bitcoin upon joining the Kansas City Chiefs. “I fully believe Bitcoin is the future of finance and I wanted to prove that I have real skin in the game,” Culkin said in April 2021. He was “not just trying to make a quick buck,” he added. In March, he tweeted a shoutout to fellow crypto-bull Okung. Here’s to the crazy ones @RussellOkung pic.twitter.com/u4Pr687SsW — Sean Culkin (@culkin22) March 4, 2024 Trevor Lawrence The former No. 1 draft pick signed with Blockfolio, a cryptocurrency portfolio tracking app, in 2021. Lawrence, a quarterback for the Jacksonville Jaguars, was rumored to have had his signing bonus paid entirely in cryptocurrency. However, contrary to reports, that bonus was separate from his $24 million NFL deal. Misreporting led some to speculate that Lawrence lost $15 million due to the subsequent crypto market crash. Recall how the cryptocurrency market’s capitalization declined from $2.9 trillion in November 2021 to $798 billion at the end of 2022. In reality, Lawrence’s NFL earnings remained untouched by the blockchain drama at the time. Aaron Rodgers, Saquon Barkley and Demario Davis Before he was quarterback for the New York Jets, Aaron Rodgers partnered with Cash App in late 2021, choosing to receive part of his NFL salary in Bitcoin. That year, Saquon Barkley, the New York Giants running back, announced he’d convert all his off-field income into Bitcoin, citing the importance of long-term wealth preservation. An honorable mention goes to Demario Davis — a linebacker with the New Orleans Saints — who reportedly declared that fiat currency is “inherently unfair and corrupted.” Ultimately, he did not accept his NFL contract in Bitcoin. But in April this year, Davis expressed interest, calling it “the future of money.” See below. Grateful to @lipscomb and @BitcoinMagazine for having me come talk all things Bitcoin. Learn why Bitcoin is the future of money. pic.twitter.com/GdwKNJObTU — Demario Davis (@demario__davis) April 16, 2024 Crypto’s end zone: Fumbling or scoring big? While these NFL stars made headlines for their Bitcoin paydays, the timing wasn’t exactly clutch. Bitcoin is enjoying all-time highs now, but recall its sharp nosedive after November 2021. After hitting a then-peak of nearly $69,000, rising interest rates, market over-speculation, and high-profile crypto crises like TerraUSD’s collapse and FTX’s bankruptcy contributed to its downfall. By mid-2022, Bitcoin’s value had fallen below $20,000, highlighting the risks of volatile investments, especially for those like NFL stars embracing crypto salaries.

NEAR has captured increased investor attention following Donald Trump’s recent victory, highlighting its growth potential. Concurrently, Tron is experiencing robust growth, driven by recent enhancements to its network and a boost in revenue, which has broadened the adoption of its TRX coin. As NEAR and TRON continue their growth trajectory, Web3Bay is emerging as a pivotal link between traditional e-commerce and the decentralized Web3 world.

Each subsequent stage of the 28 presale phases will see a 15% price increase, providing early backers with substantial growth potential. Web3Bay’s strategy includes allocating 30% (1.5 billion tokens) for ecosystem expansion, partnerships, and incentives, and 20% (1 billion tokens) for liquidity, ensuring stable trading on decentralized exchanges. As it expands, Web3Bay aims to integrate with major blockchain networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain, enabling cross-chain functionality and attracting a wider audience. With this forward-thinking strategy, Web3Bay is at the forefront of blending traditional e-commerce with the advantages of Web3, crafting a secure, transparent, and community-focused shopping experience poised to reshape the digital market landscape.

37643972,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627608,1734202815,Microsoft’s decision to not add Bitcoin to its balance sheet was a great idea for both,"Microsoft’s decision to steer clear of Bitcoin and keep its balance sheet traditional wasn’t just calculated, it was ruthless in its precision. On December 10, the tech giant’s shareholders torched a proposal to sink 1% of its $78 billion cash reserves into Bitcoin. That would’ve been roughly $784 million—a small chunk of cash for Microsoft but a significant statement for the crypto market. The plan, pitched by the National Center for Public Policy Research, called Bitcoin a hedge against inflation, a weapon to fight the brutal 5% inflation rate that’s been squeezing the U.S. economy for years. Microsoft’s board didn’t blink. They called Bitcoin what it is: volatile. They made it clear that corporate cash isn’t for speculation—it’s for stability. Shareholders backed them up with a resounding “no.” As they should’ve. Bitcoin is too risky for Microsoft’s playbook The proposal faced resistance from the start. Bitcoin’s price swings are legendary. It can double your investment or cut it in half within weeks. That’s not a risk Microsoft wants to take with its treasury. The company needs liquidity, predictable returns, and cash reserves ready to fuel operations — not gamble. Microsoft’s leadership, from the boardroom to the shareholders, didn’t buy into the hype of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Sure, Bitcoin delivered jaw-dropping returns—nearly doubling in value over the past year and up over 400% in five years—but that’s not enough to sway a company whose DNA is built on calculated growth and risk management. And let’s not forget the context. The corporate world has been watching Bitcoin skeptically. Even as some companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon, others stayed back, wary of regulatory pitfalls and unpredictable market swings. For Microsoft, the choice was less about being revolutionary and more about protecting shareholder interests. The fallout: Bitcoin dips, Microsoft stays steady When the rejection hit the news, the market reacted. Microsoft’s stock barely moved, staying firm at $446 per share. Bitcoin, however, wasn’t so lucky. It dropped over 4%, sliding to around $95,000. That’s the market speaking loud and clear: Bitcoin’s value still leans heavily on how corporations perceive it. If Microsoft had said yes, it would’ve joined a small but loud group of Bitcoin enthusiasts in the corporate world. MicroStrategy, for example, has hoarded over 402,000 Bitcoins, worth about $40 billion today. CEO Michael Saylor has repeatedly criticized conservative companies like Microsoft, claiming they’ve missed out on billions in gains by sticking to traditional assets. Saylor estimates Microsoft could have raked in $200 billion in five years by betting on Bitcoin instead of sticking with stock buybacks and dividends. Tesla, another Bitcoin heavyweight, holds close to $947 million in the cryptocurrency. Elon Musk’s flirtation with Bitcoin has been more erratic, but it’s still a firm part of Tesla’s financial arsenal. But Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder, has never liked Bitcoin. He’s called it speculative and lacking intrinsic value. But ditching Bitcoin is realistically going to hurt the company’s innovative edge, especially as competitors explore blockchain and crypto integrations. What this means for Bitcoin Bitcoin purists might actually appreciate Microsoft’s rejection. Bitcoin, after all, wasn’t built to rely on corporate validation. It was designed to disrupt traditional finance, not merge with it. Microsoft’s decision to keep Bitcoin at arm’s length reinforces its status as an independent, decentralized asset. The rejection also highlights Bitcoin’s identity crisis. On one hand, it’s a revolutionary currency designed to bypass institutions.

Indeed, these holders play a pivotal role in its growth, with top entities having a more significant influence on the network’s governance and market stability. As of press time, Solana had a total supply of 590.1 million SOL, with 479.02 million in circulation. Unlike some cryptocurrencies, it has no fixed maximum supply, allowing inflationary issuance to support network security and validator incentives. A breakdown of Solana holders indicates that SOL tokens are distributed among its 9.15 million holders on the mainnet, according to data retrieved by Finbold from CoinCarp on December 14. The top 10 holders collectively own 6.58% of the total supply, while the top 20 account for 11.03%. Expanding to the top 50 and 100 holders, their combined shares rise to 17.52% and 22.76%, respectively. Solana top holders overview.

However, most tokens remain distributed across millions of smaller accounts. Data for specific addresses indicates that Solana’s top 10 wallets hold around 7% of the circulating supply, with individual shares ranging between 0.49% and 1.01%. Solana’s top addresses.

Projections place the next key psychological level near $300 should bullish signals persist. Looking ahead, several key fundamentals are likely to influence Solana’s valuation. One notable factor is the potential approval of a Solana exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), which could attract significant institutional capital. While initial reports suggest the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) may reject the current application, the Solana community remains optimistic that the next administration will adopt a more pro-crypto stance, paving the way for eventual approval. At the same time, major institutions are forecasting further price growth for Solana, with investment management firm VanEck projecting the asset could reach $500 by 2025.

It allows smart contracts on the blockchain to access real-world data, enhancing their usefulness. Chainlink ensures data accuracy through a reputation system and a three-step process: oracles retrieve data, the data is aggregated to verify accuracy, and then delivered securely to smart contracts.

It utilizes a sharding technology called Nightshade to improve efficiency and handle more transactions. The network supports developers in creating and launching decentralized applications with ease. NEAR includes the Rainbow Bridge, allowing seamless token transfers with Ethereum, and Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that enhances performance and reduces fees using Ethereum’s technology. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, the project has raised over $20 million from major venture firms. With its emphasis on scalability and interoperability, NEAR Protocol holds significant potential in the blockchain space. Its advanced technology positions it as an interesting project in the current market cycle. Conclusion While POL, LINK, SUI, and NEAR show promise, they may offer less immediate gains.

37644262,https://thecoinrise.com/former-thai-prime-minister-urges-bitcoin-experimentation-as-legal-tender/,1734201358,Former Thai Prime Minister Urges Bitcoin Experimentation as Legal Tender,"Amid the ongoing bullish rally of Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, its adoption appears to have gained traction. While more institutional players have embraced BTC via exchange-traded funds (ETF), the industry might soon witness nations accepting the asset. According to a local news report , Thaksin Shinawatra, the 23rd prime minister of Thailand from 2001 to 2006, has called for proactive financial decisions. Notably, Shinawatra warned about the second coming of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his possible impact on the nation’s economy. Bitcoin Pilot Program Proposed in Phuket Shinawatra advised that Thailand’s current Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, should get the Ministry of Finance to set up a sandbox to accept Bitcoin payments. This experimentation should occur in Phuket to understudy the acceptability and viability of using digital assets. The Ministry of Finance should also determine if issuing stablecoins in place of printing will benefit Thailand positively. The aim is to inject money into circulation to sustain the Thai economy without printing banknotes and, essentially, seek to replace paper currency with digital coins backed by government bonds. Delivering a lecture on the global situation and adaptation, Shinawatra noted that Trump’s return as U.S. president could impact Thailand. Hence, Thailand needs to be prepared, given its trade surplus with the U.S. He anticipates that Trump might want to clear off the U.S. debt by paying with Bitcoin. Global Uncertainty Fuels Crypto Advocacy Shinawatra believes Thailand must think of innovative ways of circulating money in the system without burdening the country. He maintained that these proactive measures have become necessary as commercial banks are unwilling to take risks or lend. The former prime minister is advocating for proactive steps to help Thailand weather the economic storm it is experiencing. This includes low GDP growth, increasing public debt, infrastructural challenges, and the soaring cost of electricity. Thailand authorities in the past cracked down on illegal miners whose activities disrupted power distribution. Will Trump Serve as Catalyst for Global Crypto Adoption? Financial experts see Shinawatra’s call as a signal that the global community is leaning towards digital currencies. This might involve accepting Bitcoin as legal tender or creating stablecoin for a particular country pegged to the local fiat currency for easy financial transactions. Many consider Trump’s pro-crypto stance as a catalyst that could further drive cryptocurrency adoption in the U.S. and worldwide.

Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Blockchain Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. It is gaining popularity due to its dog theme and community-driven approach. Meme coins like WIF often originate from internet memes and focus on creating a fun and engaging community. Dog-themed tokens are particularly popular in the crypto space. WIF leverages Solana's fast and low-cost blockchain technology. In the current market cycle, its growing popularity and the robust technology of Solana may make it attractive to those interested in meme coins.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana eyes breakout, XRP holds $2, but DTX Exchange steals the spotlight with record presale and $1M giveaway. Table of Contents DTX Exchange offers unmatched security and growth potential Solana’s consolidation signals buy opportunity XRP aims for new ATH DTX Exchange promises bigger ROIs than Solana and XRP Solana (SOL) teases a possible breakout, and XRP (XRP) steadies over the $2 mark. Among the well-known altcoins, however, a new player — DTX Exchange (DTX) —is making waves with its record-breaking presale success, unparalleled functionality, and ongoing $1 million giveaway. Would this be the next major development redefining crypto investing? Read on to find out why investors are considering accumulating DTX more than Solana and XRP. DTX Exchange offers unmatched security and growth potential With its creative hybrid concept combining the greatest aspects of centralized and decentralized exchanges, DTX Exchange is transforming the trading environment. Giving traders access to a wide spectrum of assets—stocks, ETFs, FX, and cryptocurrencies—all in one seamless platform, DTX offers traders a strong arsenal of charts, graphs, and sophisticated analytical tools to keep ahead of market movements. DTX lets traders maximize their possibilities in erratic markets like Forex and NASDAQ with a simple interface, great liquidity, and strong security. Currently valued at just $0.12 in its sixth presale round, the DTX token offers a great investment opportunity particularly given the platform has already raised over $10.1 million in presale revenue and attracting significant interest from whale investors. With over 300,000 wallet addresses and a validated testnet showing 100,000 TPS, DTX Exchange is fast acquiring popularity. As DTX gets ready for listing on Tier-1 exchanges such as Uniswap, Binance, and Bybit, where the price is projected to jump to $0.20 and then increase further, analysts are projecting a 500% value gain for DTX, making it one of the best cryptos to invest in now. You might also like: DTX Exchange bound for rally, draws in Cardano and Hedera holders Solana’s consolidation signals buy opportunity With a drop of more than 3% last week, the Solana price has lately displayed indications of market consolidation. Reflecting uncertainty about its near-term direction, the Solana price has swung greatly, rising beyond $240, declining below $210, and then surging back above $220. Notwithstanding these swings, the general sentiment toward Solana is rather positive. Technical indicators, such as the MACD and Moving Averages, still indicate buy signs on the Solana price chart; the Momentum Oscillator suggests some selling pressure. Still, the annual Solana price chart shows a positive flag pattern, and many experts believe a breakout is about to occur, making Solana one of the top altcoins to hold. Solana has shown amazing returns of over 240% over the past year, but in just a few months DTX has already shown more than 440% ROIs for investors. Once DTX launches in Q1 2025, analysts predict it may rise by an additional 500%. XRP aims for new ATH With a startling 250% rise over the last thirty days, the XRP coin has been causing ripples in the market. With the XRP price ranging between $2.68 and $1.88 over the past week, the altcoin has shown notable upward momentum. With buy signs from important indicators like the MACD and Momentum Oscillator, analysts are hopeful about the future expansion of the XRP coin even as a symmetric triangular formation on the XRP price chart suggests a possible breakout, making it one of the top altcoins to hold. Though XRP (XRP) is still roughly 40% behind its all-time high of $3.84, many think the altcoin is headed for a surge toward $3 by year-end; some even project a long-term rally aiming at $20. XRP (XRP) has great growth potential; however, in terms of investor interest DTX is fast outperforming it. Early investors of DTX have already shown great enthusiasm, achieving profits of over 440%. The expected 50x rally post-presale in Q1 2025 makes DTX rapidly one of the best cryptos to invest in now for investors seeking exponential increases. DTX Exchange promises bigger ROIs than Solana and XRP While Solana teases a bullish breakout and XRP rises toward its next major milestone, DTX Exchange provides early-stage potential, state-of-the-art trading tools, and unparalleled security. DTX is the best investment choice of this cycle with over 440% returns in just a few months with analysts predicting a 500% spike following its debut.

Pepe (PEPE) There's a new meme coin catching everyone's attention: PEPE. Launched on Ethereum, it's a deflationary cryptocurrency paying homage to Pepe the Frog, the internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. PEPE keeps things simple with a no-tax policy and openly admits it doesn't have a specific use—it's all about the meme. In late April to May 2023, PEPE's value soared, and its market cap hit a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw huge gains, and a community of fans quickly grew. This surge kicked off what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with many other meme-based coins experiencing wild price swings. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its roadmap includes getting listed on major exchanges and taking over the meme scene. While it doesn't offer new technology or unique features, its strength lies in its growing community and the power of internet culture. With the crypto market always changing and big events like the Bitcoin halving on the horizon, some enthusiasts believe PEPE could be an exciting opportunity. Its recent popularity shows how memes and community can drive a coin's success. Whether PEPE will reach new highs is uncertain, but it's definitely a coin to watch in the current crypto cycle. XRP (XRP) XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make money move as fast as information. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it is fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Transactions are secure and don't need a bank account to settle. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple, a company aiming to boost the currency's use and support the network. Ripple, once known as OpenCoin Inc., has set aside 55 billion XRP in escrow to release them slowly. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" showing its goal to help money flow smoothly across different currencies. XRP's technology offers a real alternative to traditional banking transfers. Its speed and low cost make it attractive for global payments. In today's market, XRP stands out because it's been able to hold its ground while others struggle. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP focuses on making payments easy and fast across borders. This makes it an interesting option for those looking at the future of digital money. As the market evolves, XRP's unique features could make it a strong player in the world of finance. Bonk (BONK) In the world of cryptocurrencies, BONK is making waves. This Solana-based memecoin, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot, aims to shift power back to the community. By redistributing control from venture capital tokens, BONK seeks to empower users and developers within the Solana ecosystem. After a recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value skyrocketed over 100%. Embracing its role as a ""community coin,"" it airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi spaces. By mid-December 2023, BONK had become the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with an astonishing year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite its rapid rise, BONK faces challenges like a high total supply and the unpredictable nature of memecoins. However, its active involvement in a growing network of decentralized apps, such as the new exchange BonkSwap, sets it apart from others like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The current market cycle shows a renewed interest in community-driven projects, and BONK's integration into Solana's ecosystem could make it an attractive option for investors. While the crypto market remains volatile, BONK's unique approach and strong community support position it as a notable player to watch. Sui (SUI) Sui is making waves as a new layer-1 blockchain platform designed for global scale. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable environment for developers. What sets Sui apart is its unique object-centric data model and the use of the Move programming language. These innovations tackle common inefficiencies in other blockchain systems, making transactions faster and more efficient. But Sui doesn't just focus on the tech-savvy crowd. It prioritizes user experience by removing barriers that often make blockchain interactions tricky. Features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make apps built on Sui more accessible and user-friendly. In a market where ease of use and scalability are becoming more important, Sui stands out among other cryptocurrencies. Its commitment to both strong technology and a better user experience positions it as a noteworthy player in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While PEPE, XRP, BONK, and SUI show potential in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a unique chance to surpass them with its sports-centric memecoin platform.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain that transformed decentralized applications. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts, allowing apps to run without downtime. It created ERC-20 tokens used for governance and utility across various platforms. In 2022, Ethereum switched to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, becoming more energy-efficient. Plans include sharding to improve scalability and cut costs. Ether (ETH) is its cryptocurrency, used for transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Ethereum shows great potential in technology and market performance. With sharding, it aims to handle more transactions at lower costs, boosting its role in decentralized finance. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon enhance its efficiency today. Market predictions estimate Ethereum's price could reach $6,580.53 next year. Based on past trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, it may keep growing. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's vast ecosystem and continual updates make it attractive in the current market. Its focus on decentralization and innovation keeps it at the forefront of the blockchain industry. Dogecoin (DOGE) In 2013, Dogecoin burst onto the scene as a playful twist on cryptocurrencies. Bearing the image of a Shiba Inu dog, it started as a joke by creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total supply. What began as a ""memecoin"" quickly gained a devoted community. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, reaching over $50 billion in market cap and landing in the top ten cryptocurrencies. This incredible rise was fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, showcasing the power of online communities in shaping financial markets. Dogecoin's technology is based on Litecoin, which means it uses similar protocols but is even faster in transaction times. Its abundance makes it suitable for tipping and microtransactions, promoting accessibility in the crypto world. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains a popular choice for many investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. While it lacks the advanced smart contract capabilities of Ethereum or the scarcity of Bitcoin, its strong community support and mainstream recognition give it staying power. With the crypto market's volatility, Dogecoin could see significant swings. For those drawn to its playful nature and potential for quick gains, Dogecoin might be an attractive option, but it's important to stay updated on market trends and approach with care. XRP (XRP) XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make money move as fast as information. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it is fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Transactions are secure and don't need a bank account to settle. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple, a company aiming to boost the currency's use and support the network. Ripple, once known as OpenCoin Inc., has set aside 55 billion XRP in escrow to release them slowly.

Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP focuses on making payments easy and fast across borders. This makes it an interesting option for those looking at the future of digital money. As the market evolves, XRP's unique features could make it a strong player in the world of finance. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, known by its ticker SHIB, is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun take on Dogecoin. But it offers more than just laughs. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can connect with many apps and services in the Ethereum world. Launched in August 2020 by someone called Ryoshi, SHIB began with a huge supply of tokens. To build trust in the crypto community, half of these tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum's creators. Buterin surprised many by donating a large amount to help with COVID-19 relief in India and even destroyed (or ""burned"") 40% of the total SHIB supply. These big moves put SHIB in the spotlight. SHIB's use of Ethereum allows it to do more than many other meme coins. It has its own platform called ShibaSwap, where people can trade cryptocurrencies without a central authority. There are also plans for a place to create and trade NFTs, which are unique digital items. Plus, SHIB aims to have a system where holders can vote on decisions, known as decentralized governance. These features show that SHIB is trying to build real value and utility. In today's market, where many cryptocurrencies face challenges, SHIB's active development could make it appealing to some. Its connection to Ethereum might give it advantages over coins that don't have such ties. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB's efforts to expand its use could set it apart from other tokens. Conclusion While ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SHIB offer potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans in crypto, aiming for massive growth through a unique meme and sports blend.

Moo Deng moodengsol.com (MOODENG) Over the past six months, Moo Deng (MOODENG) has experienced significant growth, with its price increasing by nearly 89%. This upward trend reflects a strong interest in the coin. However, recent movements have shown some volatility. In the last month, MOODENG's price rose by about 13%, suggesting continued investor confidence. Yet, the past week saw a decline of over 16%. Currently, the coin is trading between $0.28 and $0.67, aligning with its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages at $0.39. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at 47.66 and the Stochastic at 43.62 indicate a neutral market sentiment. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $1.24 and $1.20 respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index stands at 44.92, indicating that PNUT is neither overbought nor oversold. A Stochastic value of 25.32 and a negative MACD level of -0.00318 hint at potential bearish momentum. Considering these factors, PNUT may experience short-term volatility but could regain upward momentum if positive sentiment returns. Peanut the Squirrel and (PNUT) Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) has experienced significant fluctuations recently. Over the past six months, its price has soared by 223.52%, showcasing remarkable growth and attracting investor interest. In the last month alone, PNUT surged by 178.36%. However, the past week reflected a different trend, with the price declining by 14.01%. Currently trading between $1.14 and $1.67, PNUT is approaching its nearest resistance level at $1.90. Breaking this barrier could propel the price towards the next resistance at $2.43. Conversely, if the price falls, the nearest support level at $0.83 might provide stability. A further dip could see the price testing the second support at $0.30. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $1.24 and $1.20 respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index stands at 44.92, indicating that PNUT is neither overbought nor oversold. A Stochastic value of 25.32 and a negative MACD level of -0.00318 hint at potential bearish momentum. Considering these factors, PNUT may experience short-term volatility but could regain upward momentum if positive sentiment returns. Conclusion MOODENG and PNUT are promising, but XYZVerse's unique sports-meme fusion, ambitious growth goals, and community focus position it as the leading memecoin for the upcoming bull run.

BKCH's portfolio is concentrated, with top holdings like Coinbase and Riot Platforms, and features a high price-to-earnings ratio and significant non-US exposure. Bitcoin seasonality trends are bullish, but technical indicators suggest near-term risks, including a bearish RSI divergence and potential downside price gap. I maintain a hold rating on BKCH, citing its rich valuation and technical risks, balanced by positive long-term trends and favorable bitcoin seasonality. Money has poured into the crypto space since the re-election of Donald Trump. Even in the weeks leading up to November 5, bitcoin and crypto stocks were seeing strong inflows, perhaps on the expectation that the new president-elect would indeed construct a bitcoin reserve. EPFR data show that the last eight weeks have featured the biggest net inflow into crypto funds on record. After taking a cautious stance on the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) heading into the third quarter, citing some seasonal risks and a mixed technical outlook around the middle of the year, I see risks with the ETF. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to revisit the fund before the election, and today I reiterate a hold rating following a strong rally from September through November. Record-Setting Inflows Into Crypto Funds BofA Global Research According to the issuer , BKCH seeks to invest in companies positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of blockchain technology, including companies in digital asset mining, blockchain & digital asset transactions, blockchain applications, blockchain & digital asset hardware, and blockchain & digital asset integration, according to Global X. The issuer states that the theme is bigger than just cryptocurrency and that BKCH invests accordingly, with global exposure across multiple sectors and industries. Despite a strong 32% total return since my June analysis, BKCH remains a very small ETF with total assets under management of just $217 million, though that is up from $165 million from late in the first half of 2024. The fund’s annual expense ratio is moderate at 0.50% while the forward dividend yield is near that of the S&P 500 at 1.5% as of December 12, 2024. Share-price momentum has been stellar in recent months, earning BKCH a perfect A+ ETF Grade, according to Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. The fund is highly risky , however, given a lofty annual standard deviation trend and its concentrated portfolio. Finally, liquidity risks are present since BKCH features average daily volume of barely more than 50,000 shares while its 30-day median bid/ask spread is very high at 0.49%, per Global X ETFs. For a refresher on the portfolio, the 1-star, Negative-rated ETF by Morningstar falls in the lower-right of the style box, indicating its small-cap growth bent. Just 2% of BKCH is classified as value while less than one-fifth of the fund is large cap. Prospective investors should also be aware that BKCH is 18% invested in non-US equities. The price-to-earnings ratio has swelled to above 38 (it was under 20% just six months ago), though the issuer’s website shows a negative earnings multiple. BKCH: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar Looking closer at the allocation, the top five stocks account for about half of BKCH’s portfolio, so keeping close tabs on both the fundamentals and technicals of Coinbase (COIN), MARA Holdings (MARA), Core Scientific (CORZ), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Hut 8 (HUT) is key. Those following the industry closely might recall news this week that activist investor Starboard took a stake in RIOT, which offered an encouraging sign for the broader crypto equity space. BKCH: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Perhaps the biggest variable is seasonality with bitcoin. When analyzing trends since 2010, we find that we are in the midst of a strong calendar stretch. Bitcoin has done well from October through July, so this is a tailwind to weigh. Strong Bitcoin Seasonal Trends Barchart The Technical Take With a higher valuation today but bullish crypto seasonality in play, BKCH’s chart shows some near-term risk. Notice in the graph below that the ETF tagged the upper end of its uptrend channel earlier this month. The $77 mark is also key as that’s close to where it bounced (and then fell) in early 2022. Moreover, the rally to a multi-year high came on a weaker RSI momentum mark, which is a bearish divergence. Finally, I am concerned about a downside price gap near $50 that could be filled if we see a protracted pullback. On the plus side, BKCH’s long-term 200-day moving average is rising, suggesting that the broader trend is up and that the bulls control the primary trend. Also, the 50dma is above the 200dma with price above both lines. It would be tough for the bears to take BKCH all the way down to trend-line support under $40 – that would likely require a severe bitcoin bear market in 2025, which seems unlikely given Trump’s pro-crypto stance. BKCH: Shares Touch the Uptrend Channel Line On Bearish RSI Divergence Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on BKCH. I see the crypto equity fund as somewhat richly valued while the technical picture points to near-term weakness within a broader uptrend. Bitcoin seasonality is quite bullish, which makes me reticent to issue a sell rating.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744320-bkch-bitcoin-stocks-rally-into-resistance-massive-industry-inflows?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37642394.jpeg

Glory","Meme coins have carved out a unique niche in the crypto market. They dazzle with wild growth opportunities and mint millionaires overnight. These coins are for the boldest of crypto degens, those relentless gem-seekers who thrive on the thrill of holding the hidden gems.

37642297,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627575,1734199552,Wall Street questions Fed’s intentions as tool rate cut appears likely,"Wall Street is buzzing as the Federal Reserve prepares to tweak its overnight reverse repo (RRP) facility rate, a move expected to drop it by 5 basis points. This seemingly small adjustment, rumored to come next week, could move billions in cash flows and stir up money markets. Traders and analysts are asking the same question: What’s the Fed really up to? The RRP rate, now sitting at 4.55%, is five basis points above the lower limit of the central bank’s policy target range of 4.5% to 4.75%. While the Fed labels this adjustment as “technical,” skeptics aren’t buying it. With balances at the RRP facility already down $2.4 trillion from their December 2022 peak, the timing feels off. Why make a change now when usage has plateaued at roughly $175 billion? Liquidity, or just optics? The Federal Reserve has been chipping away at excess liquidity since it began quantitative tightening. The RRP facility, which acts as a sponge for extra cash in the system, has seen massive outflows over the past year. But some experts say this isn’t about liquidity at all. Barclays says the adjustment is purely technical, meant to align the RRP rate with the lower end of the federal funds target range. In other words, it’s housekeeping. Yet firms like Bank of America and Citigroup are scratching their heads, questioning the logic. Mark Cabana of Bank of America called the timing “perplexing,” noting that the adjustment would lower repo and Treasury bill rates, but not much else. Jason Williams at Citigroup shares the confusion. “The market isn’t signaling an urgent need for this move,” he said. “If it were, the futures curve would show it, and that’s not happening.” The Fed hasn’t touched the RRP rate since June 2021, when a dollar surplus pushed short-term funding rates to the floor. Back then, $521 billion was parked in the facility. Wall Street’s breakdown of the Fed’s playbook Wrightson ICAP’s Lou Crandall thinks the Fed could act as early as next week or delay until January. His view? The Fed might want to separate the RRP adjustment from its expected quarter-point cut to the main policy rate. “It’s all about timing,” he said. But Morgan Stanley’s Martin Tobias isn’t so sure this adjustment will have much impact. He sees the move as part of the Fed’s effort to keep quantitative tightening on track while maintaining money market stability. “The Fed funds rate should stay 8 basis points above the lower range, even after the tweak.” Meanwhile, Bank of America is unconvinced the adjustment is necessary. The firm argues that liquidity conditions don’t justify a rate cut now. But Deutsche Bank takes a different view, suggesting the move could ease upward pressure on short-term rates and nudge RRP balances lower. TD Securities is focused on what happens next. The company predicts the Fed will end quantitative tightening altogether by March 2025, with this RRP adjustment serving as a temporary fix. They expect a 5 basis point drop in the RRP rate, which would trickle down to SOFR and fed funds rates. Mixed outcomes ahead Not everyone sees this adjustment as a big deal. JPMorgan Chase’s Teresa Ho said the current low balances at the RRP facility mean a rate cut might not move the needle much. “If the Fed wants to make a real impact, they’d need to adjust the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate,” added Srini Ramaswamy, her colleague. Still, some strategists think the adjustment could ripple through repo and Treasury markets. Deutsche Bank predicts partial pass-through effects, with repo rates falling slightly after the change. Barclays’ Joseph Abate described the move as a return to pre-pandemic norms, when the RRP rate matched the lower end of the federal funds range. There’s also speculation about how this tweak might influence behavior in 2025. With Treasury bill supply expected to shrink due to debt ceiling negotiations, counterparties could park more cash in the RRP facility. That could drive balances higher, counteracting the Fed’s liquidity tightening efforts.

37641976,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26423,1734199380,"Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR) Solana Memecoin to Rally 16,000% Before Exchange Listing, While Shiba Inu and BONK Fall","Trump’s Tariffs could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR.

The popular altcoin was one of the many benefactors of a Donald Trump presidential victory, rising by 67.69% in three weeks after November 5 to reach a new-all time of $263. However, this price surge has been followed by a gradual recorrection of 15.13% in the last two weeks. Albeit, recent data on investors’ behavior shows significant market optimism on the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon Solana ‘New’ Investors Buoyant On Bullish Future In an X post on December 13, blockchain analytics company Glassnode shared an insightful report on Solana investors’ activity in recent weeks. According to Glassnode, Solana investors who entered the market 1-2 years ago have now offloaded significant portions of their holdings. The analytics team explains that these investors likely bought Solana during its 2021 bull run and have now taken profits during the price rally in November, reducing their market share from 48% in June to below 5% currently. While a drop in long-term holdings can sometimes signal doubts about an asset’s future potential, Glassnode views these recent sales as purely transactional with most investors looking to sell ahead of the next bull run now exiting the market. Importantly, this selling pressure has been absorbed to a significant extent by new Solana investors of the last 6-12 months who increased their market holdings to 24% during Solana’s latest price surge. Such massive investment at rising price levels indicates confidence among new holders in Solana’s long-term profitability despite its current price dip.

In their latest insight on digital assets, Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel, and Senior Investment Analyst Patrick Bush have jointly forecasted the general crypto market to maintain its bullish form going into the new year. On that note, the digital assets will attain their first market peak in Q1 2025 with Bitcoin attaining a price of $180,000. During this rally, Solana is projected to trade at $500, indicating a potential 124.21% gain on the asset’s current price. However, VanEck analysts warn that this surge will likely be followed by Bitcoin experiencing a 30% price recorrection while altcoins including Solana record declines of about 60% as the market enters consolidation in summer. At the time of writing, Solana continues to trade at $227 reflecting a 0.34% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 14.28% and valued at $4.12 billion.

Spotting these promising ventures early could be the key to unlocking significant returns in the evolving crypto sphere. XYZVerse emerges as a compelling option, merging sports enthusiasm with meme culture. This meme coin unites fans across various sports, aiming for remarkable growth through community engagement and a clear development roadmap. XYZ, the all-sports meme coin, gears up for a 66% price surge XYZ, the world’s first all-sports meme token, is here to unite sports fandom with crypto innovation. Designed to electrify sports lovers and degens alike, XYZVerse is more than a token—it’s a gateway to capitalize on the explosive demand for prediction markets and meme coin mania. In the crypto arena of 2024, meme coins are dominating the leaderboard. Remember the thousand-fold rallies of BOME and WIF? XYZ is setting its sights even higher, with an impressive 7,402% target by the end of its presale. Starting at just $0.0001, XYZ’s presale plan is already delivering for early adopters, who locked in an extraordinary 99% discount compared to its final stage price of $0.1. Now in its ninth stage, XYZ is priced at $0.001333, and as it approaches the tenth stage, a 66% price surge to $0.002 is on the horizon. With upcoming listings on top-tier CEX and DEX platforms, audited smart contracts, and a first-mover advantage, XYZ is building an unstoppable offense. Don’t wait for the crowd to storm the field—grab XYZ tokens now and be part of the game-changing action. You might also like: Dogecoin and Shiba Inu backers look to XYZVerse for its unmatched 99x growth potential Ethereum Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain that transformed decentralized applications. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts, allowing apps to run without downtime. It created ERC-20 tokens used for governance and utility across various platforms. In 2022, Ethereum switched to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, becoming more energy-efficient. Plans include sharding to improve scalability and cut costs. Ether (ETH) is its cryptocurrency, used for transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Ethereum shows great potential in technology and market performance. With sharding, it aims to handle more transactions at lower costs, boosting its role in decentralized finance. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon enhance its efficiency today. Market predictions estimate Ethereum’s price could reach $6,580.53 next year. Based on past trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, it may keep growing. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s vast ecosystem and continual updates make it attractive in the current market. Its focus on decentralization and innovation keeps it at the forefront of the blockchain industry. Dogecoin In 2013, Dogecoin burst onto the scene as a playful twist on cryptocurrencies. Bearing the image of a Shiba Inu dog, it started as a joke by creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total supply. What began as a “meme coin” quickly gained a devoted community. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, reaching over $50 billion in market cap and landing in the top ten cryptocurrencies. This incredible rise was fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, showcasing the power of online communities in shaping financial markets. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, which means it uses similar protocols but is even faster in transaction times. Its abundance makes it suitable for tipping and microtransactions, promoting accessibility in the crypto world. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains a popular choice for many investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. While it lacks the advanced smart contract capabilities of Ethereum or the scarcity of Bitcoin, its strong community support and mainstream recognition give it staying power. With the crypto market’s volatility, Dogecoin could see significant swings. For those drawn to its playful nature and potential for quick gains, Dogecoin might be an attractive option, but it’s important to stay updated on market trends and approach with care. XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make money move as fast as information. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it is fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Transactions are secure and don’t need a bank account to settle. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple, a company aiming to boost the currency’s use and support the network. Ripple, once known as OpenCoin Inc., has set aside 55 billion XRP in escrow to release them slowly. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” showing its goal to help money flow smoothly across different currencies. XRP’s technology offers a real alternative to traditional banking transfers. Its speed and low cost make it attractive for global payments. In today’s market, XRP stands out because it’s been able to hold its ground while others struggle. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP focuses on making payments easy and fast across borders. This makes it an interesting option for those looking at the future of digital money. As the market evolves, XRP’s unique features could make it a strong player in the world of finance. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu, known by its ticker SHIB, is a cryptocurrency that started as a fun take on Dogecoin. But it offers more than just laughs. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can connect with many apps and services in the Ethereum world. Launched in August 2020 by someone called Ryoshi, SHIB began with a huge supply of tokens. To build trust in the crypto community, half of these tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s creators. Buterin surprised many by donating a large amount to help with COVID-19 relief in India and even destroyed (or “burned”) 40% of the total SHIB supply. These big moves put SHIB in the spotlight. SHIB’s use of Ethereum allows it to do more than many other meme coins. It has its own platform called ShibaSwap, where people can trade cryptocurrencies without a central authority. There are also plans for a place to create and trade NFTs, which are unique digital items. Plus, SHIB aims to have a system where holders can vote on decisions, known as decentralized governance. These features show that SHIB is trying to build real value and utility. In today’s market, where many cryptocurrencies face challenges, SHIB’s active development could make it appealing to some. Its connection to Ethereum might give it advantages over coins that don’t have such ties. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB’s efforts to expand its use could set it apart from other tokens. Conclusion ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SHIB are promising, but XYZVerse leads with an all-sport meme coin aiming for 20,000% growth in a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

37641893,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393059,1734199200,Top 3 Altcoins With Stable Gains To Beat Volatile Market Trends,"The post Top 3 Altcoins With Stable Gains To Beat Volatile Market Trends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto bull run commenced last month, and tokens surged—and corrected—at that time. While the price surges have been exciting, traders are on the lookout for altcoins with stable gains in the crypto market. DTX Exchange (DTX), SUI, and Dogecoin (DOGE) are three promising altcoins with stable gains, and they could be your best bet in the volatile markets. Here’s more on the three promising altcoins! Equal Chance for Whales and Retail Traders on the DTX Exchange Unlike other trading platforms where whales are marked out from the start, DTX Exchange is offering every user an equal chance to stock up on the tokens during the presale. On DTX Exchange, the tokens are fully democratized, with a steady rise in price through the presale phase to encourage user participation. DTX Exchange users also have the privilege of ideating future developments for the betterment of the project. DTX Exchange will be quite the hub of traders. The project brings a new initiative to the DeFi industry through its hybrid trading interface, which gives traders access to digital assets like stocks, Forex, and crypto. It’s the first time in the history of trading where traders do not have the risk of using third-party apps. The grand technology on DTX Exchange also includes a VulcanX-based system that allows for quick operation. With a speed of up to 100,000 TPS, DTX Exchange has become one of the fastest projects in the DeFi sector, going shoulder to shoulder and offering alternatives to top guns like Solana. SUI Sets a New ATH Again! SUI has been one of the fastest-growing projects in 2024, growing to the point of getting comparisons with Solana. Sui sports the typical DeFi ecosystem, complete with exchanges and staking platforms, and its latest developments have seen the SUI token edge closer to the top 20 cryptocurrencies. SUI landed a partnership deal with Backpack during the week, announcing the integration of the Backpack wallet and exchange on the Sui ecosystem. Also, the DEX volume on Sui just crossed a milestone, rising past $35 billion and setting a new 24-hour record of $466 million. Both announcements pushed the token to a 10% spike in the intraday timeframe, and SUI now trades at a new ATH, $4.86. Is Dogecoin Consolidating for a Future Surge? The past few days have been bearish on the Dogecoin charts, as the DOGE token succumbed to the market-wide correction that hit even the top altcoins with stable gains. The dip saw DOGE fall in value from $0.43 to as low as $0.35. Since November 2024, Dogecoin has demonstrated great consistency, rising steadily from under 10 cents to a new yearly high of about $0.48. Dogecoin has been coasting around that level for almost two weeks, leaving most traders to guess its next move. The dip saw some DOGE sell-off, too, and some traders moved over to profitable platforms like DTX Exchange. Now, analysts believe that the Dogecoin price might fall even further, to about $0.32, to allow for a spike above $0.50. DTX is One of the Altcoins With Stable Gains as Its Presale Raises $10 Million! While SUI and DOGE could also fight off bearish trends and maintain steady price trajectories, traders are going to have the best time on DTX Exchange. With its 1,000x leverage option, DTX Exchange allows its users to aim for even higher profit levels by scaling the liquidity available to them. And this is why the presale is doing great numbers—over $10 million raised, and more than 300,000 users sold on the dream. The token is already listed on CoinMarketCap. Its Web3-enabled Phoenix Wallet is live for downloads, and its smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof. DTX Exchange is set to revolutionize the DeFi sector, and its DTX token is well-positioned to be among the altcoins with stable gains. The full trading platform is scheduled to go live in Q1 2025, but the DTX token is still only worth $0.12 in Stage 6 of its public presale. The launch price is expected to be about $0.20, giving new investors looking for altcoins with stable gains a chance for 66% profits. Join the presale now!

The ETF firms have achieved this milestone within a year of their inception. This has proven to be a bullish sign for the new altcoin Cutoshi (CUTO) , which follows Satoshi’s vision and walks in the path paved by Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs holdings surpasses Satoshi Nakamoto Most of these BTC owned by ETFs belong to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), making it the most significant Bitcoin exchange-traded fund with around 528,000 Bitcoin. These organizations’ mass acquisition of Bitcoin illustrates the increasing acceptance and reducing regulatory pressure. Moreover, these ETFs improve accessibility for retail investors and can increase participation from investors who were hesitant to invest in Bitcoin earlier. Although it decreases Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, the increasing ETF holdings would provide more liquidity and induce more demand, ultimately driving the price up.

37641769,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312801,1734198931,Early-Era US Bitcoin Investor Sentenced to Two Years in Prison for Underreporting Gains From BTC Sales,"An ancient Bitcoin investor is going to spend the next two years in prison after underreporting his BTC gains, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). In a new press release, the DOJ says that Frank Richard Ahlgren III of Austin, Texas failed to accurately report the capital gains he earned after selling $3.7 million in Bitcoin. He was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison for filing false tax returns. The DOJ says that taxpayers are required to report any gains or losses from the sale of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Says Stuart Goldberg, the Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ’s Tax Division, “Frank Ahlgren III earned millions buying and selling Bitcoins. But instead of paying the taxes he knew were due, he lied to his accountant about the extent of a large portion of his gains, and sought to conceal another chunk of his profits through sophisticated techniques designed to obscure his transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. That conduct today earned him a two-year sentence.” Ahlgren made his first purchase of Bitcoin in 2011 and in 2015, he acquired about 1,366 BTC using top US crypto exchange Coinbase. In October 2017, he sold about 640 BTC, each worth about $5,807 at the time, for a total of $3.7 million. He used most of the funds to buy a home in Park City, Utah. But when he filed his 2017 tax return, he told his accountant he purchased the Bitcoin at a much higher price than he did, pretending his gains were less. He also sold BTC in 2018 and 2019 for over $650,000 but failed to report the sales. According to the DOJ, Ahlgren’s false filings helped him avoid having to pay more than $1 million in taxes. In addition to his two-year prison term, Ahlgren is ordered to serve one year of supervised release and pay $1,095,031 in restitution to the United States.

The number of social engineering scams targeting both US and Canadian bank customers has exploded 1,000% in the last year, according to the cybersecurity firm BioCatch. Social engineering scammers use deceptive tactics to impersonate entities like banks or family members, tricking victims into transferring money or disclosing sensitive information. The new data comes as a new congressional report finds JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America customers reported losing $166 million to scams on Zelle in 2023, with the banks refusing to reimburse 62% of the time. And although Zelle’s parent company Early Warning Services – which is collectively owned by major US banks – says it’s pushing to specifically reimburse more social engineering scams, the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations finds it’s not yet happening. “The Member Banks rejected more imposter scams than they reimbursed after EWS adopted the new policy in June 30, 2023. Zelle’s 2,100 Member Banks reported approximately 54,000 disputes to EWS as imposter scams from June 30, 2023, through December 31, 2023. Of these, approximately 24,000 disputes, or about 44%, were deemed eligible for reimbursement under the 2023 EWS Policy, leaving approximately 30,000 disputes, or about 56% of reported imposter scams, ineligible for reimbursement.” BioCatch tracks bank customers’ behavioral data to help locate illicit accounts, with American Express, Barclays and HSBC among its clients. The firm warns its data shows AI-powered schemes like deepfakes are increasingly being used to power social engineering attacks. “More than half of those surveyed said they’d lost trust in people and suffered emotional stress after falling victim to a scam. Nearly one in five victims said their loss disrupted their family life. As these scams grow more prevalent and sophisticated, a data-driven approach that combines historical account data as well as behavioral and device intelligence is critical to stopping scams in real-time and saving victims and banks from significant losses.” BioCatch also says account-opening fraud dropped nearly 60% in the last year amid a rise in effective security measures, while check and deposit fraud tripled in the same time frame.

Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it gained popularity due to its community and social media influence, notably from figures like Elon Musk. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, it remains a subject of interest due to these factors. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it started with 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, increasing SHIB's visibility. SHIB's Ethereum basis allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans include an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. This integration may enhance its utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB's potential for broader application could make it an attractive option. PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. Mimicking Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, it has no transaction tax and embraces its memecoin identity without utility. PEPE features a burning mechanism to boost scarcity and rewards long-term holders through redistribution. Its roadmap aims to increase visibility via social media trends and exchange listings. In mid-2023, it reached a $1.6 billion market cap, igniting a memecoin frenzy and cultivating a vibrant community. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum's security. Available on Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin, PEPE's unique features may attract interest in the current market cycle. BONK: Solana's Memecoin Empowering the Community BONK is a Solana-based memecoin featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK surged over 100%. It serves as a ""community coin,"" with 50% of its supply airdropped to Solana's NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK is the third-largest memecoin by market cap and one of the top gainers, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Its integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, showcases its potential. Despite challenges like a high total supply and memecoin volatility, BONK's active involvement in decentralized applications positions it as a noteworthy player in the current market cycle. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK show less short-term promise, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of presale with potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows the success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

37641386,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374590,1734198131,Texas Lawmaker Files Bill to Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"Republican State Representative Giovanni Capriglione has officially filed to create a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve for Texas. According to him, the bill is meant to enhance fiscal stability while solidifying the state’s leadership in digital innovation. The Proposed Legislation Capriglione announced the proposed Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (H.B. No. 1598) during an X Spaces event on Thursday, where he shared the document highlighting BTC’s decentralized nature, finite supply, and potential as a strategic asset to strengthen the state’s financial stability and resilience. The legislator believes the initiative will combat inflation and offer a hedge against economic volatility. He described the reserve as a “win-win” investment that would foster innovation while providing a broad framework for managing cryptocurrency holdings. The Act suggests creating a Bitcoin reserve within the Texas state treasury, managed as a special fund outside the general revenue fund under the state comptroller’s supervision. If approved, it will allow area residents to pay taxes and fees and make donations in cryptocurrency, with the holdings retained for at least five years. The framework also enables residents to contribute Bitcoin to the reserve, emphasizing public participation in the state’s financial innovation. A two-thirds majority in both legislative houses will enable the bill’s provisions to take effect immediately; otherwise, it will become applicable on September 1, 2025. Additionally, the law will expire on September 1, 2035, unless extended by future amendments. Texas Moves Ahead as States Embrace Bitcoin Integration Capriglione’s proposal is part of a growing movement across the United States to adopt Bitcoin. Representative Mike Cabell recently introduced a similar bill in Pennsylvania, which would permit up to 10% of the state’s funds to be invested in the largest digital asset. In a November 12 memo , Cabell highlighted BTC’s potential use as a protection against inflation, citing its adoption by financial firms and governments. “In recent years, many financial institutions and sovereign governments, including the United States, have invested in Bitcoin to shield their portfolios from economic volatility,” he said. The lawmaker’s motion followed Pennsylvania’s passage of a “Bitcoin rights bill” and mirrors broader legislative efforts nationwide. Other jurisdictions, including Oklahoma, Louisiana, Montana, and Arkansas, have passed laws protecting crypto mining and self-custody rights. The momentum also aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s favorable stance on virtual currency. His promise to establish a Bitcoin stockpile in the United States, made on the campaign trail while soliciting the crypto community’s votes, was recently reiterated by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis. On November 6, she declared her intention to push for the passing of the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, which would ensure the U.S. Treasury bought 1 million BTC over five years.

BiT Global had alleged that Coinbase’s decision to delist wBTC was to promote its own competing product, cbBTC, that caused massive financial losses and deteriorated consumer confidence in wBTC. Coinbase is being sued for over $1 billion by BiT Global Digital The lawsuit had also alleged that Coinbase’s listings of meme coins and tokens that have “no inherent value” prove that the exchange delisted WBTC in a bid to have a monopoly over the industry. It also restated that delisting WBTC in place of these memecoins proves that the exchange did not follow any defined listing standards. Paul Grewal Defends A day after the lawsuit, Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, defended the exchange’s approach, and emphasized its commitment to high listing standards. He reacted to criticism of the exchange’s token listing and delisting practices after the lawsuit accused the company of anticompetitive behavior regarding Wrapped Bitcoin.

37641185,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627571,1734197317,Southeast Asia countries are in stiff competition to be the region’s top AI hub,"Countries in Southeast Asia that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are quietly battling with each other to claim the region’s top AI hub position. According to CNBC , the 10 countries in Southeast Asia’s emerging economies have a combined population of 672 million people and already have a competitive edge over Europe or the US. Youth demography gives ASEAN members an advantage The region boasts over 200 million people between the ages of 15 and 35. The youthful and tech-savvy population makes Southeast Asia adaptable to future technological advances. This, coupled with support from member states’ governments for speeding up AI in the region could be advantageous to the people, especially the workers. “AI can significantly improve productivity across industries, and this boost in efficiency can lead to an uplift of incomes for all workers,” Jun Le Koay from the consultancy Access Partnership and the author of the research paper “Advantage Southeast Asia: Emerging AI Leader,” told CNBC. “Additionally, as industries increasingly adopt AI technologies, new jobs are emerging that will require AI skills. This evolution creates opportunities for low-income populations to acquire new skills and transition to better-paying positions.” ~ Le Koay According to Le Koay, the AI boom also offers vast opportunities for the region to capitalize on its existing infrastructure. These countries have already made significant efforts towards enhancing internet access over the past decade which has helped build a “digitally native population ready to adopt and innovate with AI.” Smartphone adoption ranges between 65% and 90% in ASEAN nations which should also see AI adoption rapidly take shape. Network Media Consulting CEO and scholar at the London School for Economics, Grace Yuehan Wang told CNBC that: “ASEAN as a region has demonstrated a strong GDP growth rate in recent years and undoubtedly is one of the most economically prosperous blocs in the world in the foreseeable future.” She however highlighted that a developed digital infrastructure, education of “high-level technical talents including AI, as well as world-level universities, successful industrial and research collaborations are some elements still lacking in ASEAN’s AI ecosystem.” According to her, competition is mainly on attracting foreign direct investment and collaborations with world-leading universities. All countries in Southeast Asia have established AI strategies The 10 countries that make up the ASEAN club – that is Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam have all published their national AI strategies with Singapore being among the first to reveal its vision in 2019. Singapore updated its strategy in December last year and its vision includes increasing AI workforce to 15,000, which is triple the current amount while it is also considering creating research and development centers. The island opened its AI Center of Excellence for the Manufacturing Sector in September to integrate AI across supply chains. Its AI mission has full government support which pledged to invest $741 million in the next five years. Singapore came out first on Salesforce’s 2023 Asia Pacific AI Readiness Index , which evaluated 12 states, while other ASEAN members who made it on the list were Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand although they occupied lower rankings between eighth and twelfth spots. While Singapore appears to have the upper hand, its neighbors are not backing down but have also made efforts to make a mark in the AI sector. Vietnam is betting on its strengths in assembly, testing, and packaging capacities as it meets global demand for chips. The country last year unveiled an open-source language model known as PhoGPT, specifically for Vietnamese users and a localized alternative to ChatGPT . “English-dominant AI models cannot be applied to all social and cultural contexts, while on a deeper level, it demonstrates the efforts in overcoming fears of widening existing divides and inequalities among the less powerful technology regions and countries.” ~ Wang Other ASEAN members are looking at capitalizing on AI for traditionally labor-intensive industries. For instance, Cambodia’s 60-page strategy highlights how the country wants to harness the technology for “social good” and agricultural technology, boosting the sector which accounted for 22% of its GDP in 2018. The sector also employed three million people as of 2018. Not all ASEAN nations are ready However, the ASEAN members not as digitally developed as Singapore face challenges to becoming AI-ready and achieving a full-blown AI policy. “There are several regulatory building blocks that need to be intact and robust before credibly embarking on AI.” ~ Kristina Fong, lead researcher at ASEAN Studies Centre These developments also come as the ASEAN countries released their guide to AI governance and ethics in February, diverging from Europe, which had attempted to persuade them to follow the EU’s AI regulations. ASEAN countries argued that the EU was too quick to adopt regulations without fully understanding the risks. Commenting on the regulations, Wang said by diverging from EU regulations , ASEAN members were not necessarily in a battle between choosing a Western or Chinese approach as international cooperation remains critical for ASEAN’s AI ethics framework.

This makes Zand the first bank in the UAE to provide digital asset and crypto custody services for institutions under its banking license. Zand Plans to Launch an AED Stablecoin According to the announcement, Zand will offer custody solutions designed for corporate and institutional clients. This marks a new phase in the UAE’s growing digital asset industry. Furthermore, the bank will launch a stablecoin tied to the AED, supporting the region’s goal to incorporate blockchain technology into its financial system. Meanwhile, Zand will use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect private keys and meet high security standards. These HSMs will be stored securely in the UAE. The bank affirmed that VARA’s regulatory oversight and innovative method will give businesses a safe and compliant way to manage their digital assets. Notably, the AED stablecoin aims to support the UAE’s push for a digital economy. A Step Closer to AE Coin Recall that the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) granted in-principle approval to AED Stablecoin in October . This approval marked a step towards issuing the region’s first fully regulated, Dirham-pegged token. It also aligns with the government’s vision for the future, particularly the UAE’s Digital Government Strategy 2025. However, it brings AED Stablecoin closer to realizing its vision of launching AE Coin, a dirham-pegged digital currency. AE Coin could transform how residents and merchants engage with digital assets if fully approved. Likewise, it can become a local trading pair widely accepted for goods and services. It could also help users integrate crypto assets into their everyday lives in the UAE . Beyond Zand, UAE and Crypto Regulatory Clarity The UAE’s progressive regulatory environment is perfect for exchanges and financial institutions’ ambitious objectives. It enables them to function smoothly within an advanced financial ecosystem. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, commended the UAE for its innovative regulatory approach . He said the region is positioning itself as a model for fostering fintech advancement in a rapidly evolving global market. In June, Binance boosted its operations in the Middle East by securing a Crypto Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from VARA . As reported by TheCoinRise, the VASP license, obtained through Binance’s Dubai subsidiary, Binance FZE, is a testament to Binance’s commitment to operating within the framework of local laws and regulations.

Riot's core Bitcoin mining operation is unprofitable, and their new debt strategy to buy Bitcoin mirrors MicroStrategy but lacks a sustainable business model. Post-halving, Riot's gross margins have declined, and their valuation metrics are significantly higher than sector medians, signaling potential 68.73% downside. Despite Bitcoin's bullish outlook, Riot's continued losses and expensive valuation make it a strong sell; their business model is unsustainable. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis While Riot Platforms ( RIOT )’s shares are up nearly 20% since the last time I wrote on the stock, this doesn’t mean I have turned bullish on the crypto miner. The stock is nearing $12.50 per share after being as low as $6.36 earlier this year and $10.80 as of just a few days ago (December 10). A big driver behind the increase in the company’s shares has been the rise of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has gone up in price, I continue to believe that shares are overvalued on multiple metrics. The company recently appears to have embarked on a risky strategy of borrowing money (via convertible senior notes ) to purchase more Bitcoin. While I already was bearish on the company, I certainly believe this is not a good idea (for both shareholders and for corporate operations). I do not believe that the MicroStrategy-esque plan of borrowing to buy Bitcoin will work out for them in the long run. Their core bitcoin mining operation loses money (in dollars) and erodes any long run Bitcoin potential. This is a huge drag on the capital structure (in my opinion). Borrowing more money makes the company more levered. I don’t like it. With this, I think shares continue to be a strong sell. Why I'm Doing Follow Up Coverage A big reason why I was bearish over the summer during my previous coverage was due to Riot’s operating performance since the Bitcoin halving from April. At the time, this had not resulted in a strong, bullish outcome for Riot mining. For those who do not know what the halving event is, this is a periodic event (every 4 years) where the amount of reward (Bitcoin) miners receive is cut in half. This halving happens every time 210,000 Bitcoin blocks are mined. When Bitcoin miners’ pay is cut in half, it typically results in a major shift in Bitcoin pricing, which many times later ends up marking a new all-time high for the crypto currency. In the recent halving that took place in April, the reward for mining a block fell from 6.25 Bitcoin down to just 3.125 Bitcoin. In 2009 (right as the cryptocurrency was launched), the reward for mining a block was 50 Bitcoin. Basically, what made me so skeptical during my last coverage in July was that each Bitcoin miner Riot owns now has to work twice as hard to produce the same amount of Bitcoin. Or, for the same effort as before, they now only receive half as much payment. Ultimately, this halving led to (at the time) a 45% year-over-year decrease in Riot Platforms’ Bitcoin production. I just don’t believe investing in a Bitcoin miner is nearly as lucrative as simply investing in Bitcoin itself. With losses continuing in their mining division, a big driver for the run up in shares for Riot Platforms has been the price of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is up roughly 60% since the summer. Riot Platforms is only up ~20%. In essence, the market does not see the company that is adding more Bitcoin to its balance sheet daily (thanks to mining) as a more superior investment than the underlying asset. I think that’s telling. Now that Riot Platforms is employing a MicroStrategy-esque debt financing strategy, I wanted to go in-depth and explain why I don’t believe this will work for them. Why Their Plan Won’t Work A big reason why this won’t work for Riot Platforms has to be because of the core analysis of the business. Last quarter alone, Riot lost $154.4 million , with a big part of this coming from the depreciation of GPUs that are mining Bitcoin. The biggest reason for Riot’s struggles is this: Riot’s gross margin is declining post-halving. Riot Platforms Gross Margins (Seeking Alpha) To offset this, Riot is hoping to employ Microstrategy ( MSTR )’s strategy or borrowing funds to put Bitcoin on the company’s balance sheet. Riot’s hope is that these financing projects will allow them to purchase Bitcoin and drive shares to trade at a premium to their net asset value. Shares currently trade for less than 1x book on a forward basis. However, the main difference between MicroStrategy and Riot’s business is that MicroStrategy’s core business is a software business. This core business was actually profitable last quarter (albeit slightly). MicroStrategy Q3 Earnings (Seeking Alpha) Riot’s core business is the actual mining of Bitcoin. So the main issue for Riot is that when the company borrows money in the open market to invest in Bitcoin, you’re buying Bitcoin right at the spot price. However, they are net-losing money in this situation because the total cost of mining Bitcoin (including overhead for Riot) is higher than the proceeds they could receive for selling these mined Bitcoin right now. What this means is that, over the long run, investors who are buying shares in hope of Bitcoin bull run a need to realize that the shares are still denominated in dollars. And in dollars, the company is losing money. So, for the company’s shares to make sense, the price of each Bitcoin would need to rise in the first year faster than the corresponding loss of mining the Bitcoin. I am bullish in the long run on Bitcoin, but every asset has its down year. For Riot, this could be a major issue. Valuation When looking at Riot’s valuation metrics, there are multiple categories where shares are significantly more expensive than the sector median. For example, when looking at Riot’s TTM GAAP P/E, Seeking Alpha gives the company a grade of a D- in this metric. The reason for the poor grade is simple. Riot’s TTM GAAP P/E is incredibly high at 232.35. This is a concerning 629.61% higher than the sector median of just 31.85. On a forward price-to-sales basis, Riot is also very expensive. The company has a forward price-to-sales ratio of 10.65, which is more than 220.09% higher than the sector median of 3.33. Seeking Alpha gives Riot a grade of a D on this metric. The company is projected to see losses per share more than double over the next 12 months and will likely have to issue more stock/debt just to operate their mining business versus directly expanding their Bitcoin holdings. In my opinion, this is an inefficient way to acquire Bitcoin. I think shares should trade at the sector median price-to-sales ratio. If we saw shares converge on a price-to-sales basis of 3.33, down from 10.65, this would represent 68.73% downside for the company. Bull Thesis I think the biggest bull thesis for Riot relies on the Bitcoin miner figuring out how to get their core Bitcoin mining business profitable. What I mean by this is not that they get profitable just by mining Bitcoin directly. What I mean is that they should get creative with their GPU assets to control costs. There are a couple ways to do this. Some steel mil l and sauna bathhouses are trying to put a focus on Bitcoin mining, helping them capture their excess heat. Repurposing heat is not a new practice. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency , it's common for companies to use excess heat to repurpose for generating electricity. Energyintensive processes—such as those occurring at refineries, steel mills, glass furnaces, and cement kilns—all release hot exhaust gases and waste streams that can be harnessed with well-established technologies to generate electricity... This electricity can mine Bitcoin. The problem for Riot in this case is the obvious one: they don’t own any steel mills or sauna bathhouses. They would likely need to partner, and this messes with what little economies of scale the firm has that allows them to be profitable (on a gross profit basis). For Riot, they’ve built their entire business around mining for Bitcoin. Now, some activist investors (like Starboard Value who took a stake as I was writing this) think the company can repurpose some of their GPUs and mining facilities towards AI data centers. On the surface, this doesn’t feel like a bad idea. The issue with running a datacenter (as opposed to crypto mining) is that the datacenter industry is a two sided market place. Here, Riot will have to supply computers and match it with customers. For Bitcoin? The demand for computers in the form of proof of work is already there. It's not as easy as building datacenter capacity and expecting clients to come. Takeaway While being a pro Bitcoin company should be a boost to Riot, the Bitcoin miner is incredibly expensive on a series of valuation metrics, and continues to lose money with guidance showing losses should continue next year. Now, the company is issuing debt to buy Bitcoin. I just don’t think this is sustainable. While some may want to compare Riot’s business model to a similar, but different, plan run by MicroStrategy, I’m just not confident this will work. Riot’s core business just loses too much money in my opinion. I think this is why shares have underperformed the overall Bitcoin rally. With this, while the stock is in an overall space I like, I continue to believe that shares are a strong sell.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744318-riot-platforms-stock-microstrategy-plan-may-not-work?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37640567.jpeg

Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homo-shiba-inu-homoshib-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37640129,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627547,1734195612,US Treasury Secretary Yellen tells Trump “Don’t politicize bank supervision”,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has a message for President-elect Donald Trump: back off from meddling in the regulation of the American banking system. She called out Trump’s transition team for reportedly eyeing drastic cuts or mergers in Washington’s top financial oversight agencies. Naturally, his return to power has raised questions about how far his administration might go to upend financial regulations built over decades. Yellen, speaking as she prepares to hand over the Treasury keys to Trump’s nominee Scott Bessent, made it clear she’s not against change, but radical interference? That’s a no-go. Banking regulations under the microscope “Bankers always complain about over-regulation,” Yellen said . She admitted it’s fair to look at cutting red tape where costs outweigh benefits. But she defended core regulations on banks’ capital, liquidity, and risk-taking. “These are essential for a stable banking system and economy,” she emphasized. Yellen’s concerns aren’t baseless. She pointed to the sudden collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023. These failures, she said, were stark reminders of what happens when banks aren’t properly supervised. With a century of history as proof, Yellen argued that bank oversight and deposit insurance are non-negotiable to avoid another financial meltdown. She also hinted at rumors about Trump’s team exploring ways to shrink or even eliminate key regulatory bodies. While she didn’t have specifics, she made her opinion known: less oversight is a recipe for chaos. Financial stability or political games? The Dodd-Frank Act is a post-2008 financial crisis legislation designed to prevent systemic risks. This law gave birth to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve’s financial stability division, and the Treasury’s Office of Financial Research. Critics said it would strangle banks, but Yellen countered that U.S. banks are thriving despite initial complaints. “U.S. banks are doing exceptionally well,” she said, dismissing early fears that Dodd-Frank would ruin their competitiveness. For Yellen, the system isn’t perfect, but it works. And while she acknowledged ongoing debates about merging some agencies, she made it clear that dismantling safeguards isn’t the way forward. The elimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision post-2008, for example, happened without causing harm, but further consolidation hasn’t been her focus. Trump’s approach to financial oversight could go hand-in-hand with his broader economic goals. His administration is expected to revisit his hallmark 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which delivered sweeping changes for businesses and individuals. During his campaign, Trump promised to extend those tax cuts and proposed new policies like eliminating taxes on tips, scrapping Social Security taxes for seniors, and lifting the $10,000 SALT deduction cap. Tax battles brewing With 2025 approaching, uncertainty looms over Trump’s tax policies. The TCJA was a game-changer in 2017, slashing corporate tax rates and providing temporary benefits for individuals. Financial advisors have been urging wealthy clients to plan for estate tax changes, with the current $13.99 million exemption per person set to revert to 2017 levels if Congress doesn’t extend it. Trump’s past legislative surprises, like the last-minute passage of the TCJA in December 2017, left little time for analysis before major changes kicked in. Tax advisors remember the confusion surrounding the qualified business income deduction, which gave a 20% tax break to pass-through businesses but came with a complicated multi-step calculation.

Treasure announced in September that it was migrating its ecosystem of 15+ games from Arbitrum onto its own layer-2 rollup within the ZKsync Elastic Chain ecosystem. The move drew criticisms of “grant-hopping.” Treasure was the top gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum, accounting for about 95% of gaming /NFT-related transactions on the chain. Treasure DAO co-founder Karel Vuong previously acknowledged that they received a grant from ZKsync, but the motivation driving the migration was more so to pick “the right partner” for scalability. To migrate $190 million worth of its native token, MAGIC, from Arbitrum to the new layer-2, Treasure is leveraging Hyperlane’s interoperability framework.

According to a press release, Treasure has several game developments underway, including “Bitmates’ conversion of their MMORPG into a fully onchain system integrating the Magicswap GEX, Zeeverse’s evolution into a multichain MMORPG, Calamity’s migration from Base, and numerous planned token generation events across its games.” Adidas launches co-branded physical shoes with STEPN GO As part of a partnership with Web3 walk-to-earn game STEPN, Adidas is launching a 1,200 limited-edition collection Ultraboost 5 running shoes.

But surprisingly, BlackRock has revealed no recent plans to file an ETF application for XRP or any other altcoins. This has sparked speculations in the crypto community, as BlackRock was the driving force behind the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. Over the past few months, several XRP enthusiasts were anticipating an XRP ETF filing from BlackRock. It all started after a fake XRP ETF filing from the company was filed on the State of Delaware website last year. At that time, the price of XRP soared by over 15%. Focus on Bitcoin, Ether ETFs However, BlackRock quickly denied the report, emphasizing that the filing was fake. Jay Jacobs, head of BlackRock’s ETF department, turned down the rumors surrounding the company’s plan to file an XRP ETF application. He noted that even Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have only reached a few people yet, and the company will focus on expanding the coverage of these two types of ETFs currently. Jacobs pointed out that only a small fraction of BlackRock’s clients currently own shares of iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). He emphasized the need to widen their accessibility to a wider range of clients, stressing that there are no immediate plans to introduce new ETFs tied to altcoins like XRP. Bloomberg’s ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas shared Jacob’s comment on X earlier this week. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA ) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)” – Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs in Depth. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2024 Notably, Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree filed applications for XRP ETF, with expectations of approval by the end of 2025. The comment from BlackRock comes after rumors of an imminent XRP ETF amid recent positive developments in the crypto industry. While BlackRock has decided to delay further Crypto ETFs, however, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and ETF Store president Nate Geraci are bullish on the launch. A Good Decision? Also, some investors have backed BlackRock’s decision and noted that a step-by-step approach is better than launching a new ETF toon early, which could only worsen the volatility. Moreover, Grayscale XRP Trust has recorded a robust 300% return since May. A well-known crypto market figure Ben Armstrong, known as “The BitBoy,” asserted that a robust return is a “good sign” of a potential XRP ETF launch in the US soon.

Speaking at a seminar organized by the Pheu Thai Party in Hua Hin on December 13, Thaksin shared his belief that Bitcoin adoption could significantly impact the Thai economy, especially the tourism sector. He noted that friends in his circle have predicted that the price of Bitcoin could rise to $850,000 and that Thai people should be informed about cryptocurrency trends. Thaksin said his daughter and current Thai Prime Minister Paethongtarn Shinawatra has instructed his administration to explore Bitcoin’s potential as a payment method, particularly in tourist hotspots such as Phuket and Hua Hin. A sandbox program is being considered to test Bitcoin transactions in these cities and allow tourists to spend their Bitcoin directly. Thaksin also floated the idea of issuing stablecoins backed by government bonds as a way to inject liquidity into the economy without printing additional banknotes. He suggested the approach could help Thailand overcome economic challenges while maintaining financial stability. “The Thai people should think about and understand this trend,” Thaksin said. Related News: Anticipated Development in Bitcoin: Good News Announced For Big Bull MicroStrategy During his speech, Thaksin also warned of potential trade tensions with the US, especially with Donald Trump expected to return as US president. He highlighted concerns that Trump could impose higher tariffs on Thailand due to its trade surplus with the US, and even hinted at the possibility of the US using Bitcoin to pay off its national debt, underscoring the growing importance of digital currencies in global politics. The seminar, held at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hua Hin, was part of the Pheu Thai Party’s initiative to improve the skills of its lawmakers and political staff. The seminar featured key figures from the party, including Prime Minister Paethongtarn Shinawatra and former Prime Minister Settha Thavisin. Discussions focused on Thailand’s economic adaptation to global trends, with a focus on digital currency integration and financial innovation. Thaksin acknowledged that his comments on cryptocurrencies and taxation, including a potential 15% VAT on Bitcoin transactions, had raised concerns. Thaksin explained that his comments were intended to provoke thought and research rather than recommend immediate policy changes. *This is not investment advice.

He urged Thai people to stay informed about the cryptocurrency’s potential and its increasing relevance to the global economy. During a special lecture on December 13, 2024, Thaksin said that he isn’t calling for people to buy Bitcoin (BTC), but reiterated, “The trend is like that.” “There are already many cryptocurrencies. Some people say that in the future, we will have more currencies than countries. Today, Thai people must think and understand this.” he continued. Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand and the father of the current prime minister, said on the 13th that his friends believe that Bitcoin will reach $850,000, and the Thai people should learn and stay informed, which will undoubtedly be reflected in… pic.twitter.com/UVopRoN1Bf — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 14, 2024 He warned the Thai trade sector about the potential return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, noting that Thailand must be cautious about possible tax increases and the impact of a trade surplus with the U.S. Thaksin noted that some believe Trump might use Bitcoin to help pay down U.S. debt, a point that generated attention. Thaksin: Crypto adoption is the trend In his lecture, Thaksin discussed his ideas for Thailand’s economic future, particularly with regard to the use of stablecoins. He revealed that Prime Minister Shinawatra had instructed the Ministry of Finance to explore the possibility of a pilot program in Phuket to allow Bitcoin payments and study the issuance of stablecoins backed by government bonds. According to the former Prime Minister, this would serve as an alternative to printing new banknotes and could help inject liquidity into the economy without burdening the country with additional public debt . Thaksin also addressed the country’s economic challenges, noting that Thailand’s GDP growth was sluggish. However, he was optimistic about the outlook for 2025. He predicted a 3.5% GDP growth next year and suggested that a 4.0% GDP growth in 2026 would be feasible. “I’m still not satisfied because if GDP is less than 5 percent, our country will be inferior to other countries in ASEAN,” he remarked. In terms of monetary policy, Thaksin expressed concerns about the current state of the Thai economy, mentioning that the money supply was limited due to commercial banks’ reluctance to take risks and lend. As a result, he argued, the Thai government must find ways to stimulate economic activity without further increasing the country’s already high public debt. He suggested that addressing the deficit and increasing tax revenue were essential but difficult challenges. Thaksin’s remarks follow the Constitutional Court’s removal from office in August 2024. He was ousted for breaching ethics rules related to his appointment of a convicted lawyer to his Cabinet​. Thailand regulators on course for crypto adoption For months, Thailand has been seeking ways to integrate crypto into its broader financial landscape. The country ranked 10th in Chainalysis’ 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index, and several cryptocurrency exchanges received licenses to operate within its jurisdiction. While institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals have been permitted to invest in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , regulators have stressed the importance of contingency plans for custodians in case of disruptions. According to Nares Laopannarai, President of the Digital Asset Association of Thailand, the overall crypto regulatory framework is unlikely to change drastically, though he pointed out that the government’s digital wallet policy, introduced under Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s administration, might be impacted by political shifts. Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also introduced a Digital Asset Regulatory Sandbox aimed at fostering innovation in the country’s cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Announced in early August, the initiative provides a controlled environment where businesses can safely test and develop digital asset services under the oversight of regulators. This program seeks to balance innovation with compliance by allowing companies to experiment with new technologies while adhering to established rules. It is part of the SEC’s strategy to encourage advancements in the digital economy while keeping investors safe and ensuring market stability.

A crypto analyst has highlighted a pattern of higher highs, solidifying his optimistic price projection of an imminent price surge for SHIB. Shiba Inu Price Gears Up For 130% Rally Klejdi Cuni, a TradingView crypto analyst, has released a detailed chart analysis displaying a bullish set-up for the Shiba Inu price. The chart highlights an ascending oval trend, with Shiba Inu consistently making higher highs on the daily. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week The analyst disclosed that Shiba Inu has repeatedly faced strong support around the $0.00002424 level for about a month. This retest of the support level signals an Accumulation zone, where buyers consistently step in to avoid further price decline. Sharing a price chart, the analyst has set several upward targets as Shiba Inu continues its bullish trajectory. The sharp upward curve in the chart also indicates that the SHIB price could enter a strong parabolic move upwards after breaking key resistance levels. Cuni projects a steady but substantial price increase for Shiba Inu, projecting that the meme coin could surge 130% to reach an initial target of $0.00003232 in the near-term resistance. The analyst has also predicted that Shiba Inu could hit a second target at $0.00004167. If Shiba Inu can maintain its bullish momentum and stay above $0.000041, Cuni believes a significant breakout level to the third target at $0.00005675. Finally, representing the highest target on the price chart, the TradingView analyst forecasts a massive surge to $0.00007012. Although reaching these bullish price targets would mark a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu price, it would still fall well below the meme coin’s all-time high of $0.000086. This all-time high was achieved during the bull run in 2021 when the demand and price of meme coins surged dramatically.

The meme coin had been one of the top gainers of this bull market, having surged above $0.00003 recently.

French Hill says establishing a clear market structure for digital assets is one of his top three priorities as the newly elected House Financial Services Committee chairman. Hill (R-Arkansas), a staunch supporter of the crypto sector, secured the chairmanship earlier this week, taking over for retiring fellow GOP lawmaker Patrick McHenry (R-North Carolina). The Arkansas legislator tells CNBC in a new interview that crypto doesn’t currently have “rules of the road” and needs new legislation. “Under Chairman Gensler, we had just regulation by enforcement. This is not helping America succeed, not helping technological advancement, innovation for web3, the use of blockchain both in publicly traded companies and in financial services. So that is the top priority for us, and our Majority Leader Steve Scalise has it on his ‘First 100 Days of the House [Agenda]’ is to move a regulatory structure bill for digital assets.” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler announced that he would step down from his post in January. Under Gensler’s leadership, the securities watchdog launched high-profile enforcement actions against many crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. Hill has an “A” rating from Stand With Crypto, a digital asset advocacy group backed by top US crypto exchange Coinbase. The Arkansas lawmaker has criticized the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for allegedly having “pressured banks to sever ties with entire industries like crypto.” Hill promised in November that the House Financial Services Committee would work with President-elect Donald Trump to halt that pressure and conduct an investigation.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin hits $100K, Ethereum steadies, and new altcoin Yeti Ouro nears presale end with under 10% remaining. Table of Contents Bitcoin price to $150,000 and Ethereum price to $10,000 Analysts eye Yeti Ouro Bitcoin continues to soar this week, reclaiming $100,000 after a slight dip midweek, and analysts expect BTC prie to hit $150,000 within the next year as more governments seek to adopt it in their national strategic reserves. Ethereum has been trading around $4,000, but as the altcoin season beckons, experts expect it to triple in price. Meanwhile, analysts are turning their attention to the new Ethereum-based altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) as it winds up the first stage of its presale, with less than 10% left. You might also like: The race to $1: Dogecoin vs. Shiba Inu vs. Yeti Ouro Bitcoin price to $150,000 and Ethereum price to $10,000 Since it hit its new all-time high of $103,475 in early December, Bitcoin has been trading sideways, dipping to a weekly low of $94,600 earlier this week. It has since recovered and trades just above $100,000. However, the top crypto might not stay at this level for long. Bitcoin adoption is expected to skyrocket in the new year once Donald Trump takes over as the US president. Trump has already pledged to establish a national BTC strategic reserve that would hold over $100 billion worth of the crypto, and his trusted lieutenant, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, has promised to make this a reality in the first 100 days. The US will be the first, but it certainly won’t be the last. Poland, Brazil, and now Russia have all kickstarted similar moves, which could make BTC a strategic asset for some of the world’s most powerful and prosperous nations. The US states of Pennsylvania and Texas have also started state-level BTC accumulation campaigns. Beyond governments, enterprises are expected to lead the BTC accumulation. $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock now advises professional investors to allocate up to 2% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. It says this would result in similar gains to the Magnificent Seven stocks (Google, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Nvidia and Microsoft). Meanwhile, ETH price is expected to finally kick into gear as the altcoin season starts. Data from CCData shows that trading volume hit a yearly high in November, driven by altcoins. Crypto Quant data further shows that the movement of funds from BTC to altcoins is at a yearly low, which shows that new money is flowing into altcoins. All these factors point to an impending altcoin season, and Ethereum is the default leader and could hit $10,000 in the first half of 2025. Analysts eye Yeti Ouro While BTC and ETH prices show great promise in 2025, analysts are fixated on another altcoin, Yeti Ouro, for the 2025 bull market. Yeti Ouro ’s ongoing presale has raised over $1 million, with investors snapping up over 85 million tokens. The first stage of the presale ends in a couple of days, and investors will no longer access YETIO at the discounted price of $0.012. Yeti Ouro combines the adrenaline of gaming with the thrill of meme coins and the reward of play-to-earn gaming through Yeti Go, its thrilling and immersive racing game. Built using the Unreal Engine, Yeti Go allows users to compete against a worldwide pool of competitors, with the winners receiving YETIO token rewards. YETIO can also be used to purchase weapons to gain an advantage, staked to unlock exclusive rewards or used to pay for items on the in-game marketplace.

Bitcoin price remains still above $101K, but prices of Ethereum and the other altcoins are facing strong upward pressure. Meanwhile, the Chianlink (LINK) price is fighting against the bearish influence and has launched a strong bullish attack and surged above $30. After a rise of over 10%, will the LINK price continue to hold strong bullish momentum? Will it reach $50 before the end of 2024? LINK price has been displaying massive strength since November, after breaking above the consolidation below $15. However, the token constantly formed higher highs and lows and reached the levels just below the resistance zone between $27.5 and $28.32. Bears tried hard to restrict the levels below $29, but the current breakout above $30 suggests the beginning of a fresh bullish wave. Considering the current trade setup, it suggests that the Chainlink price is trading forming ascending waves, similar to Elliot waves. If the LINK price rally follows the same pattern, then the upcoming highs could be above $40. A popular analyst, Da rky, foresees a massive bullish wave incoming for the LINK price rally, which could push the token above the consolidation. The price has completed 2 waves of Elliot and is in the middle of the third wave, which could be above a 3-digit figure as suggested by the analyst in the long term. Meanwhile, in the short term, the next pitstop for the rally could be above $40, somewhere around $41.5, which could be achieved before the end of 2025. Therefore, the Chainlink price currently appears to be quite explosive while the volume continues to contract. The drop in the volume from over $4 billion to levels around $2 billion in the times when the price continues to rise suggests a drop in the sell-offs. Therefore, the fear of a small pullback still hovers over the crypto, which may intensify as the LINK price reaches $35. Hence, if the bulls clear this pivotal resistance, then the LINK price is expected to rally close to $50.",POSITIVE,LINK,ALTCOIN | BTC | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/chinalink-poised-for-a-20-upswing-this-weekend-will-link-price-make-it-to-50-in-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37639093,https://finbold.com/?p=219529,1734193637,"Here’s when Bitcoin will hit $150,000, according to analyst","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has entered a short-term consolidation phase above the $100,000 mark. However, technical indicators and historical price movement suggest that the maiden digital asset still has the potential to add $50,000 to its value in the current cycle. Amid this potential new high, Bitcoin has shown minimal movement on the daily chart. The asset has grown by a modest 0.8% to trade at $101,600 as of press time. On the weekly chart, BTC is up almost 4%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Indeed, Bitcoin looks set to continue with the current bullish sentiment based on the technical setup. The asset is trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), signaling bullish momentum both for the near and long term. At the same time, market sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish, supported by an ‘Extreme Greed’ score of 83 on the ‘Fear & Greed Index.’ Bitcoin’s path to $150,000 Regarding the digital asset’s path to $150,000, this outlook is backed by the ‘3 Expansion Phases’ pattern formation, according to an analysis by trading expert TradingShot in a TradingView post on December 14. Notably, the ‘3 Expansion Phases’ refer to periods of sharp upward price movement, separated by brief consolidations, forming a repeating pattern that signals the continuation of a bullish trend. According to the pattern, Bitcoin could trade at $150,000 before the summer of 2025. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/TradingShot TradingShot noted that Bitcoin is in its third ‘Expansion Phase’, marked by a mid-phase consolidation within the 0.382 – 0.5 Fibonacci range on the weekly chart—a pattern previously serving as a launchpad for higher moves as momentum builds. Supporting this outlook, the one-week relative strength index ( RSI ) is again turning sideways, a signal that preceded surges in past cycles, suggesting room for further growth. With Bitcoin trading near $101,000 and holding above key support like the 50-week MA, TradingShot predicted the Channel Up pattern could push Bitcoin to $150,000 before summer. “This indicates that there is still plenty of room to rise. Based on that, a 150k Target is technically plausible before summer,” the expert said. Bitcoin’s price institutional outlook Indeed, the expert’s Bitcoin price prediction and this timeline partly align with several estimates by major institutions. For instance, as reported by Finbold, banking giant Standard Chartered projects Bitcoin will trade at $200,000 in 2025, a move that would likely see its market cap hit close to $4 trillion. According to the bank’s analyst Geoff Kendrick, institutional capital inflows will primarily drive the price target. In the same breath, on December 13, investment management firm VanEck noted that the current bull run will likely extend into 2025 and peak in the first three months of the new year. To this end, the entity projected that Bitcoin could hit a high of $180,000. When looking at the short-term price projections, Bitcoin analysis shared by trading analyst Captain Faibik in an X post on December 14 observed that the asset would likely break out as it forms a classic ascending triangle pattern on the eight-hour chart. The ascending triangle, characterized by a horizontal resistance line and a rising trendline of support, signals that buyers steadily push the price higher. At the same time, sellers struggle to maintain control at resistance levels. This builds momentum, often resulting in a decisive breakout to the upside, with the analyst projecting the next target to be $112,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: CryptoCove While market sentiments and fundamentals point to a bullish continuation for Bitcoin, CryptoQuant’s on-chain analysis identified periods when investors should exit their positions. In a December 13 blog post , the onchain analysis platform warned that when Bitcoin’s supply ‘in loss’ drops below 4%, it signals the peak of the bull run and the time to begin selling aggressively. “When the BTC supply loss % goes below 4% you should start dcaing aggressively out of BTC and wait for the next bear market lows,” the platform noted. Reflecting on the previous bull market, which ended in late 2021, the platform noted that failing to sell during this phase resulted in missed opportunities to lock in profits and avoid the subsequent market crash. In this case, the market is witnessing similar conditions, hence the need to be on the lookout. As things stand, Bitcoin’s new area of focus is the $100,000 support, as dropping below this level could signal additional losses. Finally, with the current short-term consolidation, bulls can build on the current valuation and target the $105,000 zone.

The move comes after Yoon’s controversial attempt to impose martial law in early December, which opposition leaders condemned as a threat to democratic order. According to the Financial Times, opposition leader Lee Jae-Myung successfully rallied lawmakers to support the impeachment, framing it as essential to restoring stability in the wake of Yoon’s failed martial law declaration. The impeachment motion passed decisively, with a 204-85 vote in the 300-seat National Assembly. Opposition parties hold a legislative majority and needed only minimal support from Yoon’s conservative People Power Party (PPP) to meet the required two-thirds threshold. Breaking news: South Korea’s parliament has voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol https://t.co/ecKAn0zyhM pic.twitter.com/2lSL5kFQHM — Financial Times (@FT) December 14, 2024 Following the parliamentary vote, Yoon’s presidential duties were immediately suspended. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, a Yoon appointee and veteran bureaucrat, will serve as interim leader. The Constitutional Court must now determine the impeachment’s validity, with a verdict expected within 180 days. Although the timeline is not binding, the court’s decision will determine whether Yoon is permanently removed from office or reinstated. Crypto market reactions and economic concerns Today’s vote rattled financial markets, weakening the South Korean won. The currency slipped 0.31% against the U.S. dollar, plummeting after the USDKRW rate climbed to 1,435.51 on Friday. Market analysts have attributed the fall to heightened political instability Meanwhile, Ripple XRP in South Korea’s markets saw a small price uptick, going up by 1.35% to trade for 3,495 won in the last 24 hours, according to the exchange’s data. Despite the political instability scares, XRP has performed exponentially. The coin has garnered a 258% price increase over the last 30 days and a 321% year-to-date return. Source: TradingView Recent updates also show that trading volumes on Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, have declined by about 14% in the last day to a monthly low of $4,841,140. The won’s decline aligns with broader economic challenges. According to statistics from Trading Economics, Import prices in South Korea rose 3% year-on-year in November, reversing two months of declines. Export prices surged 7%, extending their growth streak to 11 months. These figures highlight persistent inflationary pressures, even as economic sentiment weakens. South Korea’s finance ministry pledged to implement additional measures to stabilize markets if volatility increases. Meanwhile, analysts expect the Bank of Korea to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in January, with further reductions anticipated through 2025. Projections suggest the benchmark rate could drop to 2%, reflecting efforts to counter political and economic headwinds South Koreans “okay” with President’s impeachment Yoon, a former prosecutor and first-term president, had narrowly survived an earlier impeachment motion last Saturday when PPP lawmakers boycotted the vote. However, mounting dissent within his party and public backlash over the martial law attempt ultimately undermined his position. Despite initial resistance, cracks appeared within the PPP. Party leader Han Dong-hoon advised members to vote “based on their own conviction and conscience,” signaling a shift in the party’s stance. The turning point reportedly came after Yoon’s combative speech on Thursday, in which he lashed out at critics and vowed to “fight to the end.” Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, enduring frigid temperatures to demand President Yoon’s resignation, as lawmakers passed a vote with 204 in favor and 85 opposed. Outside the National Assembly, where the protests had transformed into celebrations after the vote, one demonstrator, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN, “He certainly waged war on the citizens, and this outcome is what he deserved.” Another protester succinctly expressed their sentiment to CNN, saying, “Democracy is back!” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-surges-in-skorea-won-tanks-impeachment/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37638983.jpeg

VanEck’s Bold Price Prediction for SOL appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing consolidation in the cryptocurrency landscape, asset management giant VanEck has made a bold prediction for Solana (SOL). This forecast has captured widespread attention from the global crypto community, particularly as it comes during a period when SOL has been struggling consistently. VanEck Predicts $500 for Solana In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), VanEck stressed that the crypto bull market is expected to reach a medium-term peak in Q1 and set new highs in Q4 of 2025. The post also noted that during this bull run, Solana’s (SOL) price could hit a new high of $500. VanEck 10 Crypto Predictions for 2025 Prediction #1: Crypto bull market hits a medium-term peak in Q1, sets new highs in Q4. We project Bitcoin to be valued at around $180,000, Ethereum to trade above $6,000, Solana to exceed $500, and Sui to surpass $10. — VanEck (@vaneck_us) December 13, 2024 This prediction appears achievable, as SOL is poised for a massive rally, having formed a bullish price action pattern. Solana’s (SOL) Bullish Breakout Levels to Watch According to expert technical analysis, SOL has been consolidating for over three weeks and has formed a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern on the daily timeframe. A flag-and-pole is a price action pattern that traders and investors use to build long positions over different time periods if the price breaches or breaks out of the pattern. Source: Trading View However, SOL appears to be struggling to break out of this pattern. According to technical analysis, if SOL successfully breaks out and closes a daily candle above the $236 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 70% to reach the $415 level in the coming days. Additionally, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently near the oversold region, indicating that the asset is poised for upside momentum. This bullish thesis will remain valid only if SOL breaks out of this price action pattern and closes a daily candle above the $236 level; otherwise, it may fail. 81% of Traders Long on SOL SOL’s technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, the Binance SOLUSDT long/short ratio currently stands at 4.28, indicating strong bullish sentiment among traders. At present, 81.05% of top Binance traders hold long positions, while only 18.95% hold short positions. These on-chain metrics and technical analysis indicate that the bulls are currently dominating the asset, which could support SOL in breaching the bullish pattern. Current Price Momentum At press time, SOL is trading near $222 and has experienced a price decline of 0.75% in the past 24 hours.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

At the heart of his analysis is BlackRock’s influential recommendation for a 2% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin-a seal of approval that shows institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency. The endorsement from the world’s largest asset manager could pave the way for broader acceptance among both institutional and retail investors. He also pointed out that Bitcoin ETFs have seen unprecedented success, setting new performance records. This rise in popularity of ETFs underlines the growing demand on the part of investors for easier access to BTC without holding the asset directly. Besides these financial milestones, Hougan pointed to high-profile endorsements as another catalyst for BTC mainstream credibility. For example, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has recently spoken about the need to own some Bitcoin in a diversified portfolio. And Donald Trump’s appearance as a keynote speaker at a major Bitcoin conference is an indication of growing political acceptance of the cryptocurrency, marking a shift in perception of it as a legitimate financial asset. Florida Might Put Bitcoin into Reserve Adding to Bitcoin’s momentum, Florida is mulling the creation of a state-backed Bitcoin reserve that may launch as early as 2025. Samuel Armes, President of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), has presented an investment plan where 1% of the $185.7 billion pension fund in Florida will be invested in BTC, which could potentially make it a $1.857 billion reserve. Another part of the proposal is an investment into 1% of the state’s $116.5 billion budget surplus, which can add another $1.165 billion. Armes argued that such a move would not only diversify Florida’s investment portfolio but would also position the state at the front in the innovation of blockchain. He noted that the state pension fund already has indirect exposure to cryptocurrency through hedge funds and investments in companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. The legislative environment in Florida is another factor supporting this proposal. With a pro-crypto stance, lawmakers are likely to view the initiative favorably. Armes revealed plans to push for this reserve alongside three other Bitcoin-focused bills during the upcoming legislative session, highlighting Florida’s potential to set a precedent for other states considering similar moves. These events underline Bitcoin’s increasing embedment within the mainstream financial systems and political frameworks, further giving credence to its meteoric rise.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bitwise-cio-highlights-key-signals-for-bitcoins-path/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Cash App's integration with Square, including rewards and financial services, enhances user engagement and shareholder value. I am highly bullish on Block, considering it my top long pick for 2025, with significant growth potential in its intertwined ecosystems. After a post-COVID boom and the sharp selloff during the inflationary bust that followed, Block, Inc ( SQ ) remained range bound for over two years. The stock finally broke out during the first trading week of December, bringing renewed attention to the beaten down Fintech. Data by YCharts I initiated coverage of Block in February of 2023. Much of the narrative that existed in early 2023 still exists today: the company has two sprawling ecosystems that it has been stitching together for several years. Each segment has its own distinct market positions and competitive advantages. These segments work in harmony to create an enormous opportunity for Block that I believe the market is underappreciating. I believe Block could be one of the best, if not the best, performing stocks in 2025. Block is my top long pick for 2025 and I am more bullish than ever on the company. Square The Square segment, offering POS (point-of-sale) payment terminals, has given SMB's (small-to-medium sized businesses) access to a suite of hardware and software required to run a modern, digital native business. It allows businesses of all sizes to build websites, track inventory, facilitate vendor orders, manage timesheets, pay employees, run marketing campaigns, start rewards programs, schedule client appointments, and a host of other services that are critical to scale a business in the internet age. Block focuses on several distinct verticals with unique needs like restaurants and beauty shops, but the product set is broadly the same. Square carved out a strong market position by following a 'trust, then verify' model for merchant onboarding. This flew in direct opposition to the prevailing approach at the time and solved a key issue facing many small merchants. The company was founded in 2009, at a time when it was becoming clear that businesses had to accept card payments to survive and scale. At the time, processing card payments required a bank account. However, many very small merchants (think: your local farmers market) struggled to get bank accounts because they didn't have meaningful sales. They struggled to generate meaningful sales because they couldn't accept card payments! Banks are conservative institutions, especially in 2009 in the wake of the Great Financial Crisis, so they follow a 'verify, then trust' approach to KYC (Know Your Customer). Jack Dorsey and his Cofounder Jack McKelvey solved this issue by creating a tiny dongle that attached to smart phones and processed card payments without requiring a bank account. This technology quickly began spreading in a very grassroots way, and today many companies have grown because Square opened them to the world of electronic payments. This market is more saturated today than it once was, and Square's GPV growth has been in sequential decline for a few quarters. Inflation weakened the consumer while rapidly rising rates reduced access to cheap capital for SMBs. These are temporary headwinds that matter little to Square long-term. Square's product set becomes extremely entrenched once businesses have grown with it. The longer a merchant uses Square, the stickier it becomes. Now, Block is focused on deepening its product set with new hardware and software offerings, expanding traditional banking services with loans and lines of credit, and making it easier for businesses to buy bitcoin. Finally, tying the Cash App ecosystem more closely together with the Square ecosystem has been the key focus in 2024. Cash App users can see their rewards balances with Square merchants in the app, can access cheap short-term debt with Afterpay, and can see Square merchant advertisements as well. Tying the square ecosystem closer together with Cash App will generate enormous value for shareholders over time, but the benefits will take time to fully materialize. Cash App Similar to Square, Cash App carved out a sticky customer base driven largely by a differentiated go-to-market strategy. Unlike Venmo, a Cash App account doesn't require linking an external bank account. New users can be onboarded simply by receiving money from an existing user, making the CAC (customer acquisition cost) extremely low. Ease of onboarding plus referral bonuses allowed Cash App to easily proliferate its target markets but has also resulted in a user base with a much lower average net worth than Venmo. Cash App's relatively loose KYC standards (which have been improving) attracted a certain narrative about the user base that was the target of a short report in 2023. I discussed the report here . There were accusations of inflated user base metrics and rampant fraud, but the company shrugged the report off and Cash App has continued to grow well. Block did tighten up KYC standards and worked to collect more accurate information on all users, with stepped up KYC requirements based on transaction complexity. For example, a simple P2P (peer-to-peer) payment only requires a Cash App account, which only requires name and phone number. However, if you want a CashApp Card, to buy or sell Bitcoin or stocks, or to open a savings account, you'll need a government issued ID, a social security number, and a range of other basic KYC information. Cash App has a sticky user base because it catered to an underserved population. Many Cash App users wouldn't have access to modern financial tools without the app, so it has naturally become indispensable to them. The company has leaned into this with the ""Banking Our Base"" strategy set off in 2024. Management is focused on deepening the Cash App product suite and making it more enticing for higher-income individuals and families too. Users can access high-yield savings, setup direct deposit, buy/sell bitcoin and stocks, and can even manage their taxes in the app. Users can also get a debit card linked to their Cash App. As with all Fintech apps, user quality is of utmost importance for sustained success. The best way to increase user quality is by deepening relationships either by attracting new money from existing users or by increasing average products per customer. Block has mostly focused on products per customer, but the Bitcoin bull run has also made many Cash App users richer. Cash App users selling their bitcoin not only generates fee revenue for Block but also essentially brings new money into the ecosystem. By expanding access to financial services, Cash App has created a robust network of stick users that add enormous value to the Block enterprise. With the Banking Our Base strategy, Block has effectively scaled a modern-day digital bank without any of the expensive brick-and-mortar overhead. Traditional big banks have high customer acquisition costs, long onboarding periods, strict KYC requirements for basic services, and outdated technology. They attempt to attract customers by offering the best rates (which is a race-to-the-bottom pricing game), the fullest product set, and relationship-based servicing. Cash App did this the opposite. It attracted a sticky user base by offering a quality product for free. Then, the company built out its product set and deepen relationships with its users. This has resulted in a culture of trust for Cash App and has led many people to become dependent on it for their financial livelihood. Cash App is becoming increasingly like SoFi ( SOFI ) and decreasingly like Venmo. Today, the market basically only analyzes Block's enterprise value as a sum of parts of the Square and Cash App segments. This isn't appropriate. Block is one of the leading providers of Bitcoin services and is an enormous benefactor to Bitcoin's ongoing rise. Ignoring Block's bitcoin business is a critical error in analyzing the company. Bitcoin The Bitcoin network achieved a major milestone and recently eclipsed $100,000 per bitcoin. At face value, this benefits Block enormously. For one, Block maintains one of the largest corporate bitcoin treasuries, holding 8,068 btc. The company has also begun dollar-cost-averaging into a larger btc position by using 10% of its Bitcoin gross profit to buy additional btc. Second, as mentioned earlier, Block allows both Square merchants and Cash App users easy access to buy bitcoin. Any Square merchants or Cash App users that used these services have become richer with money that is invested in Block's network. Any buying or selling of bitcoin results in fee revenue for Block and as merchants or users sell their bitcoin at a profit they'll bring more cash into Block's ecosystem organically. By allowing easier access to the Bitcoin network, Block is enriching its user base. It doesn't stop there, though. A market price of $100,000 means that there is approximately $46.8m in new bitcoin minted each day (using 3.25 btc minted every 10 minutes). Bitcoin mining, the process of solving puzzles on the blockchain to earn bitcoin rewards, is a highly competitive industry that depends on highly specialized hardware. With nearly $50m in new btc being created daily, the mining industry has blossomed into highly competitive space. Similar to AI companies, Bitcoin miners need the best hardware to win. Bitcoin mining ASICs are distinctly different from traditional CPUs and GPUs, which has led the hardware market to be relatively underserved. Most leading-edge mining ASICs are supplied by Chinese companies. Many American chipmakers are now much more focused on AI than anything else. Meanwhile, the Proto team at Block is trying to challenge Chinese dominance in the mining hardware space. Block has already made headway into this market when they announced the design and tape-out of a 3nm mining ASIC earlier this year. Then, they announced the coming availability of a Mining Development Kit (""MDK"") to bring flexibility and support for a broad range of use cases. Finally, the team came to an agreement to supply nearly 15 EH/s (exa-hashes per second) worth of mining chips to Core Scientific ( CORZ ). This was announced in July of 2024, and in November of 2024 the company formally announced the Proto division . The biggest barrier to entry for mining hardware is the ability to design high quality chips. Block has plenty of experience with chip design since Square terminals have used custom ASICs for years. By offering a leading-edge chip, a flexible platform, and high-quality software interfaces, Block believes it can win a strong position in the mining chip market. The bitcoin mining hardware industry is a multi-billion dollar per year industry whose demand will grow in lockstep with the price of bitcoin. Investor Takeaway Despite being a leading beneficiary to Bitcoin's rise, Block's stock price has not followed bitcoin's price much this year. The market is entirely ignoring both the existing benefits (richer Square merchants and Cash App users) and the benefits looming on the horizon (winning market share in the mining hardware business). For these two reasons, I believe the market misunderstands Block's enterprise value from the ground up. Investors are only focused on Block's role in traditional finance, something that will change as the Proto division begins driving profitable growth for Block's bitcoin segment in 2025. Proto will begin driving meaningful growth next year and I believe that the market will wake up to this opportunity when that begins. For these reasons, I believe Block is one of the best stock picks approaching 2025 and strongly believe an inflection is looming.

37637499,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627486,1734190216,Bitcoin improvement plan reignites debate over token denomination methods,"John Carvalho, the CEO of Bitcoin tools developer Synonym, has proposed the redenomination of Bitcoin as the smallest unit of the digital currency. In the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) published on X, he seeks to define 1 Satoshi as 1 Bitcoin, eliminating the need for decimal points. According to Carvalho, the change will reflect the Bitcoin network’s true nature instead of users’ perception of one Bitcoin as one hundred million Satoshis (sats). With the proposal, one Satoshi will now mean One Bitcoin. So, 1000 sats, currently displayed as 0.00001000 BTC, will now be displayed as 1000 bitcoins. He believes that removing decimals, a human-imposed abstraction, will improve the user experience for the Bitcoin network. It will reduce confusion and mental arithmetic error while ensuring a consistent standard for measuring Bitcoin as adoption grows and the value of the token increases. He said : “This representation requires dealing with eight decimal places, which can be confusing and foster the misconception that Bitcoin is inherently decimal-based. In reality, Bitcoin’s ledger represents values as integers of the smallest unit, and the decimal point is merely a human-imposed abstraction.” In his view, implementing this proposal would be easy as there is no need for any major technical upgrade for the network. All that would need to change is the display format, and developers can simply update user interfaces, APIs, and documentation to present Bitcoin values as integers. On the user front, the value of their Bitcoin will not change, and they simply have to adjust to not using decimals, which might take some time. During the transitional period, when the risk of confusion is high, he recommended dual displays, tooltips, coordinated messaging, and educational materials to clarify any confusion. Carvalho added that implementing the changes can happen within a year over three phases and added that Synonym’s Bitcoin wallet , Bitkit, has already implemented the integer-only display. This proves that it is achievable. New proposal restarts the conversation about Bitcoin denomination Meanwhile, the proposal has reignited an age-long debate over how to measure Bitcoin. In 2017, Bitcoin expert Jimmy Song proposed BIP 176, which sought to introduce “Bits” as the standard denomination for Bitcoin to simplify smaller transactions. The proposal sought to eliminate the need for decimal points by using “bits” to represent 100 satoshis, which is one millionth of a Bitcoin . However, Carvalho noted that the new proposal and BIP 176 are different because using “bits” will not fully address the decimal issue and only reduce the number of decimal places in some contexts. He added that implementing that proposal would only have created an inconsistent user experience and does not reflect the protocol’s true nature. He said: “In essence, while BIP 176 attempts to simplify small amount representations, it only replaces one decimal representation with another.” Thus, he believes his own proposal will be more durable as it completely redefines Bitcoin and removes the need for decimal fractions to offer a clearer and more intuitive solution. The community is divided on the proposal However, the proposal has attracted mixed reactions, with some accepting it and many criticizing it. Bitcoin advocate Psifour believes that it is harmful across numerical and linguist metrics, noting that Sats are already serving the same purpose without any complexity and this proposal has no value except to confuse users. He said: “Denominating bitcoin in sats accomplishes all of the existing upsides of this proposal that are not directly attempting to manipulate end users without any of the technical workload, social confusion, or redefinition of terms.” While not everyone vehemently opposed it, most believe that it is not necessary and could further complicate things for newbies who are just embracing Bitcoin. They noted the logistical challenges and high risk of confusion that could follow such changes. Nevertheless, some believe it would be a good change and could even increase adoption as it would invariably mean Bitcoin at $100,000 is actually 100 million bitcoins and not just 1 BTC.

37637498,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626973,1734190200,"Bitcoin’s Path to $100,000– What It Means for Lightchain AI and Other Altcoins","Bitcoin, the first and most iconic cryptocurrency, has been leading the digital currency revolution since its creation. As it inches closer to the historic $100,000 milestone, exciting opportunities are emerging across the broader crypto market. One standout is Lightchain AI Presale , offering early adopters a chance to tap into incredible potential. This bullish movement in Bitcoin is not only reshaping the market but is also driving growth for innovative altcoins like Lightchain AI ($LCAI) . In this article, we’ll explore Bitcoin’s rising trajectory, its impact on the altcoin ecosystem, and how groundbreaking projects like Lightchain AI are set to thrive in this dynamic landscape. Bitcoin’s Journey Toward $100,000 The possibility of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 has moved from speculative dream to near inevitability for many analysts. This growth is fueled by several key factors: Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, are increasingly investing in Bitcoin or creating Bitcoin-related financial products, solidifying its status as a digital asset. Scarcity and Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins and its halving cycles—which reduce the mining reward by half every four years—create a supply shock that drives up demand and price. Global Macroeconomic Trends: Rising inflation and currency devaluation have pushed investors toward Bitcoin as a store of value, akin to digital gold. Regulatory Clarity: As governments worldwide introduce clearer cryptocurrency regulations, investor confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability continues to grow. These dynamics suggest that Bitcoin’s price could surpass $100,000 by 2024, marking a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. The Ripple Effect: How Bitcoin’s Success Impacts Altcoins Bitcoin’s rise has historically served as a catalyst for altcoin growth. When Bitcoin surges, it often brings increased investor attention and capital inflows to the broader crypto market. However, not all altcoins benefit equally. Projects with real-world utility and innovative technologies, such as Lightchain AI, are poised to capitalize on this momentum. Increased Market Liquidity As Bitcoin’s price rises, it attracts new investors to the crypto market, many of whom diversify into altcoins after their initial Bitcoin purchase. This influx of capital can boost liquidity for promising projects like Lightchain AI, enabling them to gain traction. Enhanced Credibility Bitcoin’s path to $100,000 will likely solidify cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. This credibility extends to altcoins, particularly those with strong fundamentals and clear use cases, making them more attractive to institutional and retail investors alike. Competitive Differentiation While Bitcoin dominates as a store of value, altcoins like Lightchain AI focus on solving specific industry problems. This specialization allows such projects to carve out unique niches, benefiting from the broader adoption that Bitcoin drives without directly competing with it. Lightchain AI: A Rising Star in the Altcoin Ecosystem Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is one of the most innovative altcoins poised to thrive as Bitcoin’s success drives attention to the crypto market. By integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI offers unique solutions to real-world challenges. Key Features of Lightchain AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s consensus mechanism, PoI, rewards nodes for executing meaningful AI tasks, such as model training and data optimization. This approach not only secures the network but also contributes to advancements in AI. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): The AIVM serves as a computational layer for executing AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, enabling smarter and scalable decentralized applications (dApps). Real-World Applications: From healthcare and logistics to finance, Lightchain AI’s technology addresses critical inefficiencies, providing transparency, scalability, and sustainability. Eco-Friendly Design: Unlike energy-intensive Proof of Work systems, PoI significantly reduces energy consumption, aligning with global sustainability goals. Decentralized Governance: $LCAI token holders participate in the project’s governance, ensuring transparency and community-driven innovation. What Bitcoin’s Growth Means for Lightchain AI Bitcoin’s ascent to $100,000 represents more than just a milestone; it’s a validation of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. For Lightchain AI, this creates several opportunities: Increased Visibility As Bitcoin dominates headlines, new investors often explore the broader crypto market, discovering innovative projects like Lightchain AI. This increased visibility can drive interest in $LCAI, particularly from investors seeking high-potential altcoins. Strategic Partnerships Bitcoin’s growth attracts institutional players, many of whom are looking for projects that combine blockchain with emerging technologies like AI. Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge features make it an ideal candidate for partnerships with major corporations and governments. Market Expansion With Bitcoin paving the way for mainstream adoption, Lightchain AI can leverage this momentum to expand its ecosystem. Its applications in industries like healthcare and supply chain management position it as a transformative force in decentralized AI. Token Value Appreciation As more investors enter the market, demand for altcoins with real-world utility increases. Lightchain AI’s unique features and industry applications could lead to significant price appreciation for $LCAI tokens. Challenges to Watch While Bitcoin’s growth is overwhelmingly positive for the market, it’s essential to consider potential challenges: Market Volatility: As Bitcoin’s price surges, its volatility could spill over into the altcoin market, affecting projects like Lightchain AI. Competition: As the market grows, new projects will emerge, creating a competitive landscape for altcoins. Lightchain AI must continue innovating to maintain its edge. Regulatory Hurdles: While Bitcoin’s success brings regulatory clarity, it also invites scrutiny, which could impact altcoins differently depending on their use cases and governance models. Investor Education: Educating new investors about Lightchain AI’s value proposition will be critical to converting Bitcoin enthusiasts into $LCAI supporters. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out Amid these challenges, Lightchain AI has several factors working in its favor: Innovative Technology: PoI and AIVM make Lightchain AI a technological pioneer, addressing inefficiencies in both blockchain and AI ecosystems. Sustainability Focus: As environmental concerns grow, Lightchain AI’s energy-efficient design positions it as a responsible choice for investors. Real-World Impact: Unlike speculative projects, Lightchain AI solves tangible problems, ensuring its relevance and demand. Early-Stage Opportunity: At $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI offers a rare chance for investors to get in early on a high-potential project. The Future of Bitcoin and Altcoins As Bitcoin moves closer to $100,000, its role as a market leader and gateway asset becomes increasingly clear. However, its rise also underscores the need for altcoins like Lightchain AI, which bring unique solutions to the table. Together, Bitcoin and innovative altcoins will shape the next phase of the crypto revolution, driving mainstream adoption and technological advancement. For investors, the choice is not between Bitcoin and altcoins but rather how to balance these assets within a diversified portfolio. Projects like Lightchain AI, with their focus on real-world utility and cutting-edge technology, represent the next wave of innovation that Bitcoin’s success enables.

37636879,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374187,1734189356,5 Reasons Ethereum Could Outperform Bitcoin in Dec and Jan,"For the past two years, Bitcoin has come roaring back from 2022’s crypto winter. It was a tough one-year correction cycle, complete with a rash of cash crunches and liquidations of some big names in blockchain. The crash was so devastating that a few Web3 founders who broke the law even went to jail in the aftermath of that broad market correction. But BTC – the oldest, longest, most secured Satoshi chain, steadily ratcheted support levels upward over 2023 before melting up this year. 2025: Ethereum at a Glance Meanwhile, Ethereum and altcoin prices have tracked along with Bitcoin’s rise. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, however, has failed to move with the same gusto, pushing the little orange coin’s fortunes higher. What characterizes Bitcoin is its avowed simplicity as a global calculator for small sums representing vast amounts of value locked in by a secure computer hash protocol and market forces. By comparison, Ethereum is built to handle more complexity as a global computer for anything you want. The market appreciates its potential to reliably host powerful smart contracts on a network governed by rules enforced by computer programming rather than trusted rulers policed by civil authorities. Ethereum’s biggest challenge at the moment is simplifying complexity rather than getting bogged down while remaining a truly automated protocol and round table for its users. The smart contract platform’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, highlighted this challenge in a Dec. 7 post on X. “If Ethereum gave up on verifiability and accepted committees and centralized intermediaries for everything, I would consider it no longer Ethereum,” he wrote . While Ethereum’s lead team guides its development, here are five reasons crypto exchange values for its ETH tokens could eclipse BTC’s percentage growth over the next 60 days. 1. Ethereum Technical Analysis As popular analyst Cryptos Batman recently told followers in a post on X, Ethereum’s price recently broke a 3-year bearish trend line. That could indicate a bullish trend reversal, with Ether taking flight like Bitcoin has in recent months. Ethereum Breaks 3-Year Bearish Trendline For the first time in 3 years, $ETH has closed a candle body above its upper bearish trendline. This week’s retest is a healthy sign, setting the stage for a sustainable rally. Opportunities like this don’t come often. Don’t miss it! pic.twitter.com/9iJe3PhXbL — BATMAN (@CryptosBatman) December 9, 2024 “For the first time in 3 years, $ETH has closed a candle body above its upper bearish trendline,” Cryptos Batman wrote. “This week’s retest is a healthy sign, setting the stage for a sustainable rally. Opportunities like this don’t come often. Don’t miss it!” 2. Excellent Trump Bump Prospects In addition to a strong technical backdrop for an Ether bull run, the political/regulatory situation for the asset could hardly be more favorable. A pro-growth crypto policy was a signature promise of Trump’s campaign. That’s great for the blockchain industry overall but could be especially auspicious for Ethereum prices at exchange. Ethereum and its ERC20s were always less safe than Bitcoin from regulatory uncertainty, so its price stands more to gain from a pro-growth administration that’s friendly to the decentralized finance business. 3. Santa Claus Rally for Ethereum Incoming? In the history of liquid financial markets for tradable assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, there is usually a “Santa Claus” or year-end price rally that extends into January. Often this is the most profitable part of the calendar when these assets make their greatest gains on exchange markets. So far, this pattern has held up in the experience of Bitcoin and altcoin markets, with BTC and alts like Ethereum making big leaps up the chart in December and January. During the most recent Santa Claus rally immediately following a Bitcoin halving in 2020-21, like the current December to January period for 2024-2025, ETH’s price performance far surpassed that of BTC. Here are the figures for that cycle: Bitcoin’s high price on Dec. 21, 2022 was $24,059 . But by Jan. 18, 2023, its top was $37,299. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s high price on Dec. 21, 2022 was $646 . By Jan. 18, 2023, however, Ether traded at a high of $1,259. So BTC rallied by 55% while ETH jumped by 95%. 4. BTC Crushed Already ATHs in ‘24, Ether’s Waiting As long as the fundamentals of value proposition and market conditions remain in line, the tendency of “mean reversion” or a return to the average trend line remains an important factor to consider in a cryptocurrency’s price. What goes up must come down and what stays down has no where to go but back up again. Accordingly, average Ethereum prices on crypto exchanges look like they’re fixing to do just that in the markets up ahead. Bitcoin has already melted up the chart in a way that Ether hasn’t so far on this macro market halving cycle. Remember, Bitcoin has already blown past its previous all-time high prices. Ethereum has yet to mark its past record high on this cycle. That means alt season is still ahead of us if markets retrace past crypto trends. 5. Institutions Are Catching Up to Ethereum While Bitcoin is firmly in the regulated and safe column for institutional investors on Wall Street, altcoins have yet to reach this “most favored nation” status with US financial and commodities regulators. Ethereum stands out from the rest of the altcoins in that it appears to be well on its way to Bitcoin’s level of mainstream acceptance. At least it has spot ETF products for regulated investors like Bitcoin. However, the trend toward increased institutional adoption of Ethereum is a tailwind for its price, which markets are counting on as the exchanges continuously revise the valuation for Ether.

Sure, they started as internet jokes, but now they’re the talk of serious investors—and for good reason. Meme coins are blending laugh-out-loud branding with insane earning potential, especially for those who get in early. The buzz is undeniable: meme coins are back, bigger than ever. Right now, three meme coins are stealing the spotlight: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Snek (SNEK), and Osaka Protocol (OSAK). These tokens aren’t just riding the meme wave—they’re flipping it on its head with unique features, tight-knit communities, and explosive potential. Let’s break down why these are the best new meme coins to join today . BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin Leading the Charge BTFD Coin is more than just a meme—it’s a rallying cry for investors who know how to play the market. For those in the know, “Buy The F***ing Dip” isn’t just a mantra; it’s a lifestyle. This coin is turning heads with its record-breaking presale , raising over $3.7 million and selling more than 53 billion coins to over 5,000 holders. It’s not hype—it’s a movement. So, what makes BTFD stand out? Its ecosystem is stacked. There’s the Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, which is tailor-made for Gen Z gamers looking to turn playtime into profit. Then there’s the 90% APY staking, a passive income goldmine. Want exclusivity? The Bulls Squad, an NFT-powered club, gives holders access to perks that go beyond the memes. Here’s some quick math to blow your mind: A $3,500 investment at the current Stage 12 price of $0.00013 nets you a whopping 26.92 million $BTFD tokens . If the price hits $0.0006 at the presale’s end, your $3,500 could grow to $16,152. That’s a jaw-dropping ROI of 361%. And if you stake those tokens at 90% APY? By 2025, you’d be sitting on a stash worth even more—imagine what that could mean for your wallet. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin has the perfect mix of community hype, utility, and serious earning potential. It’s not just a meme; it’s a game-changer. It’s no wonder why BTFD is among the best new meme coins to join today. Snek (SNEK): The Slithering Star of Meme Coins Snek is the underdog meme coin slithering its way to the top, and it’s got everyone talking. Built around the cheeky charm of snakes, this token is making waves with its community-driven vibe and fresh approach to marketing. Forget the same old meme coin tropes—Snek is here to inject some venom into the game. Snek thrives on its simplicity. Its developers have mastered the art of viral marketing, creating a meme that’s easy to share and even easier to love. The community is what really sets it apart, with constant engagement through Twitter, Discord, and meme competitions. Snek isn’t just a coin; it’s a whole vibe. Investors are flocking to Snek for its rapid growth and strong social media presence. The developers are teasing future utilities, including NFT collaborations and community rewards that could keep the momentum rolling. For short-term investors, Snek’s ability to grab attention—and hold it—is a massive win. Why did this coin make it to this list? Snek’s community-first approach and clever branding make it a standout in the meme coin space. It’s fun, fresh, and loaded with short-term potential. Osaka Protocol (OSAK): Where Meme Meets Innovation Osaka Protocol is proof that meme coins can be innovative too. This token draws its inspiration from Japanese culture, blending iconic memes with cutting-edge blockchain technology. It’s not just about the laughs—it’s about creating a decentralised ecosystem that can stand the test of time. Osaka Protocol is gaining traction for its unique focus on decentralised apps (dApps). The developers are building a platform where users can interact, create, and trade within the OSAK ecosystem. Think of it as a mini metaverse, powered by a meme coin. For investors, this means real utility—something that sets OSAK apart from the pack. The branding is another home run. Osaka Protocol’s sleek design and cultural nods resonate with a global audience, giving it viral potential that’s hard to match. Whether it’s NFT collections or exclusive community events, OSAK is creating buzz that’s impossible to ignore. Why did this coin make it to this list? Osaka Protocol combines viral meme appeal with real-world utility, making it a must-watch for anyone looking to join the meme coin boom. The Bottom Line The meme coin market isn’t slowing down, and these three projects—BTFD Coin (BTFD), Snek (SNEK), and Osaka Protocol (OSAK)—are leading the charge. Whether it’s BTFD’s unbeatable ecosystem, Snek’s community-driven charm, or Osaka Protocol’s innovative edge, these tokens offer something for everyone. They’re the best new meme coins to join today, and the time to act is now. Want to make your move? Start with BTFD Coin.

Speculative fever in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is high, driven by Wall Street ETFs and Trump's election, despite concerns over elite control. Government ownership of Bitcoin remains unclear, with Trump's support for crypto miners and DeFi companies facing skepticism from financial experts. El Salvador's BTC adoption faces challenges from the IMF, and geopolitical implications of U.S. Bitcoin adoption could provoke reactions from countries like China. I last wrote about Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in January at the arrival of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). I was wrong in expecting it to fall but am more upset I said it ahead of the all-time highs. Regardless, I believe the Bitcoin hype train has arrived with ridiculous speculative assumptions flying around. The huge elephant in the room I've been writing some short calls, including on the Nasdaq Invesco fund ( QQQ ) recently, as I believe a correction is coming for stocks. It may a bigger risk than I thought after seeing the ""Buffett Indicator"". This was an indicator once noted by Warren Buffett as a reliable one for him, but he later played down his ties. The Buffett Indicator is a simple division of the Total stock market value and the U.S. GDP. As of September 30, 2024 the ratio values are shown as:Total US Stock Market Value = $60.86TAnnualized GDP = $29.24TBuffett Indicator = $60.86T/$29.24T = 208% The chart is easier to understand because since 1950, U.S. stocks have never traded above 2 standard deviations of the historical trend. Buffett Indicator (CurrentMarketValuation.Com) Worse still, each failure at 2 standard deviations, has corrected below the historical trend. We can also see that the internet bubble burst tested the line but the financial crisis of 2008-09 was not even a true bubble on this marker. That is also a worry for the expected market rally from Donald Trump's inauguration. The late 2021 market high above the 2-Std line led to a 75% correction in Bitcoin as tech stocks stumbled on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Speculative fever has gone 'to the moon' Bitcoin As with all periods of market extension, speculative fever can be high and that is true of cryptocurrencies. Market experts called for further highs in 2021 that failed to materialize. As I noted earlier, I was wrong about the adoption of ETFs, but retail investment is often high as I noted in my tech stock article recently. I also noted that markets were ignoring some broad-based failures in commercial adoption and growth rates of artificial intelligence. The rally which I believe is a speculative trap has been driven by Donald Trump's election and Wall Street ETFs. As I said in my previous BTC article, ""The Wall Street Takeover is Complete,"" even if my call was wrong, further highs only mean further elite control of Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency's early adopters have always touted the coin as a decentralized savior of world finance but now it is already hugely controlled by Wall Street. According to some recent data , the top five holders have around 10% of the supply of the world's Bitcoin reserves. Coinbase ( COIN ) and BlackRock( BLK ) are in the top three holders and growing. Bitcoin Trading Volume (CoinMarketCap.Com) According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin's trading volume has surged around fivefold from $22 billion to almost $100 billion since BlackRock's ETFs began trading. ETFs have also been popular, with $10 billion of post-Trump election win flows , taking yearly assets under management close to $113 billion. Government crypto ownership is still murky One of the takeaways from a Trump speech was support for crypto miners and decentralized finance ((DeFi)) companies. The most ambitious goal for Trump was said to be a strategic reserve holding Bitcoin. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said that the ideas ""crazy"" and ""merely political"". Unlike gold and oil, he added that Bitcoin was a ""sterile"" asset and its hard to see why a reserve would be a strategic win. El Salvador, which has long been seen as the poster child of BTC adoption has just bowed to International Monetary Fund pressure to water down its plans in order to accept a loan from the group. Another factor we should consider is what other nations will do if Trump did adopt Bitcoin. “If we don’t do it, China and others are going to be doing it,” Trump said at a Bitcoin rally in July. But slapping huge tariffs on China may not be the best way to get them to sign up for a new plan for U.S. dollar hegemony. Trump also said that he would apply 100% tariffs to so-called BRICs nations if they created a rival currency. We are still not aware of what kind of market turmoil could occur if he expects China and Russia to bow to dollar and U.S. dominance. Black swan risks If a market correction was about to happen then Bitcoin has not really been stress-tested against certain failures. Some commentators have previously said that the power grid is susceptible to cyber-attacks and similar events. It is an interesting take when companies have been ramping up data center energy usage and turning to ideas for nuclear power, owned by corporations . Finally, Alphabet's ( GOOG ) update on the Willow quantum computing chip has raised fears that Bitcoin's cryptography could be under threat. That brings us back to country risk, where Chinese scientists have been reported to have cracked RSA cryptography. Risks to the thesis I think I have laid out some of the important risks and investors should be wary of joining the Bitcoin hype train at these levels. I would suggest taking profit or waiting until Trump has been inaugurated in January. Around that time, we will get more clarity on tariffs and any actual plans for adoption. The obvious risk is that Trump's second term will start smoothly and his plans for government adoption come to fruition. However, as I noted, I am not sure that U.S. government ownership was ever the intended plan for Bitcoin. Conclusion The key takeaway from my article is that U.S. stock markets are at risk of being overvalued at levels that have led to substantial downturns. I will be taking a cautious approach to the markets before the January 20th inauguration and I am still skeptical about the need for a strategic reserve and also a small amount of Bitcoin being controlled by a small amount of hands, which includes corporations. Companies are not immune to hubris and risks in other markets that took down the likes of Bear Stearns . I was able to call the high in 2021 in BTC and that led to a 75% drop. The same speculative fervor is back and investors should be cautious at these levels.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744312-the-bitcoin-hype-train-has-arrived-on-cue?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37636763.jpeg

According to the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner’s office, his body was found in an apartment in San Francisco. Balaji, a former employee of the artificial intelligence firm, OpenAI, is famous for his interview with the New York Times, where he accused the company of breaching copyright law. In a statement, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed his identity, noting the cause of death as suicide. “The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) has identified the decedent as Suchir Balaji, 26, of San Francisco. The manner of death has been determined to be suicide,” said a spokesperson. The office said his next of kin has been notified of the development. Balaji’s issue with OpenAI’s alleged copyright infringement According to his interview with the New York Times, Balaji, who had worked at OpenAI for four years, decided to quit when he realized the technology that was in the works would bring more harm than good to society. He criticized the way the company used copyright data, noting that it was damaging the internet. An OpenAI spokesperson has also commented on the news, wishing his loved ones well. “We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir’s loved ones during this difficult time,” the statement said. According to a spokesperson for the San Francisco police department, Balaji’s dead body was discovered in his apartment on Buchanan Street on November 26. Officers and medical staff were alerted and upon getting there, they performed several wellness checks on him. The police said there was no evidence of foul play when the initial checks were carried out. In his tweet from October, Balaji said he had been at OpenAI before leaving, working on ChatGPT over the last one and a half years. He revealed that he did not know much about copyrights and other fair use laws before the lawsuits against several generative AI companies. When he understood what it meant, Balaji said the machine could create substitutes that would compete with the data used to train them. “When I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually concluded that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they’re trained on,” he said. OpenAI and Microsoft face several lawsuits OpenAI and Microsoft are currently defending several lawsuits filed against them by media companies, including the New York Times. The companies claimed that the AI firm broke copyright laws. On November 25, a copyright lawsuit listed Balaji as part of the plaintiffs. OpenAI promised it was going to go through the custodial file related to his concerns and address the issues he raised. Other former OpenAI employees have also raised concerns about the firm’s practices. However, only Balaji raised issues related to the data the company feeds its AI model. In a post , he discussed the company’s fair use of data, noting that it applies to every company using generative AI. Several friends and former colleagues of Balaji have taken to social media to mourn the death of the 26-year-old. Most of them have expressed admiration for his courage to speak up against AI and copyright. Before taking the job at OpenAI, Balaji studied computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He had stints of internships at OpenAI and Scale AI, moving to work for OpenAI after graduation.

The market has shown skepticism regarding Ethereum’s performance in this cycle, with some analysts predicting it might underperform compared to previous bullish phases. Despite this doubt, Ethereum has proven its resilience, consistently finding demand at key support levels and maintaining a bullish price structure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon – Top Trader Sets $2 Target Adding to the optimism, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock highlights a strong foundation for Ethereum’s network activity this week. Metrics such as active addresses, transaction volumes, and net flows suggest a healthy ecosystem, reinforcing the potential for ETH to continue its upward trajectory. These indicators reveal increasing participation and growing confidence among investors, even amid broader market uncertainties. As Ethereum approaches a critical resistance, all eyes are on whether it can maintain momentum and push past $4,000. If successful, this breakout could reignite bullish sentiment and pave the way for ETH to retest its all-time highs, silencing doubters in the process. However, failure to clear this hurdle might result in further consolidation, keeping traders on edge as they anticipate Ethereum’s next major move. Ethereum Data Signals Strength Ethereum has been steadily climbing in recent weeks, fueled by a strong bullish trend that began earlier this month. The price momentum is catching the attention of top analysts and investors, who are closely watching for a breakout above yearly highs as ETH edges closer to its all-time high (ATH). The anticipation in the market is palpable, with many viewing this as a pivotal moment for Ethereum to solidify its position in this bull cycle. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared on-chain metrics from IntoTheBlock, revealing a robust outlook for Ethereum’s network this week. Active addresses have increased by 4.24%, signaling heightened participation and interest among users. Similarly, new addresses have risen by 2.65%, suggesting growing adoption and investor activity. Notably, zero-balance addresses have decreased by 4.06%, indicating that dormant wallets are coming back to life, and ETH is being reactivated for transactions or investments. These positive metrics highlight building momentum for Ethereum, reinforcing the belief that it is poised for a significant price move. If ETH successfully breaks above its yearly highs, it could trigger a powerful rally, potentially setting new records. However, a failure to maintain upward momentum could see Ethereum retreat to consolidate further before attempting another breakout. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon With its fundamentals strengthening and the market aligning for a breakout, Ethereum appears ready to make its next major move. Whether it’s targeting new all-time highs or finding support for another push, the coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining Ethereum’s trajectory for the remainder of the bull cycle. As sentiment builds, all eyes remain on Ethereum’s ability to capitalize on its growing momentum. ETH Testing Supply Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,920, showing resilience after several failed attempts to break above the critical $4,000 resistance level. This price point remains a psychological and technical barrier for ETH, and clearing it is essential to confirm the continuation of its bullish uptrend. The market’s attention is focused on Ethereum’s ability to reclaim the $4,000 level, which would likely serve as a catalyst for a strong rally toward new yearly highs. However, the inability to decisively breach this resistance has kept ETH in a consolidative phase, leaving some uncertainty about its next move. If Ethereum fails to maintain its current momentum and breaks above $4,000 in the coming sessions, the price could face increased selling pressure. A retracement toward lower demand levels around $3,500 is likely in such a scenario. This level has previously acted as a robust support zone, and a retest could provide the foundation for another upward attempt.

Top large cap altcoins to look out for: ENS, OP, TIA, and TAO. Top low cap altcoins poised for growth: REZ, RPL, OMNI, and AEVO. Rotating between large-cap and small-cap coins might be the key to outperforming Bitcoin in the current crypto market. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged above $100,000 in the past 24 hours, trading at $101,617.37 at the time of writing. Not just that, the digital asset has reclaimed the $2 trillion valuation and is just around 2% lower than its all-time high of $103,900. Since December last year, the digital asset has climbed 137.5%, according to CoinGecko . For investors looking to outperform Bitcoin, diversifying your portfolio then becomes a must.

37636469,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627460,1734188097,Justin Sun calls out Coinbase’s leadership over wBTC delisting controversy,"Justin Sun, founder of TRON, and Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, have been sparring on social media over the exchange’s asset listing standards. This comes in after BiT Global sued the US’s biggest crypto exchange over the delisting of wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) as it prepares to launch a competing product. Coinbase announced on November 19 that it will delist wBTC starting December 19, 2024. The exchange has cited its “listing standards” in a periodic review, but the timing raised eyebrows. Justin Sun strikes back at Coinbase CLO Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal defended the decision to delist wBTC in a post, stating, “When an asset no longer meets our listing standards, we will drop it.” He thanked BiT Global for the chance to prove this in court and on the global crypto stage. However, he highlighted that when another asset meets or exceeds market requirements the exchange will list it. Justin Sun replied to the statement, questioning Coinbase’s internal alignment. He shared Brian Armstrong’s post as a reminder of how the exchange lists assets. The Coinbase CEO had stated that its “goal is to list every asset where it is legal to do so.” Armstrong mentioned that outside of the listing standards, the exchange doesn’t offer an opinion on the value of each asset. He added that Coinbase is asset agnostic as it believes in free markets and that consumers should have choice. It seems that Coinbase’s CEO doesn’t agree with your perspective. Who has the final say at Coinbase? https://t.co/VfoLLEkOCk pic.twitter.com/NSCnB5DAjs — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) December 14, 2024 Sun slammed Coinbase’s CLO and stated it seems that Coinbase’s CEO doesn’t agree with Grewal’s perspective. He continued by posing the question, “Who has the final say at Coinbase?” Paul Grewal replied that it seemed that Sun conveniently ignored that standards require safety and legality. He added that he is looking forward to the TRON founder’s deposition under oath in California. Did Coinbase ask for too much? This heated exchange is the latest episode in the rising tension in the ongoing legal wBTC battle . Sun’s influence on wBTC custody and Coinbase’s bold moves are setting the stage for a high-stakes showdown. Meanwhile, this is not the first time that Justin Sun has gone against Coinbase . Earlier, he made explosive claims about the exchange’s listing practices, alleging the exchange demanded 500 million TRX (approximately $80 million) and $250 million worth of Bitcoin deposits for a listing. Those allegations sharply contrast with Armstrong’s statement that listing on the exchange is free. Armstrong even offered help to Moonrock Capital CEO Simon Dedic over similar concerns about high listing costs. Simon had shared that Binance allegedly asked a Tier 1 project for 15% of their token supply during due diligence. He said such practices make Tier 1 listings unaffordable, often leading to “bleeding charts.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEGATIVE,BTC | TRX,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRX | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/justin-sun-coinbase-wbtc-controversy/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37636469.jpeg

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-bonk-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Weekly charts indicate a powerful Wave 3 rally, attracting institutional money, with a target of $145k by February before a potential correction. Monthly projections suggest Bitcoin could reach $300k by April, with significant upside potential as RSI extends into its red zone. Bitcoin's adoption as a form of money is accelerating, supported by pro-crypto policies and a shift towards productivity and innovation in financial systems. My previous calls for a strong Bitcoin ( BTC-USD) bull run following the long sideways consolidation between March and October has been proven out by market action. The post-election rally reached $100k in record time, and after a two week sideways churn, chances are high that it's about to begin another 50% rally. Targets for this next push range from $140-160k. Short term chart: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Garden variety sideways triangle pattern, looks to have completed. TheBullBear.com, TradingView TheBullBear.com, TradingView The sideways pattern enabled a decent pullback in daily RSI from its upper red resistance zone, setting up the next push. If it keeps to trend, contact with the upper channel rail comes sometime in January at about $140,000. TheBullBear.com, TradingView Weekly chart: TheBullBear.com, TradingView The longer term chart shows that this is the 5th wave of a Wave 3, which historically has been one of the strongest wave positions. It's at this point that the rally broadens and those who have watched from the sidelines start to throw money onto the table. In this case, that's going to include big institutional money, as MAGAnomics seems to favor Bitcoin and the regulatory and tax environment for investors is about to get a whole lot more accommodating. Weekly chart seems to indicate $145k by February, at which point BTC will have completed a 5 wave impulse move and weekly RSI will be into its upside extended resistance zone. I'd look for a correction from there, perhaps as low as a retest of 100k. Monthly chart: TheBullBear.com, TradingView The longer term monthly chart projects much higher, to 300k, potentially by April. It's impossible to say at this point what path BTC will take to that mark, but before this Wave 3 of III is over, the monthly RSI will get well into its red upside extended range, and it's got a way to go yet, leaving lots of upside running room. We'll have to see what happens when that green shorter term trendline gets hit. If price blasts through it, it may head right for 300k, or it may hug the upper rail and take a longer, slower path to that target. In either case, the Wave 3 rally looks to target that space before any substantive corrective period. Sentiment on the Bitcoin Fear/Greed Index got a bit frothy, so the consolidation also served the purpose of resetting from overly greedy: TheBullBear.com, Crypto Fear/Greed Index Everything is changing. Fast. There will be new forms of financial intermediation based on new technologies, and Bitcoin is one of them. Eventually there will be new forms of money and Bitcoin is currently regarded as the frontrunner for this role, positioning it to become an intermediation of exchange and a storage of value. The many trillions of Debt Monetarist value units that have been ginned up by the transitional Debt Monetarist economic and political regime over the last 25 years will have to find some kind of productive home. Skimming, scamming and grifting on an global scale has had its day; now its time for the return of productivity, innovation and advancement. Bitcoin is one of the places those trillions of future value units will park itself. Projections to $1,000,000 are not pie in the sky. With the Bitcoin-positive David Sacks being named to take point of tech and crypto policy, and many other pro-crypto elements in the new administration, a fundamental repricing of money in terms of new technological models of exchange is beginning now. In my opinion, it won't take more than 10 years before the way exchange works and our current concept of money is as antiquated as seashells and coins with the King's face stamped on them. Risks to this analysis: If the new administration changes its tune with regards to Bitcoin and crypto, or if quantum computing enables the breaking of Bitcoin's cryptography, or if a newer, better form of cryptocurrency is devised, then Bitcoin is at risk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744311-bitcoin-new-bull-breakout-starts-soon?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37636107.jpeg

This change in the political scene has heightened expectations across the industry, with analysts predicting that Binance Coin (BNB) might reach the $1,000 threshold. At the same time, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has voiced confidence about XRP’s future, hinting at possible favorable regulatory changes. Amidst this renewed optimism, Web3Bay is creating new standards in decentralized e-commerce. Utilizing blockchain technology, Web3Bay is transforming how digital transactions are conducted, enabling users to effortlessly buy, sell, and exchange digital goods. At the heart of this platform is the 3BAY token, which facilitates transaction efficiency, promotes user engagement, and grants governance rights to token holders. By integrating established payment methods such as PayPal, Web3Bay is making decentralized e-commerce more accessible to a wide audience. Binance Coin (BNB): Potential of $1,000 Binance Coin (BNB) remains a top altcoin, trailing only Ethereum (ETH) in terms of popularity. Integral to the Binance ecosystem, BNB powers both the BNB Smart Chain and the Binance centralized exchange, essential for transactions and services on the platform. With the recent US election as a catalyst, BNB has joined the broader market rally, increasing over 5% and currently trading above $580. As it approaches the next significant resistance level at $600, experts foresee a potential rise past $1,000 by year's end. Ripple (XRP): Navigating Regulatory Challenges Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently highlighted the regulatory challenges Ripple and XRP have faced, largely attributed to ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple nearly four years ago initiated a lengthy legal battle that has hindered XRP's growth. Garlinghouse criticized the SEC's crypto industry interference as “unnatural and manipulative,” pointing out how the lawsuit has persistently hampered XRP's performance. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Decentralization As conventional e-commerce platforms grapple with issues like data privacy, centralized control, and high transaction fees, the need for a decentralized alternative is increasingly apparent. Web3Bay addresses these issues by offering a secure, community-focused marketplace where users have complete control over their data and assets. Eliminating intermediaries, Web3Bay provides seamless, international transactions free from conventional banking restrictions. Its 3BAY token incentivizes active community involvement, cultivating a dedicated and active user base. Moreover, with payment options including PayPal and traditional financial channels, Web3Bay appeals to both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and new users. Embracing a user-driven ethos, Web3Bay enables its community to influence its strategic direction. With the 3BAY token priced at $0.003000 in the initial presale phase and set to rise 15% in subsequent stages, early adopters have a lucrative opportunity to participate in a pioneering shift in e-commerce. Summing Up As blockchain technology and decentralized finance continue to evolve rapidly, Web3Bay is poised to redefine the e-commerce sector. By addressing fundamental challenges like data privacy and transaction costs, Web3Bay is establishing a new paradigm for purchasing, selling, and managing digital assets. As Ripple (XRP) and Binance Coin (BNB) build momentum, the renewed market confidence provides a favorable context for Web3Bay’s mission. With its novel approach to user empowerment and broad accessibility, the future of e-commerce is clearly steering towards decentralization, offering substantial benefits for early adopters of this innovative platform.

The ad has started conversations on social media about how consumers will respond to such practices. For the first time, Marc Jacobs (guest editor) edited Vogue’s special December issue, placing a full-page ad by Skechers. Many readers found the ad suspicious. Then, the controversy took off when TikTok creator @polishlaurapalmer posted a video of the ad’s unusual features, confirming it to be an AI creation. A Skechers allegedly created using AI. Source: Vogue The ad illustrated two women walking down a city street. They have shopping bags in hand, and both are wearing high heels. When inspected closely, the minor errors in details start becoming apparent to the reader. The illustration contained many errors, almost as if the company had deliberately left it like that. As of now, no one can confirm if this was some statement from Skechers as it has not responded to the remarks. AI-created ad didn’t incorporate Skechers sneakers properly One prominent complaint was that the placement of sneakers in the corner was too odd. “I look at the drawing for two more seconds, and I’m like oh that’s AI!” said @polishlaurapalmer, who had initially thought the ad was “kind of cool.” In the video, she noted details that the ad was undoubtedly created using artificial intelligence. These details include unclear figures, faceless people in the background, incoherent text on a store sign, and a missing part of one woman’s gown. These flaws started to go viral as @polishlaurapalmer, who didn’t like the ad, criticized Skechers for doing it. She even went so far as to say the image was “alarmingly ugly” and wished companies were careful not to use AI too quickly. She said, “I wish people who use AI for art understand that I hate this now. You actually didn’t save any money because now I hate you, now I don’t ever want to buy a Skechers shoe again.” She wasn’t the only one. Many commenters on her viral TikTok were also surprised to see an AI-generated image grace the pages of a prestigious magazine like Vogue. But the backlash went beyond TikTok — social media users on all platforms shared and lambasted the ad. Even one X user tweeted , “We are so cooked.” The faces look melted and evil, as per Ashwinn Krishnaswamy, a partner at Forge Design and TikTok. He called the ad an “AI slop.” AI-created ads outrage artists and creatives A few weeks ago, Coca-Cola was also criticized for using AI, with some calling its campaigns “soulless,” according to NBC News . Alex Hirsch, the creator of Gravity Falls, mocked Coca-Cola saying, “FUN FACT: Coca-Cola is ‘red’ because it’s made from the blood of out-of-work artists!” However, Coca-Cola responded to the criticism, telling Fortune, “We are always exploring new ways to connect with fans and experiment with different approaches.” The brand also made films by mixing “human storytellers with generative AI.” Coca-Cola has also partnered with Microsoft to promote the use of cloud AI generative technologies. Ashley Rutstein, a freelance creative director, says that poor AI implementation could send a bad signal to the customer. “When they see that you’re cutting corners, they’re gonna dislike you,” Rutstein said. According to a National Society of High School Scholars survey, which recruited over 10,000 students, 59% of Gen Zers believe that in the next decade, AI will have more negative than positive impacts on society. Also, 55% are worried about privacy issues, and 62% fear that AI will take the jobs they want. These negative perceptions could fuel an already hostile response from consumers to companies using AI in their marketing.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Gartman expressed surprise at Bitcoin’s performance but continued to favor gold as a more enduring asset. Bitcoin has gained nearly 140% this year, significantly outpacing gold’s 30% gain. But Gartman remains unconvinced. “It still amazes me how much respect Bitcoin has,” he said. While acknowledging that BTC is a rare asset, Gartman compared the Bitcoin craze to historical bubbles like the Dutch tulip craze of the 17th century and the tech boom of the late 1990s. “Gold has been valued as an asset for centuries, while Bitcoin has only had a few months,” he said. “I would almost always prefer a century investment to a month investment.” Related News: Nasdaq-Listed Giant Company Announces Massive Bitcoin Purchase Despite his skepticism, Gartman avoided predicting an imminent crash, instead warning of eventual volatility, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price could fluctuate dramatically in the future before potentially falling. When asked to address the argument that Bitcoin is “digital gold” because of its limited supply, Gartman backpedaled. He pointed to the proliferation of other cryptocurrencies, which he believes has undermined Bitcoin’s scarcity appeal. “There’s an infinite number of other cryptocurrencies coming into the market, and that takes away from the one-time scarcity value of Bitcoin,” he said. In contrast, gold’s history as a store of value and medium of exchange gives it a unique position, the analyst said. “Gold has been money for thousands of years and will likely continue to be so for thousands more,” Gartman said. *This is not investment advice.

37635402,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110086,1734186371,Bitcoin Supply Could Tighten as Exchanges See 124K BTC Outflows: 10x Research,"The Bitcoin market may be heading toward a supply squeeze as cryptocurrency exchanges recorded a net outflow of 124,000 BTC over the past 30 days, according to 10x Research . This significant outflow, coupled with sustained demand, could lead to a tightening of Bitcoin supply and upward price pressure. Major Exchanges Witness Large Bitcoin Outflows Recent data shows that several top cryptocurrency exchanges have experienced significant reductions in their Bitcoin reserves: 1. Coinbase Outflow : 72,000 BTC (nearly 10% of its total reserves). Current Balance : 748,000 BTC , maintaining its position as the exchange with the largest BTC reserves. 2. Binance Outflow : 29,000 BTC . Current Balance : 570,000 BTC . 3. Other Major Players Gemini, OKX, and Kraken : Each reported substantial outflows, further contributing to the overall decline in exchange balances. 4. Outlier: Bitfinex Unlike its peers, Bitfinex recorded a net inflow of 8,500 BTC , bucking the broader trend. Why Are Bitcoin Outflows Increasing? The surge in outflows from exchanges can be attributed to several factors: 1. Shift Toward Long-Term Holding Investors are increasingly moving Bitcoin off exchanges to cold wallets, signaling a preference for long-term holding rather than active trading. 2. Growing Institutional Interest Institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, driven by macroeconomic factors and growing trust in digital assets as a store of value. 3. Regulatory Concerns Uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulations may be prompting investors to secure their holdings in private wallets. 4. Anticipation of Price Gains With Bitcoin’s potential supply squeeze, investors may be withdrawing funds in anticipation of future price appreciation. Potential Impact of a Bitcoin Supply Squeeze 1. Increased Price Pressure As exchange balances dwindle, reduced liquidity could drive prices higher, particularly if demand remains robust. 2. Stronger Bullish Sentiment Declining Bitcoin availability on exchanges often correlates with rising bullish sentiment, encouraging further accumulation. 3. Market Volatility A tightened supply could exacerbate Bitcoin’s price volatility, with sharp upward movements during periods of high demand. Current Exchange Bitcoin Balances Exchange Previous Balance Net Change Current Balance Coinbase ~820,000 BTC -72,000 BTC ~748,000 BTC Binance ~599,000 BTC -29,000 BTC ~570,000 BTC Gemini Not disclosed Significant outflow Not disclosed Bitfinex ~125,000 BTC +8,500 BTC ~133,500 BTC Comparative Trends in Bitcoin Supply 2024 Exchange Outflows The current 124,000 BTC outflow in the past 30 days marks one of the most significant declines in recent years. Historical Context Similar outflows in 2020 and 2021 preceded significant Bitcoin bull runs, as reduced exchange liquidity drove price increases. Expert Insights on Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics Mena Theodorou, Co-Founder of Coinstash : “This level of Bitcoin outflow suggests a clear shift toward long-term holding. As supply on exchanges tightens, the probability of price surges increases significantly.” James Seyffart, Bloomberg Analyst : “The combination of institutional accumulation and reduced exchange balances paints a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in the coming months.” Risks Associated with Supply Tightening While a Bitcoin supply squeeze may boost prices, there are risks to consider: Volatility : Tightened liquidity could lead to sharp price swings. Market Manipulation : Reduced supply might make the market more susceptible to manipulation by large holders. Regulatory Uncertainty : Potential policy changes could impact investor confidence. Strategies for Navigating the Bitcoin Market Given the current trends, here are strategies for investors: 1. Monitor Exchange Balances Keeping an eye on exchange reserves can provide insights into supply trends and market sentiment. 2. Diversify Holdings While Bitcoin shows strong potential, diversifying into other high-performing cryptocurrencies may mitigate risks. 3. Focus on Long-Term Gains With institutional adoption and decreasing supply, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains positive, making it an attractive option for patient investors. Conclusion: A Tighter Bitcoin Market Ahead The significant 124,000 BTC outflow from exchanges underscores a growing trend of long-term holding and institutional accumulation. If this trend continues alongside sustained demand, the Bitcoin market could experience a supply squeeze, leading to upward price momentum and increased market enthusiasm. While risks like volatility and regulatory challenges persist, the current dynamics present an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin as it moves into 2025.

37635415,https://crypto.news/?p=14319429,1734186361,Spot Ethereum ETFs break a key record: can ETH price hit $5k?,"Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds broke a crucial record as their inflows continued rising. Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs have had inflows in the last 16 consecutive days, breaking a personal record. The net inflow on Friday, Dec. 14 stood at over $23.6 million, bringing the total amount since inception to over $2.26 billion. According to SoSoValue, all spot Ethereum ETFs hold over $13.7 billion in assets. The Grayscale Ethereum ETF is still the biggest with over $5.6 billion. It is followed by iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Franklin Ethereum ETF. One reason for the inflows is the rising hope that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will allow staking. Such a move would mean that ETF holders will benefit as the coin’s price rises and from the staking reward. Data by StakingRewards shows that the staking yield stands at 3.26%. These inflows have happened at a time when Ethereum is doing well. Its price is hovering near $4,000, and is just 25% below its all-time high of $4,870. It has jumped by 153% from its 2023 lows. On-chain metrics are also encouraging. Data by IntoTheBlock shows that the number of active ETH addresses has risen to over 122.7 million, the highest level in months.

ETH whales | Source: IntoTheBlock Ethereum price analysis: can ETH hit $5,000? ETH price chart | source: crypto.news In a recent note, CryptoQuant predicted that the ETH price was on a path to $5,000, citing the demand and supply dynamics. On the weekly chart, we see that the ETH price has risen and found a strong barrier at $4,092. It has failed to cross that level two times before — in March and May. Ether has remained above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages and the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, ETH needs to break the resistance at $4,092 to invalidate the triple-bottom chart pattern. A move above that resistance will push it to the all-time high of $4,877 and the key level at $5,000. It needs to rise by just 25% to get to $5,000, which is achievable if the crypto bull run continues.

37635532,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627473,1734186253,Japanese yen hits longest losing streak since June. Are we in trouble again?,"The Japanese yen is getting hammered. It has clocked six straight days of losses against the US dollar, falling to 153.48 per dollar as of December 14, 2024. This makes it the worst week for the yen in over two months and its longest losing streak since June. The market is betting hard that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its ultra-loose monetary policy in its December 18–19 meeting, choosing stability over hiking rates. Japan’s monetary stance is becoming a gamble. Inflation is soaring past the BoJ’s target of 2%, fueled by October’s record-breaking wage increases—the highest in 32 years. But instead of a bold action to tighten policy, the BoJ seems cautious, even timid. Traders aren’t impressed. They’ve dumped the yen in favor of the stronger dollar, pushed higher by US Treasury yields and a Federal Reserve that isn’t afraid to flex its muscles. BoJ’s caution fuels yen selloff The BoJ’s hesitation is clear. Inflation is rising, wages are climbing, but rates? They’re stuck. October’s wage growth should’ve been a wake-up call: base salaries jumped at a pace unseen in decades, stoking inflationary fires. But the BoJ isn’t rushing. They’ve hinted that economic recovery is fragile, and any aggressive tightening could kill momentum. That caution has made the yen a sitting duck. Currency traders are ruthless. Bloomberg reports the yen is stuck in its worst slump since mid-year, with selling pressure mounting. The numbers are bleak. Economic growth in Japan is lukewarm too. Government stimulus and wage hikes have propped it up, but not enough to trigger bold policy shifts. Analysts expect the BoJ to hold its dovish stance, even if it means the yen continues its freefall. Market sentiment is clear: until Japan acts, the yen will remain a punching bag. August’s shock rate hike still haunts markets The last time Japan shook things up was in August. On July 31, the BoJ announced its first rate hike in 17 years, raising interest rates to 0.25%. The decision blindsided markets. Inflation had hit 3.2% in June, forcing the BoJ to break a decades-long policy of ultra-low rates. But the fallout was brutal. Within days, the Nikkei 225 crashed nearly 20%. On August 5, it recorded its worst single-day drop since Black Monday in 1987, shedding 12.4%, or over 4,400 points. The panic didn’t stay in Japan. It spread like wildfire. The S&P 500 plunged 6%, the Nasdaq lost 7.5%, and Europe’s DAX and CAC 40 tanked by 5% and 4.8%, respectively. The BoJ’s decision sent shockwaves through global markets, shaking confidence in equities and assets everywhere. Crypto wasn’t spared either. Bitcoin nosedived below $50,000, wiping out 27% of its value in just a week. Ethereum collapsed 34%. Over $600 million in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated as the panic spread. Traders who borrowed cheap yen to fund risky bets—the infamous yen carry trade—scrambled to unwind their positions, adding to the chaos. Investors realized that even Japan, the poster child of low rates, wasn’t immune to inflation’s bite. And now, with this, they’re getting a little concerned again. A weak yen makes Japanese exports cheaper, but it also makes imports painfully expensive, worsening inflation. And once it gets high enough, we’ll be heading for a repeat of August 5 for sure.

37635298,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27731,1734186227,Sui Blockchain Partners with Ant Digital to Tokenize ESG Assets,"A Breakthrough in ESG Tokenization Layer-1 blockchain Sui has announced a strategic partnership with Ant Digital, a subsidiary of China’s Ant Group, for tokenizing real-world assets. The focus will mainly be on ESG projects, including the management and trading of renewable energy assets for better exposure to key industries, starting with Chinese solar material manufacturers. This collaboration marks one of the most important steps toward digital transformation in green finance with the help of blockchain. Tokenizing Chinese Solar Assets The first deal under this agreement is a tokenization of assets, called “notes”, for a Fortune China Top 500 solar material manufacturer. Although the name of the manufacturer is not disclosed, the move underlines the ability of blockchain to cut red tape in asset management and open up new avenues for financing. Cobe Zhang, Head of Web3 Product at Ant Digital Technologies, pointed out that the collaboration was about moving the needle on renewable energy: “We hope to continuously provide diversified advanced technical services for more RWA projects, especially in the new energy sector, and our technology can better support the development of the real economy”. This is in line with the global effort to incorporate RWA into the blockchain ecosystem to enhance transparency and efficiency. Ant Digital’s Blockchain Footprint Widens Ant Digital is the technology arm of Ant Group, independently operating and known for powering the massive Alipay payment network. The company introduced its ZAN platform in September 2023, a suite of tools designed to facilitate the issuance and management of tokenized assets.

Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. Aiming to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE seeks to establish itself among the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. It appeals to the crypto community with a no-tax policy and transparency about its lack of utility, embracing its identity purely as a memecoin. In April and May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching a peak of $1.6 billion. This rapid growth attracted a strong community of followers and sparked what some refer to as a “memecoin season,” leading to the launch and volatile trading of other memecoins. The PEPE roadmap outlines three phases: the first includes listing on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter; the second involves listings on centralized exchanges; and the third aims for “tier 1” exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” The coin’s attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on its memetic appeal and community support, with future performance influenced by market dynamics and investor sentiment. XRP (XRP) XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. XRP is designed to be fast, low-cost, open, and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. It functions on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. XRP allows for settlements without the need for a bank account, facilitating borderless transactions. The technology behind XRP aims to enable seamless payment transfers across various currencies. Ripple, the company associated with XRP, uses it to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. With its quick transaction times and low fees, XRP has the potential to be utilized in cross-border payments and other financial applications. In the current market cycle, XRP’s features and use cases may make it an attractive option for those interested in digital currencies, depending on market conditions and adoption rates.

37635165,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110070,1734185915,Japanese Lawmaker Considers Bitcoin Reserve for Economic Stability,"In a recent parliamentary session, Satoshi Yamada , a Japanese lawmaker, proposed that Japan explore the possibility of including Bitcoin (BTC) in its foreign exchange reserves . Citing examples from the U.S. and Brazil, Yamada argued that Bitcoin’s increasing role as a hedge against economic risks warrants serious consideration by the Japanese government. This suggestion highlights the growing global interest in Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset, potentially redefining how nations manage their reserves. Why Bitcoin in Foreign Exchange Reserves? Foreign exchange reserves traditionally consist of assets like gold, U.S. dollars, and other stable currencies. Bitcoin, as a decentralized and scarce digital asset, is being considered by some policymakers for its unique advantages: 1. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins ensures it cannot be inflated like fiat currencies, making it an attractive hedge against monetary devaluation. 2. Diversification of Reserves Including Bitcoin in reserves adds diversification, reducing reliance on traditional currencies and commodities. 3. Global Acceptance As Bitcoin gains wider adoption, its liquidity and global recognition strengthen its appeal as a reserve asset. Lessons from the U.S. and Brazil Yamada referenced discussions in the U.S. and Brazil regarding Bitcoin’s potential role in national reserves: U.S. Prominent figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis have advocated for including Bitcoin in U.S. reserves, citing its potential to strengthen financial security and innovation. Brazil Brazil’s growing crypto adoption has fueled debates about Bitcoin’s inclusion in the country’s reserves, highlighting its value as a hedge against economic instability. These examples demonstrate how Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a strategic asset by governments worldwide. Benefits for Japan If Japan were to include Bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves, it could realize several benefits: 1. Economic Resilience Bitcoin’s independence from traditional financial systems makes it a robust asset during periods of economic uncertainty. 2. Tech Leadership Japan has long been a leader in technology and innovation. Embracing Bitcoin at a national level would reinforce its reputation as a forward-thinking economy. 3. Crypto-Friendly Framework Japan already has a well-established regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, making it well-positioned to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Challenges and Risks While the idea is promising, several challenges need to be addressed: 1. Volatility Bitcoin’s price volatility could pose risks to reserve stability, especially during market downturns. 2. Regulatory Concerns Including Bitcoin in reserves would require updates to Japan’s financial regulations and policies. 3. Market Liquidity While Bitcoin is liquid compared to other cryptocurrencies, managing large-scale reserves could impact market dynamics. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin vs. Traditional Reserve Assets Feature Bitcoin Gold Fiat Currencies Supply Fixed at 21 million Expanding, but finite Unlimited supply (inflation-prone) Portability Fully digital and borderless Physical and difficult to transport Digital, but tied to banking systems Volatility High Low Low to moderate Transparency Public blockchain ledger None Centralized systems Expert Opinions on Bitcoin Reserves Yamada’s remarks have sparked discussions among experts and policymakers: Satoshi Yamada, Japanese Lawmaker : “Bitcoin’s ability to act as a hedge against economic risks makes it a compelling addition to our foreign exchange reserves. We should consider its potential alongside traditional assets like gold and U.S. dollars.” Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy Chairman : “Bitcoin is the ultimate reserve asset for the 21st century. Countries that adopt it early will gain significant economic advantages.” Global Implications If Japan moves forward with including Bitcoin in its reserves, it could: 1. Spur Adoption by Other Nations Japan’s reputation as a tech-savvy nation could inspire other countries to consider Bitcoin for their reserves. 2. Boost Bitcoin’s Legitimacy Government adoption of Bitcoin would enhance its status as a reliable financial asset. 3. Strengthen Japan’s Economic Position Diversifying reserves with Bitcoin could increase Japan’s resilience against global economic fluctuations. Conclusion: A Strategic Opportunity for Japan Satoshi Yamada’s proposal to include Bitcoin in Japan’s foreign exchange reserves reflects the growing recognition of digital assets as viable components of national financial strategies. While challenges like volatility and regulatory adjustments remain, the potential benefits—economic resilience, diversification, and leadership in innovation—make Bitcoin an asset worth exploring at the national level. As discussions continue, Japan has the opportunity to position itself at the forefront of the global cryptocurrency revolution.

The analysis highlights strong investor interest, expanding network activity, and record-breaking Ethereum ETF holdings as key drivers of this potential price surge. Key Factors Driving Ethereum’s Potential $5K Price 1. Rising Demand for Ethereum The surge in investor demand for Ethereum is evident in several metrics: Ethereum ETFs: U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have grown their holdings from 3.095 million ETH in July 2024 to a record 3.41 million ETH by year-end. New Investors: More investors are entering the market, buying Ethereum at higher prices, pushing the realized price—a metric reflecting the average purchase price—closer to $5,200. 2. Increased Network Activity Ethereum’s network activity has seen consistent growth throughout 2024: Daily Transactions: Ethereum handles between 6.5 and 7.5 million daily transactions , a significant jump from the 5 million average in 2023 . DeFi and NFTs: Continued growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications contributes to higher transaction volumes and increased demand for ETH. 3. Historical Price Trends CryptoQuant notes that the realized price of ETH aligns closely with its previous all-time high of $5,200 during the 2021 bull run. This metric serves as a price ceiling, which is expected to rise as demand continues to grow. The Role of Ethereum ETFs The launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024 has been a game-changer for institutional adoption: Institutional Inflows: ETFs provide a simplified route for institutional investors to gain exposure to ETH without direct ownership, driving up demand. Record Holdings: ETF holdings reaching 3.41 million ETH reflect increased confidence in Ethereum as a long-term asset. Ethereum’s Growing Ecosystem Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand, supporting its bullish price outlook: 1. Layer-2 Scaling Solutions Layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism are increasing Ethereum’s transaction throughput, reducing fees, and driving adoption. 2. DeFi and DApp Growth The Ethereum network remains the backbone of the DeFi sector, with billions in total value locked (TVL) and growing demand for decentralized applications (DApps). 3. Ethereum’s Shift to Proof of Stake (PoS) The transition to Proof of Stake has reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption and increased staking participation, enhancing network security and incentivizing long-term holding. Comparative Metrics: 2023 vs. 2024 Metric 2023 2024 Change Daily Transactions ~5 million 6.5–7.5 million +30–50% ETH ETF Holdings Not available 3.41 million ETH Record high Realized Price ~$3,200 ~$5,200 +62.5% CryptoQuant’s Price Prediction CryptoQuant predicts that Ethereum’s price could surpass $5,000 in early 2025, contingent on sustained demand and network growth. The realized price serves as a key indicator for this target, suggesting the ceiling will rise as more investors buy ETH at higher prices. Challenges to Consider Despite the bullish outlook, certain risks could impact Ethereum’s price trajectory: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Global regulatory developments could affect the adoption of Ethereum ETFs and DeFi platforms. 2. Market Volatility Cryptocurrency prices remain highly volatile, with potential for sharp corrections. 3. Competition from Other Chains Layer-1 competitors like Solana and Cardano are gaining traction, posing challenges to Ethereum’s dominance. Expert Opinions on Ethereum’s Future Ilya Kalchev, Nexo Analyst: “Ethereum’s strong fundamentals, coupled with growing ETF adoption, set the stage for a breakout above $5,000.” Michael Saylor, Bitcoin Advocate: “While Bitcoin remains the ultimate store of value, Ethereum’s utility-driven demand is fueling its growth.” Conclusion: Ethereum on Track for $5K With rising demand, expanding network activity, and record ETF inflows, Ethereum is well-positioned to surpass $5,000 in the near future. CryptoQuant’s analysis underscores the importance of Ethereum’s growing ecosystem and its pivotal role in the crypto economy. As institutional interest deepens and new investors enter the market, Ethereum’s price ceiling is expected to rise, setting the stage for continued growth in 2025 and beyond.

37635039,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110058,1734185691,Lummis and Bessent Discuss Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the U.S.,"In a groundbreaking move, pro-crypto U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming met with Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent to explore the possibility of establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve for the United States. According to a report by Watcher Guru , the discussions revolved around positioning Bitcoin as a key strategic asset to enhance national financial security and drive innovation in the digital economy. Lummis referred to Bessent as a “champion for digital assets,” signaling his potential as a key ally for advancing the proposed Bitcoin Strategic Asset Reserve Bill . What is a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve? A Bitcoin strategic reserve would function similarly to traditional strategic reserves of gold or foreign currencies. It involves the U.S. government holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves to: Hedge against economic instability. Diversify the country’s reserve portfolio. Position the U.S. as a leader in the rapidly growing digital asset space. Why Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s unique properties make it an ideal candidate for a strategic reserve: Scarcity : Limited to 21 million coins, ensuring immunity to inflation. Portability : Digital and easy to transfer across borders. Global Acceptance : Increasingly recognized as a store of value and financial asset. The Significance of the Meeting Cynthia Lummis: A Pro-Crypto Advocate Senator Lummis has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies, advocating for regulatory clarity and adoption of blockchain technology. She has also emphasized Bitcoin’s potential to strengthen the U.S. financial system. Scott Bessent: A Strategic Ally As the Treasury Secretary nominee, Bessent’s alignment with digital asset innovation could be pivotal for pushing forward policies like the Bitcoin reserve proposal. Lummis highlighted his potential to play a critical role in advancing this agenda. Potential Benefits of a Bitcoin Reserve 1. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty Bitcoin’s independence from traditional monetary systems makes it a valuable hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and economic instability. 2. Financial Innovation Leadership A Bitcoin reserve would signal the U.S.’s commitment to innovation and leadership in the digital economy, attracting talent and investment in the blockchain space. 3. Strengthened Reserve Diversification Bitcoin would complement the existing U.S. reserves of gold and foreign currencies, providing an additional layer of financial security. Challenges to a Bitcoin Reserve While the concept holds promise, implementing a Bitcoin strategic reserve comes with challenges: 1. Price Volatility Bitcoin’s price fluctuations may raise concerns about its suitability as a reserve asset. 2. Regulatory Concerns The lack of a unified global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies could complicate the adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. 3. Political Opposition Not all policymakers are on board with cryptocurrencies, and resistance could slow progress on legislation like the Bitcoin Strategic Asset Reserve Bill. Comparing Bitcoin to Gold as a Reserve Asset Feature Bitcoin Gold Supply Fixed at 21 million Expanding, but limited by mining Portability Digital and borderless Physical and harder to transport Storage Requires secure digital wallets Requires physical vaults Volatility High Low Adoption Rate Rapidly increasing Established What’s Next for the Bitcoin Reserve Proposal? Drafting the Legislation Senator Lummis is expected to push for the formal introduction of the Bitcoin Strategic Asset Reserve Bill in Congress, outlining the framework for incorporating Bitcoin into the U.S.’s strategic reserves. Bipartisan Support Securing bipartisan support will be crucial for the proposal’s success, particularly in addressing concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and regulatory challenges. International Implications If the U.S. adopts Bitcoin as a reserve asset, it could set a precedent for other nations to follow, reshaping the global financial landscape. Industry Reactions The crypto industry has lauded the discussions between Lummis and Bessent: Michael Saylor , Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy: “This is a forward-thinking approach that highlights Bitcoin’s potential to enhance national security and economic resilience.” Elizabeth Warren , Crypto Critic: “Bitcoin’s volatility and environmental concerns make it unsuitable as a reserve asset. Policymakers should focus on regulating this space rather than endorsing it.” Conclusion: A Bold Vision for Bitcoin’s Future The discussions between Senator Cynthia Lummis and Treasury nominee Scott Bessent signal a bold vision for Bitcoin’s integration into national financial strategies. Establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve would position the U.S. at the forefront of the digital asset revolution, demonstrating leadership in innovation and financial security.

37635038,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110056,1734185615,"Bitcoin Mining Costs Surge to $55,950 in Q3 2024, Says CoinShares","A new CoinShares report reveals that the average cash cost for publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies rose by 13% in Q3 2024 , reaching $55,950 per BTC , while total costs, including non-cash expenses, soared to $106,000 per BTC . Several factors contributed to the rising costs, including diverted investments to AI projects, higher electricity prices in Texas, and a shift towards HODL strategies by some miners. Despite operational improvements, prominent mining firms like Riot and TeraWulf faced cost challenges, while Marathon emerged as the most cost-efficient operator. Key Factors Behind Rising Bitcoin Mining Costs 1. Increased Competition for Resources AI Investments : The booming interest in artificial intelligence has diverted capital and hardware resources away from Bitcoin mining. This has driven up the costs of mining equipment and operational expenses. Rising Hashrate : As more miners enter the network, the global Bitcoin hashrate has increased, demanding greater computational power and energy consumption. 2. Higher Electricity Costs Texas Energy Prices : A significant portion of Bitcoin mining operations in the U.S. is concentrated in Texas. Rising electricity prices in the state, exacerbated by extreme weather conditions and regulatory shifts, have increased operational expenses. 3. HODL Strategies Some mining companies are choosing to hold their mined Bitcoin rather than sell, betting on long-term price appreciation. This approach limits immediate revenue streams, making operational expenses harder to offset. Performance of Major Bitcoin Mining Companies Marathon Digital Holdings Key Highlight : Lowest cash costs among public miners. Efficiency Drivers : Increased production capabilities. Beneficial tax incentives. Result : Marathon maintained its competitive edge with cost-efficient operations. TeraWulf Cost Reduction : Achieved a 20% drop in total costs by restructuring debt and optimizing operations. Focus : Strategic financial management helped counter rising energy prices. Riot Platforms Rank : Dropped to seventh place despite operational improvements. Challenges : Higher energy costs and increasing competition limited Riot’s ability to maintain lower costs. Industry-Wide Implications 1. Strain on Margins With cash costs nearing Bitcoin’s spot price, many miners are facing thinner profit margins. This may force smaller or less efficient miners to exit the market, consolidating operations among larger players. 2. Increased Focus on Efficiency Mining firms are exploring new technologies and strategies to reduce costs, including: Renewable energy sources. Advanced cooling systems to improve energy efficiency. AI-driven mining optimization tools. 3. Shift Towards HODLing The decision by some miners to hold Bitcoin instead of selling reflects confidence in long-term price appreciation. However, it also creates short-term financial strain by limiting immediate revenue. Comparative Analysis: Q3 Costs Across Firms Company Cash Cost per BTC Cost Reduction Strategies Marathon Lowest in Q3 Increased production, tax incentives TeraWulf Reduced by 20% Debt restructuring, operational efficiency Riot Platforms Dropped to 7th place Operational improvements but high energy costs Challenges Facing the Mining Industry Despite technological advancements and efficiency gains, several challenges persist: 1. Rising Operational Costs Increasing energy prices and hardware costs continue to strain profit margins, especially for miners relying on non-renewable energy sources. 2. Environmental Concerns Bitcoin mining’s energy-intensive nature has led to criticism over its environmental impact. Regulatory pressures may increase as governments push for sustainable practices. 3. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can disrupt mining companies’ revenue models, especially those dependent on selling BTC to cover operational costs. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Mining 1. Shift Towards Renewable Energy To counter rising electricity costs and address environmental concerns, miners are increasingly turning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and hydroelectric power. 2. Consolidation in the Industry Larger, more efficient mining firms are likely to dominate the market as smaller players struggle to keep up with rising costs. 3. Role of Bitcoin ETFs The growing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs may reduce miners’ influence as BTC proxies but could also drive institutional demand, potentially boosting BTC prices and mining profitability. Conclusion: Rising Costs Reshape Mining Strategies The rise in Bitcoin mining costs to $55,950 in Q3 2024 highlights the evolving challenges and opportunities in the crypto mining industry. Factors like AI-driven resource competition, higher electricity prices, and strategic HODLing are forcing miners to adapt their strategies. While firms like Marathon and TeraWulf are finding ways to stay competitive, the industry as a whole must grapple with thinner margins and increasing operational complexity. As the landscape continues to shift, efficiency, sustainability, and innovation will define the future of Bitcoin mining.

37634957,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110052,1734185553,Pantera Capital CEO: Bitcoin is Much Better Than Gold,"In a recent interview with CNBC, Dan Morehead , co-founder and CEO of Pantera Capital , declared that Bitcoin (BTC) is “much better than gold,” urging the U.S. government to increase its Bitcoin holdings. Highlighting Bitcoin’s unique properties and growing adoption, Morehead positioned Bitcoin as a superior store of value and a transformative new asset class. Why Bitcoin is Better Than Gold Dan Morehead underscored Bitcoin’s advantages over gold as a store of value, pointing out several key factors: 1. Scarcity and Predictability Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins , making it more scarce than gold , which continues to be mined. The predictable issuance rate of Bitcoin ensures transparency in its supply, unlike gold mining, which can vary based on technological advancements and discoveries. 2. Portability Bitcoin is entirely digital, allowing it to be transferred globally in seconds, whereas gold is physical and cumbersome to transport. 3. Divisibility Bitcoin can be divided into satoshis , enabling microtransactions, while dividing gold is impractical for smaller transactions. 4. Accessibility Anyone with an internet connection can own and trade Bitcoin, while gold ownership often requires physical storage and intermediaries. The Case for U.S. Government Bitcoin Holdings Morehead emphasized that the U.S. government should increase its Bitcoin reserves , citing its potential as a strategic financial asset: Hedge Against Inflation : Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it a natural hedge against inflationary monetary policies. Global Dominance : As countries explore digital currencies, owning significant Bitcoin reserves could strengthen the U.S.’s financial leadership. Diversification : Bitcoin offers diversification for national reserves traditionally dominated by fiat currencies and gold. Bitcoin as a New Asset Class Speaking more broadly, Morehead highlighted Bitcoin as part of a broader cryptocurrency ecosystem that represents a transformative new asset class: 1. Low Adoption Rates Morehead noted that “most people simply don’t have exposure to it yet,” signaling significant growth potential as awareness increases. 2. Institutional Participation Institutional investments in Bitcoin have grown substantially, with companies like BlackRock , Fidelity , and MicroStrategy leading the charge. 3. Decentralized Innovation Beyond Bitcoin, the broader crypto market is fostering innovations in DeFi , NFTs , and blockchain technology , creating opportunities for diversified growth. Comparing Bitcoin and Gold Aspect Bitcoin Gold Supply Cap 21 million coins Unlimited mining potential Portability Fully digital, instant transfers Physical, requires logistics Storage Secure digital wallets Physical vaults or intermediaries Divisibility Highly divisible (1 BTC = 100M satoshis) Difficult to divide for transactions Inflation Resistance Fixed supply Inflation-resistant, but variable supply Industry Reactions to Morehead’s Comments Morehead’s assertion that Bitcoin is superior to gold has fueled debates in the crypto and financial sectors: Michael Saylor , Chairman of MicroStrategy: “Dan Morehead’s comparison is spot-on. Bitcoin combines the best qualities of gold with modern technology.” Peter Schiff , Gold Advocate and Bitcoin Critic: “Gold has stood the test of time for thousands of years. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and its volatility is a major drawback.” Challenges to Bitcoin’s Widespread Adoption While Bitcoin’s advantages over gold are compelling, certain challenges remain: 1. Volatility Bitcoin’s price is significantly more volatile than gold, making it less attractive to risk-averse investors. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty Governments worldwide are still formulating policies on Bitcoin, creating uncertainty for institutional and retail investors. 3. Energy Consumption Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact continues to be a point of contention, with critics calling for more sustainable solutions. The Future of Bitcoin Dan Morehead’s advocacy for Bitcoin over gold reflects a growing consensus among crypto leaders about the transformative potential of digital assets. 1. Institutional Adoption As major financial institutions adopt Bitcoin, its position as a legitimate asset class is becoming more established. 2. Integration with National Policies Countries like El Salvador have already embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, and more governments may follow suit, especially amid global economic shifts. 3. Innovations in Crypto Technology The ongoing development of Bitcoin-related technologies, such as layer-2 solutions like Lightning Network, will likely enhance its scalability and usability. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Rise Over Gold Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead’s claim that Bitcoin is better than gold underscores the shifting perceptions of value in the modern financial landscape. Bitcoin’s scarcity, portability, and digital nature position it as a superior alternative to gold, especially for a tech-driven future. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction among institutional investors and governments, it is poised to challenge gold’s long-standing dominance as the ultimate store of value. With adoption still in its early stages, Bitcoin’s journey is far from over—and its potential far from realized.

37634986,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627471,1734185381,Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson blasts Wyoming Token Commission boss over ADA and XRP exclusion,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has heavily criticized the actions of the Wyoming Token Commission. In a recent post on microblogging platform X, Hoskinson did not hold back, ripping into Wyoming Token Commission executive director Anthony Apollo over snubbing Cardano and Ripple in an upcoming stablecoin project. Hoskinson has been vocal about the Wyoming stablecoin project, showing interest in the project. This is entirely down to the fact that out of all the likely blockchains selected for the program, the Commission snubbed Cardano and Ripple. The Commission has initially announced nine blockchains where it will likely launch the stablecoin, including Ethereum, Sui, and Stellar. However, there was a major shock as the project snubbed Bitcoin, Cardano, and Ripple. Cardano founder rips into Wyoming Token Commission boss Although the decision to exclude Ripple, Bitcoin, and Cardano from the project sent shockwaves through the market, Hoskinson is not prepared to let it slide. Over the last few months since the first announcement, he has repeatedly cited bias on the Commission’s part. In a recent podcast, Hoskinson alleged that there was a glaring disdain toward Ripple and Cardano during the selection process. He mentioned that aside from Cardano, other high-utility chains like Bitcoin did not make the list. This is the guy who made the decision to exclude Cardano, XRP, ICP, Bitcoin, Hashgraph, etc But he did include Ethereum. He knows a lot about it, given his former employer was Consensys… https://t.co/wfC2thhTB6 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 14, 2024 In his recent tweet , he criticized the Commission’s head, Anthony Apollo, for snubbing the projects. He also reposted a post that said that Apollo only picked Ethereum because he had a lot of knowledge about the network. Hoskinson mentioned that Apollo had worked for Consensys, one of the core developers of Ethereum when he was still at the company. He clarified that the bias to remove Cardano and include Ethereum was evident. Hoskinson’s post was a reply to an earlier tweet where Apollo told the Wyoming Joint Appropriation Committee that Cardano is centralized. Apollo defends selection amid Hoskinson’s promise Anthony Apollo appeared before the Wyoming Legislative Committee on Friday, where he gave a detailed explanation of the progress of the project. During the meeting, Apollo was asked if he was unfair in his blockchain selection for the project. He mentioned that he held several meetings with representatives from Cardano and treated the network the same way as others. He mentioned that Cardano did not scale through the last screening, passing only four of the five required tests. However, he noted that the network’s project Midnight could have helped it scale through, but it was still being tested when the screening happened. Apollo highlighted that the reason Cardano was not selected was majorly down to the agency’s choice to ensure all selected projects passed the five test stages. Despite this, Hoskinson has urged other unselected networks to file lawsuits against the Wyoming Token Commission. He argued that the unfair selection process could create uneven competition among firms in the United States crypto industry. Meanwhile, this latest outburst goes against an earlier promise made by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. In a previous post on X, he apologized to everybody including Ethereum, asking them to let peace reign in 2025. Despite his controversial nature, Hoskinson noted that it was time to grow the crypto landscape in America, saying rivalry would not help them. He called on blockchains like Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin, and others who he had criticized in the past to work together in the new year to achieve greater things. However, not long after his promises, he is back to accusing a former Ethereum-affiliated employee of bias.

37634852,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110042,1734185310,"Bitcoin Could Surpass $160K by 2025, Says Matrixport","Matrixport , a leading crypto financial services platform, has made an ambitious forecast that Bitcoin (BTC) could surpass $160,000 by 2025. This optimistic projection is underpinned by a combination of factors, including sustained demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, favorable macroeconomic conditions, and an expanding global liquidity pool. Matrixport’s analysis also highlights the normalization of funding rates and improved market stability, suggesting that Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase may be shorter than in previous cycles. Key Drivers Behind the $160K Prediction Matrixport’s bullish outlook for Bitcoin is supported by several critical factors: 1. Demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs The approval and rising popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs have brought significant institutional interest into the market. ETFs offer: Ease of Access : Investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding it. Increased Liquidity : Spot ETFs boost Bitcoin’s trading volume, stabilizing its price. 2. Favorable Macroeconomic Conditions Matrixport points to improving global economic conditions that support Bitcoin’s growth: Decreasing Interest Rates : Lower rates often drive capital into alternative investments like Bitcoin. Weakened Fiat Currencies : Inflation and monetary policies are encouraging investors to seek hedges, with Bitcoin seen as a “digital gold.” 3. Expanding Global Liquidity As liquidity in global markets increases, risk-on assets like Bitcoin tend to benefit. The availability of capital drives higher demand for assets with growth potential, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s Current Market Momentum Matrixport believes Bitcoin’s market dynamics are setting the stage for significant upward movement: 1. Shortened Consolidation Phase The Fear and Greed Index and other market indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s current period of price consolidation could be shorter compared to previous cycles, paving the way for quicker gains. 2. Normalization of Funding Rates Funding rates, a key measure in futures markets, have stabilized. This indicates healthier market conditions and reduced speculative pressure. 3. Strengthening Market Stability Improved stability in Bitcoin’s price movements is encouraging both retail and institutional participation, building momentum for long-term growth. How $160K Fits into Bitcoin’s Historical Trends Bitcoin’s potential to hit $160,000 aligns with its historical four-year cycle driven by halving events , where the mining reward is halved approximately every four years. Post-Halving Bull Runs Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price surges following halving events, due to reduced supply entering the market. The next halving in 2024 is expected to further limit supply, contributing to price appreciation. Previous Milestones 2017 : Bitcoin peaked at ~$20,000. 2021 : Bitcoin hit ~$69,000. 2025 (Projection) : A potential surge to $160,000, consistent with its exponential growth pattern. Institutional Adoption: A Key Catalyst The growing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors is a pivotal factor in Matrixport’s prediction. Recent developments include: ETFs : Increasing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs by regulators and investors. Corporate Holdings : Companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square continue to hold substantial Bitcoin reserves. Broader Integration : Payment giants like PayPal and Visa are integrating Bitcoin into their platforms. Challenges to Reaching $160K While the projection is optimistic, several challenges could impact Bitcoin’s ability to achieve this milestone: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Regulatory scrutiny of Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry remains a significant hurdle, especially in key markets like the U.S. and EU. 2. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which could deter some institutional investors. 3. Competition from Altcoins As alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) gain traction, they could divert investor attention away from Bitcoin. Comparative Market Outlook Metric Current (2024) Projected (2025) Bitcoin Price ~$35,000 $160,000+ Market Capitalization ~$680 billion ~$3 trillion Global Liquidity Impact Moderate High Institutional Involvement Growing Strong Industry Reactions Matrixport’s $160,000 prediction has sparked interest across the crypto community. Market analysts have weighed in, with many supporting the notion that Bitcoin’s fundamentals are stronger than ever. “The combination of spot ETFs, macroeconomic shifts, and institutional interest creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin to reach new heights,” said a leading crypto strategist. Conclusion: A Bullish Future for Bitcoin Matrixport’s forecast of Bitcoin surpassing $160,000 by 2025 reflects the cryptocurrency’s strengthening fundamentals and growing institutional acceptance. While challenges like regulatory scrutiny remain, the combination of increasing demand, favorable macroeconomic trends, and a maturing market positions Bitcoin for continued success. As Bitcoin prepares for its next halving and the broader crypto market evolves, all eyes will be on its ability to reach this ambitious target.

37634823,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110045,1734185233,Early Bitcoin Investor Sentenced to Two Years for Tax Fraud,"Frank Richard Ahlgren III, a Texas-based early Bitcoin (BTC) investor, has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for tax fraud. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Ahlgren deliberately underreported over $3.7 million in Bitcoin capital gains from 2017 to 2019, leading to a tax loss of more than $1 million for the U.S. government. In addition to the prison sentence, Ahlgren has been ordered to pay $1.1 million in restitution to the U.S. government. The case highlights the IRS and DOJ’s heightened focus on tax compliance within the cryptocurrency industry. Details of the Case Underreporting Bitcoin Gains Ahlgren inflated Bitcoin’s cost basis on his 2017 tax return to reduce his taxable income. He also failed to report additional Bitcoin sales totaling $650,000 , further concealing his capital gains. Use of Mixers and Wallet Transfers The DOJ revealed that Ahlgren employed sophisticated methods to evade detection, including: Cryptocurrency Mixers : Services that obscure the origins of funds by mixing transactions. Multiple Wallet Transfers : Movement of funds across various wallets to make tracking difficult. These tactics were aimed at concealing the true extent of his Bitcoin holdings and gains. Impact on U.S. Government The IRS estimates that Ahlgren’s actions caused over $1 million in tax losses . Tax compliance is critical to maintaining government revenue, and cases like these highlight the challenges authorities face in ensuring fair contributions from cryptocurrency investors. Legal Repercussions The sentence imposed on Ahlgren includes: Prison Time : Two years for willful tax evasion. Restitution Payment : $1.1 million to the U.S. government to compensate for lost tax revenue. DOJ Statement In its announcement, the DOJ emphasized its commitment to pursuing tax evasion cases involving cryptocurrencies. “Cryptocurrency transactions are not exempt from tax laws. This case serves as a warning that attempts to hide digital asset gains will be met with serious consequences.” IRS and Cryptocurrency Compliance The IRS has been increasing its scrutiny of cryptocurrency transactions, particularly as the crypto market grows. 1. Expanded Reporting Requirements The IRS now requires taxpayers to report all cryptocurrency transactions, including: Sales or exchanges of digital assets. Receipt of cryptocurrency as payment or through mining. 2. Enforcement Actions High-profile cases like Ahlgren’s demonstrate the IRS’s commitment to enforcing compliance and prosecuting those who attempt to evade taxes. 3. Focus on Mixers and Wallet Privacy The use of mixers and private wallets is a red flag for regulators, as these tools are often associated with attempts to hide illicit activities or evade taxes. Lessons for Cryptocurrency Investors 1. Report All Gains Cryptocurrency gains, whether from trading, mining, or other activities, are subject to tax laws. Underreporting or failing to report these gains can result in severe penalties. 2. Maintain Accurate Records Investors should keep detailed records of their transactions, including: Purchase dates and prices (cost basis). Sale dates and proceeds. Transaction fees. 3. Avoid Illegal Tactics Using mixers or other methods to obscure transactions can raise suspicion and lead to legal consequences. The Importance of Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized and often anonymous ecosystem, but governments are actively working to ensure that these transactions are subject to the same tax regulations as traditional financial activities. 1. Enhanced Monitoring Tools Agencies like the IRS and DOJ are leveraging advanced blockchain analysis tools to track cryptocurrency transactions. 2. Increased Collaboration The U.S. government is partnering with international regulators and private firms to identify and prosecute tax evasion involving digital assets. Comparative Perspective: Tax Compliance in Crypto Compliance Aspect Traditional Assets Cryptocurrencies Tax Reporting Well-established regulations Increasingly strict enforcement Transaction Tracking Bank and brokerage records Blockchain analysis tools Evasion Techniques Offshore accounts Mixers, private wallets Penalties for Noncompliance Severe Equally severe for crypto cases Conclusion: A Warning to Crypto Investors The sentencing of Frank Richard Ahlgren III serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in failing to comply with tax laws. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, so does the scrutiny from regulatory and enforcement agencies. For cryptocurrency investors, the key takeaway is clear: transparency and compliance are essential. Attempting to obscure transactions or underreport gains not only undermines the integrity of the financial system but also exposes individuals to severe legal and financial penalties.

37634822,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110048,1734185191,Crypto Miners Adopt MicroStrategy-Like Bitcoin Strategy: JPMorgan Report,"JPMorgan has highlighted a transformative shift in the crypto mining industry, revealing that miners are increasingly adopting a MicroStrategy-like approach to Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation. Instead of selling reserves, miners are raising funds through debt and equity to retain their BTC holdings, a trend accelerated by profitability challenges following Bitcoin’s April halving and surging hashrates. Miners, such as MARA Holdings , which now holds 35,000 BTC and ranks as the second-largest public Bitcoin holder, exemplify this strategic pivot. With the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a record $10 billion raised in equity in 2024 , miners’ roles as BTC proxies are evolving rapidly. What is the MicroStrategy BTC Strategy? MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, is renowned for its bold approach to Bitcoin acquisition. The company: Issues Debt and Equity : Funds BTC purchases without liquidating reserves. Treats BTC as a Treasury Asset : Positions Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Holds Instead of Sells : Avoids selling Bitcoin even during market volatility. This strategy has made MicroStrategy the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with over 150,000 BTC in reserves. Why Are Miners Adopting This Strategy? 1. Profitability Pressures Post-Halving Bitcoin’s April 2024 halving reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, significantly cutting miners’ revenue while operational costs, such as energy expenses, remained high. 2. Rising Hashrates As competition intensifies, miners are investing heavily in infrastructure, driving up network hashrates. This further squeezes profit margins, prompting miners to hold Bitcoin reserves for future appreciation instead of immediate cash flow. 3. Influence of Spot Bitcoin ETFs The growing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which provide direct BTC exposure to investors, has reduced miners’ traditional role as BTC proxies. Consequently, miners are seeking alternative strategies to maintain their relevance and maximize profitability. MARA Holdings: A Case Study in BTC Retention MARA Holdings , a prominent crypto mining firm, exemplifies this new strategy: BTC Holdings : MARA holds 35,000 BTC, worth billions at current market prices. Second-Largest Public Holder : Trails only MicroStrategy in Bitcoin reserves among publicly traded companies. Funding Approach : Raises capital through debt and equity, avoiding the sale of mined Bitcoin. This approach positions MARA as both a mining operation and a Bitcoin investment vehicle, benefiting from BTC’s long-term price appreciation. The Rise of BTC-Focused Fundraising Record Equity Raising in 2024 Crypto miners have raised a record $10 billion in equity this year, surpassing 2021’s previous high. This capital is being used to: Expand mining capacity. Purchase additional Bitcoin. Maintain operational liquidity without liquidating reserves. Shift Away from Selling BTC Miners increasingly view their Bitcoin holdings as strategic assets rather than immediate revenue sources, aligning their operations with long-term investment philosophies. Impact on the Bitcoin Ecosystem 1. Reduced Sell Pressure By holding Bitcoin instead of selling, miners are contributing to reduced sell pressure, potentially stabilizing and supporting BTC prices. 2. Strengthened Institutional Interest The adoption of sophisticated funding strategies by miners mirrors institutional practices, further legitimizing the Bitcoin market. 3. Diversification of BTC Proxies With the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs, miners are adapting their roles by becoming both producers and strategic holders of Bitcoin, offering investors diversified exposure to the asset class. Challenges for Miners While the shift to a BTC-holding strategy offers long-term benefits, it is not without risks: 1. Market Volatility Retaining Bitcoin reserves exposes miners to the risk of price declines, which could impact their financial stability. 2.

37634743,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110040,1734185130,Ledger Hardware Wallet Faces Security Concerns After $2.5M Theft Report,"On December 13, 2024, an anonymous user, @anchor_drops , reported on X (formerly Twitter) a significant theft of 10 BTC (approximately $1 million) and $1.5 million in NFTs from their Ledger Nano S hardware wallet . This incident has sparked concerns within the cryptocurrency community regarding potential vulnerabilities in Ledger’s security system , though no official statement has been issued by the company yet. What Happened? The affected user claimed that their Ledger Nano S wallet, known for its high-security features, was compromised. According to the post: Total Loss : $2.5 million, including 10 BTC and a portfolio of valuable NFTs. Device Used : Ledger Nano S, a widely trusted hardware wallet. The incident raises critical questions about the security of Ledger devices, which are specifically designed to safeguard cryptocurrency and digital assets. Community Speculations While details about the breach are unclear, several theories have emerged regarding the possible causes: 1. Potential Exploitation of Ledger Vulnerabilities Speculation suggests a previously unknown flaw in the Ledger Nano S system may have been exploited. This could involve: Physical Tampering : If the device was accessed and manipulated by a third party. Software Exploit : A vulnerability in Ledger’s firmware or associated software. 2. User Error or Phishing Attack Many security breaches result from human error. Possible scenarios include: Phishing : The user may have unknowingly shared their private keys or recovery phrases via a fraudulent website or email. Improper Storage : Storing recovery phrases or passwords insecurely, making them accessible to attackers. 3. Third-Party Compromise If the theft was facilitated by malware or spyware on the user’s connected device (e.g., a PC or smartphone), the attacker could have intercepted credentials or transactions. Why This Incident Matters Ledger hardware wallets are trusted by millions worldwide as a secure solution for storing cryptocurrencies. This theft challenges the perception of hardware wallets as near-impenetrable and raises broader concerns about: 1. User Confidence in Hardware Wallets The Ledger Nano S is marketed as one of the most secure wallets available. Incidents like this undermine trust in the brand and the broader hardware wallet market. 2. Increasing Sophistication of Crypto Attacks Theft involving hardware wallets indicates that cybercriminals are employing more advanced techniques to bypass even robust security measures. 3. Need for Transparent Communication The lack of an immediate official statement from Ledger has left the community seeking clarity and assurance about the wallet’s security. What Should Ledger Users Do Now? If you own a Ledger wallet, here are some immediate steps to enhance your security: 1. Verify Your Ledger Device Ensure your device is genuine by checking the packaging seal and authenticity using Ledger’s verification tools. Never purchase hardware wallets from unofficial sellers. 2. Update Firmware Regularly Always install the latest firmware updates, as these often include important security patches. 3. Protect Recovery Phrases Store your recovery phrases offline in a secure location. Never share them online or with anyone claiming to represent Ledger. 4. Monitor Account Activity Regularly check your wallet balances and transaction history. Use blockchain explorers to verify recent activity if suspicious changes occur. 5. Enable Additional Security Measures Consider using passphrases or multi-signature wallets for added protection. Ledger’s History with Security Concerns This isn’t the first time Ledger has faced security-related controversies: 1. 2020 Data Breach Ledger suffered a major data breach exposing the personal information of over 270,000 customers, including email addresses and phone numbers. While no private keys or wallet access was compromised, phishing attacks on affected users surged. 2. Phishing Campaigns In the wake of the breach, customers were targeted with fake Ledger update emails, luring them to fraudulent websites that captured recovery phrases. These incidents highlight the need for heightened vigilance, even when using top-tier security devices. FAQs About Ledger Security How secure are Ledger wallets generally? Ledger wallets are among the most secure in the market, utilizing secure elements and offline storage to protect private keys. However, no system is completely immune to breaches or user errors. What should I do if I suspect my Ledger wallet is compromised? Immediately transfer your funds to a new wallet using a fresh recovery phrase and device. Avoid reusing compromised credentials. Does Ledger plan to address this theft? As of now, Ledger has not issued an official statement. Users are encouraged to monitor Ledger’s official channels for updates. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The reported theft of $2.5 million from a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet serves as a stark reminder that no solution is entirely foolproof. While hardware wallets remain one of the safest methods for storing digital assets, users must complement these tools with diligent security practices. Ledger’s response to this incident will likely shape the future of its reputation and the trust of its users. For now, the incident underscores the critical need for ongoing vigilance and education in safeguarding digital wealth.

Crypto scams are fraudulent schemes designed to steal digital money or deceive individuals into parting with it. Some scammers promise rapid growth of your investments, but more often than not, they take your money and vanish. Many fake websites mimic legitimate platforms, tricking users into making purchases that result in financial losses. Scammers often impersonate well-known figures, such as tech experts, to trap unsuspecting victims. To stay safe, it’s crucial to research thoroughly before investing or storing your digital assets. If something appears suspicious, it probably is, so exercise caution! 1.1. Real-World Examples Ponzi Scam: Bitconnect is a notorious example where investors were lured with promises of high returns through a lending program, but it ultimately proved to be a Ponzi scheme, resulting in significant losses. Mt. Gox Exit Scam: The Mt. Gox exchange claimed to have been hacked and lost Bitcoin, but it was later revealed that the exchange’s owner was the real perpetrator of the theft.

16224225,https://coinpedia.org/?p=223609,1734184724,Mastering Crypto Chart Patterns: Your Guide to Predicting Market Trends,"The post Mastering Crypto Chart Patterns: Your Guide to Predicting Market Trends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Trading patterns is a topic that every trader should explore whatever is the market he or she focuses on. Have you ever wondered how crypto analysts make crypto predictions accurately? What enables them to do the market trend analysis is their skill and knowledge to understand and interpret crypto chart patterns. 1.

That’s exactly what crypto chart patterns empower you to do! They provide a visual representation of market behavior helping you make informed decisions and seize opportunities for profit.

Trending Crypto Chart Patterns: Exploring the Popular Ones There are numerous chart patterns. Each pattern has its own unique characteristics, functionalities, and advantages.

Here we will discuss some of the most relevant chart patterns – the ones which are popular and are unique for their characteristics. 2.1 Mastering Triangle Crypto Chart Patterns Triangle Crypto Chart Patterns are very popular and widely used. Ascending Triangles, Descending Triangles, Symmetrical Triangle,s and Wedges are the prime ones. 2.1.1. Ascending Triangle Suppose Bitcoin has been on an upward trend for several months. During this time, its price forms a series of higher highs and higher lows. At a certain price level, there is significant resistance that the crypto attempts to surpass. This resistance acts as a psychological barrier, causing consolidation. Eventually, when the price breaks above the resistance level, it confirms the ascending triangle pattern, suggesting a potential continuation of the bullish trend. 2.1.2. Descending Triangle Consider Bitcoin experiencing a prolonged downtrend, with the price gradually forming lower highs and lower lows. At a specific price level, a strong support level halts further decline, The price bounces off this support multiple times, creating a descending triangle pattern. This formation suggests that the bearish trend is expected to continue, providing a potential sell signal for traders. 2.1.3. Symmetrical Triangle Picture Ethereum ’s price moving in a sideways manner, with alternating higher lows and lower highs. These price swings create a symmetrical triangle formation, where the upper and lower trendlines converge. As the triangle narrows, it indicates a decreasing range of price volatility. Traders closely monitor this pattern as a breakout in either direction, accompanied by significant volume, could signify a potential trend reversal. 2.1.4. Wedges Wedges are special triangle patterns that can further be classified into rising wedges and falling wedges. They provide valuable insights into potential price reversals. 2.2. Exploring Rectangle Crypto Chart Patterns Rectangle Crypto Chart Patterns are unique and have many special features. Bullish Rectangle, Bearish Rectangle, Double Top and Double Bottom are the main patterns that come under this category. 2.2.1. Bullish Rectangle Picture a cryptocurrency experiencing a downtrend, with the price consolidating within a range bounded by a strong support level and a resistance level. This consolidation forms a Bullish Rectangle pattern, indicating diminishing selling pressure and a potential upward breakout. Traders eagerly await the price to breach the resistance level, providing a confirmation for a buy signal. 2.2.2. Bearish Rectangle In contrast, suppose the same crypto has been in an uptrend, but the price starts consolidating within a range, bounded by a strong support level and a resistance level. This consolidation creates a Bearish Rectangle pattern, suggesting waning buying momentum and a potential downward breakout. Traders keenly observe the support level, waiting for a confirmation break to initiate a sell signal. 2.2.3. Double Top Let’s say Bitcoin experiences a significant price surge, reaching a new high and subsequently pulling back. After a brief recovery, the price attempts to surpass the previous high but fails, forming the second peak. This Double Top pattern suggests a bearish reversal, and astute traders may consider it as a sell signal, anticipating a downward price movement. 2.2.4. Double Bottom In contrast, consider a scenario where Bitcoin’s price declines and reaches a particular level, bounces back up, and then retraces to the same level once again. This forms the Double Bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal. Savvy traders may perceive this as a buy signal, expecting an uptrend following a successful break above the upper horizontal line. 2.3. Learning Pole Crypto Chart Patterns Pole crypto chart patterns are really special for their accuracy. In terms of popularity, some of them are the highly preferred ones. Bullish Flag, Bearish Flag, Bullish Pennant and Bearish Pennant are the popular ones. 2.3.1. Bullish Flag Let’s imagine a cryptocurrency experiencing a strong price surge, known as the pole, followed by a period of consolidation with a series of lower highs. This consolidation resembles a flag, hence the name ‘Bullish Flag’. Traders recognise this pattern as a potential buying opportunity, expecting the price to break out above the consolidation phase and continue the upward trend. 2.3.2. Bearish Flag The Bearish Flag is the mirror image of the Bullish Flag. Suppose the same crypto encounters a significant downward price movement, forming the pole, followed by a consolidation phase characterised by higher highs. This consideration resembles a flag but in a bearish context. Traders interpret this pattern as a sell signal, anticipating a downward breakout from the consolidation phase, leading to a continuation of the bearish trend. 2.3.3. Bullish Pennant A Bullish Pennant is a pattern similar to a Bullish Flag but with a triangular consolidation structure. Imagine a cryptocurrency experiencing a rapid upward price movement, forming the pole, followed by a consolidation period where the price forms a triangular pattern with higher lows and lower highs. Traders interpret this pattern as a bullish sign, anticipating the price to break out of the consolidation phase and continue its upward trajectory. 2.3.4. Bearish Pennant The Bearish Pennant is the inverse of the Bullish Pennant. Let’s assume the same cryptocurrency encounters a steep price decline, forming the pole, followed by a consolidation phase where the price gradually decreases. This consolidation phase resembles a pennant but in a bearish context. Traders intercept this pattern as a sell signal, expecting a downward breakout from the consolidation phase, indicating a continuation of the bearish trend. 2.4. Other Trending Chart Trading Patterns There are some unique patterns that don’t fit inside any of the general types. The prominent among them are Head and Shoulders Pattern, Inverted Head and Shoulders Pattern, and Cup and Handle Pattern. 2.4.1. Head and Shoulders Crypto Chart Patterns Imagine you are analysing the price chart of a cryptocurrency. You notice a peak (the head) followed by two smaller peaks on either side (the shoulders). This pattern suggests a potential trend reversal. If the head and shoulders pattern forms after an uptrend, it indicates a bearish reversal. Conversely, if it forms after a downtrend, it signals a bullish reversal. 2.4.2. Invested Head and Shoulders Let’s flip things around and explore the inverted head and shoulders pattern! Suppose you are analysing a cryptocurrency’s price chart and notice a trough (the head) followed by two smaller troughs (the shoulders) on either side. This pattern suggests a potential trend reversal. If the inverted head and shoulders pattern forms after a downtrend, it indicates a bullish reversal. 2.4.3. Cup and Handle Imagine you’re analysing the price chart of a cryptocurrency, and you observe a rounded bottom formation, resembling a cup. Following the cup formation, there’s a small downward movement called the handle. This pattern typically indicates a bullish reversal. Traders often look for a breakout above the handle’s resistance level as a conformation of the pattern, signalling a potential upward trend. 2.5. Special Chart Patterns to Detect Market Manipulation In certain circumstances, we cannot blindly rely on popular chart patterns, as the crypto market is highly susceptible to manipulation. There are charts that are exclusively designed to detect market manipulation. 2.5.1. The Bart Simpson Pattern Suppose you’re analyzing the Bitcoin chart on a smaller timeframe, and you notice something peculiar. You observe sudden movements, a bump in one direction, followed by consolidation, and then another abrupt bump in the opposite direction, returning close to the base price. This intriguing phenomenon has earned the name ‘Bart Simpson’ pattern, owing to its resemblance to the head shape of the iconic Simpsons character. This pattern often emerges during volatile trading periods. The motive behind these sudden pumps and dumps is likely the liquidation of crypto margin traders, both short and long, through market manipulation. 3. Success Rate of Crypto Chart Patterns One of the factors that determine how much importance you should give to the interpretation derived from a specific chart pattern is the success rate. Well, what is it? The success rate of crypto chart patterns relies on a combination of factors, including the trader’s skill, market conditions, and supporting indicators. Precisely, by continuously honing their chart pattern analysis skills, staying updated on market dynamics, and leveraging complementary indicators, traders can enhance their accuracy in interpreting and capitalizing on chart patterns.

32180814,https://coinpedia.org/?p=336072,1734184590,Creating Crypto Currency: Token vs Coin,"The post Creating Crypto Currency: Token vs Coin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Introduction Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography to stay secure. Unlike regular money governments issue (fiat currencies), cryptocurrencies run on blockchain—a decentralized ledger that a network of computers (nodes) maintains to ensure transparency and stop double-spending. Why Does Knowing the Difference Between Tokens and Coins Matter to Blockchain Developers? For blockchain developers, knowing the difference between tokens and coins has a significant impact on how they design blockchain projects. Understanding the details helps them pick the right type of digital asset for a specific use case making sure it works well, stays secure, and people want to use it. Section 1: Basics of Cryptocurrency What is a Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that follows cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the new units. Components: Blockchain: Blockchain is a distributed database that records all the transactions across the network. Consensus Mechanism: Consensus mechanisms are the set of rules that are followed by all the nodes on the state of the blockchain. Section 2: Coins Definition of Coins Coin is a type of cryptocurrency that operates on its own blockchain. Examples are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Features of Coins Native Blockchain: Native blockchain is an independent local blockchain of the coins. Examples of Use Cases: Digital currency (Bitcoin) and smart contract execution (Ethereum) How Coins Are Created Steps Involved : Design and Conceptualization : Outline the coin’s purpose and features. This involves describing its intended application total supply, and how it will be distributed. Blockchain Selection : Decide whether to create a new blockchain or use an existing one. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum run on their own blockchains, while some projects might split off from an existing blockchain. Development : Build the coin’s protocol, which includes the consensus mechanism (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake), and set up nodes. Testing : Check the coin’s functionality and security through a series of trials on a test network. Deployment : Release the coin on the blockchain allowing it to be used for transactions. Promotion and Adoption : Put into action plans to boost user uptake, like marketing drives and team-ups. Technical Requirements : Knowledge of blockchain technology Proficiency in coding and known languages like C++ and Python. Section 3: Tokens Definition of Tokens A token stands as a digital asset built on a pre-existing blockchain framework. In contrast to coins that get their very own blockchains, tokens ride on the established rails of a blockchain that’s already up and running. You’ve got stuff like “ERC-20” tokens hanging out on Ethereum and “BEP-20” tokens calling Binance Smart Chain home. Features of Tokens Built on Existing Blockchains: Tokens are built on top of existing blockchain platforms utilising their security and ad technology. Examples of Use Cases: Utility Tokens: Provide access to a service or a product that is within the blockchain domain. Security Tokens: These are the representation of ownership such as shares in a company etc, and these tokens are subjected to security regulations. How Tokens are Created Steps Involved : Define the Token : Figure out the goal, features, and tech specs of your token. Decide if you’re making a utility token, security token, or some other kind. Choose a Blockchain Platform : Choose a blockchain maybe Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, that lets you make tokens. Base your choice on stuff like how much you’ll pay per transaction how fast it is, and how big the community is. Develop the Smart Contract : Get into coding the smart contract that’ll control your token. You need to use languages for smart contracts, like Solidity, for programming how your token will work. Testing : Make sure to run the smart contract on a testnet to double-check its security and proper operation. Gotta catch and squash all those pesky bugs or security issues. Deployment : Time to launch the smart contract on the mainnet so everyone can start using the token. Now it’s ready for all sorts of transactions and app integrations. Distribution : Get creative with ways to hand out and keep track of the token. You might go with ICOs free token drops, or different plans to get tokens into the hands of the people. Technical Requirements : Familiarity with the various blockchains and their smart contract languages Hands-on experience with development environments Section 4: Key Differences Between Tokens and Coins Let’s have a look at the differences between Tokens and Coins: Section 5: When to Use Tokens vs. Coins Choosing the Right Option While creating a Token or coin there are several factors that need to be considered: Case Studies Tokens: Basic Attention Token (BAT): In the Brave browser’s world, BAT rewards folks for checking out ads. This ERC-20 token took advantage of Ethereum’s setup making it faster and cheaper to get off the ground. Chainlink (LINK): LINK’s another ERC-20 token, but it’s all about giving a little something to the data peeps (oracles) in the Chainlink oracle network that’s spread out all over. Coins: Bitcoin (BTC): The ancestor of them all Bitcoin, hit the scene as the original cryptocurrency for sending cash from A to B, no middleman. It’s got its very own blockchain and people use it to keep their wealth or buy stuff. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum goes beyond a mere digital currency; it serves as a foundation for independent apps ( DApps ) and has ETH as its built-in currency, fueling transfers and smart contracts on its blockchain network. Section 6: Practical Considerations Development Tools and Platforms Tools for Creating Coins: Blockchain Platforms: You can use stuff like Hyperledger Fabric and Tendermint if you want to build cool new blockchains for your coins. Geth & Parity: These are like playgrounds if you’re looking to craft coins that’ll run on Ethereum. Coding Languages: If you’re into blockchain crafting, you’ll be using code like C++, Python, and Go. Platforms for Creating Tokens: Ethereum: It’s the go-to spot for making tokens, packed with lots of stuff for developers and a big community. Binance Smart Chain: This one’s got cheaper costs for moving stuff around and does it quicker so lots of folks pick it for their tokens. Polkadot: Polkadot stands out for allowing users to make advanced tokens that work across different chains due to its traits for linking and expanding. Solana: Solana shines as a blockchain that can handle loads of activity while keeping costs down. It’s great for building tokens that need to handle tons of transactions. Challenges and Considerations Security: Making sure hackers can’t mess with your coin or token is super important. With tokens, one bad smart contract, like those with reentrancy glitches, might cost you heaps. For coins, you gotta be sure that the system confirming all the blockchain transactions is solid. Compliance: The rules for what’s okay with tokens shift depending on where you are for the ones that are like stocks. You need to get the scoop on these laws and follow ’em to stay out of hot water. Scalability: When your thing starts to blow up, you need your blockchain or whatever’s holding your token to deal with way more transactions without crashing and burning. Community Support: Talking about tokens here, but having a bunch of people and devs rooting for you on the platform you picked can make or break what you’re doing Conclusion Before we conclude let’s summarize all that we have seen in this article. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use blockchain technology. Coins run on their own blockchains, while tokens build on existing ones. Knowing how tokens differ from coins helps in creating the right digital asset for specific needs. The digital asset scene keeps changing, with new tech and rules shaping what’s next. Dive deeper and begin your own blockchain projects. Use what you know about tokens and coins to create new ideas. Happy Coding!!

37634533,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627453,1734184460,Trump’s return forces European central banks to soften policies,"Europe’s central banks are scrambling as Donald Trump prepares to step back into the White House. His incoming presidency has reignited fears of trade wars, geopolitical tensions, and currency volatility. Policymakers across the continent are in damage-control mode, slashing interest rates and signaling further cuts to shield their fragile economies. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) shocked markets with a half-point cut, bringing rates to 0.5%. This level hasn’t been seen since September 2022, back when Switzerland ended its eight-year experiment with negative rates. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) followed up with its own quarter-point reduction, dropping its key rate to a 1.5-year low. Christine Lagarde, ECB President, laid out the game plan: “The direction of travel currently is very clear.” The cuts are expected to continue into 2025, with insiders hinting at similar actions in January and March. Currency chaos and Swiss fears The Swiss franc, often seen as a safe haven during global crises, has become a source of anxiety for the SNB. Antoine Martin, the bank’s vice president, bluntly stated that external risks pose the biggest threat to Switzerland’s economy. The SNB is prepared to do whatever it takes to stabilize the franc, including more rate cuts, intervening in currency markets, or even bringing back negative rates. Martin Schlegel, SNB President, warned traders not to test the central bank’s resolve. “Developments abroad represent the main risk,” he said, pointing to Trump’s return as a potential trigger for currency speculation. Switzerland relies on open and stable global markets, and any disruption from Trump’s trade policies could hit its economy hard. ECB braces for economic fallout The ECB, already facing weak economic growth and sluggish inflation, is now staring down an even bigger problem: Trump’s trade policies. The central bank cut its deposit rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 3%. That was the third consecutive rate cut, totaling 100 basis points since June. Lagarde made it clear that the ECB is moving away from restrictive monetary policies. The bank’s latest projections paint a bleak picture. Eurozone growth for 2025 is now expected to hit just 1.1%, down from an earlier forecast of 1.3%. Inflation is stuck at 2.3%, with the risk of falling further below the bank’s 2% target. Economists at ABN Amro described Trump’s tariffs as a “disinflationary shock,” predicting even looser monetary policies to offset the fallout. Investors are betting that ECB rates could drop to as low as 1.75% by late 2025. But some think even that might not be enough. Global domino effect Europe isn’t alone in trying to Trump-proof its economy. Canada’s central bank preemptively cut rates by 50 basis points this week, citing fears of higher tariffs from its southern neighbor. Brazil, facing its own fiscal turmoil and Trump’s warnings to BRICS countries not to challenge the U.S. dollar, took a different approach, raising rates by 100 basis points to steady its currency. The ECB, however, has unique challenges. While growth in the eurozone unexpectedly ticked up in the third quarter, recent data shows cracks forming, particularly in the services sector. Manufacturing has already been weak for months. Fabio Panetta of Italy and Francois Villeroy de Galhau of France have hinted at more aggressive rate cuts to spur growth, while Germany’s Joachim Nagel warns against going too far. Investors and policymakers alike are watching Washington closely, knowing that January 20, the day Trump takes office, could bring sweeping changes to the global financial system. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to follow suit with a rate cut next week after U.S. inflation data came in as expected. Central banks worldwide are moving preemptively, knowing that Trump’s policies rarely follow conventional wisdom.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, has joined forces with Elon Musk to challenge the AI company’s shift, raising concerns about its impact on Silicon Valley’s innovation landscape. This legal fight is also sparked by deep ethical questions, especially after the tragic death of a whistleblower. Meta and Musk’s Opposition to OpenAI Meta, together with Elon Musk, is pushing back against OpenAI’s recent transition to a for-profit organization. In a formal letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Meta warned that OpenAI’s restructuring could misuse nonprofit resources for private financial gain. According to Meta, this move betrays OpenAI’s original nonprofit goals. Zuckerberg, despite his past rivalry with Musk, has now become a key ally in this legal battle. Both are concerned that OpenAI’s shift could encourage other startups to take advantage of nonprofit models for profit. Meta’s letter has called for an investigation into OpenAI’s actions, particularly focusing on the misuse of tax-free donations. The Ethical Dilemma in AI Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has long been critical of the company’s decision to switch to a profit-driven approach . Musk believes this contradicts OpenAI’s founding mission to serve the public good. His concerns go beyond just this issue—he has also filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, accusing them of anti-competitive behavior. With Zuckerberg now backing Musk’s cause, the opposition has gained significant momentum. The shift to a for-profit model is raising big questions about whether profit should come before ethics in the AI industry. Meta and Musk argue that OpenAI’s new approach could set a dangerous precedent for other companies in Silicon Valley. Tragic Death of Whistleblower The debate over OpenAI’s ethics has grown even more intense after the tragic death of Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI researcher. Balaji, who had raised concerns about copyright issues in OpenAI’s systems, was found dead in his apartment. Authorities ruled his death a suicide, but his passing has intensified the spotlight on the ethical challenges faced by AI researchers.

The latest boost comes from Arkham Exchange, which announced on December 13 that it has officially listed XRP for both spot and perpetual trading pairs. The listing has not only drawn significant attention from market participants but also underscored the growing institutional interest in XRP. Following the announcement, Arkham Exchange declared, “XRP TRADING IS NOW LIVE,” signaling its strong support for the token. This move coincides with XRP’s recent robust performance, which saw its price climb approximately 6% to $2.46, alongside a notable trading volume increase of 10%, reaching $10.29 billion. Market watchers are particularly impressed with XRP’s ability to hit a 24-hour high of $2.52 and achieve a staggering 250% monthly gain. Additionally, CoinGlass data reveals a 13% surge in XRP Futures Open Interest, highlighting heightened trader enthusiasm. The ongoing rally reflects broader market sentiment favoring Ripple’s token, especially as it continues to demonstrate resilience amid legal and regulatory challenges. Legal and Regulatory Developments Shape Ripple’s Future Ripple remains in the spotlight as the January 15, 2025, deadline for the principal brief in its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approaches. While the SEC’s outgoing Chair Gary Gensler may pose further challenges before his departure, market participants remain cautiously optimistic. In a parallel development, plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against Ripple Labs have filed appeals with the Ninth Circuit Court, challenging earlier district court rulings in Ripple’s favor. Despite these legal headwinds, the crypto community appears unfazed, with XRP continuing to rally on the back of positive market news. What’s Next for XRP? Adding to the bullish sentiment is the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. This milestone has sparked speculation about a potential XRP ETF approval in the United States , which could further cement the token’s standing in global markets. As market analysts project a potential rally to $3 by this weekend, investors are closely watching XRP’s next moves.

However, the current trends suggest that the liquidity within the markets is slowly contracting, which could be a bullish signal for cryptos like XRP. Presently, the XRP price has been facing massive upward pressure over the past few days while the bulls are managing to keep up the trend. Therefore, the upcoming couple of days are expected to be crucial for the XRP price rally that has reached crucial levels. The BTC pric e is trading above $101K, which helped the XRP price to rise above $2.5, which remained for a while. The bears jumped in no time, causing over 4% dump in a few hours, which may suggest the start of a fresh rejection. Meanwhile, the volumes have been squeezed, which suggests a fresh influx of volume is about to enter the platform, pushing the XRP price rally beyond the consolidation. The daily chart of XRP suggests the price to be stuck within a descending parallel channel and is about to validate a rejection from the resistance. The technicals have also not been in favour of the bulls at the momentum, which indicates a plunge below $2 could be imminent in the coming days. Meanwhile, the weekly chart reflects the token to be in danger as the bullish strength appears to have waned to a large extent. The weekly OBV has displayed a bearish divergence while the Ichimoku cloud is about to flip from bullish to bearish. This could be a massive bearish signal, but a massive drop follows each time the OBV levels undergo a huge expansion. However, the price has experienced enough bullish support as the buying pressure remains above the average range, suggesting the bulls remain vigilant, indicating a quick rebound could be fast approaching. Having both the bullish and bearish prospects alive, the upcoming weekend may have a major impact on the XRP price rally.

All of the top-rated cryptos below have passed an audit with a third party smart contracts auditing company. Best Crypto To Buy Now On Presale Pepe Unchained (PEPU)’s explosive post-ICO performance has resulted in a strong demand for other presale tokens. For the uninitiated, PEPU raised over $73.7 million in its crypto presale behind heavy whale bidding. Following its launch, the meme coin skyrocketed by nearly 500%, reaching an all-time high valuation of $550 million. We previously rated it the best crypto to buy now. In this article, we list several contenders for the next best crypto to buy now, including projects that are attracting whale wallets during their own presale stage and could potentially replicate PEPU’s success. Crypto All-Stars (STARS) Crypto All-Stars (STARS) is one of the most popular presale tokens on the market and has already raised over $16 million in its ICO. Similar to PEPU, STARS is a high-utility meme coin, with MemeVault as its key selling point. MemeVault is the first-ever unified staking protocol. This multi-chain, multi-token platform will accept 11 of the top meme coins after its launch and offer attractive passive income in return. The tokens include Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Based Brett (BRETT), Mog Coin (MOG), Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), Turbo (TURBO), Toshi (TOSHI), Coq Inu (COQ) and Bonk (BONK). STARS is already seeing strong demand from holders of the aforementioned meme coins. STARS buyers could also stake their holdings and earn thrice the rewards. They are already benefitting from the presale staking protocol which is currently offering a reward rate of 173%. Prominent crypto investors are bullish on STARS’ upside potential, with many calling it the next 100x meme coin. New whales are also jumping on the bandwagon almost every day. For instance this week a whale wallet swapped 50 ETH, worth nearly $200k, for Crypto All-Stars.

It is challenging the hegemony of whales and insiders in the meme coin sector.

37634062,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627445,1734183572,Bitcoin to reap big benefits as traders avoid trade war volatility,"Bitcoin is primed to benefit from the volatility that could engulf traditional markets with the imminent threat of a trade war on the horizon. With Donald Trump already elected, his biggest dilemma will be the issue surrounding the US dollar. While his policies might need the dollar to be weak to boost exports, the reverse is also a possibility that cannot be dismissed, which may increase global financial instability if it happens. With Trump promising tariffs upon assuming office, the movement of the dollar could pose distinct implications. One of the possible scenarios could see the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin play a prominent role. Its status as a safe haven could be crucial, as investors and users adopt the asset as a shield from the fallout of trade wars, inflation, and market uncertainty. Trump faces a big dollar problem While Trump will prefer to keep the dollar weak to boost exports, his actions might push it in the other direction, increasing the already high financial instability. Over the last few years, the dollar has swung in the same direction as the global economic momentum. Although it experienced a decline after 2001, the currency rode on the back of the European and Chinese economic weakness to ride to the top post-2011. From all indications, it looks like the trend will continue under the Trump administration. David Lubin, a senior research fellow in the Global Economy and Finance Program at Michael Klein, stated that the policies will only boost the dollar while piling pressures on the currencies of trading partners to depreciate. In addition, Trump’s upcoming fiscal expansion and tighter monetary policy show an inkling toward sustained dollar growth. If the dollar gains strength , it could cause unprecedented negative issues including hindering global trade, limiting the financial access of developing nations, and increasing inflation on weaker currencies. If things get out of hand, then it could lead to chaotic adjustments like sudden market shifts or the need for United States intervention. Lubin thinks that Trump may ignore the risks, seeing the benefits the country stands to gain from the dollar’s decline. However, the case may be, an overvalued dollar will cause issues for the global economy under Trump’s leadership. Bitcoin’s win and promising future under Trump With trade tensions already high, additional impending tariffs may cause issues for currencies. For instance, the dollar gained 0.4% while that of countries like China and Mexico dropped after Trump announced tariffs. Historically, these issues have always pushed investors to evade the volatility in the traditional market using assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin has always responded in times of economic uncertainty, with the trade war between 2018 and 2020 a typical example. However, the case of the US-China trade war has shown that China’s actions may affect Bitcoin’s price. While the inflation from the dispute may affect the asset for a while, it promises a safe bet against the dollar in the long run. Bitcoin miners could also be another major factor, with the increased tariffs affecting imports of some parts, and impacting the overall mining operations. A US-China trade war could likely have a short-term impact on Bitcoin, its design and role as a store of value in such times may make it attractive. Meanwhile, Trump’s reelection has triggered a good feeling in the crypto industry, leading many to make bullish predictions about the industry entering 2025. However, the market remains a volatile endeavor with corrections as high as 30% in the past. However, increased adoption through mainstream adoption and ETFs has done a world of good for the asset and its legitimacy.

While the prominent cryptocurrency struggles to make any significant breakout past $4,000, certain developments on its underlying network have drawn investors’ attention. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Aims Higher: A Smooth Path To $4,000 and Beyond? Ethereum Weekly Fees Rise By 18% Amid DeFi Ecosystem Boom In a recent report on December 13, crypto analytics company IntoTheBlock stated that weekly Ethereum network fees rose by 17.9% in the past week reaching an estimated $67 million – the highest-ever value since April. According to analysts at IntoTheBlock, these high network fees can be attributed to ETH’s price balancing as Bitcoin retraced to $100,000. In addition, there has been a significant increase in DeFi activity on the Ethereum blockchain. Providing more insight into Ethereum’s vibrant DeFi ecosystem, the Satoshi Club highlights that DeFi lending has been on the rise, with traders leveraging their Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) to borrow stablecoins. These wrapped assets allow users to maximize their collateral utility by tapping into the liquidity and stability of DeFi protocols while maintaining exposure to major cryptocurrencies i.e. Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notably, the demand surge for lending drove interest rates to exceptional levels, now exceeding 10% on average and reaching as high as 40% on certain platforms. Interestingly, these figures mirror the peak dynamics seen in the 2022 bull market. Aave, one of Ethereum’s major DeFi protocols with a TVL of $22.46 billion has been a focal point on this increased DeFi activity, recording an impressive $500 million in net inflows over the last week. While heightened network activity driven by increased DeFi activity can indicate growing interest in the Ethereum network, investors should note that elevated Ethereum fees will pose challenges for smaller users being rewarding only for those who can capitalize on high interest rates.

Recap of BlockDAG’s AMA with Harvard's Maurice Herlihy—Presale Hits New High of $165M,"Cryptocurrency has moved from a specialized topic to a staple in daily chats. As the globe shifts towards digital currencies, blockchain technology is racing to meet growing needs for speed, efficiency, and scalability. Here, BlockDAG (BDAG) shines with its directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. The focus of the network’s recent AMA was this technology, featuring Dr. Maurice Herlihy—a Harvard graduate, acclaimed computer scientist, and key advisor for BlockDAG. Dr. Herlihy provided important insights into BlockDAG’s goals and technologies, spotlighting the strengths of its DAG architecture, especially its efficiency in managing large volumes of transactions. Let’s dive into the details of the AMA and discover why BlockDAG is catching so many eyes. BlockDAG’s Soaring Presale: $165M & Counting, 2240% Growth Touted as the most significant crypto presale of the decade, BlockDAG has amassed over $165 million, distributing more than 17.2 billion coins. Early supporters have enjoyed a massive 2240% return on BDAG coins, which have escalated from $0.001 to $0.0234 from the first to the 26th batch. Analysts are now predicting the value to soon reach a staggering $600 million. Recently, BlockDAG introduced a new 5-tiered bonus structure, available until January 8th. This plan offers over 150% bonuses on the first five purchases of coins, attracting significant attention from large buyers and institutional entities. BlockDAG presents an opportunity that many find irresistible. Unpacking BlockDAG's Tech with Maurice Herlihy Dr. Maurice Herlihy, a Harvard graduate, noted computer scientist, and Brown University professor, recently shed light on BlockDAG's sophisticated algorithm during an AMA. He pinpointed the challenges of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin, which struggle with scalability due to slow transaction speeds and the occurrence of orphaned blocks inherent in proof-of-work systems. Dr. Herlihy introduced the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure of BlockDAG as a groundbreaking remedy, facilitating simultaneous block creation and swift consensus while maintaining security. He explored the Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, designed to ensure honest participants prevail in consensus decisions in high-traffic scenarios. Utilizing K-clusters, BlockDAG enhances network efficiency and tackles issues such as double-spending. Dr. Herlihy highlighted the system’s scalability, improved latency, and increased transaction finality. The session ended with a Q&A addressing network speed, quantum resistance, and real-world application. Surge in Daily Funds: Is BlockDAG Nearing $600M? BlockDAG's presale is experiencing a daily influx of $5 million, with total funds now exceeding $165 million. The recent AMA has sparked further excitement, significantly boosting participation from large-scale participants overnight. With the $600 million goal within reach, the enthusiasm is palpable. Participants are eager to join a crypto project that addresses real challenges in blockchain technology. The focus of the AMA was on BlockDAG's technology, yet it's the project's commitment to its community, as shown through the 5-tier bonus system, that underscores its robustness. This mix of hybrid technology, community incentives, and a dynamic presale highlights the BDAG coin's potential for longevity and keeps participants engaged. Final Thoughts: The Time for BlockDAG is Now BlockDAG combines cutting-edge technology with a top crypto presale and a community-centered ethos, marking its spot as a standout in the crypto arena. Its DAG architecture solves critical blockchain issues like congestion and high fees. The recent AMA with Dr. Maurice Herlihy has boosted the project's standing, providing participants with a clear understanding of its direction. As the presale approaches the $600 million mark, BlockDAG's momentum is unwavering. Both seasoned participants and crypto newcomers view BlockDAG as a must-watch project worthy of inclusion in their portfolios. Currently priced at $0.0234 per coin in the latest presale batch, and predicted to climb into double-digit values soon, the window to get involved with what might be the next big crypto revelation is now.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

37633492,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627439,1734182397,China’s stubborn deflation really is a global economic problem,"China is spiraling deeper into deflation, and it’s not just Beijing’s problem anymore—it’s everybody’s. Prices have been falling for six straight quarters. One more, and China ties the grim record from the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s. But it’s not like Beijing is sitting around doing nothing. Policymakers are trying to fix it, but nothing seems to be sticking. And as Donald Trump preps his return to the White House with promises of crushing Chinese exports with a 60% tariff, things are about to get even worse. What is deflation anyway, you ask? Well basically, it’s when prices across the board don’t just rise slowly or stagnate—they straight-up drop. This isn’t your standard “less inflation.” It’s a full-blown economic retreat where falling prices scare consumers into hoarding cash instead of spending. Why China’s deflation feels unstoppable Unlike in the U.S., where people rushed to spend after COVID-19 restrictions lifted, Chinese consumers stayed cautious. There’s a reason for that. The real estate crash in China hasn’t just affected homebuyers—it rattled everyone. Big-ticket purchases? Forget it. Consumers are holding on to their money, waiting for prices to drop even more. But that’s not the only thing dragging China into deflation. The government clamped down on high-paying industries like tech and finance. Layoffs and pay cuts followed, and people stopped spending. On top of that, China pushed for more manufacturing and advanced tech, flooding the market with goods no one wanted to buy. Businesses had no choice but to slash prices. Here’s the thing: falling prices don’t help the economy. When people think prices will keep dropping, they stop buying. And when they stop buying, businesses make less money, which leads to layoffs and even deeper price cuts. Bloomberg economists call this “debt deflation,” where rising inflation-adjusted interest rates make paying off debt even harder. It’s a vicious cycle that’s impossible to escape without aggressive intervention. Beijing knows this but has been unusually cautious. After the pandemic, China didn’t go back to its old playbook of massive infrastructure projects and housing booms. President Xi Jinping is all about advanced technology and sustainable growth now. While that sounds good in theory, it means there’s no big money injection to save the day. Does Beijing have a plan? The People’s Bank of China has tried cutting interest rates multiple times over the past two years, hoping to get people spending again. It’s not working. Real estate restrictions were loosened, down payments were slashed, and mortgage rates were cut to revive the housing market. But none of this has stopped the spiral. Banks have been told to lend more to developers so they can finish stalled projects. Local governments have even been asked to buy unsold apartments and turn them into public housing. Meanwhile, the central government launched a $1.4 trillion program to help local governments manage their debt. On top of that, China has tried handing out subsidies for cars and home appliances. Low-income families and students got some aid too. Still, economists aren’t convinced this is enough. The housing market is still a mess, and consumer confidence is dead in the water. What about the numbers? China uses three major indicators to measure deflation. First, the consumer price index (CPI), which tracks household spending, hit a five-month low in November. Then there’s the producer price index (PPI), which measures industrial prices—it’s been shrinking for over two years. Finally, there’s the GDP deflator, which looks at price changes across the entire economy. And it’s not looking good either. The products dragging prices down Transportation is one of the biggest drags on consumer prices right now. Car prices are falling, and even gas prices are down. Carmakers like BYD are in full panic mode, asking suppliers to cut costs to stay competitive. The result? A full-blown price war in China’s auto market. Real estate is another major problem. The housing market is bloated with unsold apartments, and there’s no quick fix for it. Manufacturing is just as bad. China’s push for more production created a glut of goods no one is buying. It’s basic supply and demand—except here, supply is winning, and it’s crushing the economy. Then there’s the highly-expected trade war with America. Trump has threatened to add another 10% tariff on all Chinese imports as soon as he takes office next month. If these tariffs go through, China’s export growth—one of its few bright spots—will take a massive hit. Anyone holding Chinese equities is feeling the pain as corporate earnings drop. Luxury carmakers and high-end brands that rely on China’s wealthy consumers? Their sales are tanking. On the flip side, China’s bond market is doing great. Low-risk government bonds are attracting investors who expect even more rate cuts from the People’s Bank of China. But this is hardly good news. The broader economic picture is bleak, and the bond market boom is just a symptom of the larger problem.

Avalanche’s News & Stellar’s Advancements Stir the Market,"The recent Avalanche news shows that AVAX has received a $250 million investment from heavyweights like Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly Capital, which has shaken up the market, fueling excitement for its Avalanche9000 upgrade. Meanwhile, in other crypto news, the Stellar ecosystem has strengthened its foothold with the “Build Better” initiative, empowering communities to drive Web3 innovation and expand real-world financial utilities. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) has crypto enthusiasts enthralled with its record-breaking $165 million presale, which is seeing $5 million in daily inflows. Whale activity around BlockDAG has surged as traders rush to secure BDAG before the prices go up in the next batch, with analysts projecting a $20 price by 2027. Avalanche News: AVAX Receives a $250M Investment The Avalanche news has sent ripples through the crypto market as the platform secures $250 million in funding from leading investors like Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital. This investment comes at a crucial time, fueling Avalanche’s expansion and strengthening its strategic partnerships. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and flexible “subnets,” Avalanche is set to launch Avalanche9000 on December 16, its most significant upgrade yet. By introducing a cost-effective subscription model for developers, Avalanche aims to boost adoption and innovation. Thanks to institutional backing and its unique approach to horizontal scaling, Avalanche solidifies its role as a frontrunner in blockchain technology, ready to shape the future of decentralized finance. Stellar’s Ecosystem Launches “Build Better” Initiative Stellar’s ecosystem is taking a bold step forward with its new initiative, “Build Better”, aimed at driving Web3 innovation through community input. This initiative empowers users to share transformative ideas, positioning Stellar’s ecosystem as a hub for impactful solutions. By crowdsourcing insights, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) bridges the gap between visionaries and developers, ensuring ideas turn into tangible outcomes. The Stellar ecosystem already powers over 550 million tokenized assets and connects to 475,000 cash-to-crypto ramps in 180 countries, highlighting its real-world utility. “Build Better” not only amplifies community voices but also reaffirms the Stellar ecosystem’s mission to revolutionize financial systems and unlock global opportunities. BlockDAG’s $165M Presale Sees Huge Whale Activity BlockDAG’s presale frenzy has shattered records, as it continues to pull in up to $5 million daily — a testament to skyrocketing whale activity and trader confidence. Backed by $165 million raised in the ongoing presale and over 17.1 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is racing toward its $600 million milestone. Given the incredible performance in its presale, analysts predict a staggering price surge to $20 by 2027, positioning BlockDAG as the top crypto to buy in 2024 . Currently, priced at a low $0.0234 in batch 26, early adopters of BDAG have already seen an incredible 2240% ROI since batch 1. Whales are loading up on BDAG, recognizing its groundbreaking tech ecosystem and future dominance in the blockchain space. Demand is at an all-time high, driving a buying surge that shows no signs of slowing down. The hype is real—BlockDAG’s Mainnet, which is currently in its audit phase, marks a critical step toward delivering a superior, scalable ecosystem. As the recent Avalanche news fades and Stellar aims to refine its strategy, BlockDAG emerges as the clear frontrunner in the race for dominance, setting new benchmarks for innovation and crypto potential. The opportunity is here, but it won’t last long, which is why buyers are rushing to seize BDAG now before prices skyrocket to $20 and beyond. Key Takeaways: Top Crypto To Buy in 2024 The Avalanche news of a $250 million investment cements its position as a leader in blockchain scalability, while Stellar’s ecosystem pushes boundaries with its “Build Better” initiative, empowering community-driven Web3 innovation. Both projects show promising updates, but BlockDAG’s explosive momentum can’t be matched. BlockDAG is leaving its competitors behind with its ongoing presale raising $165 million and its early adopters seeing a staggering 2240% ROI. Analysts’ predictions of BDAG hitting $20 by 2027 have fueled massive interest, which has resulted in huge whale activity, with demand for BDAG hitting record highs. As Stellar refines its strategy and Avalanche scales with institutional support, BlockDAG stands as the top crypto to buy in 2024, delivering unmatched potential for life-changing gains.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has observed that these deep-pocketed investors are using the correction to buy more assets, signaling strong confidence in these coins despite short-term price declines. Whale investors are buying the dip – should you too? Let’s find out. Cardano Whales Return Strong Cardano (ADA) has been on a remarkable run, doubling its value over the past month. However, the last week saw a 4% decline, hinting at some short-term selling. Martinez reports that Cardano whales have been especially active in the past 48 hours, purchasing over 80 million ADA tokens. Despite a 6.22% price drop, with ADA currently at $1.14 per token, large investors are undeterred. They seem confident in Cardano’s long-term potential, particularly its smart contract capabilities , and are continuing to buy during the dip. #Cardano whales bought over 80 million $ADA in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/hCBb40Fri6 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 12, 2024 Dogecoin Is Raising the Bar! Dogecoin (DOGE), a popular meme coin, has struggled to break above the $0.50 mark. Still, whales are taking advantage of the market dip. Martinez highlights that investors holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE tokens bought an impressive 210 million DOGE during the correction. Despite a 4.7% decline in price, leaving DOGE at $0.402, whales remain optimistic about its future growth, even as the token’s volatility continues. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market This Week: Top Performers, Losers, and Key Trends , XRP Draws Strong Whale Interest XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, has dropped 5% today, now trading at $2.43.

37635309,https://invezz.com/?p=2387510,1734182041,Is iDEGEN worth buying after Trump Jr. reitereated commitment to crypto?,"Bitcoin remained in focus this week after Trump Jr. reiterated his father’s commitment to making America the crypto capital of the world. Eric Trump expects the US to become a crypto superpower with a sensible set of regulations. Optimism related to Trump’s pro-crypto policies has already pushed the price of Bitcoin above the psychologically important $100,000 level. But the President-elect’s crypto initiatives are expected to be a tailwind for the crypto industry at large. That may include the likes of up-and-coming projects like iDEGEN. iDEGEN is already attracting massive demand The best part of investing in an iDEGEN is that it not only exposes you to the explosive initial growth that meme coins are broadly known for, but it will likely help you tap on the massive expected growth in the Artificial Intelligence market Note that Statista forecasts the AI market to surpass a $1.0 trillion valuation by 2032. These factors combined have helped iDEGEN raise well over $500,000 in less than a month of presale. If you’re interested in building an early position in iDEGEN to benefit from its future potential growth under the Trump administration, click here to visit the iDEGEN website now. A Bitcoin reserve could be a tailwind for iDEGEN Remember that Donald Trump himself, on his visit to the New York Stock Exchange this week reiterated that his government will do something great with crypto. He even plans on setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve and embracing blockchain technology to maintain the country’s technological supremacy over political rivals like China. A Bitcoin reserve will likely add a new layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin and deliver a significant boost to institutional investments. BlackRock has already recommended that investors allocate 2% of their available capital to Bitcoin as its risk profile is pretty much the same as the Magnificent 7 stocks. So, it’s evident that Trump’s commitment to crypto will result in a transformational year for cryptocurrencies. It may particularly benefit iDEGEN as it taps on AI to expand its knowledge base through whatever the community feeds it on X.com. If you’d like to benefit from such AI and crypto tailwinds and invest in iDEGEN , click here to explore how.

37632899,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393225,1734181836,What is DePIN? A Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Physical Networks,"The post What is DePIN? A Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Physical Networks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News DePin, short for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, represents the natural evolution of blockchain technology beyond Web3 and into the physical world. As blockchain and decentralized solutions gain traction, DePin has emerged as a topic of growing interest. While still in its early stages, this innovative concept has the potential to disrupt existing technologies and create more efficient solutions across various sectors. But, what exactly is DePin? How does it work? And why is everyone suddenly talking about it? What is DePin? DePin is just an umbrella term for all networks that use blockchain to decentralize control or ownership over physical infrastructure. So, DePin includes a network of crowd-sourced providers. Here, these providers offer real-world services to users and use blockchain to keep a record of these services. In turn, they receive rewards (for the services) via cryptocurrency that might run on the same or a completely different blockchain network. Imagine a world where, instead of relying on large corporations, we depend on OURSELVES to run systems. By sharing resources like computers, internet access, or even solar panels, we collectively build and sustain infrastructure. Let’s simplify it further. Say you and your friends need a wifi network. However, instead of relying on one big company to provide it, you all chip in by setting up your own small Wi-Fi devices. These devices can now create a big network together and everyone has access. What’s cool is that no single person owns the network. It’s run by everyone who contributes to it. In addition, say, when you build or maintain the network by setting up the device, you can earn rewards too. This is an idea of sharing both responsibilities and rewards. Right? DePin is based on this idea. Think of teamwork but on a broader, more global scale. DePin leverages blockchain and token-based rewards to decentralize infrastructure, reducing reliance on large corporations and breaking their monopolies. It’s a concept applicable across diverse sectors, from transportation and energy to wireless connectivity. Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s explore the different categories of DePin. Categories of DePin. DePin networks can be broadly classified into two categories: Physical Resource Networks (PRNs): These focus on tangible, physical resources such as raw materials, transportation, or facilities. Digital Resource Networks (DRNs): These manage intangible, digital resources like data, software, or information. While both aim to optimize resources, their domains of operation—physical versus digital—set them apart. How Does DePin Work? DePin combines blockchain technology with real-world physical infrastructure to create shared, decentralized networks. Here’s how it works: Start with a Physical Resource Examples include a wireless hotspot, an electric vehicle charger, or a data storage device. These assets aren’t controlled by a single company but are instead distributed among individuals contributing to the network. Think back to the Wi-Fi example we discussed earlier. Blockchain for Coordination A blockchain network manages and coordinates these distributed resources, ensuring transparency, security, and decentralization. Rewards for Contributors Contributors earn tokens for sharing their resources. This incentive model encourages broader participation. End-Users Pay for Services Users accessing these services can pay using tokens or, in some cases, traditional payment methods, depending on the network’s setup. Smart Contracts at Work Smart contracts automate transactions, rewards, and agreements, eliminating the need for central authorities. They execute predefined actions seamlessly and securely. For example, let’s consider the Helium Network project. It is a DePin project where individuals deploy wireless hotspots for IoT devices and earn HNT (cryptocurrency) to share network coverage. Then people can connect their devices to hotspots and pay in tokens for the data they use. Interesting, right? Technology Used in DePin DePin is like a smart system where people share physical resources—Wi-Fi, storage, energy—and get rewarded for their contributions. Here’s a breakdown of the core technologies that power DePin: Blockchain: Say you find a giant, super-secure notebook where every action is written down and can’t be erased. That is blockchain! It keeps track of who’s sharing what and makes sure everyone gets rewarded fairly. And there’s no way for unfair practices. Tokens: When you help out by sharing something, you can earn in tokens. These are like digital reward points and you can use them to buy something cool or even trade for real money. It’s how DePIN says, “Thanks for helping!” IoT Devices: If you’ve seen gadgets like sensors, cameras, or Wi-Fi hotspots, they are the little helpers in DePIN. They collect data or provide services and return that information to the network. You can say they are the worker bees of the system. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are automated agreements that execute actions based on predefined conditions. For example, if someone shares a Wi-Fi hotspot, a smart contract can instantly reward them with tokens without needing any middleman. P2P Networks: Instead of going through a big company’s server, people in DePIN talk directly to each other. It’s like sharing files or streaming a movie directly from a friend’s computer. It’s of course faster and cheaper, with no bossy middlemen. Storage and Compute: You also have a giant shared garage where everyone offers some of their unused space or computer power. Did you say you need a place to store your files or run some heavy tasks? DePIN’s got your back through this shared system. AI and Data: What happens to all the data from devices and users? AI can make sense of it—like figuring out where a Wi-Fi hotspot is most needed or how to use certain resources more efficiently. It’s the brain behind the scenes. Governance: Since there’s no almighty leader in DePIN, everyone who owns tokens can vote on important stuff. We can decide about making upgrades or changing how rewards work. It’s teamwork at its best! So, in short, DePIN uses cutting-edge tech like blockchain, tokens, and smart gadgets to let people share resources directly, get rewarded, and make decisions together. Core Principles of DePin DePin is guided by key principles that set it apart from traditional systems. Think of them as the “rules of the game” that ensure fairness, inclusivity, and growth. We go back to decentralization. As we already know, here, power is in the hands of people. There’s no one individual controlling everything. Power is spread out among people who participate in the game. Everyone has a role and no matter what they are sharing or using, they benefit from it. Incentives are driving participation DePin supports a give-and-get model. You share something that adds value and get rewarded for it. The reward is tokens that have real value. They keep the motivation on. The more you contribute, the more you earn. Digital weds physical DePin doesn’t just work on the internet, it connects the real world with the virtual one. Say: Wifi hotspot provides internet Sensors collecting weather data Storage devices hosting files You use tech to solve problems in the real world in an efficient and helpful way. Everyone has open access: DePin is an inclusive system. You don’t need technical expertise to participate. If you have a resource to share, you can join—no special qualifications required. Transparency for Trust Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and changes are visible to everyone. Whether it’s a token reward or a network upgrade, everything is transparent. No hidden deals, no sneaky edits—just open and fair processes. Decisions have to be community-driven If you participate in the network, you can have a say in how it runs. You can vote and hold important decisions on upgrades and changes in rewards too. In this game, every member decides what happens next. Scalability drives growth DePin is designed to grow. As more participants join and share resources, the network becomes stronger, faster, and more useful. This scalability benefits everyone involved, creating a win-win ecosystem. Use Cases of DePin Across Industries We already know DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) can really shake up a lot of sectors. While the idea seems simple, it can transform industries in amazing ways. We can go sector by sector and find out how: Telecommunications Say instead of big telecom companies owning all the towers and hotspots, people like you and me set up small devices and get paid for providing internet in our neighborhoods. Hold on to the thought for once. That’s the future! Use Case : The Helium Network is already doing this. Individuals set up IoT hotspots and provide wireless coverage for things like smart sensors. Don’t forget that they earn tokens as a reward. Why It’s Cool : It expands coverage to areas traditional telecoms overlook. It is cheaper for users too because it does not depend on the big middleman companies. Energy and Utilities What if your rooftop solar panels or home battery could contribute to a decentralized energy grid? You could sell your extra energy to neighbours and get paid directly. Use Case : Networks like Voltus help people contribute energy savings to grids and in turn earn rewards. Why It’s Cool : Firstly, it encourages renewable energy sharing. Next, it makes energy cheaper and more reliable, especially if you consider the remote areas. Transportation and Mobility Say there is a city where you share resources like electric vehicle (EV) charging stations or even parking spaces, and the system rewards you for participating. Use Case : Decentralized networks for EV charging can let us individuals host charging points at home or businesses. We can then earn tokens from drivers who use them. When someone has a shared bike or scooter program, they can use DePIN to ensure fair distribution and rewards. Why It’s Cool : It makes transportation more accessible and sustainable. DePin reduces reliance on big companies to build infrastructure. Cloud Storage and Computing Instead of paying big companies like Google or Amazon for cloud storage, you could store your files on a decentralized network where regular people like us can provide the space. Use Case : Filecoin and Storj let users rent out unused hard drive space to others. Why It’s Cool : We don’t have to worry about the security of files because they’re split into pieces and stored across multiple locations. It’s cheaper too because it uses people’s spare storage instead of giant data centers. Healthcare and Life Sciences Consider a world where your wearable fitness tracker (like a smartwatch) contributes health data to a decentralized network for medical research. And again, you get rewarded for it. Use Case : Decentralized networks can gather data for research on diseases like diabetes or Alzheimer’s but still keep your data private. Why It’s Cool : Patients can stay in control of their data. It helps researchers access more diverse and accurate information. Smart Cities and IoT Cities need lots of data to run efficiently. You need to have a check on traffic patterns, air quality, temperature, etc. Instead of governments installing expensive sensors everywhere, we can just deploy devices as we want and earn tokens to provide the data that they need. Use Case : Helium or similar networks can easily power smart city applications like air quality monitoring or traffic management. Why It’s Cool : It saves cities money while involving the community. The system makes smart city technology more accessible for smaller towns. Supply Chain and Logistics You know how tricky it can be to track goods as they move from factories to stores. DePIN can use sensors to monitor conditions like temperature and location in real-time and reward people who provide the infrastructure. Use Case : A decentralized network of GPS trackers and IoT devices keeps tabs on goods in transit. Why It’s Cool : You know the value of transparency, and you know exactly where your stuff is. It reduces costs by removing middlemen. Media and Entertainment Say you could share your unused bandwidth to help others stream videos or play games and earn rewards for it, would you skip it? Use Case : Decentralized video streaming platforms could use shared resources to host videos. Gamers could share unused computing power for rendering graphics or even hosting servers. Why It’s Cool : DePin makes streaming and gaming cheaper and faster. We can have our power back to users and leave out the giant platforms. Finance and Insurance You create micro-networks for peer-to-peer lending or decentralized insurance pools using DePin. Here people contribute funds to a shared pool and earn returns. Use Case : Farmers in rural areas could form insurance networks to protect against crop failures. Why It’s Cool : We can now make financial services accessible to underserved areas. DePin reduces reliance on big banks or insurers. The Big Picture DePIN stands out with its flexibility. It’s like the ultimate sharing economy—but actually powered by blockchain and real-world resources. Benefits of DePin DePIN is a cool concept but it’s more than that. It’s because it solves real-world problems while making systems fairer, more accessible, and more efficient. Perfect, right? But, what’s in it for us? For Individuals: Earn and Participate Earn Rewards: If you have something to share, you can earn tokens. These tokens often have real-world value. Example: Running a Helium hotspot to provide Wi-Fi earns you tokens. Low Barriers to Entry: The best thing is the fact that anyone can participate. You do not need to be a tech wizard or have a big company backing you. You just need a resource to share! It’s like getting paid for letting others borrow your extra stuff. How cool is that? For Businesses: Efficiency and Cost Savings Lower Costs: Businesses don’t have to build massive infrastructure themselves anymore. They can just use DePIN networks to access storage, bandwidth, or data from people already providing them. Example: A startup can use Filecoin for cheap, decentralized file storage instead of paying for expensive centralized services. Scalability on Demand: DePIN can grow with demand. As more participants join, businesses can tap into more resources when they need them. And you do not need heavy upfront investments. It’s like renting instead of owning—use what you need when you need it, and save money. For Communities: Fair and Open Systems Local Benefits: People in communities can now set up and maintain infrastructure (like Wi-Fi hotspots or energy-sharing systems) to earn tokens. It keeps the benefits local instead of sending our profits to big corporations. Example: A rural area can set up a DePIN network to provide internet where big companies won’t invest. Democratic Governance: Decisions about the network—like how rewards are distributed—are often made by community voting. It’s like having a neighborhood project where everyone contributes and shares the rewards. For Technology and Innovation: Cutting-Edge Solutions Better Use of Resources: DePIN taps into unused resources like idle computers, extra internet bandwidth, or renewable energy. Instead of wasting these, they’re put to good use. Example: Unused storage on your computer becomes part of a global decentralized storage network. Innovation Without Monopolies: Since DePIN is decentralized, no single company can monopolize it. This encourages innovation and competition, making the system better for everyone. It’s like turning leftovers into a gourmet meal—making the most of what’s already there. For the Environment: Greener Solutions Energy Efficiency: DePIN often uses distributed networks, which can be more energy-efficient than centralized systems that rely on massive data centers or infrastructure. Example: A solar-powered device contributing to a network while earning tokens. Promotes Renewables: Networks can be built using clean energy sources shared by participants, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. It’s like sharing a carpool to save gas—efficient and eco-friendly. For Users: Better Services and Lower Costs Improved Access: Services like internet, file storage, or computing become cheaper and more widely available because no middleman is hiking up prices. Example: A DePIN storage network can be more affordable and reliable than a big tech company’s service. More Choices: You get more choices because DePIN systems are decentralized, users can choose between multiple providers rather than being stuck with one big company. It’s like shopping at a farmer’s market instead of a giant supermarket—you get more variety and better deals. For the World: A Resilient Future No Single Point of Failure: As DePIN is decentralized, it might be harder for the network to go down. Even if one part fails, others keep working. Example: If one storage node goes offline, your data is safe on other nodes. Global Collaboration: DePIN connects people worldwide, creating a global network of contributors and users. It’s like having a backup for your backup—always on and reliable. Challenges of DePIN Now that we all agree that DePIN is an amazing idea, it’s not easy. Like any big change, there are some tough corners we need to glide through. Scaling Participation The Challenge: DePIN thrives on user participation, but onboarding individuals can be slow. Many are unfamiliar with blockchain or hesitant to contribute their resources. Why It Matters: The network’s effectiveness depends on widespread adoption. Without enough contributors, the system’s value diminishes. The Fix: Simplify onboarding with user-friendly interfaces and education campaigns that demystify blockchain and DePIN processes. Handling Growth The Challenge: Small networks are manageable, but scaling up introduces technical bottlenecks. A sudden influx of users can lead to slower performance or even network failures. Why It Matters: A poor user experience during growth can drive participants away and damage trust in the network. The Fix: Develop scalable infrastructure and stress-test systems to ensure they can handle surges in demand without disruptions. Regulation and Trust Issues The Challenge: Operating in the blockchain space often places DePIN networks in a regulatory grey zone. Users may also hesitate to trust a system that feels unfamiliar or lacks guarantees. Why It Matters: Without legal clarity and user trust, adoption becomes an uphill battle. The Fix: Work proactively with regulators to establish compliance and transparency. Build trust through open governance and robust security measures. Balancing Rewards The Challenge: Designing fair incentives is tricky. Rewards that are too low fail to attract participants, while overly generous rewards can invite exploitation and unsustainable practices. Why It Matters: A poorly balanced reward system undermines network sustainability and participant satisfaction. The Fix: Use dynamic reward models that adjust based on contributions and market conditions to ensure fairness and sustainability. Bridging the Tech Divide The Challenge: Rural or underserved areas, where DePIN could make the biggest difference, often lack the resources or knowledge to participate. Why It Matters: These gaps prevent DePIN from realizing its full potential as a tool for global equity. The Fix: Provide affordable starter kits, community-driven support, and partnerships to bridge the digital divide. Competing with Centralized Giants The Challenge: Established companies like internet providers or cloud storage giants already dominate the space, with trust, money, and infrastructure on their side. Why It Matters: Competing against these giants can slow DePIN’s growth and adoption. The Fix: Highlight DePIN’s unique advantages like fairness, affordability, and community-driven governance to carve out a niche. Managing Technical Complexity The Challenge: Blockchain and decentralized networks can be intimidating for newcomers, creating a barrier to entry. Why It Matters: High technical complexity limits participation to a small tech-savvy group, reducing inclusivity. The Fix: Develop intuitive interfaces and abstract the technical complexities to make participation accessible to all. So, while DePIN has incredible potential to change how we share and use resources, it’s not without its growing pains. Want to hear the good news? These are challenges worth solving, and every step forward makes the system better for everyone. The Future of Decentralized Physical Networks When we try to imagine the future of Decentralized Physical Networks (DePIN) , it’s exciting because it’s not just about technology. It’s also about changing the way we work, share, and live. If we think about how the internet made the world smaller and connected us all, DePIN is like the next step. Now rather than just sharing information, we’re sharing real things : Wi-Fi, energy, storage, sensors, and more. In the future, DePIN could make our lives much easier and more fair. Just consider living in a place where everyone contributes to building local networks for the internet or energy. You do not have to wait for giant companies to show up, communities can create their own systems and keep the rewards. Rural areas could finally have reliable internet. Cities could use smart sensors to manage traffic and pollution, all owned and run by the people who live there. We would finally be part of the process. For businesses, this means a low barrier to entry. A small startup could access global resources and they don’t have to build massive infrastructure. This opens the door to new innovations and ideas because the tools are affordable and available to all of us. It’s also super eco-friendly too. In the future, we could even see solar-powered DePIN nodes everywhere, turning clean energy into something valuable for everyone. And let’s not forget how secure and resilient it will actually be. There would be no central point of failure. So, DePIN networks are much harder to shut down or control. Your data and services will always be accessible, no matter what happens in one part of the network. Ultimately, the future of DePIN is all about empowerment . It puts control back in the hands of people, creating systems that are fair, inclusive, and long-lasting. It’s like creating a world where collaboration drives progress. That’s a future we’d all want to be a part of—no? .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin ( BTC ), the biggest cryptocurrency, remained above $101,382 at last check Saturday as it struggled to retest the all-time high of $104,000. VanEck predicts that the coin will rise to $180,000 in 2025.

Happy Cat price rises after Uphold listing HAPPY, which is a fast-growing Solana meme coin, rose by 35%, while HYPE and Virtuals jumped by 15% and 10%, respectively. The other top gainers were tokens like Raydium, Ripple, Fantom, and Flare. Happy Cat’s token rally was mostly because it was because it was listed by Uphold , one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the industry. Altcoins often rally after being listed by big exchanges. The risk, however, is that the number of tokens on exchanges has rallied by 14% in the last seven days to over 464.95 million.

37632704,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627352,1734181199,Ethereum short positions reach record high despite bullish sentiments,"Ethereum’s leveraged short position on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has reached an all-time high, indicating a strong bearish sentiment in the market. The record leveraged shorts happened as open interest in Ethereum futures on the CME reached a record high of over one million ETH. Overall, open interest in Ethereum has increased over the past few weeks, setting a new record high of 6.91 million ETH ($27 billion) across all exchanges. While the heightened open interest indicates more speculative activity, the short positions raise concerns about the ETH price. ETH shorts reach new highs on the CME. Source: Zerohedge Meanwhile, record shorts on CME suggest that institutional investors (hedge funds) are shorting ETH. This has led to speculation about whether this is a basis trade, i.e., investors hedging their bets on spot ETH by shorting its futures to take advantage of the price gaps. Nevertheless, the leveraged short positions pose a risk of massive liquidation if the price of ETH should rise unexpectedly. This could also mean extra sell pressure for the asset, as the short squeeze could force more people to become cautious and reduce their exposure. Onchain analysts bullish on ETH due to increased demand Despite the record short positions, many analysts believe that ETH will rise in value soon and point to on-chain signals to prove their point. According to data from CryptoQuant , Ethereum will likely surpass $5,000, as its realized price upper band is at $5,200. The blockchain analytics platform notes that demand and supply are gaining the strength to play out this scenario. It said: “The realized price upper band, currently at $5.2k, matches the level seen during the 2021 bull run peak, signaling strong potential for further growth.” Most of that growing demand comes from Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen more investor interest recently. The net inflow into ETFs now stands at $2.268 billion despite Grayscale ETHE seeing over $3.5 billion in outflows. BlackRock ETHA also has over $3 billion inflow after ten consecutive days of inflows. These continuous accumulations have driven the upward movement of ETH price. With the accumulation increasing, many believe ETH will see massive gains in 2025. VanEck , in its predictions for next year, projected that ETH would reach $6,000, while BitWise was even more bullish, with a $7,000 prediction. $3,700 to $3,810 is a key support level for ETH price. Source: Ali Martinez However, whether ETH will even finish 2024 above $4,000 still depends on its ability to maintain its price above $3,700. Technical analyst Ali Martinez has noted that $3,700 to $3,810 is one of ETH’s most important support levels, as three million wallets bought 4.6 million ETH at that level. Ethereum is seeing a surge in scarcity Meanwhile, ETH supply, which is currently around 120 million, has also witnessed a turnaround in the burn rate. The network was at the center of a debate about L2s earlier in the year due to the high emissions of ETH on the L1 network and low transaction volume, which has caused the burn rate also to fall. However, the average daily burn rate has increased to 2,700 ETH, compared to 80 ETH in August. This means that ETH supply has once again become deflationary due to heightened network activity, and many believe this will cause the ETH price to increase further. Most of the network activities seem to be trending up for Ethereum. The network has seen an 8-month high in new wallets, with an average of over 130,000 new addresses created daily throughout December, a 2.63% increase this week. The last time it saw this much activity was in April. Additionally, active addresses on Ethereum also increased by 4.24% this week, while addresses with zero balance fell by 4.06%.

Musk recently labeled the SEC a “political tool” after his company Neuralink came under scrutiny . Garlinghouse, no stranger to clashes with the SEC, amplified Musk’s message, sparking intense discussions in the crypto and political circles. What he said https://t.co/sHs1aLkf8Z — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 13, 2024 Industry Openly Lashes Out at SEC It seems like the crypto industry has waged an open war against the SEC’s overreach. Recently Elon Musk vented his frustration over the SEC for their aggressive approach toward companies, including Neuralink. His remarks, accusing the SEC of being a “political tool,” is a voice many have been raising for a long time who feel the agency is not fair. Musk once again stirred the controversial pot which points out that the SEC’s actions are to protect markets or if it’s pushing a broader political agenda. For Garlinghouse, the frustration runs deep. Ripple has been locked in a prolonged legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP, its native token, should be classified as a security. This case has become a symbol of the larger struggle between innovation in crypto and regulatory oversight. Many in the industry argue that the SEC’s actions stifle growth, creating unnecessary roadblocks for projects trying to bring blockchain technology to the mainstream. Due to this XRP faced massive losses and SEC is also accused of causing this damage deliberately to suppress XRP over Bitcoin and ETH. In his interview with 60-minute Garlinghouse pointed out the need for clear regulations for digital assets, stating that Ripple isn’t seeking deregulation but rather asking for “clear rules of the road” to guide the crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Michael Saylor Dodges Question About Ripple Vs SEC , Growing Criticism of the SEC However, it’s not just Musk and Garlinghouse speaking out. Political figures like Senator Mike Lee and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have also criticized the SEC . Lee has questioned the agency’s trustworthiness, while Ramaswamy highlighted its repeated legal losses as a sign of overreach. Legal experts have also pointed to recent court rulings that suggest the SEC may be stepping beyond its authority, raising questions about its focus and priorities. On the other hand, Chamath Palihapitiya criticized the SEC for wasting government resources and using legal tactics to target individuals they disagree with, labeling the behavior as corrupt. He highlighted how only wealthy individuals like Elon Musk can defend themselves against such actions, while others would struggle without similar resources.

After leading the organization for three years, she is now resigning. She is not leaving the organization but now she will join as the Senior Global Advisor. Let’s have a look at her work and how she has contributed towards the crypto ecosystem. A Tough Time for Crypto When Warren took over at CCI, things weren’t exactly smooth sailing. The crypto market was in a rough spot, and there were serious regulatory challenges to face. Even so, she helped CCI gain a reputation for advocating for clear and transparent crypto regulations.

She stayed focused on making sure the crypto world wasn’t written off because of a few bad apples. Her leadership kept CCI in the game, and she’ll be remembered for that. What Happens Next at CCI? Warren’s departure leaves some big shoes to fill, but CCI isn’t worried. Ji Kim, the Chief Legal Officer, will take over as Acting CEO. Warren’s confident Ji will keep things moving forward with the same level of commitment and vision. At the same time, the SEC is about to see changes as well. Gary Gensler, known for his strict policies, will step down in January 2025 , and industry experts are hopeful that his replacement, Paul Atkins, could signal a more crypto-friendly approach. What’s Coming Up for CCI? Though Warren’s leaving the CEO position, she’s not leaving the mission behind. She’s proud of the work done so far and hinted at some exciting things coming next, though she’s keeping details close to her chest. Under Ji Kim’s leadership, CCI is going to continue pushing for the kinds of crypto regulations that let innovation happen without making the whole industry a free-for-all. It’s a time of change, and there’s a lot of hope for the future of crypto, both at CCI and in Washington. Stay tuned for what’s coming.

The move, which will take effect before markets open on Dec. 23, follows a dramatic rise in the company's stock price, driven by its aggressive investments in Bitcoin. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 typically brings additional demand for a company’s stock as ETFs that track the index adjust their portfolios to include the newly added stock. MicroStrategy’s stock is set to more than sixfold increase in value by 2024, taking its market value to around $94 billion, largely due to its status as the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin in 2020 as a strategy to protect its reserves at a time when software revenues are declining. As of Dec. 8, the company held about 423,650 bitcoins, which it purchased for an average of $25.6 billion. At Bitcoin’s last closing price, the investment is worth about $42.43 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Related News: Switzerland-Based Bitcoin Suisse Shares 2025 Forecast for BTC Price Analysts are banking on the firm’s Bitcoin strategy for the stock’s appeal, which closely tracks BTC’s performance. Bernstein analysts noted that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 could pave the way for its potential inclusion in the S&P 500 by 2025. They also predict continued growth in 2025 thanks to increased visibility and recognition beyond ETF inflows. “Management has shown no signs of slowing down this Bitcoin buying and is comfortable buying Bitcoin in the $95,000 to $100,000 range,” Bernstein analysts added. Alongside MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies (PLTR.O) and Axon Enterprise (AXON.O) will also be added to the Nasdaq-100 Index. Meanwhile, Nasdaq confirmed that Illumina (ILMN.O), Super Micro Computer (SMCI.O) and Moderna (MRNA.O) will be removed. *This is not investment advice.

The Altcoin Season Index shows a market shift with altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoin may regain dominance after altcoin rallies. As of Dec 14, 2024, the crypto market shows a shift in dominance, with altcoins taking the lead. The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by CoinMarketCap , is at 65, signaling altcoin season . This change contrasts with previous periods when Bitcoin dominated the market. The index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 coins over the past 90 days, shows that at least 75% of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index With a score of 65, the current index indicates that altcoins are surpassing Bitcoin, but not to the extent seen in past altcoin surges. Although Bitcoin remains strong, the market dynamics are changing, with altcoins gaining influence. The Altcoin Season Index reflects the market’s volatility. A week ago, the index was at 83, showing a powerful altcoin rally. However, a month ago, the index was lower at 36, suggesting a quieter market where Bitcoin had stronger dominance.… The post Altcoin Season Strengthens as Bitcoin Dominance Slips Below 60% appeared first on Coin Edition .",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coin Edition,https://coinedition.com/altcoin-season-strengthens-as-bitcoin-dominance-slips-below-60/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png
37632073,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312788,1734180350,"Crypto Investors HODLing Solana in Anticipation of Higher SOL Prices, According to Analytics Firm","New data from market analytics firm Glassnode reveals that traders are keeping their Solana ( SOL ) stacks amid expectations that its price will continue to rise. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Glassnode says that long-term holders now own a significant supply of SOL, believing that Solana’s bullish phase is far from over. “Solana investors are HODL-ing (holding on for dear life) firm, expecting higher prices. Long-term holders’ share of wealth locked in the network is growing. The 6-12 month cohort now holds 27% of the supply, showing conviction from 2024 rally buyers.” Source: Glassnode/X But the data analytics firm notes that investors who accumulated SOL toward the end of the 2022 market cycle have massively unloaded their holdings. According to Glassnode, the distribution of the 2022 investor cohort suggests that selling pressure for SOL is now weak. “Meanwhile, the 1-2 year cohort has steadily diminished, dropping from 48% in June to just below 5% now. These were investors from the previous bull run who largely took profits during this year’s rally. For now, those who wanted to sell SOL have likely sold.” Source: Glassnode/X Earlier this week, the co-founders of Glassnode predicted that Solana is due for a major rally. “SOL hit the marked zone and rebounded toward $230. If it surpasses $235 on a daily timeframe, it could break the price compression, targeting the previous high of $264. Key Signals: Daily RSI (relative strength indicator) is neutral, far from overbought territory – favorable for a move higher.” Solana is trading for $224 at time of writing, a 3% decrease during the last 24 hours.

37632054,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-joins-nasdaq-100-amid-bitcoin-surge,1734180297,MicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq-100 Amid Bitcoin Surge,"MicroStrategy has been added to the prestigious Nasdaq-100 Index, a significant step that underscores growing recognition of cryptocurrency-focused companies in traditional markets. This achievement follows a remarkable surge in both Bitcoin’s value and MicroStrategy’s stock, driven by the company’s aggressive accumulation of the cryptocurrency. The Nasdaq-100 Index includes the top 100 non-financial firms on the Nasdaq exchange, featuring global leaders like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla. MicroStrategy’s inclusion in this elite group highlights its rising prominence in the market. Exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) tracking the Nasdaq-100, such as Invesco QQQ, will now include MicroStrategy, increasing its exposure to passive investors. Analysts note this could create a feedback loop, where higher investment inflows bolster the company’s ability to raise capital and acquire more Bitcoin, further linking its performance to the cryptocurrency’s value. Over the past year, MicroStrategy’s strategic focus on Bitcoin has redefined its corporate identity. The company currently holds over 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $43.18 billion, with 40% of this acquired in just the past month. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor attributes the company’s success to this bold strategy, emphasizing that Bitcoin has strengthened its market position. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock has soared 124% over four years, outperforming major indices like the S&P 500. Despite its success, analysts warn of potential risks. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggests that MicroStrategy might face reclassification as a financial entity by March due to its dependence on Bitcoin for valuation, rather than its core software business. If reclassified, it could be removed from the Nasdaq-100, posing challenges for the company. MicroStrategy’s inclusion comes at the expense of Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna, which have been removed from the index. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise are also joining, with all changes effective December 23. As Bitcoin prices climb, MicroStrategy benefits from a unique cycle: its stock rises with Bitcoin’s value, attracting more passive investments, which allows it to raise capital to buy even more Bitcoin . This strategy has positioned MicroStrategy as a key player in the evolving financial ecosystem. This achievement signals a broader acceptance of crypto-focused companies in institutional finance. However, as MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin continues to grow, the question remains: can the company sustain this trajectory if market conditions shift? For now, its debut in the Nasdaq-100 is a defining moment for both the company and the crypto industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-joins-nasdaq-100-amid-bitcoin-surge,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37632054.jpeg

In this climate, FXGuys has emerged as a standout project, poised to attract institutional interest thanks to its robust ecosystem and innovative features. As a Top PropFi Project, the FXguys combines trader-centric programs like Trade2Earn and Staking with institutional-grade tools, making it a prime candidate for mainstream adoption. With over $2.6 million raised in its Stage 2 presale and the $FXG token priced at just $0.04, FXGuys is rapidly climbing the list of high potential altcoins. Why FXGuys Stands Out for Institutions Institutional investors seek projects with scalability, utility, and long-term growth potential. FXGuys checks all these boxes and more, making it a compelling option as crypto adoption accelerates. 1. Trade2Earn: A Unique Value Proposition The Trade2Earn program is a revolutionary model that rewards traders with $FXG tokens for every trade. This drives trading activity and aligns token incentives with ecosystem growth. Institutions looking to boost trading volume and engagement find this approach particularly appealing. 2. Staking and Revenue Sharing Institutional investors value predictable revenue streams, and FXGuys delivers with its staking program .

As more countries are seeking a Bitcoin reserve, a Japanese lawmaker has urged his government to do the same. On December 11, Hamada discussed the proposition with the country’s House of Councillors to investigate how other nations are starting their own Bitcoin reserves. Coincidentally, his first name is the same as that of Bitcoin’s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Hamada’s proposal directly referenced US officials and crypto supporters who are trying to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the country. He claims replicating the move would be a strong move for markets. 浜田聡事務所より質問主意書を提出いたしました。 @satoshi_hamada 「米国等が進めているビットコイン準備金導入の動きの把握状況等に関する質問主意書」 pic.twitter.com/n0I0G3RucM — 村上ゆかり (@yukarimurakami5) December 11, 2024 “I think this issue should be talked about, and I would like to hear the government’s opinion,” said Hamada in the translated statement. He also asked, “Should Japan start converting some of its foreign reserves into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Japan’s discussions about a national Bitcoin reserve follow similar moves by Russia, Brazil, and Poland. The topic has grabbed global attention thanks to Bitcoin’s price hitting a record of over $103,000 earlier this month. Bitcoin reserve may benefit crypto investors in Japan’s $4 trillion economy Hamada also mentioned the US’s plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve on social media platform X. Despite still having one of the largest GDPs in the world, Japan slumped to fourth in 2023. The country fell from third behind Germany, which had a slower economy. If Bitcoin has any future, then setting up a national Bitcoin reserve could be good for crypto investors, given the Asian nation’s $4 trillion GDP. Hamada is a member of a political party that holds only two seats in Japan’s parliament, but his vision is likely to see some support in its house. National Diet member Yuichiro Tamaki, the leader of Japan’s Democratic Party for the People, also supports cryptocurrency. He recently promised to cut the crypto tax in the country if re-elected. However, Japan’s new prime minister could hinder crypto promotion in the country. He supports accommodative monetary policy and the use of taxes due to his concerns about deflation .

These digital currencies are catching eyes for their promise of immense growth by 2025. With big players making moves, the buzz around these assets is growing. Dive in to discover which coins could be the next breakout stars. CYBRO to List Ahead of Schedule Following 450% Surge and $7 Million Presale CYBRO, the AI-driven multichain platform, is accelerating its timeline for listing on major exchanges after a standout presale performance. The platform raised $7 million and drew nearly 20,000 investors, positioning itself as a frontrunner in decentralized finance innovation. During its presale, CYBRO’s token price surged 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token is set to debut at $0.06 on major crypto exchanges including Gate.io, and the listing is planned on December 14th. Be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum before it unlocks the full potential CYBRO aims to democratize access to decentralized finance with tools such as staking, farming, and lending. Its presale marked key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs, tailored to diverse investor strategies Blast Index Debut: A one-click investment feature that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols Platform Growth: Laying the groundwork for a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It enables developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially handling up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators with Decentralized Technology TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform developed to give digital content creators full ownership rights over their work. Launched by the Tron Foundation, TRX originally operated on Ethereum but later moved to its own network. By enabling direct interaction between content consumers and creators, TRON eliminates the need for intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. This allows creators to receive more rewards for their efforts. The platform supports smart contracts and decentralized applications, offering an alternative to Ethereum. Users can create dApps on TRON, offer content, and earn digital assets in return. Transactions occur on a public ledger, ensuring transparency and traceability. TRON aims to build a decentralized Internet where sharing content is seamless and cost-effective. NEAR Protocol: Scalable Platform Empowering Decentralized Applications NEAR Protocol is a blockchain platform that helps developers create and launch decentralized apps. It uses sharding to improve efficiency and scalability, allowing more transactions at lower costs. Operating on a distributed network, it offers a decentralized alternative to centralized data storage systems. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, NEAR raised over $20 million from major venture firms. Its Nightshade sharding solution enhances scalability. The Rainbow Bridge enables Ethereum tokens to be transferred to NEAR. Aurora, a Layer 2 solution, uses Ethereum’s technologies for better performance and lower fees. NEAR aims to make blockchain technology accessible and efficient for developers and users. Render Token: Powering Decentralized GPU Rendering for Creatives Render Token (RENDER) is the utility token of The Render Network, a platform offering decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions. It enables creators to access GPU power for rendering tasks more efficiently and at lower costs. Node operators contribute their spare GPU capacity to the network and receive RENDER tokens in return. This system facilitates the production of animation, motion graphics, and visual effects by leveraging a distributed network of processing power. The technology aims to make high-quality rendering more accessible to artists and developers, opening up new possibilities in digital content creation. Conclusion While ADA, TRX, NEAR, and RENDER show promise for significant growth by 2025, their short-term potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO presents investors with unparalleled opportunities to maximize earnings through its technologically advanced DeFi platform. Utilizing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO offers features such as lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. It ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. With a strong emphasis on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project attracting significant interest from crypto whales and influencers. As the bull run of 2024 unfolds, CYBRO positions as a compelling choice for investors seeking immediate growth.

MicroStrategy joins Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) as new additions to the index, according to a Dec. 13 statement from Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Illumina, Inc. (ILMN), Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), and Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) will be removed. MSTR Now Among Nasdaq’s Largest Companies MicroStrategy, originally a software company that pivoted into becoming a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund in 2020, is now among Nasdaq’s 100 largest stocks by market capitalization. Its inclusion also means that the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an ETF managing $322 billion in assets, will add MSTR to its portfolio. Crypto Industry Reacts to the News The announcement sparked excitement across the crypto community. Crypto analyst Will Clemente commented on X, “Now that MSTR is getting added to the Nasdaq, every large pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, and individual retirement account in the world is going to have Bitcoin exposure.” Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, declared, “The trade of the decade is just getting started. Buckle up.” Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, added, “This news is not priced in until public markets open,” predicting active managers benchmarking against Nasdaq would adopt direct exposure to Bitcoin or MSTR to stay competitive. Saylor’s Bitcoin Push Extends to Microsoft This development follows Michael Saylor’s recent attempt to persuade Microsoft’s board to embrace Bitcoin.

37631688,https://crypto.news/?p=14319425,1734179579,Can Shiba Inu price really soar to $1 as burn rate jumps?,"Shiba Inu price continued to consolidate this weekend even as some cryptocurrency analysts remained optimistic. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-biggest meme coin in crypto, was trading at $0.00002812, up by 163% from its lowest level in August. Some analysts predict that Shiba Inu was on the cusp of a strong bullish breakout in the coming weeks. In an X post, SHIB Mortal , predicted that the coin would jump to $1 in this bull run. Shibainu #SHIB Is Going Past $1.00 This Cycle. If You Agree Follow, Like & ReTweet pic.twitter.com/2DcuoglsNj — SHIB Mortal (@SHIBMortal) December 5, 2024 Similarly, Daink, a popular trader with over 88k followers, expects the coin to have a strong bullish breakout. He cited its strong technicals on the monthly chart. One of the most cited bullish catalysts for Shiba Inu price is its ongoing token burn. According to ShibBurn , the 24-hour burn rate rose by 425% to 71,122,860 coins. These burns brought the total number of burnt Shiba Inu coins to over 410 trillion. Those in circulation are over 584 trillion. You might also like: 4 charged cryptos with potential to invest $1k in and make $100k in no time A token burn is a situation where coins are moved from circulation by being transferred to an inaccessible address. In Shiba Inu’s case, some of these tokens comes from its ecosystem like Shibarium and ShibaSwap. Shibarium is a relatively new layer-2 network that has handled over 645 million in transactions . It has over 2.01 million addresses, and its average block time is 20.9 seconds. Some of the BONE fees made in Shibarium are converted to SHIB and burnt. Another potential catalyst for the Shiba Inu price is that investors are moving their tokens from exchanges. The total tokens on exchanges has dropped by 1.73% in the last seven days to 258.19 trillion. Shiba Inu price analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price has been in a slow uptrend after bottoming at $0.00001095 in August. It formed the highly bullish golden cross pattern on Nov. 4 as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed each other. It has formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular continuation sign. Most recently, it has consolidated as it forms the handle section of the pattern. This consolidation happened after it moved to the upper side of the cup and the weak, stop & reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Shiba Inu price will have a bullish breakout. The depth of the cup is 67%. Therefore, if we measure that distance from the upper side of the cup, we can estimate that the price will rise to $0.00005470. While it is possible for Shiba Inu to jump to $1, the scenario is improbable. For that to happen, it needs to rise by 3.02 million percent. Shiba Inu was created in 2020 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Ryoshi, whose identity remains unknown — similar to the mysterious origins of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.

37633664,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52161,1734179409,Curious About the Best Coins with 100X Potential? These 4 Options Are Worth a Closer Look Right Now,"Ever wondered which cryptocurrencies have the potential to turn small investments into incredible gains? With so many projects competing for attention, finding the best coins with 100X potential can feel like a guessing game. But the key lies in identifying cryptos with real-world utility, innovative tech, and robust growth prospects. One such project is Qubetics ($TICS) , a blockchain platform redefining how developers and businesses build on Web3. Along with Qubetics, three other altcoins have been making noise for their potential to deliver extraordinary returns. Let’s break them down. 1. Qubetics Offers A Game-Changing Web3 Development Tool Qubetics is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a powerhouse for Web3 innovation. Central to its ecosystem is the QubeQode IDE , a cutting-edge development environment that simplifies blockchain app creation. From pre-built components to intuitive configurations, it’s designed to make blockchain accessible to businesses and developers from all backgrounds. For example, imagine a start-up looking to launch a tokenised loyalty programme. With QubeQode IDE, they can drag and drop pre-built features like user authentication and token management, saving weeks of development time. Small businesses can also use its form-based configurations to automate contracts, eliminating the need for in-depth coding. Whether you’re a developer or a non-tech entrepreneur, the code snippet library ensures you can incorporate advanced blockchain features effortlessly. The $TICS presale has been nothing short of impressive. Currently in its 12th stage, it has already raised over $5.9 million, selling more than 318 million tokens. Each presale stage lasts seven days, ending every Sunday at midnight with a 10% price hike. Analysts predict $TICS will grow from its current $0.031 per token to $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 703.21% ROI. And that’s just the beginning. With forecasts of $10 or even $15 after the mainnet launch, early investors could see returns exceeding 48,000%. Here’s a scenario: if someone invested $650,000 during the $TICS presale, they’d secure 20,902,778 tokens. At $15 per token, this investment would skyrocket to $313,541,670. Why this coin made it to this list? Qubetics combines cutting-edge tools like QubeQode IDE with incredible growth potential, making it a standout choice among the best coins with 100X potential. 2. Hedera Revolutionises Distributed Ledger Technology Hedera (HBAR) is setting new benchmarks in blockchain with its enterprise-grade distributed ledger technology. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera uses a unique consensus mechanism called Hashgraph, which offers unparalleled speed, security, and scalability. It’s designed to support everything from micropayments to large-scale supply chain solutions. Take the example of a retail company looking to improve its supply chain transparency. By integrating Hedera, they can create immutable records of every transaction, ensuring end-to-end visibility for suppliers, partners, and customers. With transactions finalising in seconds and costs significantly lower than traditional methods, Hedera appeals to both developers and enterprises. The project’s partnerships with major brands, including Google and IBM, showcase its potential for mass adoption. Analysts suggest that as enterprise interest grows, so will the value of its native token, HBAR. Why this coin made it to this list? Hedera’s unique technology and strong corporate backing make it a key player among projects with 100X potential. 3. Kadena Bridges Blockchain Efficiency And Security Kadena is an innovative blockchain network focused on delivering high throughput without sacrificing security. Unlike other platforms that struggle with scalability issues, Kadena’s braided chain architecture allows it to process an ever-growing number of transactions as its network expands. Picture an e-commerce platform needing fast, secure payment processing. Kadena’s blockchain can handle thousands of transactions per second, ensuring customers experience quick and seamless checkouts. Plus, its low transaction fees make it an attractive choice for cost-conscious businesses. Kadena has also gained attention for its energy-efficient operations. As concerns about blockchain sustainability grow, Kadena’s ability to scale while keeping energy consumption low makes it a forward-thinking solution. Why this coin made it to this list? Kadena’s focus on scalability and energy efficiency positions it as a blockchain primed for explosive growth. 4. Ocean Protocol Unlocks Data Marketplaces Ocean Protocol is bringing decentralised data sharing to the forefront. This project aims to create a marketplace where individuals and companies can monetise their data while maintaining control and privacy. With data becoming one of the most valuable commodities in the world, Ocean Protocol is tapping into a high-demand sector. Imagine a healthcare organisation wanting to share anonymised patient data with researchers. Using Ocean Protocol, they can securely monetise their data while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations. This opens up new opportunities for data owners and creates a more democratic system for data exchange. Ocean Protocol has been expanding its partnerships and integrations, with an ever-growing list of use cases. Its focus on solving real-world challenges ensures it will remain relevant as industries increasingly turn to blockchain for data solutions. Why this coin made it to this list? Ocean Protocol’s innovative approach to data monetisation gives it significant potential to generate strong returns. Wrapping Up With The Best Coins For 100X Potential When it comes to finding the best coins with 100X potential, it’s not just about hype—it’s about substance. Projects like Qubetics, Hedera, Kadena, and Ocean Protocol are building real solutions that address current gaps in the blockchain world. With the $TICS presale showcasing the power of Qubetics and other coins bringing unique innovations, these picks could be game-changers for your portfolio. Whether you’re an investor looking for long-term growth or a newcomer exploring blockchain technology, these projects deserve a closer look.

37632558,https://thecoinrise.com/senator-lummis-proposal-for-u-s-bitcoin-reserve-sparks-market-speculation/,1734179405,Senator Lummis’ Proposal for U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Sparks Market Speculation,"The crypto market is buzzing with discussions following Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis’ ambitious proposal for the U.S. government to acquire 1 million Bitcoin, equivalent to 5% of the total supply. Crypto analyst Ben Simpson predicts that such a move, if approved, could trigger heightened price volatility. “I expect Bitcoin to pump initially, but it will likely rotate back afterward,” said Simpson, founder and CEO of Collective Shift, during an interview . Lummis, a Republican and staunch crypto advocate, announced her plan after Donald Trump’s re-election in November. Her proposal involves holding the Bitcoin reserve for a minimum of 20 years, a strategy aimed at cementing the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets. Simpson also highlighted a potential shift in market dynamics, with Bitcoin dominance showing signs of decline . Currently at 56.63%, dominance has dropped 7.20% in the past month, according to TradingView data . This shift, coupled with Bitcoin’s consolidation around $100,000, has paved the way for altcoins to gain traction. While some traders foresee a strong altcoin season, Simpson cautioned that the transition will likely be turbulent. Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Stays Strong Despite predictions of altcoin growth, Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of institutional portfolios. Analysts at Bitfinex emphasized that Bitcoin’s historical performance continues to outperform many altcoins, underscoring its role as a reliable investment. “With Bitcoin surpassing six figures, we see strong spot demand sustaining these levels,” Bitfinex analysts stated. They also noted that leverage in the market remains manageable, suggesting that any dips during the holiday season could present buying opportunities rather than a cause for concern. Bull Market Just Getting Started? Analysts further observed a growing sentiment among Bitcoin proponents who view the asset as a superior alternative to gold and a definitive store of value. This belief, coupled with strategic accumulation by institutions, is expected to support Bitcoin’s long-term price stability. Adding to the optimism, VanEck digital asset analysts Nathan Frankovitz and Matthew Sigel reaffirmed their $180,000 price target for Bitcoin at the peak of this cycle. They believe the next phase of the bull market is only beginning, driven by sustained interest from institutional investors and a broader embrace of cryptocurrencies.

37631442,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374521,1734179134,"These Network Dynamics Could Push Ether Above $5K, According to CryptoQuant","Analysts at the on-chain intelligence platform CryptoQuant have identified network dynamics that could push ether (ETH) above $5,000 in the coming weeks. Per a weekly report , the Ethereum network is seeing renewed demand and increased network activity. Valuation metrics suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency will trade above $5,000 if supply and demand dynamics continue. The asset was worth $3,910 at press time. ETH Sees Rising Demand Gauging ether’s realized price, the average one at which holders bought their ETH, $5,200, is the current upper limit for the crypto asset. Although this point marked the ETH top for the 2021 bull run, the price band will continue to rise as new market participants buy ETH at higher valuations. The renewed demand for ETH can be seen in the holdings of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which hit a new high of 3.41 million coins. These products have witnessed a significant increase in their holdings since their launch in July 2024, and this growth marks a notable recovery from a low of 2.716 million ETH in September. CryptoQuant noted that with market participants expressing renewed confidence in ETH as an investment vehicle, sustained buying pressure from Ethereum ETFs could contribute to upward price momentum. Supply Dynamics Flash Positive Signal The cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics have been positive, especially since the implementation of the EIP-1559 upgrade, which enables the burning of a portion of transaction fees and reduces net issuance. Effects of the Dencun upgrade led to the total supply of ETH growing to its highest level since April 2023; however, the amount of ETH burned via fees began to increase in September. With the amount of ETH burned through transaction fees increasing from 80 ETH on August 30 to 2,700 as of today, the pace of supply growth has declined over the past few months. This exerts a deflationary pressure on the asset. In addition, Ethereum has recorded higher network activity, with total transactions and contract calls hitting new highs in 2024. The network’s total daily transactions now hover around 6.5 million to 7.5 million, compared to 5 million last year, while total daily contract calls have expanded to 7 million from 5 million in 2023. Analysts pointed out that higher network activity on the protocol leads to greater ETH burned via transaction fees, which positively affects the cryptocurrency’s price.

Despite recent struggles and a significant pullback earlier in the week, some analysts have predicted ETH could surge to $5,000 due to growing institutional demand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: A Recap Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to move beyond $4,000 as it faces considerable resistance, with buyers pegged back by selling activity at upper levels. ETH has been bullish since the US elections, with demand increasing substantially as markets surged following Donald Trump’s victory. ETH’s bull run peaked last week, reaching an intraday high of $4,093 before settling at $4,003, a level not seen since March 2024. However, sentiment waned over the weekend as the price registered a marginal drop on Saturday and fell to $3,999. ETH registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,007. Source: TradingView However, markets collapsed on Monday as they faced a sudden pullback. As a result, ETH plummeted over 7%, falling to an intraday low of $3,536 before recovering to reclaim $3,700 and settle at $3,715. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price dropped over 2%, hitting a low of $3,521 before settling at $3,630. Sellers attempted to drive ETH below $3,500 on Wednesday as it fell to an intraday low of $3,558. However, it recovered from this level as sentiment changed, registering an increase of almost 6% and settling at $3,834. ETH attempted to go above $4,000 on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $3,988. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and ultimately settled at $3,882 after registering an increase of 1.26%. Buyers retained control on Friday, and ETH registered a marginal increase to $3,907. In the current session, ETH is marginally up as buyers look to build momentum and move towards $4,000. What Next For Ethereum (ETH)? So, where does Ethereum (ETH) go from here? ETH is facing considerable resistance at $4,000, a level it has been unable to conquer as yet. Despite its recent struggles, analysts are confident ETH can surpass $4,000 and even hit $5,000 as institutional demand for the asset grows. Looking at the price chart, we see ETH has support at around $3,700. If sellers overwhelm this level, ETH could drop to $3,500. On the other hand, if buyers retain control and build enough momentum, a move beyond $4,000 is a realistic scenario. Analysts favor the latter scenario, with some predicting an unprecedented surge that could take ETH beyond $5,000. This prediction is backed by a significant spike in on-chain activity and a substantial increase in inflows to the new Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum funds reported $1.2 billion in inflows from investors as ETH emerged as a viable alternative to Bitcoin (BTC). According to CryptoQuant, renewed investor demand could take ETH well beyond $5,000. “Based on valuation metrics, ETH could be heading above $5,000 if current demand and supply dynamics continue.” CryptoQuant also noted the spike in on-chain activity, with daily transactions hovering between 6.5 million and 7.5 million for the current year, compared to around 5 million during the previous year. “Higher network activity on Ethereum signifies increased usage and demand for the network’s capabilities, reflecting growing adoption of decentralized applications.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37631306,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393206,1734178788,Top 5 Non-Custodial Wallets for a More Personalized and Seamless Crypto Experience,"The post Top 5 Non-Custodial Wallets for a More Personalized and Seamless Crypto Experience appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Custodians are entrusted with the care of something; say caretakers. These are what custodial wallets are. They take the burden of asset protection off users, however, they may or may not bear the full brunt for the misplacement of the asset. Think Mt. Gox or FTX. This is the reason the crypto market has evolved in the last few years to be more personal, truly decentralized and non-custodial. This has birthed a plethora of decentralized and non-custodial services that facilitate borderless and trustless transactions. These services, especially wallets, literally give users the keys – and magic words – to their assets. Here, we explore five of such wallets. 1. NOW Wallet Supporting over 70 blockchains, 1500+ tokens, including coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Monero (XMR), NOW Wallet enables a range of transactions: storing, sending, receiving, buying, selling, exchanging, and staking. Speaking of staking, users can stake Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA) and several other tokens. They also enjoy the flexibility of personalizing their asset management and transactions by adding custom tokens that run on supported EVM-compatible and Tron networks, and connecting to favorite dApps through WalletConnect. Furthermore, NOW Wallet ’s user-friendly interface and fiat-to-crypto function provide newbies with an easy pathway to the crypto market. This functionality allows the conversion of 60+ fiat currencies to crypto using Mastercard, Visa, Apple/Google Pay, or bank transfers. Though users do not need to go through KYC verification for crypto-to-crypto transfers with the wallet, its partner services require KYC for fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions. Powered by the instant crypto exchange ChangeNOW, NOW Wallet also features free and paid Pro plans including a cashback of up to 0.2% for every swap made. Users also do not need to worry about shady transactions since they can run AML checks on their transactions. Other Pro features include unique domain names for receiving crypto payments and unlimited access to crypto loans. NOW Wallet is accessible on Google Play and App Store and macOS , Windows , and Linux devices. There’s also an efficient 24/7 customer support with a 99% resolution rate to attend to the diverse needs of users. 2. Metamask MetaMask is one of the most popular non-custodial wallets, boasting over 30 million monthly active users. It is not just a secure wallet for storing funds, but a way through which users connect to several blockchain-based applications. One of its key features is its portfolio platform that provides users with detailed insights about the performance of their assets across all networks. Thus, users can track price movements, know the total value of their portfolio, and monitor trends. With this data, they can make informed investment decisions. While Metamask supports a myriad of assets, they are all Ethereum- or EVM-based. This means that the wallet is not an option for users who have only non-Ethereum or non-EVM assets like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). 3. Coinbase Wallet Launched by Coinbase, US leading exchange, Coinbase Wallet offers users the opportunity to buy, swap, and stake their assets. The wallet supports thousands of digital assets, including NFTs. Furthermore, Coinbase Onramp makes it easy to purchase crypto. It gives users access to over 60 fiat currencies and more than 100 cryptocurrencies with a single integration. Recently, it added Apple Pay to this Onramp service, making fiat-to-crypto conversions even more convenient by allowing users to fund their wallet with 100+ tokens, enjoy no fees on USDC, and access to a range of fiat currencies. However, a downside to the wallet is that it has the tendency to accumulate transaction fees, particularly for smaller transactions. Also, its strict vetting policy makes it support a limited number of crypto assets and dApps. 4. Trust Wallet Supporting more than one million assets and 100+ blockchain networks, this is a great choice for users whose portfolios are a diversity of assets. Like other non-custodial wallets, Trust Wallet gives users total autonomy over their assets. Like NOW and Coinbase Wallet, users can also buy crypto with their local fiat currency. This service is managed by Trust’s global partners like MoonPay, Ramp Network, and Transak. They allow the wallet to handle over 100 different currencies and facilitate the easy purchase of cryptocurrencies with only a few clicks directly from the app. While Trust Wallet’s capacity to accommodate millions of assets makes it a powerhouse, it also indicates a significant security risk, especially for new users who are yet to differentiate between fake and legitimate assets. Also, its lack of two-factor authentication is a significant flaw in its security design. 5. Zerion Wallet Zerion is a perfect fit for DeFi users. It supports 60+ DeFi protocols and comes with an interface that allows its 200,000 monthly users to invest, lend, borrow, and swap their assets. While many non-custodial wallets that have integrated DeFi protocols give users a chance to earn passive income through staking, Zerion offers an alternative opportunity whereby users earn interest by lending tokens. Users can also access yield farming protocols and liquidity pools to earn rewards. This unique function is, however, constrained since the supported blockchains on Zerion are quite limited. Summary Non-custodial wallets are essential tools for secure, autonomous, and effective management of crypto assets. NOW Wallet, Metamask, Coinbase, Zerion and Trust Wallet are some of the most reliable non-custodial wallets designed to cater to crypto needs. NOW Wallet offers a truly personalized experience by allowing the addition of custom tokens and favorite dApps, the creation of unique domain names for receiving payments, while AML checks, cashback rewards, and access to unlimited crypto loans just add to the appeal. These functionalities easily make NOW Wallet a trendsetter for others. However, this doesn’t mean that other wallets fall short, because they all empower crypto users to easily navigate the dynamic crypto market, irrespective of their features or offerings. And since they are non-custodial, they enable users to flex their power of choice and unlock the full potential of their crypto journey.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/now-wallet-for-a-more-personalized-and-seamless-crypto-experience/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37631548,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627385,1734178764,"OpenAI hits back at Elon Musk lawsuit, says he suggested for-profit entity","Elon Musk and OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company he co-founded, are locked in a heated legal battle over its transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity. Following Musk’s recent lawsuit, the company is now pushing back, arguing that his lawsuit is rooted in personal grievances rather than legitimate concerns. According to recent reports, OpenAI has asked a California federal judge to invalidate Elon Musk’s lawsuit seeking to stop its transition to a profitable entity. Musk had filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, accusing the organization of abandoning its original mission for financial gain. However, the entity has pushed back, calling Musk’s allegations baseless. In a statement released on the legal filing, OpenAI criticized Elon Musk for what it described as contradictory actions. The organization alleged that Musk himself had attempted to shift it from its nonprofit roots to a for-profit model during his tenure, years before stepping away from the company. Elon Musk wanted an OpenAI for-profit. https://t.co/wjDRN1ExX4 — OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 13, 2024 The company has defended its decision to transition to a for-profit model, citing the need for substantial funding to compete with major players like Google’s DeepMind. Internal communications reveal that Musk was aware of these challenges as early as December 2018, when he reportedly told the company that it needed to raise “billions per year immediately” to remain relevant. Musk vs OpenAI: The Backstory OpenAI began as a nonprofit with the mission to advance artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity in 2015. Musk, a key figure in its inception, initially floated the idea of a hybrid structure combining nonprofit and for-profit elements, according to emails and texts recently published by the company. While the organization initially launched as nonprofit, financial challenges in later years pushed OpenAI’s leadership to explore alternative structures to secure funding. Documents unveiled by OpenAI show that in 2017, Musk proposed merging the company with a hardware startup, potentially Cerebras , to create what OpenAI’s president Greg Brockman described as an “AI research + hardware for-profit.” The Tesla CEO’s vision included majority equity ownership, with demands for control over the company’s board and operations. The company’s leadership, however, resisted these terms, leading to a stalemate. According to OpenAI’s legal team, Musk’s wealth manager incorporated a public benefit corporation named “Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies Inc. ” in September 2017. This move marked a turning point in negotiations over ownership and governance. Musk’s insistence on controlling equity and leadership roles clashed with the priorities of OpenAI’s other founders. By early 2018, tensions between Musk and OpenAI had reached a breaking point. Emails released by OpenAI show that Musk was initially supportive of the idea of a for-profit arm. However, his later demands for majority control and leadership roles created friction with the rest of the team. This discord ultimately led to Musk’s departure and the establishment of his rival AI venture, xAI. OpenAI’s for-profit transition creates tensions In March 2019, OpenAI publicly announced the formation of a capped-profit entity to address funding challenges. The new structure allowed investors to earn returns up to a predefined limit while the nonprofit retained overall governance. OpenAI’s decision to transition to a capped-profit structure was not made lightly. Internal discussions from 2017 and 2018 reflect a deep awareness of the trade-offs involved. While the nonprofit model aligned with the organization’s original mission, financial realities necessitated a shift to attract the level of investment required for cutting-edge AI research. The AI company shared an advance copy of the announcement with Musk, who responded by requesting explicit clarification that he had no financial interest in the for-profit arm. Over the years, OpenAI’s founders reportedly offered Musk equity in the for-profit entity multiple times, but Musk declined. Musk’s lawsuit, filed in August 2024, alleges that OpenAI’s collaboration with Microsoft has undermined its independence. The legal filing accuses the two organizations of sharing proprietary information and resources, potentially violating regulatory norms. 🚨BREAKING: ELON MUSK SUES OPENAI OVER AI THREAT ELON IN SUIT: ""OpenAI, Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft.

This relationship has reportedly drawn scrutiny from competitors, including Google, which is requesting authorities to investigate its cloud arrangements. OpenAI’s responds to Elon Musk’s lawsuit OpenAI is now dismissing Musk’s claims, framing his lawsuit as an attempt to rewrite history. “You can’t sue your way to artificial general intelligence,” the organization said in a statement. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAI, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom.” In a new blog post, OpenAI throws down the gauntlet to Elon Musk: ""You can't sue your way to AGI"" pic.twitter.com/06HOr5Ugjm — Tsarathustra (@tsarnick) December 13, 2024 A Bloomberg report shows that besides the Tesla CEO’s lawsuit, the AI behemoth is facing mounting pressure to finalize its for-profit transition. Investors in the company’s latest funding round have reportedly negotiated terms allowing them to withdraw their investments if the transition is not completed within two years. This urgency has added a layer of complexity to the ongoing legal dispute with Musk. Musk’s motion for an injunction also seeks to block the firm’s collaboration with Microsoft. The filing alleges that the two companies’ close ties, particularly in cloud computing, could hinder fair competition in the AI sector. OpenAI and Microsoft have yet to respond directly to these specific allegations in court.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

37630890,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393197,1734177974,"From Presales To Potential Power Houses, These 2 Have Taken Over the Market","The post From Presales To Potential Power Houses, These 2 Have Taken Over the Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Following the recent US elections, the expected changes in US crypto regulation are changing the crypto landscape. Investors are giving precedence to innovative projects that focus on utility. Among these, BlockDAG and Cutoshi have surprised analysts with their wildly successful presales. BlockDAG Unique Technology Nets it $160.73M In Presales Ever since Bitcoin, there has been relatively little innovation in proof of work (PoW) technology. Instead, most crypto assets opted for an alternative model. Most recently, however, BlockDAG broke this trend with its unique take on PoW technology. This unique approach was successful, as so far, BlockDAG secured $160.73 million in its presale. The team is not stopping there and is aiming for a total of $600 million in investments. While the goal is ambitious, BlockDAG is on track to break new presale milestones soon. The key to its success is the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, BlockDAG’s unique take on PoW. Unlike most blockchains, DAG technology enables the creation of multiple blocks at the same time. This makes BlockDAG much more scalable than most blockchains. What is more, BlockDAG has the added advantage of PoW chains, which is higher security and decentralization. Unlike PoS chains, which are typically controlled by a small number of validators, PoS chains rely on miners. This creates a more decentralized validation infrastructure, protecting the network from attacks. The technical sophistication is not the only reason why investors are looking into BlockDAG. Namely, the project also offers tiered rewards to presale investors. The goal of these rewards is to incentivize those that support it early on. Cutoshi Blends Memes With DeFi Just like BlockDAG, memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) is also attracting attention thanks to its unique vision. In just weeks after starting its presale, Cutoshi raised $1 million in investments, gaining viral status. Now, the project is on track to sell out all its presale tokens. As of December 12, Cutoshi raised a total of $1,363 million in presale investments. The reason why traders are excited is its unique blend of memes and DeFi. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi token. It is based on the famous lucky cat, a symbol believed to bring luck and prosperity. At the same time, it is also a utility token for a DeFi ecosystem run by its users. Its ecosystem will feature a multichain DEX, a learning platform and various essential DeFi utilities. All of these are designed to make DeFi more accessible to average users. Cutoshi’s use of memes broadens its appeal to regular users and traders. While BlockDAG appeals to a section of tech-savvy investors, Cutoshi appeals to both meme coin traders and DeFi enthusiasts. Its focus on memes is also in line with its ability to attract regular users to DeFi.

37630738,https://crypto.news/?p=14319120,1734177660,Launchpads are the key to decoding crypto’s investment complexity | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. When investors decide which stocks or ventures to invest in, they usually have a set of criteria to evaluate which options best align with their financial goals. One main factor to consider is risk appetite , which refers to investor willingness to take on risk in pursuit of potential returns. You might also like: VCs come and go, but launchpads will remain a fundamental part of web3 | Opinion Those with a lower risk appetite prefer more stable blue-chip stocks with steady but modest returns. On the other hand, investors with a higher risk tolerance may seek out more volatile stocks or emerging markets, enticed by the possibility of substantial returns. They are often willing to endure market fluctuations, believing the potential long-term rewards outweigh the risks. However, when it comes to crypto, retail investors have remained conservative. Despite the industry’s notorious promises of high returns, many retail investors cautiously approach crypto. Their hesitation is due to crypto’s well-known volatility, the perception that frauds and scams are prevalent, and a general lack of technological understanding compounded by a complex user experience. With 2025 on the horizon and Bitcoin ( BTC ) soaring amid bullish vibes, crypto has steadily gained traction as a legitimate investment class. While recent price jumps stem from Donald Trump’s election victory and his crypto-friendly appointees , the industry has been gaining traction for some time. The industry has found a new product-market fit for stablecoins, DeFi is booming, and newly improved infrastructure has enabled a variety of new applications while also reducing transaction costs. As such, many retail and institutional investors are becoming enamoured with crypto’s investment potential and growing technological capabilities. This begs the question: How can blockchain-based projects effectively convert conservative retail and institutional investors into active participants beyond their comfort zone? Enter crypto launchpads Crypto launchpads grant investors early access to tokens before they list on public exchanges. In practice, this offers investors enticing investment opportunities as they have the potential for higher ROIs. Cryptocurrency uncertainty can be unsettling for those who prefer investing in safe stocks with steady growth. Launchpads address these concerns by helping make crypto approachable, challenging the perception that it is unsafe, and emphasizing transparency to foster trust among hesitant new investors. The concept wasn’t always perfect. For one, ICOs became notorious during the 2017 bull run due to scammy token launches and straight-up fraud. However, the next generation of crypto launchpads incorporates stronger vetting practices to bolster safety and informed investment. This allows investors to engage with early-stage projects with a sense of security they might not get when exploring projects independently. Investors gain here in two ways. They get to actively engage with projects with some level of protection and gain bragging rights to say they helped launch an innovation in a growing field. As crypto expands and matures, so do the launchpads that propel many of the industry’s most promising projects, even putting community-focused spins on the “auction house” vibe launchpads sometimes inhabit. For instance, Gems’s launchpad emphasizes community and networking as it seeks to establish an exclusive ecosystem for crypto investing and fundraising. At the heart of Gems’s platform is a diverse network of “Leaders,” eager and discerning investor influencers who then rally their community around projects on the launchpad based on their interests and speciality. Compared to other launchpads, Gems recognizes the unpredictability of crypto investments and offers an optional protection program through a trusted insurance provider. To make sure the projects utilizing their launchpad are the cream of the crop, Gems’s investment committee also conducts a thorough vetting process to pinpoint teams with the most disruptive potential. It’s understandable why investors may be cautious about investing in unknown crypto projects. However, launchpads are an irreplaceable asset for an industry that is in the midst of expansion by helping demystify early-stage investing and broadening access to everyone.

Aave price, for instance, seems to have taken off after making a somewhat tame performance in the remarkably bullish month of “Moonvember.” According to data from CoinGecko, the price of AAVE has increased by more than 26% over the past week. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the DeFi token may face some hurdles in its bullish trajectory and suffer a slight setback in the short term. Is AAVE Price Going To Witness A Correction? In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the investor sentiment around the Aave token has become increasingly positive following its latest price upswing. This on-chain observation is based on the Social Volume and Weighted Sentiment metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week The Social Volume metric measures the total number of mentions of a particular crypto asset on various social media platforms in the last 24 hours. In essence, it tracks the degree of discussion surrounding a cryptocurrency on social media. Meanwhile, weighted sentiment is a product of sentiment score and social volume. Typically, there is a significant shift in this metric when the social volume is high and there is a specific average sentiment (either positive or negative). Based on data from Santiment, the social volume and positive sentiment around the AAVE price action have grown significantly over the past few days. As shown in the chart below, this soaring positive sentiment correlates with the Aave price surge over the past week. According to Martinez, a brief price correction might be on the cards for Aave, especially with the crypto crowd seemingly hyped about the DeFi token’s price performance. This is based on the notion — backed by historical data — that crypto prices often in the opposite direction of the crowd. Recent price action data shows that the Aave price might be falling into something of a consolidation range, having failed to hold above the $380 mark on Friday. As of this writing, the Aave token is valued at $365, reflecting a mere 0.4% increase in the past 24 hours. DeFi Coins Back At It? Most of the attention has gone to the meme coins — and deservedly so — in this bull cycle. However, it appears that prominent DeFi coins are beginning to pull their weight and stake a claim for the spotlight.

37630813,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627381,1734177597,Donald Trump and the US dollar – Is one really a threat to the other?,"Donald Trump’s relationship with the US dollar has always been complicated. During his first term, he openly pushed for a weaker buck, often clashing with the norms of presidential behavior. You know, typical Trump. Back in 2019, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted at more monetary stimulus, Trump pounced, tweeting that: “Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA. They have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.” That was a direct shot at traditional US dollar policy and a signal that Trump was willing to take matters into his own hands. Now, as the president prepares for a second term, the conversation around the dollar is heating up again. His pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is trying to sell a different narrative. Scott claims that Trump’s new administration believes in free-market dynamics, saying, “If you have good economic policies, you’re naturally going to have a strong dollar.” But anyone who’s followed Trump knows that his actions often speak louder than his administration’s talking points. A strong dollar and Trump’s trade tactics The dollar isn’t waiting for Trump to decide. Since his re-election, the DXY dollar index, which tracks the dollar against major currencies, has climbed nearly 3%. This rise goes against Trump’s earlier preference for a weaker currency and puts pressure on key trading partners like the eurozone and China. Both are already grappling with economic challenges. Europe’s position is especially precarious. The European Central Bank has been slashing rates to fight off recession risks. Deposit rates could drop as low as 1.5% from 3%, while inflation remains below the ECB’s 2% target. In contrast, US inflation has ticked up to 2.7%, keeping the Federal Reserve cautious about cutting rates further. These dynamics make the dollar naturally stronger, creating a headache for European exporters and widening the trade gap with the US. China is in no better shape. Its economy is struggling to find footing, with leaders calling for more fiscal and monetary stimulus. The renminbi, China’s currency, has been a key battleground in past US-China trade wars. Deliberate efforts by Chinese authorities to weaken the renminbi by buying up dollars are nothing new, and many analysts expect more of the same in the coming months. If Trump revives his tariff-heavy policies, China could respond with currency manipulation, setting the stage for another round of economic brinkmanship. This is where Trump’s unpredictable nature becomes a factor. During his first term, he didn’t hesitate to lash out at foreign stimulus measures, accusing them of undercutting American trade. If the dollar continues to rise, Trump could easily take a similar stance, especially if it helps him sell his trade policies as a win for American workers. A new currency accord or another Twitter storm? Trump has never been one to play by the rules. In 1985, the Plaza Accord saw major economies agree to weaken the dollar to balance global trade. Could he attempt a modern version of this, perhaps branded as a “Mar-a-Lago Accord”? It’s not far-fetched to imagine him demanding currency concessions from US trading partners in exchange for tariff relief. But pulling off such a deal would require diplomatic finesse—something Trump’s impulsive approach often lacks. The problem with currency negotiations is their complexity. Exchange rates aren’t just numbers; they reflect the economic health, trade dynamics, and monetary policies of entire nations. Coordinating these factors across multiple economies is like playing chess on multiple boards simultaneously. Trump’s tendency to simplify issues into win-or-lose terms makes this an especially risky path. Some analysts are already bracing for what they call “currency wars.” Despite these risks, markets seem to have priced in much of Trump’s potential impact. The dollar index has surged 6% since late October when investors started betting on his victory. This could limit the dollar’s upward momentum next year. But if Trump begins actively pressuring foreign governments to weaken their currencies, all bets are off. Social media-driven diplomacy could return with a vengeance, making financial markets as unpredictable as ever.

But the panic didn’t last long! However, XRP price has bounced back, rising by almost 9% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile some experts are boldly claiming that XRP will never drop below $2 again. Here’s why they are so confident! Why XRP’s Price May Continue to Rise XRP, a cryptocurrency linked to Ripple Labs, is riding the wave of optimism in the crypto market. As Bitcoin’s rally boosts altcoins, XRP is gaining momentum . Experts believe it could soon aim for its all-time high (ATH), with on-chain data pointing to further growth. One key factor is the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), which measures how long tokens stay inactive on the blockchain. A high MDIA usually indicates a stagnant market. But for XRP, the MDIA has recently dropped, showing that long-held tokens are now being traded actively. This increase in activity is a positive sign, as it brings more liquidity to the market and supports price growth. Another important metric is the Taker Buy Ratio, which tracks the number of buy orders compared to total trades in the derivatives market. Currently, XRP’s ratio is at 0.55, which shows strong buying interest. Data from CryptoQuant highlights this as a bullish signal, with buyers gaining control of the market. Bulls Take the Lead As of now, XRP is trading around $2.45 , supported by a market cap of $139.3 billion. Its 10-day simple moving average of $2.42 and 100-day average of $2.37 further confirm the upward trend. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52.27 suggests a balanced market, while the MACD indicator signals potential for further gains. If this buying pressure continues, XRP could climb toward $3.50 in the short term. However, if the recent increase in token circulation slows down, the price might drop back to $2.13. For now, the bulls seem firmly in control, and XRP’s future looks brighter than ever.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | ASIA | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-bounce-back-to-2-45-experts-say-it-may-never-fall-below-2-again/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37630140,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627362,1734176391,"SEC-CFTC merger will simplify crypto regulations, John E. Deaton reveals","Vocal crypto advocate John E. Deaton has revealed the need to merge the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to simplify crypto regulations. The issue of regulating the crypto market has become a widely discussed subject in the United States, with experts and advocates alike giving their opinions. However, Deaton thinks the way forward will be to merge the SEC and CFTC into one big organization for effective regulations. He has been critical of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who he describes as a ‘Bad Faith Regulator’ in the past. This was due to Gensler’s stifling crypto regulations and his unwarranted legal actions against crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase. Deaton gave his opinion while replying to a post on X where Digital Chamber CEO Perianne Boring was discussing how Trump’s crypto vision could help the United States’ regulatory clarity. John E. Deaton makes his case for joint regulatory bodies On the morning show with Maria, Boring made a case of the confusion and conflicts it causes the financial markets by having two separate regulators oversee their activities. Deaton, in his post on X, agreed with Boring, highlighting the confusion and inefficiency it causes for the agencies. He said that by merging both regulators, they would be able to eliminate overlapping responsibilities and conflicts that have risen in the past. It would also make it easier for firms, helping them follow the rules. Outstanding job by @PerianneDC on @MorningsMaria with @MariaBartiromo discussing how @elonmusk and @VivekGRamaswamy ’s @DOGE may want to push for merging the @CFTC & @SECGov . There’s a strong case to be made for merging the two agencies. Merging the SEC & CFTC would eliminate… https://t.co/dLdSSVXyxs — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 13, 2024 Deaton also mentioned that the move will also help the agencies provide a consistent and straightforward approach to making rules for securities like stocks, and commodities like Bitcoin and other assets. He believes that grey areas in the financial market should be removed, and having one regulator would help the United States achieve this. “This would simplify compliance for market participants, especially as financial products increasingly blur the lines between securities and commodities,” he said. The United States in a competitive global crypto market John E. Deaton also mentioned the need for the United States to step up its regulatory clarity, highlighting the competitive global crypto market. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) could be the mouthpiece and advocate achieving the much-needed merger. Aside from the merger providing clear and precise regulations in the market, it could also help the country cut costs by reducing funds allocated to them. The new merger would also assure crypto investors and firms alike of a new dawn in the country. With the pro-crypto Paul Atkins set to replace the outgoing Gary Gensler as SEC Chair, there is already optimism in the country about the direction of the crypto sector under the new administration. Adding the merger of these two organizations would only bolster that optimism, helping the industry in the long run. John E. Deaton also touched on the payment sector, noting that it is another area that needs work. He highlighted the federal agencies overseeing the payment sector, pointing out that there are over a dozen. With a unified agency, which would bring about a unified regulatory framework, these agencies would be streamlined to achieve more efficiency. He used XRP as an example, noting that the FinCEN said it was a virtual currency in 2015, only for the SEC to say it was a security years later. This is not the first advocacy for a joint relationship between the SEC and CFTC, with Congressman John Rose submitting a proposal to foster collaboration between both bodies on September 12. In the ‘Bridging Regulation and Innovation for Digital Global and Electronic Digital Assets Act,’ the committee will involve experts, and users to help the agencies streamline laws that will enable efficient use of blockchain technology and consumer protection. The committee will comprise 20 members of non-government staff and a representative of the SEC and CFTC. The meetings will be twice annually, with their recommendations requiring public input to foster transparency.

From decentralized exchanges and hardware wallets to social media accounts and entire blockchain networks, hackers have targeted some of the industry’s most trusted platforms. These attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities that have remained hidden, raising questions about the true security of the crypto space. The dangers are more alarming than ever! Read on to know more. Clober DEX Suffers Major Reentrancy Attack A reentrancy attack recently targeted Clober’s decentralized exchange liquidity vault on the Base Network. The hackers exploited the Rebalancer smart contract’s _burn() method, making off with 133.7 ETH, valued at over $501,000. This attack shows us the ongoing threats faced by decentralized exchanges and their users, emphasizing the need for stronger security protocols. URGENT: Security Breach Alert We regret to inform our community that the Clober Liquidity Vault has been compromised in a security breach. We want to reassure our users that the Clober protocol itself is unaffected, and all core functionalities continue to operate… — Clober | Fully on-chain CLOB DEX (@CloberDEX) December 10, 2024 Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hacked The official X account of the Cardano Foundation was hacked, resulting in unauthorized posts being made from the account. While no funds were lost, the incident raised significant concerns about the safety of social media accounts linked to cryptocurrency projects. The foundation quickly urged followers to disregard any posts during the investigation. The Cardano Foundation X account @Cardano_CF has been compromised. Please ignore any posts from the account at this time while we address this. — Cardano Community (@Cardano) December 8, 2024 Ledger Nano S Wallet Hack: A $2.5 Million Theft A Reddit user recently claimed that hackers stole $2.5 million in digital currencies from their Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, 10 Bitcoin, and $1.5 million in NFTs. Though the user encrypted the seed phrase and avoided the unsafe transactions, he said that the hacking happened after two months when the wallet was idle. Charles Guillemet, CTO of Ledger, responded by reiterating that phishing scams remain a significant threat. He also reminded users that Ledger never asks for private account information, urging vigilance in protecting sensitive data. Dogecoin Network Hit by ‘DogeReaper’ Attack A major vulnerability called “DogeReaper” was exploited to launch a damaging attack on the Dogecoin network. As a result, 69% of active nodes were brought offline, dropping the number of active nodes from 647 to 205, before partially recovering to 331. Although centralized exchanges and custodians remained unaffected, this attack revealed serious concerns about the decentralization and resilience of the network, raising questions about its long-term stability. India Cracks Down on Gate.io Exchange The Indian government recently took action by shutting down access to the Gate.io cryptocurrency exchange, affecting a large number of users. The exchange has yet to issue an official statement, but this move highlights the growing regulatory pressure on the crypto industry in India, which could significantly impact crypto trading for Indian citizens in the future. WallStreetBets X Wallet Hack: $2.2 Million Stolen WallStreetBets X’s digital wallets were hacked and the attackers made away with an estimated $2.2M in meme coins of various types: $1.43M PNUT tokens, $400K ZEREBRO tokens, and $130K ALCH tokens. The exploit was about passkey weaknesses present in the mobile application of X. The post revealed that, sometimes, clicking on links in social media can be risky especially those offering at prices which seem to be too good to be true.

Warren shared her decision in a heartfelt December 13 X post , describing her departure as bittersweet. While stepping down, Warren will continue to contribute as Senior Global Policy Officer to support the organization during its leadership transition. Ji Kim, CCI’s current chief legal officer, will assume the role of acting CEO. Under Warren’s stewardship, the CCI became a prominent voice advocating for balanced cryptocurrency regulations worldwide. Reflecting on her tenure, Warren expressed optimism about the industry’s future, particularly in the U.S., where regulatory clarity remains a crucial goal. “I am confident that CCI will achieve a smart regulatory outcome in Washington,” she stated, referencing the organization’s success in shaping crypto policy in other global markets. Changing Dynamics in Crypto Regulation Warren’s announcement coincides with a pivotal period in U.S. cryptocurrency policy. As the industry navigates post-FTX challenges and heightened regulatory scrutiny, there is growing anticipation that the upcoming administration, led by Donald Trump, may adopt a more favorable stance toward digital assets. Trump has already signaled a pro-crypto agenda by nominating Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner and vocal advocate for transparency and investor protection, to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Known for his stringent approach to crypto oversight, Gensler’s departure on Jan. 20, 2025, leads to many expecting potential turning point for the industry. Warren herself acknowledged the transformative nature of the past three years, describing the crypto industry as being in a “different era” compared to when she first joined CCI. Optimism for a Pro-Crypto Future Industry leaders have expressed hope that Trump’s administration will spur the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain innovations. As Warren steps back from her role, her legacy at CCI underscores the importance of advocating for fair and pragmatic crypto regulations. With new leadership at both the CCI and SEC, the industry also stands at the cusp of potentially significant regulatory and technological progress.

37629481,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627365,1734175197,xAI to rollout smarter Grok chatbot on X,"xAI, the artificial intelligence startup led by Elon Musk, announced significant updates to its flagship chatbot, Grok, and other AI offerings, signaling the company’s drive to expand its footprint in the AI industry. On the eve of December 13, the company revealed that it has begun rolling out an upgraded version of its Grok 2 chatbot model to users on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk also owns. According to a report from TechCrunch, the enhanced Grok is “three times faster” than its predecessor and boasts “improved accuracy, instruction-following, and multilingual capabilities.” X gains a faster Grok model and a new ‘Grok button’ https://t.co/QZCKleQagD — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) December 14, 2024 Grok leverages the X platform to deliver real-time insights by integrating web search and citations. These features allow the AI model to draw from posts on X and broader internet sources, providing timely and context-rich responses to user queries. The chatbot will also reportedly integrate a new “Grok button” on X, which aims to help users explore trending discussions, gain deeper insights into current events, and find relevant context. Grok AI announces API changes In addition to the consumer-facing updates, xAI announced major changes to its enterprise API. Two new Grok models have been introduced, featuring improved efficiency and enhanced multilingual capabilities. As a result, the company has reduced pricing for API usage, slashing input token costs from $5 to $2 per million tokens and output token costs from $15 to $10 per million tokens. Each token corresponds to approximately four characters of text. The upgraded API will also soon include xAI’s image generation model, Aurora . Aurora debuted on X this month as part of the Grok chatbot experience. It offers users a largely unfiltered image-generation capability, further expanding xAI’s creative tools. xAI launched its API back in August, fulfilling a promise to make its generative AI capabilities available to developers. Currently, the API is in a relatively basic stage, featuring a single model, “grok-beta.” The initial offering is priced at $5 per million input tokens, equivalent to approximately 750,000 words, and $15 per million output tokens. Tokens represent units of raw data, such as the syllables “fan,” “tas,” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.” On December 6, X announced that users no longer need to subscribe to X Premium to access Grok. Instead, the platform introduced a freemium model, granting all users ten free chatbot prompts every two hours. Asked @Grok to draw a picture of @GaryGensler . Very flattering, I think! https://t.co/NJnAj1nKIS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 12, 2024 Freemium X users can also generate up to ten images in the same period, though they are limited to analyzing three images per day unless they subscribe. This move marks a shift from Grok’s earlier availability, which was restricted to X Premium subscribers paying $8 per month or $84 annually. Integration with X and the broader AI Ecosystem Grok’s updates outline its developer’s xAI strategy of leveraging the X platform’s social media ecosystem to enhance its AI capabilities. The AI model draws its info from real-time data and user-generated content on X to differentiate itself from traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained datasets. This integration positions Grok as a dynamic tool for navigating and understanding live events, trending topics, and nuanced discussions. Moreover, Aurora complements Grok by enabling users to create visual content. Its upcoming inclusion in the API echoes xAI’s commitment to offering a comprehensive suite of AI tools that cater to diverse user needs, from textual analysis to creative design. xAI’s recent updates place it in direct competition with established players like OpenAI and Anthropic. The introduction of multilingual capabilities and efficiency gains could help position Grok as a viable alternative to competitors like ChatGPT and Claude. The pricing adjustments for API usage reflect xAI’s commitment to attracting enterprise customers who seek cost-effective solutions.

37629274,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393163,1734174952,From Bitcoin to the ‘Next Big Thing’: December 2024’s Blockchain Shake-Up,"The post From Bitcoin to the ‘Next Big Thing’: December 2024’s Blockchain Shake-Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For over a decade, Bitcoin has dominated the blockchain narrative, serving as the gateway to the world of decentralized finance and digital assets. But as the crypto market matures, new projects are stepping into the spotlight, offering innovative solutions to long-standing challenges. This December, the blockchain world is buzzing with speculation about a “next big thing” poised to disrupt the industry and shake up the status quo. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Could December 2024 mark the beginning of a new chapter in blockchain evolution? Let’s explore the landscape and what this mysterious contender might bring to the table. Bitcoin’s Legacy: The Original Disruptor Bitcoin revolutionized finance by introducing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system free from centralized control. Its impact as a store of value and a hedge against inflation cannot be overstated. Despite its strengths, Bitcoin’s limitations have become increasingly apparent: Energy Usage: Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining mechanism consumes massive amounts of energy, raising environmental concerns. Scalability Issues: The network struggles with high fees and slow transaction times, making it less practical for everyday use. Limited Use Cases: Bitcoin’s design prioritizes security and simplicity over versatility, limiting its application beyond digital gold. These factors have opened the door for newer, more versatile projects to capture market share and address unmet needs. The Search For the ‘Next Big Thing’ In recent years, Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchain platforms have gained significant traction by expanding on Bitcoin’s foundation. However, as users and developers demand more scalability, sustainability, and innovation, a new contender seems ready to take the stage. This project, shrouded in mystery, has crypto enthusiasts speculating that it could redefine what’s possible in the blockchain space. What’s Driving The Buzz? Next-Gen Consensus Mechanism: Reports suggest the use of a groundbreaking system that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining decentralization and security. AI Integration: This new blockchain reportedly bridges artificial intelligence and decentralized technology, unlocking smarter applications and decision-making tools. Scalability Without Layer 2: Unlike Ethereum, which relies on additional scaling layers, this project is said to deliver native scalability for high transaction volumes. Inclusivity: A design that ensures fair participation by rewarding meaningful contributions rather than just computational power or staking capacity. These features align with the evolving demands of the blockchain ecosystem, positioning the project as a strong contender for widespread adoption. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Why December 2024 Is Pivotal Timing is everything in the crypto world, and December 2024 appears to be the perfect moment for a shake-up. The industry is reaching a critical juncture: Environmental Focus: Increasing scrutiny on energy usage means greener blockchains are in high demand. Mainstream Adoption: As more enterprises and governments explore blockchain solutions, the need for scalable, efficient, and versatile platforms has never been greater. Investor Interest: With institutional investors diversifying into crypto, the spotlight is on projects that offer both innovation and stability. A new project with the right features could seize the moment and establish itself as the market’s next leader. What This Means For The Crypto Market If the speculation proves true, this project could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance and set a new standard for blockchain technology. By addressing issues like scalability and energy efficiency while introducing cutting-edge AI integration, it could attract developers, investors, and businesses looking for a platform built for the future. Potential Impacts: New Use Cases: The combination of blockchain and AI could unlock applications in fields like healthcare, logistics, and predictive analytics. Increased Competition: Established players like Ethereum and Solana may need to innovate further to keep up. Mainstream Adoption: User-friendly design and eco-conscious architecture could drive adoption among non-technical users and institutions. From Bitcoin’s emergence as digital gold to Ethereum’s innovation in smart contracts, the crypto market has been shaped by transformative moments. December 2024 could be the next milestone, as the blockchain industry braces for the arrival of a project that combines sustainability, scalability, and cutting-edge technology. Whether you’re an investor, developer, or blockchain enthusiast, now is the time to pay attention. The crypto world is poised for a shake-up, and the ‘next big thing’ could be just around the corner.

37630898,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52156,1734174951,"Forget Whether You Caught or Missed Ripple (XRP), Analysts Say These are the 5 Coins You Should be Focused on Now","It has been quite an eventful year for Ripple (XRP) as their court cases alongside currency value fluctuations have gotten the whole crypto space talking about them, making a lot of investors question whether it is time to look for other growing assets in the market. For all the latecomers, XRP sure did come back from devastation, however, some analysts are looking at five potential coins that seem to be gaining traction and would be worthwhile in the near future. It is safe to say that out of all the top five candidates, Cardano (ADA), Sui (SUI), Bonk (BONK), Sei (SEI), and Rexas Finance (RXS), Rexas Finance is one of the bigger bets for exponential growth. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Underdog That Ended Up Making It Big Today, Rexas Finance is one of the most highly discussed tokens, and for a good reason as well. Rexas has already sold over 335 million tokens and raised an astonishing $27 million, which is staggering for a presale price of $0.15. What makes them unique is their approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Through this, a significantly larger number of individuals can invest in traditionally difficult-to-access markets by letting them allocate fractions of high-value assets like real estate and fine art.What differentiates Rexas from its competitors is its well-rounded ecosystem. Rexas provides tools such as Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder, which enable tokenization of assets and let developers build and market blockchain projects. Furthermore, it’s CertiK audited, which adds security, while its presence on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko adds trust. Recently, the project announced an ongoing giveaway worth $1 million, in which 20 selected investors are expected to get $50,000 each in RXS tokens, raising interest in the project even further. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain Veteran Cardano is arguably one of the most successful blockchain projects. It remains faithful to its academic approach and focus on sustainability. The introduction of Hydra, the second-layer scaling solution, places Cardano in a better position to handle a higher volume of transactions at low costs. Cardano’s steady growth has created a strong base of investors, and its emphasis on practical applications, such as collaborations in education or agriculture, enables it to survive in a saturated market. ADA is now trading at $1.12 as of this writing, and analysts expect the gains to be modest as it continues to strengthen its ecosystem. Sui (SUI): Explosive Growth and Scalability Sui recently has emerged as a blockchain that can handle a large number of transactions at affordable rates. It was developed by ex-Facebook engineers and it uses the Move programming language that allows the development of secure and scalable applications. At the current price of $3.96 as of this writing, Sui promises unrivaled effectiveness and has positioned itself as a competitor to Solana. Its user-friendly tools and strong infrastructure have made it a developer favorite. Its huge potential for mass adaptation certainly makes it one of the major coins to look out for during the next bull run. Bonk (BONK): Not Your Ordinary Memecoin Bonk is a community-driven memecoin that’s built on Solana. It was created to serve as an alternative coin to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Bonk has a very big community due to the constant airdrops in the past, during which early investors were rewarded for holding Bonk tokens. Bonk is currently trading at $0.00004261 and has a market cap of $3.22 billion, according to Coinmarketcap. Over the past month, Bonk has gained over 91.56%, which shows that it has attracted the attention of investors. Sei (SEI): The Next Step In The Evolution Of Decentralized Finance Sei is a layer-one blockchain focusing solely on decentralized finance (deFi) applications. Sei, with its cutting-edge technology, promises to execute transactions efficiently and faster than other traditional chains. Currently valued at $0.63 as of this writing, Sei has been on a growth trajectory owing to its relations with top deFi networks. With the growth of the DeFi market, the lending protocol is suited well to gain a lot of traction owing to its compatibility with other blockchains around the globe. Why Rexas is the Best Pick Of the five coins highlighted above, Rexas Finance is the best investment opportunity as it has the most advancement and room for growth. It’s not that coins such as Cardano and Sui do not have promise, but they are built on already established systems. Rexas, conversely, is about disrupting the space as it enters the market, effectively blending traditional finance with blockchain, which is a true game changer. Analysts think that it won’t take less than a month after the currency is listed to exceed $1, making the early adopters gain over 7x their initial investment. Unlike the speculative nature of some altcoins, strong fundamentals and real-world use of Rexas set it up to thrive over the long term. Conclusion Markets will always mature, and in the coming wave of the crypto market, alts and diversification in trading strategies will be key to maximizing all returns. Even though Ripple has had its moment in the market, the other projects that stand to take over the dominance of the crypto world are Rexas Finance, Sui, and Sei, focusing on driving innovations and expanding what blockchain technology can extend into using its capabilities. As an investor, if you are preparing for the next bull run, then placing your bets on these emerging tokens will be a smart decision. Among them, Rexas Finance is the front runner alongside opportunities for short-term and long-term gain.

37629204,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393159,1734174803,Has Bitcoin Reached Its Peak? What’s Next for Crypto in 2024,"The post Has Bitcoin Reached Its Peak? What’s Next for Crypto in 2024 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Bitcoin has made a historic milestone crossing $100k this month, the market is happy as well as skeptical. Crossing this psychological resistance is a great achievement, but would it be possible for BTC to move forward or is it exhausted for the season? There are many questions looming around for the future of crypto. From bold government proposals to shifts in market trends, the crypto space is buzzing with developments that could shape what happens next. Let’s take a closer look at what’s unfolding and why these changes matter more than ever. Huge Achievement, Global Impact Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is not just a price milestone—it shows how much cryptocurrency has grown. But there’s more to the story. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently proposed a plan for a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , which would involve acquiring 1 million BTC—about 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Why does this matter? If the U.S. moves forward with this plan, it could change how governments worldwide view Bitcoin. However, experts warn that such a big move could cause short-term market instability. Large actions like this come with risks. Bitcoin Dominance Drops, Altcoins Gain Ground Even though Bitcoin is hitting new highs, its share of the total market has dropped to 55.2%, a decline of over 7% in just a month. This is opening the door for altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, which are all starting to gain more attention. XRP has reclaimed its spot as the third-largest crypto, and Solana (SOL) has moved up to fifth place on CoinMarketCap. But experts caution that altcoin season won’t happen overnight. The market is still volatile, and altcoins will face challenges before they can take off. The road ahead could be rocky, but it’s one to watch. Bitcoin Remains a Strong Investment Despite the rise of altcoins, Bitcoin remains a favorite among institutional investors. It’s increasingly being seen as digital gold, and analysts from VanEck predict that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 in this market cycle. This shows that Bitcoin is becoming more recognized as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin-focused ETFs are also seeing significant investment. It’s been a long journey from ETF approval delays to having Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs up and running. Source : Sosovalue The introduction of options on Bitcoin ETFs has added more positivity to the market. More cryptocurrencies are also preparing for their chance to tap into similar funding opportunities. Good Buying Opportunity? Short-term price drops could work in favor of larger investors. A dip below $100,000 might be seen as the ideal moment to buy more Bitcoin. This confidence shows how Bitcoin is becoming a bigger part of the global financial system. What to Expect Next Looking ahead, analysts predict Bitcoin might drop 20-30% before it rallies again. While this may seem like a setback, it could present an opportunity for long-term investors to get in at a better price. As for altcoins, patience is key. Cryptos like Ethereum and Solana are gaining traction, but it won’t be an overnight change. The market is still volatile, and that’s likely to continue for some time. Finally, the U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve proposal could shake up the market. If it moves forward, it may change the market in ways we can’t fully predict yet.

37628933,https://finbold.com/?p=219435,1734174303,"ChatGPT says Cardano (ADA) price will hit this target by December 31, 2024","As Cardano ( ADA ) attempts to maintain its price above the $1 support , OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o has offered several scenarios for the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) asset on the last day of 2024. Notably, ADA is among the notable beneficiaries of the current cryptocurrency market rally , having broken out from a prolonged consolidation below $1. This surge was partly inspired by the post-election optimism following Donald Trump’s re-election. Trump is anticipated to spearhead the rollout of crypto-friendly regulations. ChatGPT predicts ADA’s price for December 31 Looking ahead, ChatGPT noted that heading into the final day of 2024, the value of ADA will likely be influenced by market sentiment, technologica l developments, investor behavior, and broader economic trends. To this end, the AI tool pointed out that ADA will likely trade between $1.25 and $1.40 in a bullish scenario on December 31. The high target reflects a growth of about 26% from the current valuation. ChatGPT predicted that ADA would trade around $1.10 to $1.15 in a neutral situation, where the current market conditions remain stable. However, if the cryptocurrency sector experiences bearish sentiments, the AI tool foresees Cardano dropping below $1 by December 31. ADA price prediction for December 31, 2024. Source: ChatGPT ADA’s key fundamentals Several fundamental and technical indicators support a possible short-term price increase for ADA, with whale accumulation standing out. According to data from prominent cryptocurrency on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, on December 12, whales accumulated over 80 million ADA tokens within 48 hours. ADA whale transactions chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts The data indicates that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion ADA are behind this recent uptick in buying. Whale movements have historically signaled pivotal moments, often preceding upward price momentum or strategic accumulation phases. At the same time, according to crypto on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock , as of December 14, a significant share of ADA holders are in profit , a factor likely to influence selling activity. ADA holders making money at current price. Source: IntoTheBlock Indeed, 67% of holders are in profit, with 9% breaking even and 24% at a loss. With a significant number of investors in profit, ADA is likely to have strong support, as investors are less likely to sell, supporting possible continued momentum. However, profit-taking could slow momentum if the price stalls. Meanwhile, the ADA community will likely be banking on Cardano network developments for a possible boost. For instance, the community is anticipating the full impact of Cardano’s ‘Chang’ upgrade, which shifts governance to ADA holders through voting and elected representatives. The upgrade introduced a decentralized structure, transferring upgrade authority from founding entities to user-led groups. This move will likely enhance ADA’s utility and align with its decentralization goals. ADA price analysis ADA was trading at $1.10 by press time, gaining over 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Over the past month, the asset has rallied 94%. ADA one-month price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding the next price movement, a cryptocurrency trading analyst with the pseudonym CryptooELITES , in an X post on December 12, observed that ADA has broken out of a multi-year downtrend, signaling strong bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency’s technical setup shows that ADA has formed a bullish cup-and-handle pattern , which indicates a continuation of the upward trend. ADA price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In this case, ADA’s move above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $1.73 points to growing investor confidence. Further targets include $2.50 and $3.00, representing significant psychological and technical milestones, with $6.00 aligning with the 1.272 Fibonacci extension—a key indicator for measuring projected price movement beyond previous highs. Should this momentum persist, the analyst believes a bull market end goal of $12 remains a realistic target. For now, attention is focused on how ADA will interact with the $1 support level, as a drop below this point could signal trouble for the asset.

37628913,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393145,1734174251,SpacePay: Zero Equipment Cost and Instant Settlements Make Local Stores Switch To Crypto,"The post SpacePay: Zero Equipment Cost and Instant Settlements Make Local Stores Switch To Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A local store owner spends thousands of dollars a year just to rent credit card machines while waiting up to three days to access money from weekend sales. These equipment costs and payment delays create real problems—from delayed supplier payments to missed inventory deals. Meanwhile, customers increasingly ask to pay with crypto, but fears about price swings and complex setups keep merchants hesitant. SpacePay addresses these common frustrations by turning existing payment screens into crypto-ready terminals. It has also raised over $700,000 from investors who see how this solution helps real businesses. The platform changes standard Android-based card machines into complete payment terminals that handle both traditional and crypto transactions. When customers pay using any of the 325+ supported wallets, merchants receive their local currency instantly—no equipment costs, no settlement delays, and no crypto price risks. Traditional Payment Systems Vs. Spacepay: The Real Cost Difference Standard payment equipment creates a heavy financial burden for small businesses. A typical retail store pays $600-1,200 per card terminal annually in rental fees. For businesses needing multiple terminals, these costs multiply quickly. Add monthly maintenance fees, software updates, and replacement costs, and stores often spend over $3,000 yearly just to accept card payments. SpacePay eliminates these equipment expenses entirely. Store owners keep their current Android-based payment screens, which now handle both card and crypto payments through a free software update. Switching to SpacePay instantly saves store owners thousands in annual fixed costs. The platform’s 0.5% transaction fee replaces the traditional 3.5% rate, creating additional savings on every sale. The impact becomes clearer when looking at monthly transactions. A store processing $20,000 monthly pays $700 in traditional card fees (3.5%). With SpacePay, the same sales volume costs just $100 (0.5%). Combined with eliminated equipment costs, a business could save over $10,000 annually. These savings help stores invest in growth, improve inventory, or simply increase their profit margins. Why Three-day Settlement Delays Hurt Local Business Payment delays create real problems for small business cash flow. When a store processes card payments on Friday, traditional systems hold that money until Wednesday. During busy seasons like holidays, these delays trap thousands of dollars that businesses need for daily operations. Holiday periods make these delays even more challenging. Consider a toy store during December – their biggest sales days happen just before the holidays, but three-day settlement times mean they can’t access this money for restocking during the crucial shopping period. Many stores resort to expensive short-term loans or credit cards to bridge these payment gaps. SpacePay changes this dynamic with instant settlements. When customers pay with any supported crypto wallet, merchants receive their local currency immediately in their account. This immediate availability of funds helps businesses operate more efficiently and take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. Protection From Crypto Price Changes: How It Works Price protection forms the core of SpacePay’s merchant-first approach. When a customer pays in crypto, SpacePay locks the local currency value instantly. For example, if someone buys a $50 meal using Bitcoin, the restaurant receives exactly $50 in their account – regardless of what happens to Bitcoin’s price afterward. This protection removes the biggest worry that keeps merchants from accepting digital currencies. The system works through automatic real-time conversion. Let’s walk through a real transaction: A customer scans the QR code to buy a $75 shirt using Ethereum. At that moment, SpacePay checks current market rates and locks in the $75 value. Even if Ethereum’s price drops 10% during the next hour, the store still gets their full $75. This price locking happens invisibly in the background, requiring no action from the merchant or customer. With SpacePay’s instant conversion, shop owners now confidently accept any of the 325+ supported cryptocurrencies, knowing they’ll receive the exact sale amount in their local currency. The platform handles all market calculations, leaving merchants free to focus on their business. The technology behind this protection creates true risk-free crypto acceptance. A café can sell a $5 coffee for $5, without worrying about cryptocurrency markets or exchange rates. This simplicity helps merchants expand their payment options while maintaining stable pricing and predictable income. Becoming A Part Of Spacepay’s Journey As the platform raises over $700,000 in presale funding , new supporters can join at $0.002315 per SPY token. The investment process starts at SpacePay’s official website , where investors connect their crypto wallets. The platform accepts payments in USDT, AVAX, BASE, MATIC, ETH, and BNB. Those new to crypto can purchase directly with bank cards, making entry accessible to everyone. SpacePay helps in removing payment barriers that help local businesses compete in the digital economy. Store owners can now actively participate in SpacePay’s community, sharing insights with other merchants considering the switch. Current investors gain early access to a platform that’s actively solving real business problems.

A local store owner spends thousands of dollars a year just to rent credit card machines while waiting up to three days to access money from weekend sales. These equipment costs and payment delays create real problems—from delayed supplier payments to missed inventory deals. Meanwhile, customers increasingly ask to pay with crypto, but fears about price swings and complex setups keep merchants hesitant. SpacePay addresses these common frustrations by turning existing payment screens into crypto-ready terminals. It has also raised over $700,000 from investors who see how this solution helps real businesses. The platform changes standard Android-based card machines into complete payment terminals that handle both traditional and crypto transactions. When customers pay using any of the 325+ supported wallets, merchants receive their local currency instantly—no equipment costs, no settlement delays, and no crypto price risks. Traditional Payment Systems Vs. Spacepay: The Real Cost Difference Standard payment equipment creates a heavy financial burden for small businesses. A typical retail store pays $600-1,200 per card terminal annually in rental fees. For businesses needing multiple terminals, these costs multiply quickly. Add monthly maintenance fees, software updates, and replacement costs, and stores often spend over $3,000 yearly just to accept card payments. SpacePay eliminates these equipment expenses entirely. Store owners keep their current Android-based payment screens, which now handle both card and crypto payments through a free software update. Switching to SpacePay instantly saves store owners thousands in annual fixed costs. The platform’s 0.5% transaction fee replaces the traditional 3.5% rate, creating additional savings on every sale.

He talked about AI’s transformative potential to become “unpredictable” while highlighting its challenges and implications. Sutskever, speaking at the NeurIPS conference on Friday, explored the concept of “superintelligent AI,” which he defined as systems surpassing human capabilities in a wide array of tasks. OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever believes superintelligent AI will be ‘unpredictable’ https://t.co/vLHmqwQOJQ — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) December 14, 2024 He predicted that such systems would be qualitatively different from today’s AI and, in some respects, unrecognizable. According to Sutskever, these advanced systems will possess self-awareness, a level of reasoning, and the ability to understand complex scenarios from limited data. “ [Superintelligent] systems are actually going to be agentic in a real way, ” he said, contrasting them with current AI, which he described as only “very slightly agentic.” Sutskever: Current AI models are limited Receiving a “Test of Time” award at the conference, Sutskever acknowledged the limitations of pre-training models like those used in OpenAI’s ChatGPT. While current systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities, he warned that the finite nature of internet data is becoming a bottleneck. Full @ilyasut TALK! about Pre-training is dead and more pic.twitter.com/PigZVvcEGB — Diego | AI 🚀 – e/acc (@diegocabezas01) December 14, 2024 Sutskever proposed alternative approaches, including AI systems generating their own data or refining their responses to enhance accuracy. These innovations, he suggested, could help overcome existing limitations. The OpenAI co-founder also touched on the ethical implications of superintelligent AI, including the potential for such systems to demand rights. “ It’s not a bad end result if you have AIs, and all they want is to co-exist with us and just to have rights, ” he remarked. However, he emphasized the inherent unpredictability of agentic and self-aware AI, presenting both opportunities and challenges for developers and regulators. OpenAI CEO Altman predicts disruption and the advent of AGI Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared similar views with Sutskever about the ceiling of superintelligent AI performances. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, Altman outlined his vision for artificial general intelligence (AGI). He predicted that AGI-AI systems capable of performing complex tasks with human-like reasoning—could become a reality as early as 2025. “ I think it’s possible … in 2025 we will have systems that we look at … and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected, ’” Altman said. Altman compared the potential impact of AI to the invention of the transistor, which revolutionized industries and economies worldwide. He described a future where this will be “shockingly capable.” “ AI models become widely available and are used across industries for various applications. “AI itself, the reasoning engine, will become commoditized ,” Altman opined, suggesting that its integration into everyday life will be as transformative as past technological breakthroughs. During his appearance, Altman highlighted ChatGPT’s widespread adoption, revealing that the AI tool now has more than 300 million weekly users. He acknowledged ongoing debates about its safety but maintained that the iterative development and deployment approach has been crucial. “ There are definitely people who think ChatGPT is not sufficiently safe, ” he said but noted that OpenAI believes early adoption when the stakes are lower is vital for gradual improvement. Altman’s emphasis on safety echoed the industry concerns about responsible AI development. He acknowledged that while ChatGPT is “now generally considered by most of society to be acceptably safe and acceptably robust,” continued refinement and oversight remain priorities. Reflections on leadership and OpenAI’s evolution Altman’s leadership journey has played a pivotal role in shaping OpenAI’s trajectory. Co-founding the organization in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, he aimed to advance AI technologies for the benefit of humanity. Before joining OpenAI full-time in 2019, Altman served as president of Y Combinator, a leading startup accelerator, from 2014 to 2019. OpenAI transitioned from its nonprofit origins to a capped-profit model to secure the funding needed for large-scale AI projects. Under Altman’s leadership, the company launched ChatGPT and DALL-E, which have reshaped the AI landscape. However, the journey has not been without challenges. In November 2023, Altman was briefly ousted from his role by the OpenAI board over concerns related to his communication with board members. The dispute, which unfolded publicly, concluded with Altman’s reinstatement less than a week later, as the board claimed they were now on “good terms” with the CEO.

Stock exchange operator Nasdaq announced on November 13 that MicroStrategy (MSTR) and two other firms will be the latest additions to the index fund.The Nasdaq 100 index comprises 100 of the largest non-financial firms by market cap listed on the Nasdaq exchange market. Notably, Nasdaq reviews the funds' components every year, shuffling participants based on market performance.MicroStrategy Joins an Elite GroupThe fund’s reconstruction will take effect on December 23, and MicroStrategy will join an elite group of non-financial companies. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy's inauguration into the Nasdaq 100 index automatically includes it in the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund managing $325 billion in assets boasting a larger reach to market investors.With a broader market reach, MicroStrategy could leverage its growing relevance to penetrate more markets and raise capital to buy Bitcoin. Notably, the software development company has indiscriminately leveraged several debt vehicles from the fixed-income market to grow its Bitcoin exposure.Meanwhile, firms are beginning to mimic the MicroStrategy playbook, with crypto miner Marathon Digital (MARA) and Japanese Metaplanet adopting the strategy. Furthermore, MicroStrategy’s growing Bitcoin exposure has spurred a sixfold stock upsurge year-to-date, contributing to its increasing market traction.Short-Lived Listing?MicroStrategy’s position in the Nasdaq 100 will be up for contention by the March 2025 reclassification event. The exchange will reevaluate the company's benchmark on the said date due to its growing Bitcoin stash. Data from the Saylor tracker shows that MicroStrategy holds $43 billion worth of Bitcoin, its latest 21,550 BTC acquisition occurring recently. As a result, MicroStrategy’s growing Bitcoin holdings and yield strategy could lead to its classification as a financial company and immediate removal from the Nasdaq 100 index.In the meantime, MicroStrategy will maximize its entry into the fund and aggressively pursue its endgame .

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-bonk-and-dogecoin-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37628991,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52147,1734173337,Analyst Foresees XRP Crashing to $1.5 and $0.5. Here Are the Timelines,"XRP’s price trajectory is raising concerns among analysts, with The Block Bull, a well-regarded market observer, forecasting a sharp decline. He suggests the cryptocurrency may revisit its November 2024 lows in the coming weeks, driven by broader market instability and XRP’s failure to sustain its recent bullish momentum. The current bearish sentiment has been exacerbated by the consolidation phase XRP entered following its meteoric rise earlier this month. On December 3, XRP surged to a seven-year high of $2.9, achieving a remarkable 105% increase in just eight days. However, the rally encountered stiff resistance, resulting in a dramatic pullback. While XRP managed to recover from this steep drop, it has not been able to retest its $2.9 peak, instead stabilizing between $2 and $2.5 with occasional dips below $2. XRP Could Begin Its Downtrend Today The Block Bull warned that XRP’s decline might begin imminently. After issuing his analysis on December 12, XRP ended the day with an over 2% loss, halting a winning streak from December 10. Although the cryptocurrency displayed minor resilience the following morning by trading flat, the analyst remains pessimistic about its mid-term outlook. He predicts XRP could drop to $1.50 as early as next week. This is particularly significant as XRP has maintained a price above $1.50 since surpassing that level on November 29. The analyst further expects that this support level will not hold, anticipating a deeper decline to $0.50 by the end of the year. For context, XRP struggled to maintain the $0.50 price range in 2022 and 2023 before breaking above it in November 2024. A return to $0.50 would mark a 79% decrease from current levels. Crucial Support Levels and Historical Precedents At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.44, hovering above its critical support level of $2.20. The Block Bull emphasized that losing this support could trigger a cascade of sell-offs, with $1.50 as the next notable target. However, he cautioned that $1.50 is a weak support level, making a further drop to $0.50 increasingly likely. The analyst noted similarities with XRP’s performance during its 2017 bull run. In March 2017, XRP surged 284% but experienced a 44% decline in early April before recovering to reach its all-time high of $3.30 later that year. A similar trajectory could unfold now, although the outcome remains uncertain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Differing Views Among Market Observers Despite the grim outlook, some XRP proponents remain optimistic. They argue that Ripple’s upcoming launch of its RLUSD stablecoin , evolving market conditions, and potential regulatory clarity under the incoming Donald Trump administration could support XRP’s value. The divergence in perspectives highlights the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s mid-term prospects. While some investors hope for a recovery fueled by Ripple’s developments, others, like The Block Bull, caution that market trends and historical patterns point to a potential downturn. As XRP trades close to its $2.20 support, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether the cryptocurrency can defy bearish projections or if a significant crash is indeed on the horizon.

37628369,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393079,1734173334,Meme Index: World’s First DAO-Governed Memecoin Index Launches With 4 Categories,"The post Meme Index: World’s First DAO-Governed Memecoin Index Launches With 4 Categories appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme Index has JUST launched its presale offering the world’s first decentralized meme coin index. Blending the standard meme coin baskets made popular recently thanks to VanEck and other major enterprises, and putting them in the decentralized zone, the Meme Index aims to revolutionize meme coin investment. Will it be enough to make it the next big crypto of 2025? Changing Meme Coin Investments for the Better with Indexes One of the biggest warning labels people receive when they get into meme coin investment is don’t put all your investments into a single meme crypto. This is a legitimate concern since the volatility of the market impacts these assets the most. However, diversifying isn’t easy. Most meme coins have a wildly different community, and their price movements can reflect that. So, if a meme coin spikes in value while the other crashes at the same time, while users may offset their losses, there is nothing to be gained. Indexes offer a better solution. Bundling multiple crypto assets of similar nature, they offer a more streamlined approach to investment. With Meme Index, this approach involves taking multiple meme coins of similar nature and putting them in a basket. The added element of versatility makes meme coin investment relatively safe. Meme Index accomplishes this by providing four categories of indexes. Titan Index This index contains tokens that are considered titans of the industry. That is, OG cryptos that have already made it to the top of the crypto charts. Because they have already gained an elevated status, their performance is similar to standard crypto assets. Take Pepe, for example. While the token has surged a lot since launch, when we look at its performance over the last six months, it has only risen by double digits, despite being very volatile. Due to its high-cap status, it might not experience a massive parabolic action soon, which makes it a relatively safe bet for most meme coin investors. Moonshot Index Next is the Moonshot index, and the tokens within this basket aim to topple the titan meme cryptos. These are also high-cap tokens but their market capitalization hasn’t reached the $1 billion mark. These assets are more volatile than high cap meme coins, but they have gone mainstream enough to gain people’s trust. Midcap Index This index is where a token’s volatility truly starts to show its face. These mid-cap assets have a market cap ranging between $50 million to $250 million, and they are trying to become the next big mainstream cryptos. The price action of these assets is immensely volatile, making most investors wary of them, but not enough to scare people away. Frenzy Index This index is for those who understand the risks and are not willing to forego the perks. This contains the most volatile tokens, ones that make it to the hottest pairs list on sites like Birdeye and Dextools, only to disappear the next day. Requiring constant attention and a degen mindset, these are the tokens that either make or break one’s wealth. What Makes Meme Index Different From Standard Memecoin Indices? The first quarter of 2024 saw the arrival of multiple meme coin indexes. WOO X, a tier-2 cryptocurrency exchange was the first to introduce a set of index perpetual contracts linked to meme coins. Days later VanEck, a prominent asset management firm, joined the meme coin frenzy by introducing a new index for popular meme coins. However, both of these entities are centralized, with the index rebalancing depending on a single authority. Security concerns and a lack of community participation further complicates matters, since there is no creativity behind their implementation. Meme Index offers the world’s first decentralized meme coin index. Completely within the control of the community, the project lets the community decide how the tokens are added to the index. That’s where MEMEX, the native token of the ecosystem, shows its unique attributes. Meme Index has been designed as a DAO project, letting the community govern the ecosystem. Holders of the MEMEX tokens can join this DAO and, along with voting on proposals about future updates, they also decide which tokens should be added to the index, and which tokens should be removed. It makes the act of rebalancing the indexes driven by community sentiment, which is the primary force behind a meme coin’s price action. This could result in investors being able to capture opportunities that logic-based, automated systems, cannot provide. Can MEMEX Explode? Now comes the big question. Can MEMEX explode? The answer to it lies in the multiple growth drivers. First aspect we have to look at is how the project is being marketed. Even though the texts on the Meme Index’s whitepaper show focus on utility, the imagery is still one of jokes. This is a positive, driving positive community sentiment that could make the token blow up in value. https://twitter.com/memecoin_index/status/1864710834074825143 Second crucial aspect is broader market dynamics, and the timing of the project’s launch. If the Meme Index concludes during a bull run, it could ride the bullish wave to pump in value. However, concluding the presale when the market has cooled down may not bring an explosive beginning for this token. Furthermore, how the indexes perform will also play a crucial role. If they can outperform centralized meme coin indexes, we may see people gravitating towards MEMEX’s decentralized offerings. This influx can also bring positive news for the MEMEX price action. Meme Index Raises $100K – Stage 1 Ending Soon Meme Index has raised more than $100k to date and the current stage will conclude shortly. So, investors have a limited window to buy MEMEX at a highly discounted price of $0.014056. Therefore, those looking to maximize their gains should act now.

37628642,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319465,1734173291,Sui Blockchain and Ant Digital Partner to Tokenize ESG Assets,"Sui, a Layer-1 blockchain, has announced a strategic partnership with Ant Digital, the technology arm of China’s Ant Group, to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) with a focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) assets. The first tokenized assets, referred to as “notes,” will be linked to a Chinese solar material manufacturer listed among the Fortune China Top 500, the firm said in a recent press release . Ant Digital, which operates independently from Ant Group as of April 2024, provides blockchain-based solutions through its brand ZAN. ZAN Offers Tools for Web3 Launched in September 2023, ZAN offers plug-and-play tools powered by the AntChain Open Labs TrustBase open-source stack. The product suite includes solutions for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, supporting the issuance and management of tokenized RWAs. The partnership builds on previous collaborations. In August, ZAN integrated with Mysten Labs, the original contributor to the Sui blockchain, by becoming a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) node operator. “We established our partnership in August and have now achieved another significant milestone. Sui is a star public chain dedicated to technology and value creation, with a rich ecosystem and diverse applications,” said Cobe Zhang, Head of Web3 Product at Ant Digital Technologies. “Looking ahead, we hope to continuously provide various advanced technical services to more RWA projects, especially in the new energy sector, and our technology can better support the development of the real economy.” Sui’s network has seen growing interest from prominent investors. In November, VanEck launched a Sui-based financial product, following a similar move by Grayscale in August. With nearly $2 billion in total value locked (TVL), Sui’s ecosystem continues to expand. On December 11, the blockchain announced an integration with Backpack Exchange, granting access to the non-custodial Backpack Wallet. The ESG tokenization trend aligns with broader initiatives in green finance. We’re excited to partner with @SuiNetwork to bring ESG-backed RWA assets onchain! Together, we’re unlocking access to ESG-backed green assets, pioneering tokenization with a focus on sustainability, scalability, and innovation. https://t.co/Dy5S5Ci7xG — ZAN (@zan_team) December 13, 2024 China’s involvement in the China-Singapore Green Finance Taskforce highlights its commitment to sustainable financial systems. Similar efforts are seen in Hong Kong, which recently issued tokenized green bonds worth 800 million Hong Kong dollars ($100 million) as part of its Green Bond Programme. Beyond China, tokenized ESG initiatives are gaining traction globally. PowerDime, an energy finance firm, operates a tokenized renewable energy trading platform on the Layer-1 Chintai blockchain, offering virtual wind and solar power purchase agreements. Tokenization Market Could Reach $16T by 2030 A report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) and Boston Consulting Group estimates the global value of tokenized illiquid assets will reach $16 trillion by 2030. Even more conservative estimates from Citigroup suggest that $4 trillion to $5 trillion worth of tokenized digital securities could be minted by 2030. Recognizing this potential, major companies are making significant moves in the tokenization space. Goldman Sachs, for instance, plans to launch three new tokenization products later this year, driven by growing client interest.

In a Dec. 13 complaint, BiT Global accused Coinbase of delisting wBTC to promote its own product, cbBTC. The move allegedly caused significant financial losses and damaged consumer confidence in wBTC. The lawsuit claims attempted monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act, predatory practices to undermine wBTC, and false statements suggesting wBTC failed to meet listing standards. Coinbase announced the token delisting on Nov. 19, citing undisclosed failures to meet its listing standards. A Coinbase spokesperson defended the decision, stating: “Coinbase is committed to maintaining the high integrity of our listing standards, and we regularly evaluate assets listed on our platform. Should an asset fail to meet those standards, it is delisted.” BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has been a joint custodian of wBTC reserves with BitGo since August. The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, alleges Coinbase favored memecoins while challenging wBTC’s compliance with listing standards. Attorney Kevin Kneupper stated, “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space. If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” The lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $1 billion and demands injunctive relief to prevent further harm. BiT Global claims Coinbase aimed to eliminate competition, stating: “It’s clear that Coinbase’s decision is an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, pushing forward their own wrapped Bitcoin product, cbBTC, and removing the largest and most influential competitor in wBTC.” Coinbase previously announced: “Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC on Dec. 19, 2024, on or around 12 pm ET.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/coinbase-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-over-wrapped-bitcoin-delisting/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37628641,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319461,1734172934,"GOP Majority Leader to Push For Crypto Market Bill in First 100 Days, Says Rep. Hill","The Republican Party is preparing to introduce a comprehensive crypto market structure bill within the first 100 days of the upcoming legislative session, according to Representative French Hill. Speaking on CNBC , Hill emphasized the urgent need for regulatory clarity in the U.S. crypto market, calling it a “top priority” for the GOP. Hill revealed that GOP Majority Leader Steve Scalise is leading the charge on the legislation, which aims to establish clear guidelines for the digital asset industry. Hill Slams Current Regulatory Approach Hill criticized the current regulatory approach under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. “We don’t have rules of the road. Under Chairman Gensler, we had just regulation by enforcement,” he said. “This is not helping America succeed, not helping technological advance, innovation for Web3, [or] the use of blockchain both in publicly traded companies and in financial services.” A formal market structure bill is seen as a potential game-changer for the U.S. crypto sector, which has long faced uncertainty due to a fragmented regulatory landscape. Proponents believe the bill could position the U.S. as a global hub for digital asset innovation and reduce the risk of crypto firms relocating to more favorable jurisdictions. Momentum for pro-crypto legislation has grown following the GOP’s strong performance in the November elections. Industry insiders are also optimistic due to the anticipated resignation of Gensler from the SEC, a move that could open the door to a more industry-friendly regulatory environment. After winning the House Financial Services Committee chairman position yesterday, @RepFrenchHill talks crypto, fintech and his top priorities for the new Congress: https://t.co/qdrdptSdEF — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) December 13, 2024 Earlier this year, Congress passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which proposed a regulatory framework for digital assets. However, the bill failed to clear the Senate. FIT21 sought to classify digital assets under the oversight of either the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) based on their level of decentralization. Adding to the industry’s optimism, President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering shifting crypto oversight to the CFTC, which could classify most digital assets as commodities if they meet certain criteria. Trump has also nominated pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair, citing Atkins’ role as co-chair of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance as a key reason for the appointment. US Crypto Owners Expect Less Regulation Cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump. Scott Hartman, co-chief of the securities and commodities task force at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, revealed that fewer resources will be allocated to policing cryptocurrency crimes. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players.

37628175,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627354,1734172781,What crypto and stock investors should watch out for next year,"Crypto is skyrocketing, stocks are hitting the ceiling, and everyone is drinking the same Kool-Aid: American exceptionalism. Despite inflationary policies, Trump’s return to the White House, and sky-high valuations, analysts still think the U.S. market is unbeatable. But cracks are starting to show. Katie Martin, Financial Times columnist, isn’t buying the hype. “Everyone’s saying the same thing,” she said . “And if something goes wrong with this narrative, everyone runs to the other side of the ship at the same time.” At an investment roundtable in London, financial giants tackled 2025’s biggest issues: Trump’s tariffs, stock market bubbles, crypto’s historic Bitcoin rally, and the ongoing regulatory nightmare. Experts from Schroders, Fidelity International, and the FT’s own columnists dissected every angle. Now let’s take a look. Wall Street is overconfident — and dangerously so Wall Street predicts the S&P 500 will climb to 6,630 by the end of 2025. That’s a modest 9.6% jump, fueled by strong economic activity, easing interest rates, and Trump’s pro-business agenda. But let’s not forget: these are the same experts who underestimated 2024. Back then, they predicted the S&P would close at 5,705. It surpassed that in September. Tom Lee from Fundstrat expects the index to hit 7,000 by midyear before cooling off. He calls it a “tale of two years,” where gains in the first half won’t last in the second. Some strategists are more cautious. UBS’s Jonathan Golub set a conservative target of 6,400, while Oppenheimer’s John Stoltzfus went big with 7,100. No one, however, predicts a market drop. Here’s the problem: the bull market is losing steam. After surging 24% in 2023 and 27% in 2024, returns are expected to be more subdued. Stuart Kirk called it “frothy,” likening it to the dot-com and Japanese equity bubbles. Stocks like Apple, trading at 37 times earnings, are “ludicrously expensive,” said Simon Edelsten. Passive investing is inflating valuations for big-name stocks, creating the perfect conditions for a bubble. Europe, meanwhile, is being sidelined. But Kirk pointed out that investors could still make absolute gains there, even if the continent underperforms the U.S. The final stretch before a market peak often delivers massive returns. Missing out could be costly. Bitcoin is not yet too big to fail Crypto investors are riding high after Bitcoin smashed through $100,000. Trump’s victory has turned the market bullish, with promises of a friendlier regulatory approach. At a Nashville conference, Trump compared Bitcoiners to Edison and Ford, calling them pioneers of a new era. His pro-crypto policies, combined with a crypto-friendly SEC, have already driven Bitcoin up by over 40%. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, is all in. He called Trump’s win “the dawn of a new era” and met with him at Mar-a-Lago to discuss crypto policy. Brian’s Super PAC, Fairshake, poured $135 million into pro-crypto candidates during the election. Since Trump’s victory, Coinbase’s stock has soared, boosting Brian’s holdings to $11 billion. Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy is doubling down, too. His company holds $43 billion worth of Bitcoin and plans to buy $42 billion more. MicroStrategy’s stock skyrocketed 550% in 2024, making it a leveraged Bitcoin play. Saylor called Bitcoin “the monetary network” and warned investors not to miss out. The Winklevoss twins, once crypto moderates, are now Trump’s biggest fans. They donated $1 million each in Bitcoin to his campaign and spent millions more supporting crypto-friendly candidates. After the SEC sued Gemini over a failed lending product, their frustration with regulators boiled over. Cameron Winklevoss accused the Biden administration of destroying the American dream, calling outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler “a disgrace.” Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has also joined Trump’s camp. Tether issued $138 billion in tokens this year, backed by U.S. Treasuries, but remains a favorite target for law enforcement. Paolo defended Tether’s role, pointing to its collaborations with authorities worldwide. “If the U.S. wanted to kill us, they could press a button,” he said. Even Binance, after paying $4.3 billion in fines for money laundering charges, sees a fresh start under Trump. CEO Richard Teng said Trump’s policies could usher in global crypto adoption, calling the new administration a turning point. But all technical indicators are pointing to a correction coming in the near future. Crypto and stocks both face hidden risks Optimism aside, 2025 won’t be smooth sailing. Stocks are dangerously overvalued, and the third year of a bull market is historically weak. Meanwhile, the crypto market faces its own challenges. Regulatory uncertainty, potential bubbles, and geopolitical tensions are all on the radar. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, isn’t impressed by the Trump hype. He criticized crypto leaders for supporting “power-seeking narcissists” and warned against abandoning the movement’s core values. Vitalik, who runs a nonprofit focused on Ethereum’s ecosystem, called out the industry’s shift toward authoritarianism. Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse is taking a different approach. After winning a partial legal victory in 2024, Ripple’s XRP token surged to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Brad continues to push for clear regulations, wearing a “F**k the SEC” T-shirt at a recent conference. Even Silicon Valley is changing. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, known for their Democratic ties, shocked the tech world by endorsing Trump. Their company, Andreessen Horowitz, is the largest VC fund for crypto companies. Andreessen called Trump’s win “a boot off the throat” of crypto innovation. The financial world is at a crossroads. Crypto’s explosive growth and Wall Street’s overconfidence could lead to massive gains—or devastating losses. Investors are betting big, but the risks are bigger. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Tesla, or Treasury bonds, 2025 will be a wild ride.

The platform, which integrates the AI with the metaverse with an aim to build the future of virtual interactions, has displayed a monstrous rally since the start of the final quarter. However, despite the gigantic rise, the token does not appear to slow down as the VIRTUAL price continues to soar in the times when the other cryptos are consolidating after a significant rise. This massive rise in the value and the market cap with a 10-fold increase in the trading volume has raised concerns over it’s stability in the coming days. However, the volume continues to record levels above $300 million following it’s listing on major exchanges, which offers the possibility of continued bullish action until the end of the year. Now the question arises: will Virtuals Protocol be the top performer of 2024, with over 8000% surpassing the major tokens in the crypto markets? The above chart shows the gigantic rise of VIRTUAL price from the levels below $0.05 to highs above $2.7. The token is constantly displaying strength in the discovery phase and is currently facing some sell-offs at the moment. As happened earlier between 0.5 FIB & 0.78 FIB, the token is believed to have been traded between 0.786 FIB & 1 FIB for nearly a week before a breakout to the 1.2 FIB at $3.4, probably by the end of the year. With this, the market capitalisation of Virtuals Protocol is expected to surge above $3.3 billion, paving the way for the token to enter the top 50 cryptos. However, the meteoric rise usually attracts huge concerns over it’s stability, as the markets have witnessed a number of fallouts and rug-pulls.

The analysis offers insights into how short-term and long-term participants view the current state of the market. The analysis also comes as BTC’s price maintains its price above $100,000, after reclaiming it few days ago. Related Reading: Key Indicators Signal Bitcoin’s Next Move: Should Investors Brace For A Market Shift? BTC Market Sees Optimism Amid Binance Inflow Trends Binance, recognized as one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, remains pivotal in shaping Bitcoin’s trading landscape. According to Crazzyblockk, the average realized price for Bitcoin deposits into Binance currently stands at $63,000. Despite this high historical price level, the Inflow CDD (Coin Days Destroyed) metric remains low. This data indicates a notable pattern among Bitcoin investors, showcasing a “nuanced interplay” between market confidence and trading activity. Crazzyblockk revealed that the low Inflow CDD metric reveals that Bitcoin deposits into Binance primarily come from short-term holders or new market entrants rather than long-held coins. This trend suggests that long-term investors continue to adopt a “hodl” strategy, refraining from liquidating their assets despite Bitcoin’s price volatility. The analyst added that this reluctance of seasoned investors to sell their holdings points to a sustained belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Crazzyblockk wrote: Such trends reflect a reduction in selling pressure and growing optimism in the market. Binance’s ability to attract substantial inflows further cements its reputation as a trusted exchange, making it a critical hub for both institutional and retail investors in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Bitcoin Market Performance And Outlook Bitcoin so far continues to maintain its price above the $100,000 price mark. Although it recently attempted to renew its all-time high (ATH) of $103,679 after trading above $102,00 earlier this week, it has again faced correction now trading for $101,090. This trading price puts BTC to 2.7% decrease away from its peak and a 0.5% decline in the past day. Regardless of these corrections, a recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Datascope has revealed that the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is currently within the bull market.

37627736,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744287-bkch-more-upside-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1734172166,BKCH: More Upside Ahead,"Summary The Global X Blockchain ETF is a buy due to its fair valuations and strong growth potential, driven by Bitcoin's bullish momentum. BKCH offers dual exposure to digital assets and blockchain technology, with a market-cap weighted structure and an expense ratio of 0.50%. Bitcoin's potential establishment as a strategic reserve by multiple countries could drive BKCH higher, despite short-term risks and bearish futures options. Despite risks, BKCH's current momentum and multiple Bitcoin catalysts suggest significant upside potential, making it a timely investment opportunity. The Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ) is a buy despite its holdings trading at high valuations. I feel that the valuations of these companies is fair, and that it reflects the strong growth potential. With Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bulls fighting to maintain the $100,000 support, I feel that market sentiment for the BKCH ETF will see it move to new heights. I then recommend investors to buy this ETF to benefit from the tailwinds lifting the broader market as well as cryptocurrencies. Overview I feel that the Global X Blockchain ETF is appealing for many reasons that allow dual exposure to both the appreciation of digital assets as well as the underlying blockchain technology. BKCH tracks the Solactive Blockchain Index, and this currently consists of 25 holdings that allow for broad exposure. The ETF is market-cap weighted, with the largest companies receiving greater allocations. It has an expense ratio of 0.50% and has approximately $226.8 million of net assets. This gives BKCH a net asset value of $68.18 at the time of writing. Seeking Alpha Market-cap weighted ETFs are sometimes critiqued for their lack of sophistication. When compared to equal-weighted ETFs, which tend to lock in more consistent Net Asset Value ((NAV)) growth over time by buying low and selling high, ETFs like BKCH simply reflect market reality that the most-capitalized companies should have higher influence over the investment. I feel that this is especially useful now, as the momentum of BKCH is firmly in bullish territory. Seeking Alpha During strong bull markets, and especially recently due to the AI boom, market breadth has contracted significantly toward higher market-cap companies. This is evident for the S&P 500 index, as Reuters reported in October this year: The ""Mag 7"" stocks make up nearly one-third of the S&P 500's entire market cap, and they have accounted for 50% of the index's 22% gain so far this year, note Bank of America analysts. This seems unsustainable, and high concentration has historically been associated with lower returns, say Goldman Sachs analysts. Similarly, companies represented in the BKCH ETF are showing similar characteristics, with more speculative and earning less ""value"" stocks falling to the wayside in favor for firms that can deliver solid value in the short-term. My opinion then is that investors should position their portfolios to benefit from the solid momentum in the blockchain space to lock in some early gains. The top five holdings of BKCH point to a deep concentration in digital assets, rather than utilizing blockchain technology for other pragmatic purposes. The influence of Bitcoin's price action on the performance of these companies is the key driver. The top five companies below constitute approximately 50.75% of the fund's total net assets. Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN): 13.58% MARA Holdings, Inc. (MARA): 12.55% Core Scientific, Inc. (CORZ): 10.30% Riot Platforms, Inc. (RIOT): 8.16% Hut 8 Corp. (HUT): 6.16% BKCH Fees & Performance BKCH is competitively priced ETF in my view. With an expense ratio of 0.50% it is lower than both the median and the average expense ratio of comparable ETFs by around 0.15%. Author ETF Ticker ETF Name Expense Ratio BKCH Global X Blockchain ETF 0.50% BLOK Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF 0.76% BLCN Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF 0.68% LEGR First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF 0.65% BITQ Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF 0.85% DAPP VanEck Digital Transformation ETF 0.50% CRPT First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF 0.85% BITS Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF 0.65% SATO Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF 0.60% FDIG Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF 0.39% WGMI CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF 0.75% To summarize BKCH's performance: 3 Month: BKCH achieved 59.41%, slightly below the median (60.19%) but above the average (56.17%). 9 Month: BKCH matches the median (51.65%) and slightly exceeds the average (51.45%). 1 Year: BKCH's 88.39% falls short of the median (93.03%) and average (95.76%). I'd rate the performance of BKCH overall as competitive , especially when one considers they are getting a slightly cheaper expense ratio. Data by YCharts Timeframe BKCH Performance (%) Median Performance (%) Average Performance (%) 1 Month -5.13 -1.15 -0.44 3 Month 59.41 60.19 56.17 6 Month 31.83 38.39 35.47 9 Month 51.65 51.65 51.45 YTD 47.45 71.46 61.73 1 Year 88.39 93.03 95.76 Discount to NAV Another benefit that investors may enjoy is that BKCH has historically traded at a discount to its NAV. At present, its discount to NAV is the following: At a small premium over the 1-month period. At a discount for the 3-month and since inception periods. This to me indicates that it's good value overall. Global X BKCH and Bitcoin Bitcoin recently breached the USD $100,000 threshold for the first time in its nascent history, and bulls and bears have fought fiercely to establish it as a key support level moving forward. My view is that if this new support is able to be established, then a greater run up for Bitcoin will be on the cards. Data by YCharts It should be noted that the majority of the companies in the BKCH ETF all benefit directly from a rising Bitcoin price, this includes COIN, RIOT, HUT and MARA. These companies either mine cryptocurrencies that are correlated to Bitcoin or are Bitcoin miners themselves, or earn from increased trading fees and volatility in the case of COIN. It should be no surprise then that BTC and BKCH have shared a close correlation over the past year, which may be even stronger due to the general rise of equities in the broader market. Data by YCharts Valuation Here are the forward-looking reasons why I believe that a higher Bitcoin (and consequently BKCH) price will be on the cards this year and into the next. These points establish the reasons that I believe BKCH is presently undervalued: Multiple countries, including the United States and Russia are exploring the possibility of creating a ""strategic Bitcoin reserve"". In the U.S, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act , proposing the U.S. purchase 1 million bitcoins over five years to address the $35 trillion national debt. Meanwhile, Russia has legalized Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining and a proposal for a reserve of Bitcoin has been submitted for approval. This could allow Russia to both bypass sanctions as well as hedge against their falling ruble currency. The U.S. Department of Justice already holds 208,000 Bitcoin, which it acquired through confiscations of criminal enterprises and networks. These coins now are worth around $21 billion at the time of writing, which some have suggested could become the genesis of the reserve fund for the United States. Developing nations such as Argentina and El Salvador are also exploring Bitcoin as a strategic asset . My view is that as Bitcoin is normalized as an asset reserve then other developing nations that are struggling with inflation and currency depreciation will also follow suit. Adopting Bitcoin may be a way for countries to challenge U.S. dollar asymmetrically, most notably by using it as a payment layer between BRICs countries. These drivers in my view will keep BKCH at elevated levels even if the broader market cools down from overheated levels. I expect that the correlation between these two instruments to remain tight. According to analysis from Morning star, Bitcoin will benefit from a number of catalysts including Trump's pro-crypto policies. My view is that Bitcoin could reach above the $150K mark. The Fed is predicted to cut interest rates next week which would be a complementary boon to both Bitcoin as well as ETFs such as BKCH. I believe that this would create upside for both the wider equity market and give Bitcoin bulls the enthusiasm to continue pushing the price higher. Why Own BKCH Over Bitcoin? The reason I prefer BKCH over Bitcoin directly is that it constituents offer diversified earnings potential rather than directly owning Bitcoin. BKCH for instance offers investors the ability to trade covered calls and cash-secured puts which increases their income potential. Furthermore, BKCH gives investors exposure to both the raging bull market for equities as well as the bull market for cryptocurrencies in general. Risks There are some signs that Bitcoin bulls are becoming exhausted in the short-term, with the futures options market predicting that Bitcoin will suffer some losses in the short-term. Buyers may have spent up most of their enthusiasm pushing it to a new all-time high. Barchart The options on futures this month is decidedly bearish for Bitcoin, with a put/call premium ratio of 1.72 and a put/call open interest ratio of 1.27. Explained simply, this means there is more money being spent on puts and calls, and that there are more open put contracts than call contracts for December. With implied volatility at 56.01%, we are in a rocky territory, that will, more likely than not, result in a downward correction. My view coming up to the $100,000 mark is if it is lost, we will fall considerably due to the psychological importance of that number alone. Finally, buying at these extreme levels for the Bitcoin and the broader market is particularly risky. If the greed and enthusiasm runs out, it could be a long time before investors break even. Conclusion Despite the risks, I feel that now is good time for investors to hop on BKCH due to its incredible momentum that will likely lead to more upside ahead. Multiple catalysts for Bitcoin are developing below the surface, which, I think, could lead to one of the biggest ""told you so"" moments we've seen so far for the digital asset.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744287-bkch-more-upside-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37627736.jpeg
37628639,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319458,1734172089,Coinbase Faces $1B Lawsuit from BiT Global Over Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Delisting,"Coinbase is facing a $1 billion lawsuit from BiT Global Digital Limited over its decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). The Hong Kong-based exchange claims that Coinbase’s move was a deliberate attempt to monopolize the market and promote its own rival product, cbBTC. Filed on December 13 in the Northern District of California , the lawsuit accuses Coinbase of anti-competitive practices under the Sherman Act. Coinbase’s Delisting of wBTC Damaged Consumer Confidence BiT Global alleges that Coinbase’s delisting of wBTC caused significant financial losses and damaged consumer confidence in the token. The complaint further accuses Coinbase of making false statements suggesting that wBTC failed to meet its listing standards. The delisting was announced on November 19, with Coinbase citing unspecified failures of wBTC to meet its token listing standards. BiT Global’s legal team, led by law firm Kneupper & Covey, argues that Coinbase’s reasoning was misleading. “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space,” said attorney Kevin Kneupper. “If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” BiT Global has been a joint custodian of wBTC’s Bitcoin reserves, alongside crypto firm BitGo, since August 2024. The exchange claims that Coinbase’s delisting move came shortly after the launch of Coinbase’s own wrapped Bitcoin product, cbBTC. BiT Global’s legal filing asserts that Coinbase’s actions were intended to diminish the competitiveness of wBTC and pave the way for cbBTC’s market dominance. The lawsuit seeks more than $1 billion in damages and requests injunctive relief to prevent further harm.

Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC (wBTC) on Dec. 19, 2024, on or around 12 pm ET.” Coinbase to Shift Toward More Revenue Streams Under Trump Last month, Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s Vice President of International Policy, said the exchange aims to shift toward more predictable revenue streams, such as stablecoin fees, staking rewards, and subscription services under Trump. “We want to build an earnings profile that isn’t entirely dependent on market volatility,” he explained. As Trump prepares to take office, the expectation of reduced regulatory friction offers hope for U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase. Gordon reiterated the company’s commitment to the American market, stating, “The U.S. will continue to be our most important market. The cryptocurrency sector has become a significant player in political financing during the 2024 election cycle, with industry-funded PACs raising a total of $190 million . The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, stand out as the largest individual donors , having contributed a combined $10.1 million. Other significant contributors from the cryptocurrency industry include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who has given over $1.3 million to both Republican and Democratic PACs. As reported, Coinbase has also announced a $25 million donation to the super political action committee Fairshake, aiming to bolster support for pro-crypto candidates in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.

37627674,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/switzerland-based-bitcoin-suisse-shares-2025-forecast-for-btc-price/,1734172087,Switzerland-Based Bitcoin Suisse Shares 2025 Forecast for BTC Price,"Bitcoin Suisse, one of Europe’s longest-running cryptocurrency service providers, has released a report predicting a bullish outlook for the digital asset market in 2025. According to the firm, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to reach a price range of $180,000 to $200,000 in 2025, with altcoins potentially experiencing a fivefold increase in total market value in the first half of the year. Bitcoin Suisse’s analysis leverages its proprietary Dynamic Cycle Risk and Dynamic On-Chain Cycle Risk models, which suggest that BTC will reach a new all-time high in 2025. Institutional adoption fueled by Bitcoin ETFs has driven sustained demand as Bitcoin’s price consolidates between $50,000 and $60,000 in early 2024 and approaches $100,000 later in the year. The report highlights the role of institutional buyers in offsetting selling pressure from long-term holders. Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed several times the daily BTC mining issuance since their inception, creating a more stable price environment and paving the way for the next cycle top. Bitcoin Suisse also estimates that greater adoption by nation-states and institutional investors could push BTC toward “supercycle” valuations of $300,000 during this market cycle. Looking ahead, the report notes the possibility of even higher long-term growth with Bitcoin potentially capturing 5%-10% of global financial assets, which could push its price to between $2.5 million and $5 million per BTC in the coming years. Related News: Nasdaq-Listed Giant Company Announces Massive Bitcoin Purchase The report also highlights the potential for Ethereum (ETH) staking ETFs to outpace Bitcoin ETFs in terms of adoption and returns. With Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake and increasing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), staking-based financial products could gain traction among institutional investors. Bitcoin Suisse is predicting a significant rally for altcoins, predicting a five-fold increase in total market value in the first half of 2025. The firm attributes this growth to the ongoing development of decentralized applications (dApps), advances in Layer-1 and Layer-2 protocols, and the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into blockchain ecosystems. Bitcoin Suisse is positioning 2025 as a pivotal year for the crypto industry. The firm believes that Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt traditional financial markets, with its current market share accounting for just 0.2% of global financial assets. With total global assets estimated at $910 trillion, even a modest increase in Bitcoin’s market penetration could significantly accelerate its price appreciation. While the short-term focus is on BTC surpassing $200,000, Bitcoin Suisse is also focusing on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency market, citing projections such as Michael Saylor’s target of $13 million per BTC by 2045. *This is not investment advice.

37627618,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393105,1734171994,Japan’s National Diet Bitcoin Reserve Proposal: A New Chapter in Crypto Adoption,"The post Japan’s National Diet Bitcoin Reserve Proposal: A New Chapter in Crypto Adoption appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The political sentiment of the United States towards the cryptocurrency industry has turned encouraging, since pro-Crypto candidate Donald Trump won the US presidential election , defeating Kamala Harris, who represented a crypto-skeptic regime. The country is expected to establish a Bitcoin reserve as soon as Trump assumes the seat of power in late January, 2025. There are enough reasons to believe that the change in the US’ attitude towards the crypto industry and its plan to create a BTC reserve have influenced many countries. With a Japanese lawmaker submitting a proposal seeking the creation of a national crypto reserve in Japan, the country becomes the latest entrant to the list of countries considering the reserve strategy. Here is what you should know about the development. Japan’s Push for a Bitcoin Reserve It was on December 11 that the Bitcoin reserve proposal was submitted in the national legislature of Japan, known as the National Diet. A rare coincidence is that the lawmaker, who placed the proposal, shares a first name with the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto . It is unclear how far Satoshi Hamada (the Japanese lawmaker) can push the proposal in the lawmaking body, considering the fact that his political party is very weak in terms of parliament representation. The general expectation is that the proposal would win the support of lawmakers like Yuchiro Tamaki, a pro-Bitcoin legislator who leads a party with strong representation in the Japanese legislative body. Notably, Tamaki recently made some bold statements, highlighting the importance of bringing reforms to the cryptocurrency regulation and tax frameworks. Institutions are driving Bitcoin adoption to new heights! Read Bitcoin price prediction to see how this trend could impact future prices. The Global Bitcoin Reserve Movement It seems that many countries are preparing to embrace the strategy of establishing a Bitcoin reserve to counter the threat of inflation. Russia, Brazil and Poland are some of the countries discussing the possibility of creating a national BTC reserve. Russian and Brazilian lawmakers tabled their proposals in their respective law-making bodies in 2023 itself. Probably inspired by how Donald Trump won the hearts of the US electorate by projecting himself as a crypto champion, a Polish presidential candidate is currently pushing for Bitcoin stockpiling for national security. In conclusion, as Bitcoin adoption grows globally , the race for national Bitcoin reserves highlights its role as a critical asset in financial strategy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The city-state, known for its wealth and tech-forward mindset, has been years ahead of the curve in embracing cryptocurrencies. It didn’t happen by luck. A well-planned mix of infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and incentives made Singapore the place for crypto, while others like China and India dragged their feet. According to Henley & Partners, Singapore tops the global crypto adoption index. Tax breaks, regulatory frameworks, and a central bank willing to experiment with a digital Singapore dollar are all part of the game plan. But it hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Back in March 2022, Charles & Keith, a homegrown fashion brand, made headlines by accepting crypto payments. Little did anyone know that this move coincided with the beginning of the Crypto Winter. The collapse of Terraform Labs, run by Singapore’s own Do Kwon, started the avalanche. Things only got worse with the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX. The domino effect shook even Singapore’s largest state-linked entities. Singapore’s resilience in the crypto winter Despite the chaos, Singapore refused to flinch. While others abandoned ship, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) doubled down on building the infrastructure needed for a crypto future. Over 30 companies, including U.S. giants like Coinbase and Ripple, as well as Hong Kong-based Futu, are now licensed to offer digital token services under the MAS framework. Meanwhile, a survey by the Independent Reserve earlier this year revealed that 40% of Singaporeans are crypto investors. This adoption isn’t limited to the Gen Z crowd. Baby Boomers and Gen X are joining in, helped by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Still, the MAS plays it cautiously. Retail investors can’t buy spot Bitcoin ETFs, and crypto listings remain off-limits. The seemingly unstoppable bull run has reignited excitement. With ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump heading back to the White House in 2025, speculation is high that pro-crypto policies in the U.S. could propel Bitcoin to even greater heights. Singapore’s well-prepared ecosystem is primed to ride that wave. Economic growth and crypto synergy The Bitcoin rally comes as Singapore’s economy shows serious muscle. Inflation dropped to 1.4% in October, down from 2% in September. Core inflation, which excludes volatile categories like rent and transport, also eased to 2.1%. Lower electricity, gas, and clothing prices played a role, according to MAS. The Singapore dollar, already a strong currency, appreciated slightly to 1.34 against the U.S. dollar after the inflation report . While inflation cools, Singapore’s GDP is heating up. Third-quarter growth hit 5.4% year-on-year, exceeding earlier estimates of 4.1%. This is the fastest growth Singapore has seen since late 2021. Officials have revised annual growth projections for 2024 to 3.5%, up from the previous range of 2% to 3%. Unlike most countries, Singapore doesn’t rely on interest rates to control its economy. Instead, MAS manages the Singapore dollar’s exchange rate within a policy band. By adjusting this band, the central bank keeps inflation in check while maintaining economic growth. It’s a system that works, and it’s one reason the country can afford to take calculated risks on crypto.

Nasdaq announced the inclusion of Michael Saylor’s firm alongside Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) in its December 13 official statement . The listing comes as Illumina, Inc. (ILMN), Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), and Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) are set to exit the prestigious index. This inclusion positions MicroStrategy among Nasdaq’s 100 largest companies by market capitalization. Known for transforming itself into a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund in 2020, the company has amassed billions in Bitcoin holdings , solidifying its reputation as a pioneer in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Crypto Community Reacts The announcement sparked excitement across the cryptocurrency industry, with many noting the broader implications for Bitcoin exposure in traditional markets. Prominent crypto analyst Will Clemente took to X (formerly Twitter), stating , “Every large pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, and individual retirement account in the world is now indirectly exposed to Bitcoin through MSTR.” Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, described the development as “the trade of the decade,” signaling a wave of fresh interest in Bitcoin. Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, stated that active fund managers benchmarking against the Nasdaq will now face pressure to hedge risks by incorporating Bitcoin or MicroStrategy stocks into their portfolios. MicroStrategy Advocates Bitcoin to Microsoft MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 caps off a month of Bitcoin advocacy by Michael Saylor. Earlier in December, Saylor made headlines after addressing Microsoft’s board during its annual meeting, urging the tech giant to embrace Bitcoin. He argued that adopting Bitcoin could add nearly $5 trillion to Microsoft’s market cap. Despite Saylor’s impassioned pitch, Microsoft shareholders voted against incorporating Bitcoin into the company’s balance sheet. Nevertheless, MicroStrategy’s latest achievement underscores Bitcoin’s gradual integration into mainstream financial systems. As the crypto space eagerly awaits the market’s response to MicroStrategy’s new status, the listing highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance and digital assets.

Crypto lobbyist Perianne Boring tells Fox Business in a new interview that President-elect Donald Trump’s future approach to the sector could send BTC skyrocketing close to $1 million. “The stock-to-flow model says it’s going to be at over $800,000 by the end of next year. If Donald Trump is successful in putting forward a lot of the proposals that he’s proposed to the community, the sky is the limit because Bitcoin has a fixed supply.” The stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which was traditionally used for traditional commodities before being adapted to Bitcoin, predicts the performance of an asset based on the idea that price increases as the asset becomes more scarce. After expressing skepticism about Bitcoin and crypto during his previous presidential term, Trump spent the past year on the campaign trail promising to protect and grow the digital asset sector. At campaign events over the summer, the former president and now president-elect promised to fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office and end policies that prevent crypto investors and companies from using digital assets. After Trump’s victory, Gensler announced he would step down from his post in January. The former president also said the US would stop selling its trove of seized Bitcoin on the open market and instead strategically hold the asset as an investment.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Trump’s firm swaps $5M USDT for ETH, boosting altcoin momentum; Solana and Lunex Network poised for 2025 surge. Table of Contents Ethereum token eyes $5,000 price target – expert says Grayscale files for Solana ETF amid SOL’s price positivity Lunex Network prepares for a parabolic run after ICO stage elapses as investors’ interest booms Can Lunex network compete with Solana and Ethereum? The positivity in the altcoin market has skyrocketed following Donald Trump’s huge involvement with Ethereum (ETH). Recently, it was reported that its financial firm, World Liberty Financial, swapped $5 million USDT for ETH. This raised its Ethereum holding above $55 million. Riling up the crypto market, several market analysts as well as investors expect positive results after this news. This increasing attention on altcoin is poised to send top cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and fast-rising presale stars like Lunex Network (LNEX) on a parabolic run by 2025. You might also like: Dogwifhat forms bullish flag pattern as Lunex Network hits $0.0033 Ethereum token eyes $5,000 price target – expert says The attention towards Ethereum (ETH) token has skyrocketed due to Trump’s financial firm raising its ETH holding above $55 million. With this, Ethereum token now takes up over 76% of the firm’s portfolio, leading analysts to predict higher price levels for Ethereum. For instance, seasoned futures trader and crypto investor, CoinMamba , hinted that the Ethereum coin is looking ready to hit the $5,000 price market with just a single candle. Investors’ confidence also grew after this speculation, with some even expecting ETH price to go past this price. Another analyst, sighted that Ethereum will hit $4,900 very soon before monumentally rising to $7,238 by latest Q1, 2025. As the price positivity for Ethereum brews, coupled with bullish technical indicators , the token’s recent 9% weekly jump above $3,900 has contributed largely to its optimism as a top crypto to buy. Grayscale files for Solana ETF amid SOL’s price positivity Recent news from CoinMarketCap shows that Grayscale is filing for spot SOL ETF, raising positivity for Solana (SOL) price. Beyond this, Solana also maintains a 5.56M active addresses lead even though its DeFi TLV ranking slipped to 3rd position after Tron surpassed it to become the second highest ranking DeFi protocol by TVL. All of these have raised optimism for Solana as the token itself is reflecting approximately 5% pump in the past month. However, the native SOL price also hit an all-time high of $263 less than three weeks back. While Solana price is currently consolidating with a 3.3% decline in the past week, bullish predictions for the native SOL token are still brewing. Popular analyst, Ali Martinez, particularly predicted that Solana price is primed to hit $4,000, referencing a particular cup and handle pattern, typically known to indicate a bullish price breakout. In view of this, investors are now filled with FOMO on Solana, as many resort to holding the coin while closely watching its trajectory. Lunex Network prepares for a parabolic run after ICO stage elapses as investors’ interest booms Given its interconnected ecosystem, Lunex Network is shaping up as a changing DeFi project set to take cross-chain transactions to the next level. The platform allows fast and secure swap of over 50K crypto assets across 40+ blockchain networks. Meanwhile, considering its non-custodial attribute, users get to have full control over their assets without the need for KYC or third-party applications like Trust Wallet. Essentially, Lunex Network presents itself as a profitable crypto to buy for both retail and institutional investors as it offers reward programs, including cashbacks on each transaction. Beyond this, the platform also shares the revenue it generates from its swapping services, offering 50% to its users with the other half reserved for exclusive rewards. Coupled with this, Lunex Network assists investors track their portfolio while offering market insights. Given its unique model, Lunex Network has been able to garner over $5 million in its ICO stage with over 2.2 billion of its presale token supply sold already. Its native token, LNEX, has spiked by 260% to a current price of $0.0044, granting investors significant ROIs. However, market analysts are predicting over 500% presale pump by the end of the year and up to 50x spike on launch day, attracting more investor interest in its network. Can Lunex network compete with Solana and Ethereum? The multifaceted approach Lunex Network is taking to redefine crypto exchange protocols is wide. Enabling business merchants and web3 developers to benefit from its decentralized protocol demonstrates its strong potential to lead market adoption in 2025. This could allow it to contend with top cryptocurrencies like ETH and SOL alongside other top altcoins. To learn more about Lunex Network, visit the w e bsite and join Lunex’s growing community .

We expect this pro-Bitcoin stance to ripple across the broader U.S. crypto ecosystem. Crypto rails promise a better financial system through improved efficiency, decentralization, and greater transparency. By the end of 2025, we project that Blob Space fees will exceed $1 billion, up from negligible levels today. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Before we get into our 2025 predictions, let's take a moment to review how our 2024 calls stacked up. Out of 15 predictions made back in December 2023, we score ourselves 8.5/15. A 0.566 batting average might not be perfect, but it's enough to keep us in the game. With Bitcoin (BTC-USD) smashing $100k and Ethereum (ETH-USD) breaking $4k, even some of our misses were part of a year to remember. Crypto Predictions Review for 2024 Debut of spot BTC ETP s - (1 point) Bitcoin halving proceeds smoothly - (1 point) Bitcoin reaches all-time high in 4Q2024 - (1 point) Ethereum remains #2 to bitcoin - (1 point) L2s dominate Ethereum activity (but L2 TVL still below Ethereum's) - (0.5 points) Stablecoin market cap hits record high - (1 point) Decentralized exchanges attain record share of spot volumes - (1 point) SOL outperforms ETH - (1 point) DePIN network adoption grows - (1 point) Now, let's get into the main event: our crypto predictions for 2025. 1. Crypto bull market hits a medium-term peak in Q1, sets new highs in Q4 We believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle's apex, we project Bitcoin to be valued at around $180,000 , with Ethereum trading above $6,000 . Other prominent projects, such as Solana (SOL-USD) and Sui (SUI-USD), could exceed $500 and $10, respectively. Following this first peak, we anticipate a 30% retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing sharper declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates during the summer. However, a recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year. To gauge when the market is nearing its top, we are monitoring these key signals : Sustained High Funding Rates: When traders borrow to bet on BTC price increases, they are willing to pay funding rates exceeding 10% for three months or more, which indicates speculative excess. BTC Perps Funding > 10% For Months Would be Bearish 10% For Months Would be Bearish"" contenteditable=""false""> Sources: Glass Node as of 12/8/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Excessive Unrealized Profits: If the proportion of BTC holders sitting on significant paper gains (a profit-to-cost ratio of 70% or higher) stabilizes, it suggests market euphoria. Overvalued Market Cap Relative to Realized Value: When MVRV (market value to realized value) scores exceed 5 , it shows BTC prices are far above average purchase prices, often signaling overheated conditions. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: If Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market drops below 40% , it implies a speculative shift into riskier altcoins, a classic late-cycle behavior. Mainstream Speculation: A flood of texts from non-crypto-savvy friends asking about questionable projects is a reliable signal of speculative mania near the top. These indicators have historically been reliable signals of market exuberance and will guide our outlook as we navigate 2025's anticipated market cycles. 2. U.S. embraces bitcoin with strategic reserve(s) and increased crypto adoption The election of Donald Trump has already injected significant momentum into the crypto market, driven by his administration's appointments of crypto-friendly leaders to pivotal positions, including VP JD Vance, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Mary Bessent, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Jelena McWilliams, and HHS Secretary RFK Jr, and more. These appointments signal not just the end of anti-crypto policies, such as the systematic de-banking of crypto companies and their founders, but also the start of a policy framework that positions Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Crypto ETPs: in-kind creations, staking, and new spot approvals New SEC leadership, or possibly the CFTC, will approve multiple new spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the U.S., including the VanEck Solana offering. Ethereum ETP functionality expands to include staking, further enhancing its utility for holders, while both Ethereum and Bitcoin ETPs support in-kind creations/redemptions. The repeal of SEC Rule SAB 121, either by the SEC or Congress, will pave the way for banks and brokers to custody spot crypto, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial infrastructure. Sovereign bitcoin adoption: federal, state, and mining expansion We predict that by 2025, either the federal government or at least one U.S. state-likely Pennsylvania, Florida, or Texas-will establish a Bitcoin reserve. Federally, this is more likely to occur through an executive order utilizing the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), though bipartisan legislation remains a wildcard. Simultaneously, state governments may act independently, viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal uncertainty or a tool to attract crypto investment and innovation. On the Bitcoin mining side, the number of countries mining Bitcoin with government resources is expected to reach double digits (currently at seven) as BRICS adoption grows. This trend is fueled by Russia's stated intent to settle international trade in crypto, highlighting Bitcoin's increasing importance in global economic strategies. Number of Countries Mining Bitcoin with Government Resources Source: VanEck Research as of 12/2024. We expect this pro-Bitcoin stance to ripple across the broader U.S. crypto ecosystem. The share of global crypto developers based in the U.S. will rise from 19% to 25% as regulatory clarity and incentives draw talent and companies back. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Bitcoin mining will flourish, with the U.S. share of global mining hash rate increasing from 28% in 2024 to 35% by the end of 2025, driven by cheap energy and potentially favorable tax policies. Together, these trends will solidify America's leadership in the global Bitcoin economy. U.S.-Listed Company's Share of Bitcoin Hash Rate to Reach 35% Source: JPMorgan, VanEck Research s of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Corporate bitcoin holdings: poised to surge 43% In terms of corporate adoption, we expect companies to continue accumulating Bitcoin from retail holders. Currently, 68 public companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, a number we project to reach 100 by 2025 . Notably, we boldly predict that the total Bitcoin held by private and public companies-currently 765,000 BTC -will surpass Satoshi Nakamoto's holdings of 1.1 million BTC by next year. This implies a remarkable growth rate of 43% in corporate Bitcoin holdings over the coming year.

The value of tokenized securities exceeds $50 billion Onchain Securities Grew 61% in 2024 Sources: RWA.xyz, Defillama as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Crypto rails promise a better financial system through improved efficiency, decentralization, and greater transparency. We believe that 2025 will be the year that tokenized securities take off. Already, there is ~$12B worth of tokenized securities on blockchains, with the majority ($9.5B) being tokenized private credit securities listed on the Figure's semi-permissioned blockchain called Provenance. In the future, we see enormous potential for tokenized securities to launch on public chains. We theorize that there are many incentives for investors to push for tokenized equity or debt securities launched exclusively onchain. In the next year, we project that entities like the DTCC will enable tokenized assets that seamlessly transition between public blockchains and private, closed infrastructure. This dynamic will result in standards for performing AML/KYC for on-chain investors. As a wildcard bet, we forecast that Coinbase will take the unprecedented step of tokenizing COIN stock and deploying it to its BASE blockchain. 4. Stablecoins daily settlement volumes reach $300 billion Monthly Stablecoin Transfers ((USD)) Were Up 180% YoY in 2024 Source: Artemis XYZ as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Stablecoins will leapfrog their niche role in crypto trading to become a core part of global commerce. By the end of 2025, we project stablecoins will settle $300B daily transfers-equivalent to 5% of DTCC's current volumes, up from ~$100B daily in November 2024. Their adoption by major tech companies (think Apple and Google) and payment networks (Visa, Mastercard) will redefine the economics of payments. Beyond trading, the remittance market will explode. U.S.-Mexico stablecoin transfers, for instance, could grow 5x, from $80M to $400M monthly. Why? Speed, cost savings, and the growing trust of millions who see stablecoins not as experiments but as practical tools. For all the talk of blockchain adoption, stablecoins are its Trojan Horse . 5. AI agents' onchain activity surpasses 1 million agents Total Revenue for AI Agents is $8.7M in 5 Weeks Sources: Dune @jdhpyer as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results One of the most compelling narratives we believe will translate into massive traction in 2025 is AI Agents. AI agents are specialized AI bots that direct users to achieve outcomes such as ""maximizing yield"" or ""spurring X/Twitter engagement."" The agents optimize these outcomes by utilizing their abilities to change their strategies autonomously. AI agents are often fed data and trained to specialize in one domain. Currently, protocols like Virtuals give anyone the tools to create an AI agent to perform on-chain tasks. Virtuals allow non-experts to access decentralized AI agent contributors such as fine-tuners, dataset providers, and model developers so that non-technical people can create their own AI agents. The result will be the enormous proliferation of agents their creators can lease out to generate income. The current focus of agent building has been DeFi, but we believe that AI agents will transcend financial activities. Agents can be employed to act as social media influencers, computer players in gaming, and interactive companions/helpers in consumer applications. Agents have already become important X/Twitter influencers, such as Bixby and Terminal of Truths , who reached 92k and 197k followers, respectively. As such, we believe the enormous potential for agents will result in the birth of over 1 million new agents in 2025. 6. Bitcoin layer-2s reach 100,000 BTC in total value locked (TVL) Bitcoin L2s TVLs Reach 30k BTC, 600% Increase YTD 2024 Sources: Defillama as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. We are closely monitoring the emergence of Bitcoin layer-2 (L2) blockchains, which hold immense potential for transforming Bitcoin's ecosystem. Scaling Bitcoin enables these L2 solutions to enable lower latency and higher transaction throughput, addressing the limitations of the base layer. Moreover, Bitcoin L2s enhance Bitcoin's capabilities by introducing smart contract functionality, which can power a robust decentralized finance ((DEFI)) ecosystem built around Bitcoin. Currently, Bitcoin can be moved off the Bitcoin blockchain to smart contract platforms through bridged or wrapped BTC, which rely on third-party systems prone to hacks and security vulnerabilities. Bitcoin L2 solutions aim to address these risks by offering frameworks that integrate directly with Bitcoin's base layer, minimizing reliance on centralized intermediaries. While liquidity constraints and adoption hurdles remain, Bitcoin L2s promise to enhance security and decentralization, giving BTC holders greater confidence to use their Bitcoin in decentralized ecosystems actively. As shown in the chart, Bitcoin L2 solutions have experienced explosive growth in 2024, with total value locked (TVL) surpassing 30,000 BTC-a 600% increase year-to-date, amounting to approximately $3 billion . Currently, over 75 Bitcoin L2 projects are in development, though only a select few are likely to achieve significant adoption over the long term. This rapid growth reflects strong demand from BTC holders seeking yield generation and broader utility for their assets. Bitcoin will also become an integral part of DeFi as chain abstraction technology and Bitcoin L2s mature into usable products for end users. For instance, platforms like Ika on Sui or Near's chain abstraction used by Infinex highlight how innovative multi-chain solutions will enhance Bitcoin's interoperability with other ecosystems. By enabling secure and efficient on-chain borrowing, lending, and other permissionless DeFi solutions, Bitcoin L2s and abstraction technology will transform Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active participant in decentralized ecosystems. As adoption scales, these technologies unlock substantial opportunities for on-chain liquidity, cross-chain innovation, and a more integrated financial future. 7. Ethereum blob space generates $1 billion in fees Ethereum Blobs Posted Per Day Sources: Dune @hildobby as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Ethereum community is actively debating whether Ethereum accrues sufficient value from its Layer-2 (L2) networks through Blob Space, a critical component of its scaling roadmap. Blob Space serves as a specialized data layer where L2s submit a compressed history of their transactions to Ethereum, paying fees in ETH on a per-blob basis. While this architecture underpins Ethereum's scalability, L2s currently remit minimal value to the Mainnet, achieving gross margins of approximately 90% . This has sparked concerns that Ethereum's economic value could shift too heavily toward L2s, leaving the base layer underutilized. Despite a recent slowdown in Blob Space growth, we project a sharp expansion in its usage by 2025, driven by three key factors: Explosive L2 Adoption: Transaction volumes on Ethereum L2s are growing at an annualized rate exceeding 300% as users migrate to lower-cost, high-throughput environments for DeFi, gaming, and social applications. The proliferation of consumer-facing dApps on L2s will significantly increase the demand for Blob Space as more transactions flow back to Ethereum for final settlement. Rollup Optimizations: Advances in rollup technology, such as improved data compression and reduced costs for posting data to Blob Space, will encourage L2s to store more transaction data on Ethereum, unlocking higher throughput without sacrificing decentralization. Introduction of High-Fee Use Cases: The rise of enterprise-grade applications, zk-rollup-powered financial solutions, and tokenized real-world assets will drive high-value transactions, prioritizing security and immutability, increasing willingness to pay Blob Space fees. By the end of 2025, we project that Blob Space fees will exceed $1 billion , up from negligible levels today. This growth will cement Ethereum's role as the ultimate settlement layer for decentralized applications, while reinforcing its ability to capture value from its rapidly expanding L2 ecosystem. Ethereum's Blob Space will scale the network and serve as a key revenue stream, balancing the economic relationship between Mainnet and L2s. 8. DeFi hits all-time highs with $4 trillion DEX volumes and $200B TVL Total DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Total Value Locked (TVL) Source: Defillama as of 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Despite record-high decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes, both in absolute terms and relative to centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized finance total value locked (TVL) remains 24% below its peak. We anticipate that DEX trading volumes will surpass $4 trillion in 2025, capturing 20% of CEX spot trading volumes, driven by the proliferation of AI-related tokens and new consumer-facing dApps. Additionally, the influx of tokenized securities and high-value assets will catalyze DeFi growth, providing fresh liquidity and broader utility. As a result, we project DeFi TVL to rebound to over $200 billion by year-end, reflecting the rising demand for decentralized financial infrastructure in an evolving digital economy. 9. NFT market recovery with trading volumes reaching $30 billion NFT Volumes Fell in 2024; We Expect a Rebound in 2025 Source: as of: 12/6/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The 2022-2023 bear market dealt a severe blow to the NFT sector, with trading volumes plummeting 39% since 2023 and a staggering 84% since 2022. While fungible token prices began to recover in 2024, most NFTs lagged behind, marked by weak prices and low activity until a turning point in November. Despite these challenges, a few standout projects have defied the downward trend by leveraging strong community bonds to transcend speculative value. For instance, Pudgy Penguins have successfully transitioned into a consumer brand through collectible toys, while Miladys have gained cultural prominence within the realm of sardonic internet culture. Similarly, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) has continued to evolve as a dominant cultural force, attracting widespread attention from brands, celebrities, and mainstream media. As crypto wealth rebounds, we expect newly affluent users to diversify into NFTs, not merely as speculative investments but as assets with enduring cultural and historical significance. Established collections such as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) are well-positioned to benefit from this shift, given their strong cultural cachet and relevance. While BAYC and CryptoPunks remain significantly below their all-time trading peaks, down approximately 90% and 66% in ETH terms, respectively, other projects like Pudgy Penguins and Miladys have already exceeded their previous price highs. Ethereum continues to dominate the NFT space, hosting the majority of significant collections. In 2024, it accounts for 71% of NFT trading, a figure we project to rise to 85% by 2025. This dominance is reflected in market capitalization rankings, where Ethereum-based NFTs occupy the entire top 10 and 16 of the top 20 positions, underscoring the blockchain's central role in the NFT ecosystem. Although NFT trading volumes may not revisit the euphoric highs of previous cycles, we think a $30 billion annual turnover is doable, approximately 55% of the 2021 peak, as the market shifts toward sustainability and cultural relevance over speculative hype. 10. DApp tokens narrow the performance gap with L1 tokens In 2024, Layer 1 Tokens Outperformed Leading dApps by 2x Source: Market Vectors as of 12/8/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The MVSCLE index tracks Smart Contract Platforms. The MVIALE index tracks Infrastructure Application tokens. A consistent theme of the 2024 bull market has been the significant outperformance of Layer-1 (L1) blockchain tokens compared to decentralized application ((DAPP)) tokens. For instance, the MVSCLE index, which tracks Smart Contract Platforms, has gained 80% year-to-date, while the MVIALE index of application tokens has lagged with a 35% return over the same period. However, we anticipate this dynamic will shift later in 2024 as a wave of new dApps launches, delivering innovative and useful products that drive value to their respective tokens. Among the key thematic trends, we see artificial intelligence as a standout category for dApp innovation. Additionally, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) projects offer immense potential to capture investor and user interest, contributing to a broader performance rebalancing between L1 tokens and dApp tokens. This pivot underscores the growing importance of utility and product-market fit in determining the success of application tokens in the evolving crypto landscape.

37627059,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627334,1734170391,New US Financial Services chair French Hill targets crypto regulation in first 100 days,"French Hill, Arkansas Republican and the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee has his eyes locked on crypto. Hill, who took the reins on December 13, laid out a clear agenda on CNBC’s Squawk Box . Hill’s top priority? To fix the regulatory chaos that’s been crippling the crypto industry while pushing innovation and making U.S. financial markets more competitive. He has come into this role amid huge political changes, including the Republican Party’s sweeping victories in November. These changes, along with SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s upcoming resignation, have triggered a full-on bull run. Crypto regulation, stablecoins, and FIT21 Hill wants to end the SEC’s “regulation by enforcement” approach, he said. “We need a market structure for digital assets… This is not helping America succeed.” At the heart of Hill’s strategy is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21. This comprehensive bill proposes a regulatory framework for crypto, dividing oversight between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) based on a project’s level of decentralization. Despite passing in the House earlier this year, the bill stalled in the Senate. Hill is determined to push it forward, with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise promising to prioritize the legislation within the first 100 days of the new congressional session. Stablecoins are another pillar of Hill’s agenda. He’s advocating for a U.S.-backed stablecoin as part of broader efforts to modernize payment systems and keep America competitive. “Our Majority Leader Steve Scalise has it on his first 100 days of the House to move a regulatory structure bill for digital assets,” Hill said. A strategic Bitcoin reserve? One of the most intriguing topics Hill addressed is the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. This concept has gained traction among Republicans, with President-elect Donald Trump pledging to establish such a reserve during his campaign. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent crypto lover, has already drafted a bill that would require the U.S. Treasury to acquire one million Bitcoin over five years. Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione is pursuing a similar plan at the state level, proposing a Bitcoin reserve funded through donations. When asked about the federal government adopting a Bitcoin reserve, Hill expressed caution. “I’d have to think long and hard about what value that is to the United States or the Treasury,” he said during the interview. His response suggests a more measured approach compared to the outright enthusiasm shown by some of his Republican colleagues. Trump is considering handing the CFTC oversight of digital assets, a move that would classify most crypto projects as commodities if they meet certain criteria. Trump has also nominated Paul Atkins, a known crypto advocate, to replace Gensler as SEC chair. Atkins’ past work as co-chair of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance is seen as a promising sign for the industry, which has long been calling for leadership that understands the nuances of blockchain technology. Banking reforms and capital markets Hill isn’t just focused on crypto. His agenda includes reforms aimed at easing the regulatory burden on smaller banks and improving capital formation for public companies. He criticized the current banking regulations for driving consolidation toward the largest financial institutions. “The regulatory burden actually pushes consolidation in the banking industry to the largest bank because nobody can cope with the regulatory burden,” Hill said. His focus on capital markets is just as sharp. Hill wants to remove what he calls “barnacles on the ship of state,” referring to outdated rules that make it harder for companies to go public. He’s pushing for a streamlined regulatory environment that encourages innovation while maintaining strong consumer protections. These reforms, Hill argues, will make U.S. markets more attractive and competitive on a global scale. Hill also emphasized the need for stronger partnerships between banks and fintech companies. He believes fintech can play a critical role in improving compliance and customer service, two areas where traditional banking often falls short.

37637835,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105138,1734168741,Here’s How High Dogecoin Could Rise if the Global Crypto Market Cap Reaches $15T,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could surpass a $250 billion market cap if the global crypto market cap hits $15 trillion. Dogecoin, despite its meme-based origin, continues to rank among the most prominent crypto assets in the market, with a valuation of $61 billion. This market cap places it ahead of utility tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX).With Dogecoin trading at $0.4010 at press time, the meme coin boasts a 60-day gain of 252%, far outpacing the 45% growth seen in Ethereum and Solana. As the crypto bull run continues with nearly a year left, Dogecoin is expected to perform even more spectacularly. Notably, the global crypto market cap currently stands at $3.65 trillion, with Dogecoin at $61 billion. This article explores Dogecoin's potential price and valuation in a scenario where the global market cap reaches $15 trillion.Dogecoin Price with $15 Trillion Global Market CapNotably, with a market cap of $61 billion, Dogecoin currently makes up 1.67% of the global crypto market cap, which is $3.65 trillion. For the global crypto market to reach $15 trillion, it would need to grow by 310%.As a result, Dogecoin could achieve a market cap of approximately $250 billion, particularly if the meme coin maintains its current dominance and circulating supply. In this case, a $250 billion market cap would correspond to a price of $1.70 per Dogecoin.For market participants holding Dogecoin at its current price, this would represent a 3X growth in their portfolio.When Could Dogecoin Reach a $250 Billion Market Cap? According to crypto exchange Changelly, Dogecoin could attain a $250 billion market cap with a price of $1.70 by 2030. However, community analysts strongly disagree with this timeline.Some have argued that Dogecoin could surpass $1 before the end of this year, while others, including Ali Martinez, Crypto Scofield, and Ash Crypto, have voiced the view that Dogecoin could reach $3 by 2025. Some even more ambitious projections suggest that Dogecoin could hit $18 or $23 in the near future.In essence, popular opinions among market analysts suggest that Dogecoin could exceed a $250 billion market cap even this year, especially considering that Dogecoin surged by over 200% in November alone.Notably, at a $15 trillion global crypto market cap, Bitcoin, the most prominent crypto asset, would have a valuation of around $8.5 trillion, based on Bitcoin’s current market dominance of 56%. At an $8.5 trillion market cap, Bitcoin’s price would be $426,000, a remarkable increase from its current price of $101,000.Given that Dogecoin typically experiences more explosive growth than Bitcoin , this implies that Dogecoin could have a price far higher than $1.70 in a scenario where Bitcoin reaches above $425,000.",POSITIVE,ADA | DOGE,ADA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/heres-how-high-dogecoin-could-rise-if-the-global-crypto-market-cap-reaches-15t/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-high-dogecoin-could-rise-if-the-global-crypto-market-cap-reaches-15t,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

Brazil, for example, could begin to regulate cryptocurrency-related activities, while Argentina continues on its digital innovation path by allowing underground payments in cryptocurrency. In Brazil, Public Consultation 111 seeks to regulate the introduction of virtual asset services into the Central Bank of Brazil’s foreign exchange market. This program aims to incorporate virtual asset service providers’ activities and operations in the currency market, according to a recent declaration on the country’s official presidential portal. The proposal would amend many prior resolutions to comprehensively regulate these transactions under Brazilian capital restrictions. The BCB has been closely watching technological breakthroughs, business models, and concepts connected to virtual assets, particularly their relationship to the foreign exchange market and international capital flows. This inspection has revealed a huge increase in traded volumes and integration with traditional financial sectors, emphasizing the significance of regulatory talks in international forums. Such conversations advocate for regulations that are consistent with the capabilities and hazards connected with virtual assets. Furthermore, the BCB’s investigation indicates that a variety of business models utilizing virtual assets could improve service delivery in the foreign exchange market. This regulatory framework has the potential to improve the overall functionality of Brazil’s currency market by making it easier to conduct transactions and make investments. Argentina allows cryptocurrency for subway payments The election of Argentina’s new president has resulted in a more positive stance toward the use of cryptocurrencies. Recent regulatory reforms have allowed a variety of payment methods, including digital currencies, to be accepted. As of December, Buenos Aires citizens can pay for metro fares with nearly any payment option, including cryptocurrencies. Lemon, a local company that operates in numerous Latin American nations, has announced that its cards may now be used to pay for metro travel in the capital. This flexibility allows users to utilize either local currency or their cryptocurrency, depending on their preference. Visa has also launched a savings program for users who pay using contactless methods on the subway, and Lemon’s partnership with Visa allows customers to benefit from large discounts and cashback. The press announcement stated that to utilize Lemon’s wallet for subway payments, users must have a physical Visa card. It was also observed that frequent travellers might save up to 30,000 pesos per month through cashback rebates, while each payment helps to grow Bitcoin, confirming its image as a valued asset. The introduction of contactless payment systems in the Buenos Aires subway is a key step in modernizing and digitalizing Argentina’s public transportation, improving user experience and the interaction of citizens with their daily expenses. Colombia ranks 4th in LATAM for Bitcoin revenues, earning $6.79 billion in 2024 According to Chainalysis’ Geography of Cryptocurrency Report 2024 , Colombia has emerged as a major player in the regional cryptocurrency environment. The country ranked fourth in Bitcoin transactions, having amassed more than US$6.788 billion during the same period. The latest increase in Bitcoin’s value, surpassing a critical milestone of US$100,000, coincided with a government declaration by the newly elected president Donald Trump. This development caused waves in global markets, increasing valuations for corporations with Bitcoin holdings and raising the cryptocurrency assets of countries like El Salvador. However, the consequences of this increase go beyond the bounds of established economies and wealthy investors. According to industry experts, Bitcoin’s soaring price and more favourable laws under the US government, alongside the potential establishment of a Bitcoin strategic reserve, poised the cryptocurrency to gain enhanced legitimacy and a growing user base.

Hoskinson has been vocal about recent developments in the Wyoming stablecoin project. For context, the agency announced nine chains where Wyoming would issue the imminent state-backed stablecoin, including networks like Ethereum, Stellar, and Sui.However, the major shock came when the project did not include Cardano, Bitcoin, and XRP as networks that could accomodate the stablecoin. The decision did not bode well with Hoskinson, who has repeatedly cited a bias.Cardano Founder Taunts ApolloIn a tweet today, Hoskinson taunted the Wyoming Token Commission’s head, Anthony Apollo, for the snub. He reposted a tweet from a Cardano enthusiast, stating that the executive director overlooked Cardano and XRP but chose Ethereum because he knows a lot about the network.The Cardano founder stated that his knowledge came from his time with Consensys, one of the core developers of the Ethereum network. He implied that Apollo was biased in his decision to include Ethereum and snub Cardano.Notably, the response came to a tweet from Stake With Pride, one of the Cardano ecosystem’s SPOs and Dreps . The user shared a clip from the December 13 Wyoming Joint Appropriation Committee meeting, where Apollo insinuated that Cardano is centralized.Apollo Cites Reasons for Cardano SnubMeanwhile, Apollo appeared before the Wyoming Legislative Committee on Friday to provide updates on the stablecoin project. Notably, the legislature inquired whether Apollo treated Wyoming-based blockchains disparately to make the bidding process unfair.The executive director responded that he had a series of meetings with Cardano’s representatives and involved the network in the selection process. However, he disclosed that Cardano passed four of the five criteria but failed the freeze and seize test.Furthermore, he admitted that Cardano’s Midnight would have ensured that the network met the criteria. Nevertheless, the innovation was still on testnet during the assessment, and the agency stated explicitly that it needed all required technologies fully functional on the chain.In the meantime, Hoskinson called on the unselected networks to pursue legal actions against the Wyoming Token Commission. He argued that such disparity would create an uneven competitive landscape among digital asset firms in the United States.",NEGATIVE,XRP,ADA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/cardano-founder-taunts-wyoming-token-commission-head-over-decision-to-exclude-cardano-and-xrp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-founder-taunts-wyoming-token-commission-head-over-decision-to-exclude-cardano-and-xrp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

That’s the vibe BTFD Coin (BTFD) is riding as it dominates the meme coin scene with a killer presale and an innovative ecosystem. Meanwhile, Brett Coin, the mascot of Base Chain, continues to draw attention with its unique community, and Popcat’s rollercoaster volatility keeps investors intrigued. With so many options, which are the best meme coins to join today? Let’s dive in to see what makes these three coins buzzworthy—and why BTFD might just be your golden ticket. BTFD Coin: A Community on the Rise, Turning Dips into Dreams Picture this: A P2E game beta that’s already live, presale stages selling out like hotcakes, and over 53 billion tokens grabbed by more than 5,000 holders. That’s BTFD Coin for you! This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a rallying cry for those ready to flip the script on market downturns. The BTFD’s meme coin presale is making waves, sitting proudly in its 12th stage with $3.7 million raised so far. It blew past the $1 million mark in just 10 days and smashed $2.5 million within 14 days. At $0.00013 per coin right now, early adopters stand to reap serious rewards. When the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006 per coin. Imagine putting $500 into this presale now—you’d bag 3,846,153 coins. When the listing price hits, that same stash would be worth over $2,300. Not bad for catching the dip early, right? But the presale is just the tip of the iceberg. BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game’s beta version is already live. While rewards aren’t up for grabs just yet, the gameplay sets the stage for a revolution in crypto gaming. Add staking rewards averaging a jaw-dropping 90% APY, and it’s clear why BTFD is causing such a stir. With its Ethereum backbone, secure tokenomics, and a loyal community known as the Bulls Squad, BTFD isn’t just about buying dips; it’s about building wealth. The maximum supply is capped at 173 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and value for early holders. From a well-thought-out roadmap to bold marketing campaigns, everything about BTFD screams opportunity. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to join today, BTFD’s presale is your chance to be part of something big. Brett Coin: The Mascot of Base Chain Holds Steady Brett Coin has become a cultural icon in the crypto world, representing the thriving Base Chain ecosystem. Its all-time high of $0.2342 earlier this year turned heads, but it currently trades at $0.1749. Despite a 47% drop in April due to insider supply concerns, Brett has bounced back with steady community support. Its integration into the Base Chain ecosystem is a game-changer. With listings on major exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io, and OKX DEX, Brett has built a reputation for accessibility and liquidity. Brett’s appeal lies in its simplicity and cultural resonance. It’s more than just a token; it’s a symbol of a community uniting under a shared vision. Speculation about future listings on Binance and Coinbase adds an air of excitement. While Brett isn’t as dynamic as BTFD in terms of ecosystem innovation, it’s a solid choice for those looking for a reliable meme coin with potential for long-term gains. If you’re after the best meme coins to join today, Brett offers a different kind of opportunity—one rooted in community and steady growth. Popcat: Volatile, Unpredictable, and Intriguing Popcat is the wildcard of this trio. As a Solana-based meme coin, it’s gained a reputation for its extreme volatility and unpredictable price swings. Trading at $1.31 with a market cap of $1.21 billion, Popcat has attracted a mix of risk-tolerant investors and meme enthusiasts. Recent market trends have been a rollercoaster. Popcat saw an 11% decline over 24 hours in December, showcasing just how unpredictable it can be. Yet, analysts see potential for a 25% rally, with a price target of $1.53. It’s a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario. What makes Popcat unique is its cultural cachet. Despite downturns, it’s occasionally outperformed stalwarts like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its presence in the meme coin sector speaks volumes about its staying power. However, Popcat’s volatility is a double-edged sword. While it offers opportunities for quick gains, it requires a steady hand and a solid risk appetite. For those who love a good gamble, Popcat could be one of the best meme coins to join today. Just remember this cat’s got claws. Don’t Miss the Dip—Join the Movement The meme coin market is buzzing with opportunities, but few stand out like BTFD. With its record-breaking presale, innovative P2E game, and unbeatable staking rewards, it’s a no-brainer for those ready to seize the moment. Brett Coin offers stability and community, while Popcat brings the thrill of volatility. Based on current trends, BTFD’s crypto presale is a golden opportunity you don’t want to miss. With over $3.7 million already raised and a listing price set to soar, now’s the time to jump in. Visit the BTFD website and join the presale today.

With 2025 on the horizon, he believes clearer regulations will spark a massive rise in Bitcoin and the entire crypto market. But that’s not all—Morehead also revealed the top altcoins he’s backing to explode in value during the next Bitcoin bull run. Could these altcoins be the next big thing? Keep reading to find out why Morehead is so confident. This Could Be the Turning Point for Crypto Dan Morehead is especially confident that 2025 will be a turning point. He thinks the regulatory environment will become clearer, making it easier for big institutions to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. RAt the moment, most institutions have limited exposure to crypto. However, once the regulatory landscape becomes clearer, large institutional investors could bring a wave of capital into the market, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price to new heights—some even predict it could reach $1 million. Could the U.S. Build a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve? One of Morehead’s most intriguing ideas is that the U.S. might create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . He highlighted that the U.S. already owns around 1% of the world’s Bitcoin and believes it could increase its holdings. Morehead sees this as a smart move, positioning Bitcoin as a key asset in the digital age, much like gold has been for centuries. Morehead’s Top Altcoins: TON, Solana, and ONDO While Bitcoin is always the main focus, Morehead is also backing several promising altcoins. He revealed that Pantera Capital has large positions in TON, Solana, and ONDO. These altcoins, he believes, have significant potential and could rise in value as Bitcoin leads the next bull run. His confidence in these tokens suggests they could see impressive growth in the near future. Trump’s WLFI’s Focus In another major development, World Liberty Financial, a company linked to former President Donald Trump, has recently swapped USDC stablecoins for well-known altcoins like Chainlink (LINK) and AAVE. This move shows that even traditional companies are starting to recognize the value of crypto. As more institutions embrace tokens like Chainlink and AAVE, the market is gaining traction among big players Looking Ahead As we approach 2025, the crypto market is on the verge of a major shift. With more institutional interest, clearer regulations, and strong altcoins, the stage is set for a crypto boom.

The firm also expects Solana (SOL) to surpass $500 and Sui (SUI) to rise above $10. According to VanEck, the crypto bull market is expected to reach a medium-term peak in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025, followed by a 30% pullback for Bitcoin and a sharper 60% decline for altcoins in the summer. However, the firm predicts a recovery and new market highs by the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2025 thanks to increasing adoption and market momentum. VanEck’s comprehensive report outlines several milestones for the crypto industry in 2025, including: Bitcoin Adoption: The US is expected to adopt Bitcoin, potentially adding it to strategic reserves and encouraging widespread crypto adoption. Tokenized Securities: The value of tokenized securities is expected to exceed $50 billion, signaling a shift towards blockchain-based financial assets. Stablecoins and DeFi Growth: Stablecoins are predicted to process $300 billion worth of transactions daily, while decentralized finance (DeFi) could reach record levels with $4 trillion in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume and $200 billion in total value locked (TVL).

The cryptocurrency surged 4.5% to near the $5 barrier for the second time this week, fueling investors’ optimism about the token’s future price action. Related Reading: Ethereum: Analysts Eye $4,100 Target As ETH Reclaims Key Support Level SUI Nears $5 After New ATH SUI has been one of the leading cryptocurrencies this bull run, rising over 521% year-to-date (YTD) and nearly 182% since Q4 started. The token also outperformed the market throughout the Q2 and Q3 retraces, registering massive gains while most altcoins struggled. As the crypto market started to gain steam in preparations for the US elections, SUI saw a brief consolidation period after surpassing its March ATH. The token hovered between the $1.7-$2.3 price range before continuing the “price discovery” mode in November. The post-US election pump propelled the cryptocurrency’s price past the $3 barrier and near the $4 mark before retracing. Nonetheless, SUI’s momentum resumed on December 5 when it hit the $4.5 mark, fueled by Bitcoin’s first-ever surge above $100,000. The token’s rally continued this week, with SUI registering a 14% increase in the last seven days, which led to its latest $4.92 milestone on Friday morning. SUI’s remarkable performance also drove the token to the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after flipping Polkadot (DOT). SUI’s Price To Peak In June? Amid SUI’s performance, several analysts noted that the token, often called “Solana’s “killer,” seems to be repeating SOL’s 2021 path. Market watcher Mags compared the two charts, suggesting investors won’t be ready for SUI’s upcoming movements. During the 2020-2021 cycle, Solana saw a massive rally that drove its price to its previous ATH. Its price action saw SOL gain steam at the end of 2020 and surge to its first major high of the year in May 2021. Then, Solana consolidated for a few months before resuming its run, peaking at $259 in late November 2021. According to Ali Martinez, SUI’s performance earlier this year resembled Solana’s initial climb last cycle, jumping to its $2.3 high before consolidating for a few months. Now that it has broken past its March ATH, SUI continues to move similarly to SOL, which could suggest that the token is poised for a massive surge soon. If it continues this pattern, the cryptocurrency could hit the $5 mark in the coming days after a brief consolidation in the $4.5-$4.8 price range. Trader Crypto Rand highlighted that SUI is in “full bullish momentum,” also forecasting it will hit the $5 mark soon.

Another pseudonym crypto trader predicted that the token could be near the $8 barrier by early 2025 and hit the $16 mark by Q2, following SOL’s path. Based on the chart, SUI could see its rally extended until June 2025, when it would hit its peak around the $40 mark.

37624846,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627328,1734166635,SEC Commissioner Crenshaw’s renomination faces time limit,"Caroline Crenshaw’s reappointment as SEC Commissioner is uncertain. The Senate has rescheduled the vote for her return for Wednesday, December 20, at 9:30 AM. Delays and strong opposition from the crypto industry have left little time before the Senate finishes for the year. The outcome will affect cryptocurrency rules and the Ripple case. Crenshaw’s renomination hangs in the balance as the U.S. Senate has just a few days left before adjourning for the year. Delays, disagreements, and opposition from the crypto industry have turned her reappointment into a tight race against the deadline. To confirm Crenshaw, two key votes are needed: one by the Senate Banking Committee and another by the full Senate. However, time is short. Senator Sherrod Brown must give three days’ notice for a committee vote, and even if it happens soon, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will have just two days to schedule the full Senate vote. With the Senate focused on budget and defense bills, there’s little time left for Crenshaw’s nomination. Recent delays have made things worse. On December 11, a committee vote was delayed due to scheduling rules. Republican Senators, led by Tim Scott, stopped a waiver that would have let the committee meet longer. Now, Senator Brown must reschedule the vote, but with little time left, completing the entire confirmation process seems unlikely. Crypto industry opposes Crenshaw’s SEC renomination Crenshaw’s renomination faces strong opposition from the crypto community, with arguments that her strict regulations hurt innovation. She has been outspoken against spot Bitcoin ETFs and is skeptical about the crypto market overall. The Digital Chamber, a group supporting blockchain and digital assets, has asked the Senate Banking Committee to reject Crenshaw’s renomination. In a December 11 letter , the group called for an SEC Commissioner who supports innovation while ensuring proper regulation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has also criticized Crenshaw, calling her a failure and urging lawmakers to block her reappointment. The Cedar Innovation Foundation, a dark-money group linked to undisclosed crypto interests, has launched a digital ad campaign portraying Crenshaw as “more anti-crypto than Gensler.” Decision has ramifications for Ripple and the SEC leadership Crenshaw’s renomination is important for both the Ripple case and the SEC’s crypto policies. If reappointed, she could influence whether the SEC moves forward with its appeal in the Ripple case, with a deadline of January 15. This situation is similar to former SEC Chair Jay Clayton’s decision to file the Ripple lawsuit before leaving. Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is stepping down on January 20, might file the appeal brief as one of his last actions. Additionally, Crenshaw’s renomination could affect the SEC’s future approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. If she isn’t reappointed, a new commissioner from former President Trump’s team could bring a more crypto-friendly perspective to the SEC. Democrats have been making a push to confirm Crenshaw before they lose their Senate majority in January. Some critics believe this rush is a strategic move to secure Crenshaw’s role and keep the SEC’s current regulatory approach in place. Although Democratic senators support Crenshaw, the strong pushback from the crypto industry and delays in the process make her renomination uncertain. If all the Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee vote for her, her nomination could move to the full Senate. But with limited time left and growing opposition, it’s unclear whether she’ll be confirmed. Whether she stays at the SEC or is replaced will have a big impact on the agency, crypto regulations, and the ongoing Ripple case. The next few days are crucial in deciding the future of the SEC and its approach to cryptocurrency.

XRP has been one of the top performers over the past six weeks, having recently reclaimed and retained the $2 level . Despite this, some commentaries suggest the altcoin still trades below its fair market value due to several factors contributing to price suppression.The Collateralization ModelNotably, last year, venture capital firm Valhil Capital compiled several models seeking to assess XRP's fair market value under certain conditions. Interestingly, a bold valuation model, the Collateralization Model, suggests that XRP could has a fair market value of $122,580.This evaluation sees a future where global financial systems are tokenized, and XRP becomes the foundation for collateralizing assets worldwide. Developed by Valhil Capital, the model examines the total global wealth and tokenization's impact on XRP's role as a store of value.Interestingly, the Collateralization Model assumes that all global assets, including real estate, derivatives, central bank reserves, and commodities, are tokenized on the XRPL, the underlying blockchain for XRP. The Ripple CTO David Schwartz already confirmed that the XRPL is pivoting to RWA tokenization.This ambitious scenario sees a future where blockchain technology represents the full spectrum of global wealth. Notably, the goal is to determine XRP's value as a universal collateral asset in a highly interconnected, tokenized financial system.Further, the methodology stresses XRP’s ability to secure assets rather than drive transactions. The model’s assumptions include full tokenization of global wealth and the use of XRP to collateralize this value.XRP Fair Market Value at $122,580The evaluation considers the world's total wealth, which is estimated at $5.3 quadrillion. When it applies a 1.25x risk adjustment ratio and calculates the present value of tokenized assets, the model estimates a total tokenized economy of $6.2 quadrillion by 2030.Notably, dividing this value by XRP's circulating supply of 50.7 billion tokens results in the projected value of $122,580 per token.The Collateralization Model puts an emphasis on XRP’s potential in the tokenization scene . However, challenges remain. Tokenizing all assets globally would face technological and regulatory setbacks. Moreover, unknown values not in the analysis could affect the accuracy of this valuation.Despite these challenges, the model notes the possibility of a blockchain-based future where XRP’s value syncs with its utility. Currently, XRP changes hands at $2.4, trading far below this fair market estimate. However, this is not a price prediction but rather an analysis of XRP’s theoretical fair value under ideal conditions.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/collateralization-model-sets-xrp-fair-market-value-at-122580/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=collateralization-model-sets-xrp-fair-market-value-at-122580,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

While Bitcoin was speculated to lose the $95,000 support after just one test, the sluggish behaviour of Ethereum has also raised many concerns. Meanwhile, the latest recovery of the BTC price has revived the possibility of a healthy ascending trend with the ETH price, and the second-largest token continues to follow the star crypto pretty closely. The ETH price has been maintaining a steep ascending trend since the start of the quarter, and hence, despite the bearish interference, it is believed to slice through the important resistance levels. The major reason for the continuation of the bullish momentum this upcoming week is the strong on-chain metrics, like a massive rise in the daily active addresses. The Intotheblock data shared by popular analyst Ali , the active addresses are up by over 4.24%, while the new addresses surged by 2.65%. Meanwhile, the zero-balance addresses have plunged by over 4%, suggesting that market participants are optimistic about the upcoming trend. With this, the ETH price has surged above the crucial resistance levels between $3700 and $3810, wherein more than 3 million wallets have bought over 4.6 million ETH. Therefore, the traders are now confident of a potential weekend jump, which may help the price to break $5000 as demand and supply dynamics strengthen. The end of the sluggish behaviour of the ETH price can be determined by the growing strength of Ethereum against Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC pair is stuck within a descending parallel channel, and regardless of a rebound, the levels do not display any possibility of a steep rise. As seen in the above chart, the weekly ETH/BTC pair has failed to rise above the average bands of the channel with a rise in the bearish activity. Moreover, the bearish pattern remains intact since Q4 2022, suggesting the second-largest token failing to trade independently. Therefore, it is required for the BTC price to rise above the current ATH, which may help the ETH price to not only cross $4000 but also achieve the important resistance at $4200. This move may slightly increase the strength of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin, which could compel the ETH/BTC to surpass the average levels of the band and eventually elevate close to the resistance. Back in 2021, the ETH/BTC broke above the consolidation and soared high to mark highs which enabled the price to mark a new ATH. Therefore, a breakout of the ongoing consolidation may also have an equal impact over the Ethereum (ETH) price rally, which may rise and reach a 5-digit level in the upcoming bull run.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/after-bitcoin-this-popular-crypto-is-ready-to-explode-will-it-end-2024-with-20-gains/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Crenshaw’s SEC Re-Appointment Raises Concern appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Well, here we are again. Caroline Crenshaw’s leadership at the SEC has the crypto world on edge. Her strong stance on digital assets, combined with controversial votes, has raised questions about whether she is the right person to lead the commission. With her reconfirmation now on the table, the stakes are high, especially for those in the cryptocurrency industry. What’s all the stir about? A Troubling Track Record with Crypto Crenshaw’s track record with crypto has been far from favorable. She’s called the markets “petri dishes of fraudulent conduct,” which hasn’t won her many fans in the crypto community. Her vote against the spot Bitcoin ETF was seen by many as a setback to crypto’s ongoing efforts to become a bigger part of the financial world. Crenshaw’s supporters argue that her actions are all about protecting investors. The crypto market has faced its share of scams and shady practices, and Crenshaw believes caution is key to reducing risks for everyday people, particularly when it comes to fraud and manipulation in the markets. Source : X.com High Time for Good Change Tyler Winklevoss , CEO of Gemini, has been a vocal critic of the SEC’s approach under Democratic leadership. He claims that the agency has lost credibility and that its enforcement-driven methods aren’t effective. Winklevoss believes the SEC’s current stance is causing more harm than good, pointing to a history of lost court cases. He suggests that a change in leadership, particularly with a GOP-led SEC, could bring back balance and credibility to the commission. Why Democrats Are Still Backing Her While some in the crypto community criticize her , Crenshaw has strong backing from Democrats. Her priority? Protecting regular investors. She has pushed for stricter regulations, more transparency, and a safer market for everyday people. At least that’s what we know! For many Democrats, this is a good thing, as they view crypto as a threat to the financial system. They believe it could destabilize the economy, and Crenshaw is seen as someone who can help curb those risks. She has also supported building a framework to regulate digital assets. Democrats see this as a necessary step to avoid potential market crashes. With the SEC already under a microscope, Crenshaw’s reconfirmation could ensure consistency in how things are handled. What’s at Stake for Crypto? If Crenshaw is reconfirmed, the crypto sector may face tougher regulations. This could lead to more enforcement actions, stricter rules, and fewer approvals for crypto ETFs. While this would align with the Democrats’ goal of financial stability, it could also limit the growth and innovation of the crypto industry. With uncertainty ahead, the crypto market’s resilience will be put to the test, but so too will the regulators determined to keep it in check.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crenshaw-and-the-sec-what-cryptos-really-worried-about/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The conversation highlighted key developments and speculations, including potential pro-crypto policies under a new U.S. administration and rumors about Ripple’s leadership meeting with former President Donald Trump. BREAKING: MICHAEL SAYLOR & PATRICK BET-DAVID DISCUSS $XRP & RIPPLE CEO MEETING WITH TRUMP! “The community with XRP & @Ripple , has anything changed since you and I were last together?” — @patrickbetdavid “I think you’ll have a pro-digital assets SEC, a pro-digital assets… pic.twitter.com/yxrnc7G5lU — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) December 13, 2024 Pro-Crypto Regulatory Shift Michael Saylor, a well-known advocate for Bitcoin and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, expressed optimism about a potential shift in U.S. policy favoring digital assets. He predicted that by January, the U.S. could see a “pro-digital assets SEC, a pro-digital assets Treasury, a pro-digital assets White House, and a pro-digital assets House and Senate.” Saylor emphasized the need for an ethically, technically, and economically sound regulatory framework to ensure the growth and prosperity of the cryptocurrency sector. Saylor also critiqued the outdated financial compliance systems that hinder innovation and capital formation. He questioned the logic of imposing excessive compliance costs on smaller companies seeking to raise capital, arguing that such policies stifle economic freedom and progress. Ripple’s Growing Influence Saylor acknowledged Ripple’s efforts in exploring use cases beyond Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, noting the proposed launch of Ripple’s RLUSD and its advancements in tokenized assets on the XRP Ledger. These developments underscore Ripple’s commitment to expanding the functionality of blockchain technology and highlight its potential impact on the future of finance.

The outcome of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC could set a precedent for how digital assets are classified and regulated in the U.S. Furthermore, Saylor’s comments reflect a broader sentiment within the industry that a supportive regulatory environment is essential for fostering innovation and ensuring global competitiveness. XRP Community Reactions The crypto community has responded enthusiastically to the video, with many expressing optimism about the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment. Some view Saylor’s recognition of XRP and Ripple’s broader use cases as a significant shift, given his historical focus on Bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency. The conversation also highlighted the diverse perspectives within the crypto space, from Elon Musk’s involvement with Dogecoin and Bitcoin to Ripple’s focus on cross-border payments and tokenized assets. This diversity illustrates the dynamic nature of the industry and its capacity to address various economic and technological challenges.

37624269,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627329,1734165453,Telegram removes 15 million illicit groups with AI,"Telegram has removed about 15 million illicit groups on its messaging platform using artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last few months, the platform has been under immense pressure to purge its messaging application of illicit content. The pressure led to the arrest of its CEO Pavel Durov in France, where he faces charges over the harmful and illegal content shared on the application. While Durov, who has had his first day in court, is still under strict restriction, the platform seems to have gotten to work. According to Telegram , it has now removed more than 15.4 million illicit groups and channels related to fraud and other illegal activities. In its statement, Telegram highlighted that the feat was achieved using cutting-edge artificial intelligence moderation tools. The move comes after the platform announced a crackdown in September, with Durov noting that they were trying to comply with government requests. Telegram launches new moderation page to monitor efforts The new moderation page aligns with the company’s policy of transparency in its dealings. According to a post from Durov’s Telegram page, the company wants the public to see its efforts at combating these illicit activities. He noted that the moderation team has been working behind the scenes over the last few months, removing the contents that violated its terms, and thanking the users for their help in curbing the menace. Durov promised to bring regular updates that users can see in real-time, showing how much work the moderation team is doing. Telegram moderation overview in 2024. Source: Telegram According to the moderation page, the platform has carried out a higher rate of enforcement after Durov’s arrest. The page notes that the removal of illicit accounts has been in effect since 2015. Blocked illegal groups and channels currently stand at about 15,474,022, representing the figure for only 2024. Telegram also increased its crackdown on Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM) this year, banning a total of 703,809 groups and channels. Aside from user reports and the proactive work from the moderation team, Telegram also reported thousands of instances processed via third-party organizations against CSAM, leading to instant bans. Breaking down the figure, it highlights the top four groups that provided the most reports, including the Internet Watch Foundation, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Child, the Canadian Center for Child Protection, and Stitching Offlimits. Since 2016, Telegram has actively combated violence and terrorist propaganda by providing daily updates on its efforts, which have been recognized by Europol. The company noted that it has worked with numerous organizations on these fronts since 2022, banning 100 million terrorist content. In 2024, Telegram revealed it blocked 129,099 terrorism-related content. Durov’s continued restriction amid moves to combat illicit materials Durov will continue to be under the watchful eyes of French authorities after his first day in court. The Telegram CEO was accompanied by his legal counsel, answering several questions related to the platform’s activities. Although Durov refused to comment on the case after the session, he noted his belief in the French justice system and his innocence. However, if he is found guilty, he could spend up to 10 years in prison, in addition to a $550,000 fine. Meanwhile, Telegram recently announced a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), signaling an attempt to combat illicit child sexual exploitation materials shared on the platform. The charity will identify, and remove these materials, using its cutting-edge AI tools. IWF’s CEO, Derek Ray-Hill, mentioned the great feats both firms could achieve together. “ We look forward to seeing what further steps we can take together to create a world in which the spread of online sexual abuse material is virtually impossible ,” he said.

37625012,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52032,1734165056,Why Long-Term Holders Are Choosing FX Guys Over Synthetix and SolarX,"When it comes to long-term crypto investments, savvy investors look for projects that offer both stability and significant growth potential. While Synthetix and SolarX have carved out niches in decentralized finance (DeFi), an emerging contender, FX Guys , is turning heads with its innovative ecosystem. Here’s why FXGuys is increasingly favored by long-term holders over these established platforms. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE FX Guys: Redefining DeFi and Trading At its core, FXGuys merges the worlds of decentralized finance and proprietary trading. Positioned as a Top PropFi Project, it combines the benefits of staking and trading rewards to offer a robust value proposition for investors. The platform’s $FXG token is gaining traction due to its utility in the ecosystem, particularly with its unique Trade2Earn program, which rewards users for every trade they make. For long-term holders, these features provide consistent incentives to remain engaged in the platform, setting the FXguys apart from competitors like Synthetix and SolarX . Why Long-Term Holders Prefer FX Guys 1. High Rewards Through Staking Long-term investors love assets that provide passive income. With FXGuys , staking $FXG tokens allows holders to earn a 20% profit and revenue share from broker trading volumes. This feature not only rewards loyalty but also drives engagement, ensuring the token’s value remains stable and promising over time. In comparison, while Synthetix offers synthetic assets, it lacks the hands-on, trade-driven rewards that make FXGuys so appealing. 2. Trader Funding Program for Greater Market Access The Trader Funding Program by FX Guys opens opportunities for retail traders to scale their trading activities. By successfully completing trading evaluations, traders can access accounts with up to $500,000 in trading capital, splitting profits 80/20 in their favor. This initiative has positioned FXGuys as one of the best proprietary trading firms, giving traders a chance to maximize their earning potential in a structured, secure environment. For long-term holders, such programs ensure a continuous influx of activity on the platform, further boosting token demand and value. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 3. No Buy/Sell Tax and Decentralized Trading Another major advantage for FXGuys investors is the platform’s no buy or sell tax policy. Combined with no KYC decentralized trading , it ensures a seamless and secure experience for users across the globe. These features make the FXguys attractive to privacy-conscious traders and investors, providing them with the flexibility they need. While SolarX focuses on sustainability and green blockchain initiatives, it doesn’t provide the same direct financial incentives or seamless trading experience that FXGuys offers. How FX Guys Stands Out From the Competition Unlike other platforms, FXGuys isn’t just a DeFi project; it’s a complete ecosystem for traders and investors alike. Whether through the Trade2Earn program, staking opportunities, or its custom trading platform—compatible with MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade— The FX Guys ensures users have multiple avenues to earn and grow their wealth. The ongoing presale of FXGuys, now in its Stage 2, has already raised over $2.6 million, with the token priced at just $0.04. These impressive numbers showcase the growing confidence in the project and its potential as one of the top DeFi coins for the future. Why FX Guys Is a Smart Long-Term Investment For investors seeking high potential altcoins , FXGuys offers a unique blend of DeFi rewards and trading benefits. By staking $FXG tokens , holders can enjoy passive income, while the Trader Funding Program creates continuous activity on the platform, driving token utility. The Trade2Earn initiative further solidifies FXGuys as a leader in incentivized trading ecosystems. In contrast, while Synthetix excels in creating synthetic assets and SolarX focuses on eco-friendly blockchain solutions, neither matches the holistic benefits provided by FXGuys . >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion: FX Guys Is Leading the Way With its Stage 2 presale raising over $2.6 million and a promising future in the crypto trading and DeFi space, FXGuys is quickly becoming the go-to choice for long-term holders. Its innovative approach—combining staking , Trade2Earn , and the Trader Funding Program —ensures a thriving ecosystem that benefits both traders and investors. For those looking to build sustainable wealth, FXGuys provides a compelling alternative to Synthetix and SolarX . Whether you’re a trader or a long-term investor, the opportunities with The FX Guys are unmatched.

XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and partnerships with financial institutions worldwide have expanded, making it a cornerstone of blockchain adoption in traditional finance. Recent integrations with major banks and payment platforms highlight XRP’s growing role as a bridge between fiat and digital currencies. Ripple’s efforts to expand into Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) further bolster XRP’s use case, giving it a unique edge in a highly competitive market.

37623839,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26409,1734164985,Early Bitcoin Investor Sentenced for Tax Evasion on $4M in Crypto Gains,"An early Bitcoin investor from Austin, Texas, has become the first person criminally charged for failing to report crypto capital gains, involving about $4 million in cryptocurrencies. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Frank Richard Ahlgren III, a Bitcoin investor, “falsely underreported the (realized) capital gains” from selling Bitcoin worth $3.7 million between 2017 and 2019. The DOJ stated: “All taxpayers are required to report any sale proceeds and gains or losses from the sale of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, on a tax return.” Ahlgren began investing in Bitcoin in 2011 and purchased 1,366 BTC on Coinbase in 2015 when Bitcoin was under $500. In October 2017, he sold approximately 640 BTC at an average price of $5,807.53, generating $3.7 million, which he reinvested in real estate. However, discrepancies were found in Ahlgren’s 2017 federal income tax return. “Ahlgren then filed a false 2017 federal income tax return that substantially inflated the cost basis of the bitcoins, thereby underreporting his true capital gain from his sale of bitcoins,” the DOJ noted. In addition, Ahlgren failed to report over $650,000 in Bitcoin sales in 2018 and 2019. He attempted to conceal the movement of funds using wallet transfers, crypto mixers, and in-person cash transactions. The DOJ revealed: “In total, the tax loss from Ahlgren’s criminal conduct was over $1 million.” Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart Goldberg commented that Ahlgren’s underreporting and concealment “earned him a two-year sentence.” In a landmark decision, the two-year sentence marks the “first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered solely on cryptocurrency,” according to Lucy Tan, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Houston Field Office. Tan stated, “Ahlgren will serve time because he believed his cryptocurrency transactions were untraceable.” Ahlgren has also been ordered to serve one year of supervised release and pay $1.1 million in restitution to the U.S. government.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/early-bitcoin-investor-sentenced-for-tax-evasion-on-4m-in-crypto-gains/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Ripple has officially begun following the X Verified account, igniting widespread discussion in the cryptocurrency community about the possibility of XRP integrating into X Payments, the platform’s upcoming payment system. Crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) highlighted this possibility in a recent post , suggesting that big things are coming for the digital asset. Her sentiment aligns with the broader enthusiasm in the crypto sector, which views XRP’s potential integration into X Payments as a milestone for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.

The excitement surrounding this potential partnership is fueled by XRP’s strong market performance and an evolving regulatory landscape in the U.S. XRP recently surpassed $2 for the first time since 2018 and briefly reached $2.86, its highest level in over five years. Ripple’s momentum coincides with significant changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation effective January 20, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly figure who has previously shown interest in the XRP lawsuit , as Gensler’s successor. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market participants anticipate that the incoming administration may foster a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, including resolving the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The cryptocurrency community views these developments as pivotal, particularly for Ripple’s prospects in the U.S. market. The regulatory clarity could open new avenues for XRP adoption, including its integration into mainstream platforms like X. Following the final ruling in August and before the SEC appealed the case, Fred Rispoli, a prominent attorney and popular figure on X, recently called on Musk to integrate XRP into X Payments as a way to get back at the SEC for its pattern of unnecessary legal actions against Musk and the crypto world. However, instead of an act of defiance, Musk’s integration of XRP can be done properly under the new, crypto-friendly administration. An X employee also revealed earlier in the year that XRP would be integrated into X Payments , and it’s only a matter of time before the digital asset receives the spotlight it deserves.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports.

Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-gold-elongold-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37625008,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52132,1734163531,Can Dogecoin Reach $0.5? Analysts Are Betting On These Altcoins Instead,"Dogecoin is facing a major setback after a hacker crashed 69% of its network nodes. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is picking up bullish momentum as top market experts predict a $20 price target for the AI coin. Meanwhile, Rollblock is dominating Q4’s altseason already by raising more than $7 million during its viral presale. Dogecoin (DOGE) Hacker Crashes 69% Network Nodes by Exploiting Vulnerability Dogecoin investors have raised genuine concerns about security in Dogecoin’s ecosystem since the network was recently infiltrated by a hacker. Although this hack was carried out by known cryptocurrency expert Andreas Kohl, it is still making analysts question Dogecoin’s future potential. Since Kohl easily crashed nearly 70% of Dogecoin’s network nodes, analysts believe Dogecoin’s price will experience a setback after this major security concern. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.4018 after an intraday dip of 2.36%. Dogecoin’s volume has already crashed by 35.81% which suggests low network activity. Since Dogecoin’s MACD indicator is also flashing strong sell signals, Dogecoin’s price could retrace towards the $0.3482 support trendline. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Gains Traction in Crypto AI Space Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has experienced a 36.77% increase in value during the last month as whales showed interest in AI coins. Since Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is the fifth largest AI coin in terms of market cap, analysts believe Artificial Superintelligence Alliance could retest its critical resistance at $2 within the next few days. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is currently trading for $1.76 after an intraday increase worth 1.42%. If Artificial Superintelligence Alliance can break above the $2.10 mark, the token’s price could experience a massive rally towards the $20 mark. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s technical indicators support the bullish trend as the token’s RSI is in neutral territory. If Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s MACD indicator turns positive soon, investors can expect a massive AI coin rally before the end of Q4. Rollblock’s (RBLK) GambleFi Project to Experience Massive100x Rally in Early 2025 Rollblock’s viral GambleFi project is already poised for a massive 100x rally because of its impressive features, native RBLK utility token and attractive staking rewards. Since Rollblock’s gaming library combines features of both decentralized and centralized gaming, analysts believe this new project will mark a significant revolution in the GameFi world. If these bullish predictions stand true, Rollblock’s price could jump by 880% even before the end of its presale stages. Since Rollblock is committed to user experience, the platform offers a massive collection of 7,000+ AI-powered games that are all audited and regulated by SolidProof and Gaming Curacao. All bets placed on any of these games are automatically encrypted on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain which makes Rollblock the most secure iGambling platform in the market. To make things even better, Rollblock also allows users to view transparent betting analytics which can help improve their odds of winning over time. Rollblock’s entire ecosystem is powered by the platform’s native RBLK token which also functions as an independent utility token on the open market. This means traders can add RBLK to their staking pools and start earning a weekly passive income through Rollblock’s revenue sharing model. Since Rollblock pays staking rewards with up to 30% APYs through a token buyback and burn mechanism, analysts expect RBLK’s price to remain under deflationary pressure on the open market. For a limited time, Rollblock is selling its native RBLK tokens for a low price of only $0.041. Since this low price is only to break barriers to entry, market experts are predicting another huge demand-induced price jump before the end of this week.

37623035,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312782,1734163452,Wrapped Bitcoin Custodian BiT Global Sues Coinbase After November WBTC Delisting,"New court documents show that BiT Global, a custodian of Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), is suing Coinbase after the top US-based crypto exchange delisted wBTC in November. In a new complaint, BiT Global accuses Coinbase of using wBTC – the tokenized representation of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain – as a “cash grab” before ultimately delisting it and replacing it with its own version of the asset. “In the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab. It saw a competitor, wBTC, that had something it wanted: an innovative product that released value inherent in Bitcoin and let users utilize that value in bold new ways… Coinbase decided it would take what it wanted. Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform – and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC.” According to BiT Global, similar actions were taken against competitors years ago by tech giants such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook. BiT Global goes on to say that Coinbase’s actions were in violation of US commerce laws as they were an attempt to monopolize the market and intentionally debase wBTC. “Coinbase engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct to accomplish [its] monopolization. It has used its dominant power in one market – the market for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States – to attempt to exclude wBTC from that market. It has made false statements about the reasons for its delisting (with implications that the delisting was based on an in-depth review of wBTC using neutral standards, and implications that Coinbase possesses damaging information about wBTC which caused the delisting). These activities have created ‘FUD’ (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) surrounding wBTC and were part of an intentional strategy to do so.” On November 20th, Coinbase announced that after its most recent review, it would suspend trading for WBTC on December 19th. Coinbase first announced Coinbase Wrapped BTC ( cbBTC ) – its own wrapped version of the crypto king – earlier this year. wBTC is trading for $101,122 at time of writing, a 1.7% increase during the last 24 hours.

37622902,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/illegal-cryptocurrency-mining-likely-behind-irans-rolling-blackouts,1734163260,Illegal Cryptocurrency Mining Likely Behind Iran’s Rolling Blackouts,"Illegal cryptocurrency mining has emerged as a significant contributor to the major power outages experienced in Iran’s capital city, Tehran and neighbouring provinces over October and November. While authorities listed several causes for the rolling blackouts, illegal crypto mining was found to be one of the biggest causes of Iran’s power crisis. Crypto Miners Exploit Iran’s Government-Subsidized Electricity Iran’s capital city, Tehran and its neighbouring provinces faced a major power crisis in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people’s lives and businesses. While several factors are likely involved in the disruptions, illegal cryptocurrency mining has been named a major contributing factor. Iran’s government-subsidized electricity has become a global hotspot for crypto mining since 2022. With the world's lowest estimated cost of mining, many cryptocurrency miners have exploited the country’s cheap electricity. Cryptocurrency mining was able to resume in 2022 after the Iranian government lifted a four-month ban on these energy-consuming activities after multiple cities across the country suffered crippling blackouts. After the government lifted the ban, Iran said crypto mining could continue , but only under strict conditions. Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade (MIMT) said it would only issue licenses to mining farms supplied by power from renewable energy sources to ease the stress on power plans and avoid blackouts. Electricity in Iran costs a mere $0.002 per kilowatt-hour, the lowest in the world by a large margin, according to data by Statista . The cost of mining one Bitcoin in Iran is estimated to be around $1,320, compared to the $100,000 it costs in the United States or the $300,000 in Ireland. Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, CEO of Iran’s state electricity company, Tavanir, recently highlighted the impact of illegal mining activities on the region’s power grid. Mashhadi explained that the power used by 230,000 unlicensed devices equals the total electricity demand of a key manufacturing hub, the Markazi province. News agency Iran International reported the capital introduced “a bounty of 1 million toman” to incentivize citizens to report unlicensed crypto mining equipment. The bounty , roughly $24 at the current exchange rate, came into play as the country faced power shortages amid a severe heatwave that recorded temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country. Mashhadi explained the challenges to Iran International, stating: “Opportunistic individuals have been exploiting subsidized electricity and public networks to mine cryptocurrencies without proper authorization. This unauthorized mining has led to an abnormal surge in electricity consumption, causing significant disruptions and problems within the country's power grid.” Sanctions and Geo-Political Tension Drive Iran to Turn to Crypto Iran has embraced cryptocurrency to mitigate economic challenges and circumvent US-imposed sanctions that restrict the country’s access to global financial networks. The low-cost energy framework and increased need for ways to participate in the international economic framework have forced the country to participate in the cryptocurrency arena. Last week, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) approved a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies to balance the oversight of the industry with economic development. The Tehran Times reported the country is taking a unified approach to regulating the industry with a policy mandating licensing for crypto brokers and custodians to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws, counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules, and tax obligations.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced some notable shifts recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 8.43%, indicating a short-term decline. However, over the last month, SHIB’s price increased by 5.44%, showing signs of recovery. Looking at the bigger picture, the price has surged by 34.42% over six months, highlighting significant long-term growth. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00002805 and $0.00003489. The nearest support level is at $0.00002390. If the price dips to this point, it would mean a decrease of about 15%. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $0.00003759. Breaking through this could lead to gains of around 30%. If momentum continues, SHIB might reach the second resistance at $0.00004442, offering further potential growth. If Dogecoin gains upward momentum and breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.54, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.64. This would represent a potential increase of approximately 28% from its current price. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.35, it might decline to the second support at $0.25, a decrease of around 39%. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they could signal the next significant move in Dogecoin’s price. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.41 and $0.50. Over the past week, its price has decreased by 4.86%. In the past month, it has seen a growth of 7.10%. Looking back six months, Dogecoin’s price has surged by 198.68%. This shows that while there has been a slight dip recently, the long-term trend remains positive. Based on the data, Dogecoin’s momentum appears neutral. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47.38, which is in the middle range, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The MACD level is at -0.0013236, suggesting slight bearish momentum. The Stochastic oscillator reads 41.54, supporting a neutral stance. These indicators suggest that Dogecoin’s price might consolidate before making a significant move. If Dogecoin gains upward momentum and breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.54, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.64. This would represent a potential increase of approximately 28% from its current price. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.35, it might decline to the second support at $0.25, a decrease of around 39%. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they could signal the next significant move in Dogecoin’s price. Conclusion While SHIB and DOGE remain popular, XYZVerse (XYZ) is set to dominate by uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem, targeting massive growth with its unique meme and sports blend.

Plus, the Bulls Squad, an exclusive NFT-powered club, adds an extra layer of community-driven benefits. Let’s talk numbers. If you invest $5,000 at Stage 12, where the current price is $0.00013, you’d snag a whopping 38,461,538 BTFD tokens. Now, if BTFD hits its projected presale-end price of $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $23,076—an ROI of over 360%. That’s not just an opportunity; it’s a call to action.

Inspired by the everyday hustle of squirrels preparing for winter, PNUT’s branding taps into a sense of light-hearted fun and relatability. But make no mistake—there’s more to this coin than just cute cartoons. What sets PNUT apart is its focus on gamification and community-building. Holders gain access to a squirrel-themed universe filled with NFT collectibles, where they can participate in games and earn rewards. PNUT has also teased an ecosystem expansion that includes a charity initiative focused on environmental conservation—because who doesn’t want to save trees while stacking crypto? Investors are flocking to PNUT not just for its unique theme but also for its explosive growth potential. It’s already making waves on social media, with Gen Z and Millennials latching onto its cheeky charm and feel-good vibes. Plus, its relatively low entry cost makes it an easy addition to any meme coin portfolio. Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel combines whimsy with purpose, offering a fun yet meaningful investment opportunity that appeals to both the heart and wallet. It’s quirky, it’s fresh, and it’s primed to ride the meme coin momentum. Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Meme Coin with Real-World Utility Floki Inu isn’t just another dog-themed token—it’s a movement. Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, FLOKI has carved out a unique niche, blending meme culture with serious utility. And the results are stunning: FLOKI has already gained traction in NFTs, decentralised finance (DeFi), and real-world applications, proving that meme coins can be more than just a passing trend. What’s really exciting about FLOKI is its multi-pronged approach. From the Valhalla P2E metaverse to the FlokiFi DeFi suite, this token has diversified its offerings to ensure long-term relevance. FLOKI’s emphasis on education through the Floki University initiative is another feather in its cap, demonstrating a commitment to empowering its community with knowledge. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki Inu has proven itself as more than just a meme coin, with its blend of innovative features and community-driven initiatives. It’s got the charm, the hype, and the utility to make waves in the crypto world.

So the question becomes, will other trending Pepe alternatives, Turbo and Wall Street Pepe, explode next? Pepe Unchained Soars After Biggest ICO of 2024 Pepe Unchained is trading at a staggering $335 million market cap after launching just two days ago. Before its exchange launch, $PEPU underwent the biggest presale of 2024, raising $73 million. This was a massive commitment from the community, underlining just how much support this project had garnered. Pepe Unchained is not just a meme coin. It has built the first Pepe-themed Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. It’s 100x faster and much cheaper than the Ethereum main network, and it launched without a hiccup. Now, traders can buy, sell, and create meme coins with Ethereum’s security and Solana-grade scalability. As such, its out-the-gate success was no surprise. PEPE UNCHAINED L2 IS LIVE! Yesterday’s launch went off without a hitch. Our L2 network handled the massive volume effortlessly and is now ready to welcome the masses! Check out our official block explorer, Pepuscan, and witness this greatness firsthand.… pic.twitter.com/0EJ7itirOz — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 11, 2024 Currently, Pepe Unchained is trading at $0.04103, up 75% today and 336% since CoinMarketCap began tracking its price data on Tuesday. And its position as the number one trending token on CoinMarketCap provides a huge spotlight that could enable continued growth. On continued growth, analysts believe that Pepe Unchained has much more gains ahead. Analyst Says Gains Still to Come For PEPU Pepe Unchained has caused a huge buzz on social media, with top analysts hailing its early momentum and suggesting that it could become one of the top meme coins. 99Bitcoins analyst Jacob Bury dubbed Pepe Unchained a “success story” and suggests that the coin could “absolutely pump.” Bury underscored that Pepe Unchained’s price action shows real momentum, concluding that “we could see more continuation to the upside.” It’s also worth noting that the team has multiple high-potential moves planned for the forthcoming weeks. This includes the launch of Pepe Pump Pad, a no-code launchpad that allows anyone to create a meme coin in seconds. $PEPU will also launch on tier-1 exchanges, and there is speculation that Coinbase is interested, given its recent listings of Peanut the Squirrel, Moo Deng, and Turbo. $PEPU @pepe_unchained might be the next Coinbase listing. It’s day 2 and has reached $300Million MC. Wait until it’s given to the masses. $Wepe @WEPEToken will be the next gold mine. — Pallu Israel (@israel_pallu) December 11, 2024 Lastly, the Pepe Unchained team will purchase an add-in for Times Square, New York, to promote $PEPU in one of the world’s most iconic tourist attractions. We are ready. Are you? pic.twitter.com/xFddvk7FrU — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 6, 2024 So yes, Pepe Unchained still has room for growth. However, those seeking to maximize their returns are positioning in other projects that could explode even more. Turbo Can Rise, But Wall Street Pepe Is the Next Moonshot Pepe Unchained’s growth underlines the huge potential of Pepe alternatives. Right now, Turbo is another popular Pepe alternative, also claiming the title of “first AI-created meme coin.” The project has enjoyed notable success recently, especially after being listed on Coinbase this week. Given its Pepe roots and proximity to the AI meme coin narrative, analysts expect the token’s uptrend to continue. $TURBO price hit ATH #TURBO #TURBOUSDT pic.twitter.com/t0eiD9EsaX — HexaTrades (@HexaTrades) December 11, 2024 However, Turbo is already well-established, with a whopping $851 million market cap. While it can still rise from here, its upside is limited compared to a newer alternative, such as Wall Street Pepe . Traders are tipping Wall Street Pepe as the next Pepe Unchained, citing its similar launch pattern and innovative approach. Like Pepe Unchained, Wall Street Pepe has launched via a token presale, allowing traders to buy at a ground floor price. And also like Pepe Unchained, the project is focused on utility rather than pure memetics like the original Pepe. Wall Street Pepe brings in the high-octane energy of Wolf of Wall Street, aiming to turn its cohort of holders into profit-maximizing wolves. It’s doing this by equipping them with institutional-grade trading tools. This includes buy and sell signals, meme coin picks, data insights, a trading insider’s group, trading rewards, and even staking. RJ, the host on the Cryptonews YouTube channel, suggests that anyone who missed the Pepe Unchained presale could buy Wall Street Pepe as an alternative. The project’s presale is ongoing, and it has raised $6 million so far. The current price is $0.000211, but this will rise in three days.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/pepe-unchained-explodes-after-exchange-debut-turbo-wepe-to-follow/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Today, that figure has skyrocketed to 16.8%. Many believe that Binance’s influx of stablecoins has played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s recent rally, helping it hit the $100K mark. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters. Massive Stablecoin Inflows in 2024 Crypto analyst Darkfost reports that Binance saw at least $22 billion in stablecoin inflows in 2024 alone. He points out that what makes Binance stand out is its large share of the market. For example, on December 5, while OKX saw a $1.6 billion stablecoin netflow, Binance recorded a much higher $13 billion netflow. Binance’s Market Share Explosion Another analyst, joaowedson, highlights that Binance now controls 16.8% of the total stablecoin market cap. This is a dramatic increase from just 4% in March 2023, showing how much the exchange has grown in influence within the stablecoin market. Bitcoin’s recent jump to $100K has caught the attention of many experts. Some argue that Binance’s stablecoin inflows were a key factor in this rise. Larger stablecoin reserves improve liquidity, making it easier to execute large trades without causing big price swings. This helps push prices higher across the crypto market, especially for Bitcoin. Exchange Reserves Hold the Power According to joaowedson, exchanges like Binance control about 24.16% of the total stablecoin market cap. This concentration of stablecoins in the hands of exchanges means they have the power to influence crypto prices, including Bitcoin’s. As more stablecoins flow into Binance and other exchanges, they will likely continue to shape market trends and fuel further price rallies. The growing influence of Binance in the stablecoin market is a clear sign that liquidity will remain a key driver of crypto prices in the years to come.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-binances-22b-stablecoin-inflows-powered-bitcoins-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Is a new all-time high on the horizon? Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has consistently been making higher highs and lows since rebounding from the $52K support level. It has also broken above several resistance levels and now sits well above the resistance of $100,000. Meanwhile, the RSI is showing clear bullish momentum, and it’s likely for the market to finally decisively conquer $100K and move toward the $120K psychological resistance zone. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a more clear picture of recent price action, as the market has been climbing higher inside a large ascending channel. Yet, with the lower boundary of the pattern remaining intact, the market is now paving its way toward the higher trendline and potentially the $105K level in the short term. A breakout above the ascending channel is likely to lead to an aggressive rally higher. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Coinbase Premium Index American investors, including US institutions, are mostly the ones responsible for market moves. As a result, analyzing their behavior can be beneficial in making an accurate prediction about short-term market moves. This chart presents the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index, which is a metric that measures the relative buying and selling pressure on Coinbase compared to Binance. Coinbase is mostly used by American traders, while Binance is utilized worldwide. Therefore, this metric can indicate whether American investors are buying or selling at a higher or lower rate than other parts of the world. As the chart demonstrates, the Coinbase Premium Index has demonstrated highly positive values over the last couple of months, indicating the buying pressure from the US post-election, which is likely responsible for the market’s recent rally. As long as this metric shows positive readings, BTC could expect more upside.

37622339,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374665,1734162327,We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Can Reach $1T Market Cap This Cycle,"TL:DR; Ripple’s cross-border token became one of the best performers in the cryptocurrency market on a monthly scale at one point, but can it go even higher? ChatGPT and Perplexity weigh in on the factors needed for its market cap to skyrocket to the $1 trillion mark. XRP at $1T? Recall the price developments around XRP shortly after Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential elections. After a sluggish start, while the rest of the market was climbing, Ripple’s native token exploded in the following weeks, especially after current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his upcoming departure from the agency. At one point, XRP’s price tag had skyrocketed by over 400% and neared $3 on a few occasions. While the community anticipated a surge past that level and a new all-time high of over $3.4, the asset retraced and even slumped below $2 earlier this week during the market-wide correction. Now, though, XRP stands around $2.5, with a market cap of just over $140 billion. In order to tap the coveted $1 billion mark in market cap, its price would have to go up to around $17.5 per token. As of now, it seems like a tall order, but ChatGPT has outlined the potential factors that could lead to such a massive increase. Perhaps the most important part is the overall market sentiment. As long as the bull market remains intact, XRP has the potential to rise further, even perhaps going into double-digit territory. The other factor highlighted by ChatGPT and Perplexity is the adoption levels. “Ripple has positioned XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. If financial institutions globally adopt Ripple’s solutions, it could drive demand for XRP. Partnerships with banks and payment providers could lead to increased transaction volume and liquidity.” Further utilization of the native cross-border token, as well as the upcoming stablecoin RLUSD, could also impact the former’s price movements and send it higher, said the two chatbots. Challenges ChatGPT and Perplexity also outlined a few challenges that XRP could face on the way up. Competition from other projects, including other, more established stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, is among those. The XRPL network also faces different competitors, and XRP’s price could be suppressed if it fails to dominate the market. The regulatory environment needs to be mentioned in both categories. Should it change and become more crypto-friendly, as Trump promised, it could affect XRP positively. However, if the landscape remains similar during the Trump administration as it has been under Biden, the asset, as well as many other US-based crypto projects, could be harmed significantly. ChatGPT also mentioned the growing supply of XRP tokens and the potentially growing selling pressure, which could halt its price growth. “Ripple Labs holds a significant portion of XRP, releasing it periodically. This could create selling pressure, limiting price appreciation.” The post We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Can Reach $1T Market Cap This Cycle appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,XRP | USDC,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP | USDC,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-chatgpt-if-ripple-xrp-can-reach-1t-market-cap-this-cycle/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37622339.jpeg
37622304,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393062,1734162174,"Here’s Why Reaching $110,000 By the Year End Is Very Important for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally","The post Here’s Why Reaching $110,000 By the Year End Is Very Important for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Bitcoin has begun to display strength, spot ETF inflows have swelled, with $428.98 million recorded last trading day and $393 million since the start of the day’s trade. Besides, MicroStrategy has entered the Nasdaq 100, primarily led by more than $42 billion in BTC and over $550 billion in ETF assets, which is believed to be a big win for Bitcoin adoption. In this case, it is not only important for the BTC price to sustain above $100K but to achieve new highs before the end of the year. BTC’s dominance is rising again, while the inclusion of MicroStratergy is expected to have a wider adoption, inviting more buying pressure. Meanwhile, the recent BTC price movements show that psychologically, people are finding it difficult to buy the token at $100,000. A strong squeeze on the BTC chart indicates the weakness of the buyers and validates the above claim. Therefore, the price is believed to chop around the levels for a while before going higher before the end of the year. If the BTC price closes below $100K by the end of the year, how will the markets begin the 2025 trade? The short-term price action of BTC suggests the bulls are trying hard to keep up the bullish trend, mainly utilising all their strength to keep the price over $100K. The rally trading within the symmetrical triangle displays both bullish and bearish possibilities while the volume remains within a decent range. The price hovers in and out of the 50-day MA in the short term which has been a strong support at the moment. On the other hand, the RSI remains consolidated within a parallel channel since the start of the month. Therefore, the price is expected to maintain an ascending consolidation and reach the apex in the coming week. Besides, the bulls are exhibiting some more power compared to the bears which suggests the selling pressure may not hinder the progress of the rally. Therefore, the price is expected to test the ATH in the next 4 to 5 days which could also test the stability of the bulls. If they manage to withstand the bearish pressure at these levels, then a breakout from the pattern may enable the token to rise above $105K and eventually push the price above $108K to $110K by the end of the year. If the bulls fail to do so, then a similar drag below $98,000 may be expected. As long as the RSI remains within the range and the 50-day MA acts as strong support, then the possibility of a new ATH remains evident. Otherwise, a bearish start for 2025 could slightly delay the formation of new highs but cannot refrain as 2025 is expected to be the bullish year for the entire crypto space.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/heres-why-reaching-110000-by-the-year-end-is-very-important-for-the-bitcoin-btc-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, not many manage to offer their customers the payment methods they’re looking for, nor do they offer customers their local currencies and low fees. After over 2 years of operations, Swapped.com has now gotten to a point where the site supports 30+ payment methods, 20+ currencies to pay with, and industry-low fees. The site started out as an option only available to Danish people in Denmark but decided to go international last year in August 2023. Since then, it has gained large popularity in jurisdictions where customers don’t just want to use bank transfers or credit cards. Among its available payment methods are Revolut Pay, Interac, Local Bank transfers in GBP, DKK, USD, EUR, AUD, and others, PIX, Google Pay, Apple Pay, PaySafeCard, Skrill, Neteller, and lots of other methods. And the fees? They start as low as 0.50%, ensuring customers can get their hands on their desired crypto without breaking the bank on currency conversion, deposit, and withdrawal fees. With Swapped.com you can pay in your local currency avoiding any currency conversions you might be used to when using large exchanges or crypto onramps. Also, the conversion rates are mid-market rates which means you aren’t subject to any gaps in the foreign exchange rates (no hidden fees). Non-custodial platform Swapped.com was launched and has been designed to ensure customer funds are kept safe and not connected to Swapped.com and its potential successes or failures. As such, you can not hold funds on the Swapped platform but instead, Swapped provides instruction on how to easily and for free, set up your own cryptocurrency wallet in no time. This means that you get familiar with setting up your own cryptocurrency wallet which you can keep and use as you please, without any exchange or platform telling you what you can and cannot do and who you can and cannot transact with. This also means that in the case of bankruptcy or something like FTX or Mt. Gox, your funds will be safe. If Swapped.com goes bottoms up, your funds will be with you and they won’t be pulling any of your funds into the depths of their bankruptcy—instead, your keys, your coins. Why would someone invest in cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency has been “the next big thing” in recent years and has also come with a lot of speculation, poor investments, and other stories of rags to riches. People often choose to invest in cryptocurrency to get exposure to a different asset class than traditional ones, such as stocks, bonds, rare metals, and real estate. Contrary to traditional assets, cryptocurrency is known not to correlate with the general market. As such, if everything else is plummeting, cryptocurrency might be a bet in the other way, acting as an investment hedge. It is very important to figure out your risk profile, however, and make sure that cryptocurrency is the right investment for you. Cryptocurrencies come with significant risks and are very volatile assets. Make sure to do your research before investing. To ensure that you don’t end up with random coins or pump-and-dump coins, Swapped has strict criteria for the cryptocurrencies that they make available to you. As such, only cryptocurrencies that are within the top 25 of most valuable cryptocurrencies are available on the website. A regulated way to buy crypto A lot of exchanges and sites are registered and operate out of unfamiliar jurisdictions with questionable regulators and laws that might not be in your interest. Swapped.com on the other hand is a Danish company, registered and incorporated in Denmark and is regulated by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Denmark, FINTRAC Canada, and ASIC Australia. This means that should you encounter any issues with Swapped.com paying out your crypto or FIAT currencies, you can reach out to the relevant regulator and have them look into the case for you. A provider ready to help out when things aren’t working Who doesn’t hate going through 10 steps, 2 help centers, and 3 different AI Agents/Live chatbots? We don’t know. Swapped hates that process as well. As a result, Swapped has live agents available 24/7 for your convenience. Also, no need to go through lots of submenus, help centers, etc. The agents are there to help and you can get in touch with them within a minute should you experience any issues while trying to transact on Swapped, setting up your first-ever cryptocurrency wallet, and whatever else you might have on your mind. How to get started If it’s your first time considering buying crypto, we would advise that you first discuss the matter with an investment advisor to figure out if the asset class fits within your investment needs. If it is, consider heading to Swapped , and have a chat with one of the live chat agents who sit ready to help with any questions, concerns, etc. you might have with cryptocurrencies. They will also be able to provide instructions and guidance on how you can securely set up your first cryptocurrency wallet so that you can get started on your cryptocurrency adventure. If you decide that you want to buy crypto , the agents will once again be ready to help you through the process, explaining the risks of cryptocurrency and how to store them.

Following Bitcoin’s rollercoaster movement earlier this week, Shiba Inu plunged below the $0.00003 mark to a weekly low of $0.00002442. Since falling below this level, SHIB has been making significant moves for a rebound above the $0.00003 territory. Currently, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002878, reflecting a decline of 5.66% in the past seven days. The canine-themed token is also down 67.59% from its all-time high of $0.00008845, recorded on October 28, 2021. Shiba Inu attained this feat after its price spiked by over 150 million percent within 14 months of its launch. Shiba Inu Price if Its Market Cap Reaches $100B, $500B, or $1TEven though Shiba Inu has yet to meet investors’ expectations recently, several market observers believe the asset may revisit its glory days, when it saw hefty price spikes. Consequently, they project that Shiba Inu’s market cap could surge to $100 billion, $500 billion, or $1 trillion in the future. Notably, we’ve estimated how much Shiba Inu could be worth if these projections become a reality. Shiba Inu at $100 Billion Market Cap The $100 billion market cap projection has recently gained momentum within the Shiba Inu community. Experts like Oscar Ramos and Jake Gagain believe that Shiba Inu has the capability to reach this market cap. At the moment, Shiba Inu has a market cap of $16.96 billion, making it the 13th-biggest cryptocurrency. Attaining the $100 billion market cap will position Shiba Inu as the seventh-biggest crypto ahead of Dogecoin (DOGE). To reach the $100 billion market cap, Shiba Inu must soar by 489.62% from its current valuation of $16.96 billion. At a $100 billion valuation, Shiba Inu will trade at $0.000169 per token, assuming its circulating supply remains stable. Notably, experts at Changelly forecast that Shiba Inu will clinch the $0.000169 target by December 2030 . According to Changelly analysts, this would be Shiba Inu’s average price by December 2030. Shiba Inu at $500 Billion Market Cap The $500 billion market cap projection is an ambitious target set for Shiba Inu. It requires a surge of 2,848.11% from the current valuation of $16.96 billion. If Shiba Inu attains a valuation of $500 billion today, it will flip Ethereum (ETH) and become the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. At a $500 billion market cap, Shiba Inu will be worth $0.00084 per token. Meanwhile, Changelly experts believe that Shiba Inu will reach the $0.00084 price level between 2034 and 2039 . Shiba Inu at $1 Trillion Market Cap The $1 trillion market cap requires Shiba Inu to rally more substantially. Despite this, Shiba Inu’s enigmatic leader, Shytoshi Kusama, believes SHIB can attain the feat in its lifetime. As reported earlier, the Shiba Inu leader said he aims to make SHIB the first trillion-dollar decentralized entity globally. To reach a $1 trillion market cap, the current valuation must grow by 5,796.23 %. At this market cap, Shiba Inu will be worth $0.001696, assuming its circulating supply remains stable. Interestingly, Changelly analysts forecast that Shiba Inu will attain this feat by February 2040 , less than 16 years from now. It is imperative to note that this article is for informational purposes and should not be taken as investment advice.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SHIB,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/here-is-how-high-shiba-inu-can-rise-if-shib-market-cap-hits-100b-500b-or-1t/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-how-high-shiba-inu-can-rise-if-shib-market-cap-hits-100b-500b-or-1t,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This highlights how a rally in SOL could have a ripple effect on related tokens, making them worth monitoring for secondary trades. Solana Price Prediction: Could $300 Be Next? Solana is showing signs of a potential breakout, with key resistance at $227.35. A move above this level could pave the way for a test of $234.80, and possibly its previous high at $264. With sustained momentum and ecosystem activity, a medium-term target of $300 is within reach. Solana (SOL) is poised for a breakout!

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $222.74 provides strong support, keeping the price aligned with its ascending Fibonacci retracement. Key levels include $227.35 resistance at $227.35, with additional targets at $234.80 and $241.55. Immediate support is at $222.74, with safety nets at $219.10 and $215.30 if bearish pressure builds. Key factors supporting this outlook: EMA Support: The 50-day EMA at $222.74 has consistently cushioned recent price dips. Neutral RSI: RSI at 53 leaves room for upward moves without immediate risk. Ecosystem Interest: Growing focus on Solana-related tokens like JUP and WIF could boost sentiment. A failure to hold $222.74, however, may lead to a deeper pullback. Traders should watch the $235 level for confirmation of a breakout. $BEST Wallet: Web3 Simplified, $4.15M Raised in Presale Best Wallet is a Web3 platform that supports thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

37637829,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105124,1734161561,"Analyst Reveals His Ultimate XRP Investment Strategy, Eyes Profit-Taking Range of $4.4 to $27","A notable market analyst discusses his ultimate XRP investment strategy amid the ongoing bull run, identifying an attractive profit range. XRP has experienced a tremendous rally since the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, which saw Donald Trump emerge victorious. In November, XRP surged by an impressive 283%, followed by an additional 26% increase in December, as it holds above $2 .XRP Profit-Taking TargetsThis sustained bullish momentum has triggered optimism among investors, most of whom are seeking effective strategies for maximizing profits during this market cycle.Renowned analyst EGRAG has revealed an XRP investment strategy, highlighting a profit-taking range of $4.4 to $27. He based his approach on Fibonacci retracement levels, which analysts often use to identify potential price movements.EGRAG’s profit-taking targets include $4.42 (Fibonacci 1.414), $6.56 (Fibonacci 1.618), $8.39 (Fibonacci 1.272), $13.73 (Fibonacci 1.414), and $27.86 (Fibonacci 1.618). He explained that these price points critical for investors aiming to secure profits as XRP continues its upward trajectory.XRP Investment Strategies for Short-Term HoldersTo provide guidance, EGRAG outlined several profit-taking strategies tailored to both new and experienced investors.Notably, for those looking to take a systematic approach, he recommends percentage-based selling. In this approach investors can sell a fixed portion of holdings—such as 25%—at each target price, while they hold the remainder for potential future gains.Another option involves incremental selling. This would see investors sell smaller amounts, such as 5%, each time XRP’s price increases by a set figure, like $0.50.However, some investors may prioritize recovering their initial capital before implementing other strategies. This allows them to minimize risk while potentially maximizing long-term profits.Alternatively, some may prefer to sell their entire holdings upon reaching a personal price target. For context, this will ensure that they observe a definitive exit point.XRP Investment Strategy for Long-Term HoldersNotably, for those willing to take on higher risk, EGRAG suggested they reinvest profits into low- or mid-cap projects with high growth potential. While this can yield exponential returns, it requires a deep understanding of the market.On the other hand, long-term holders might choose to forgo short-term selling altogether, instead opting to accumulate XRP for 10–15 years. This strategy appeals to those with a long-term vision and less immediate need for liquidity.Another approach is on building generational wealth by retaining a significant portion of XRP holdings to pass down to future generations. This method aligns with investors looking to secure a legacy for their family.EGRAG encouraged investors to develop custom strategies tailored to their individual goals and to share these approaches within the community. His own strategy is from his unique financial background and family priorities.After spending two decades in investment sales and resigning from his role in early 2024, he now combines various methods to balance profit-taking with future growth potential.He plans to recover his initial capital through percentage-based selling while gradually releasing 10% of his holdings at specific price milestones. Once XRP reaches the $27 to $33 range, he intends to hold a “moon bag” for further appreciation.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/analyst-reveals-his-ultimate-xrp-investment-strategy-eyes-profit-taking-range-of-4-4-to-27/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-reveals-his-ultimate-xrp-investment-strategy-eyes-profit-taking-range-of-4-4-to-27,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The proposal echoes similar initiatives by lawmakers in Argentina, Russia and other countries. Hamada, a representative of the People’s Protection Party, told NHK in a formal written request to the government, asking for Bitcoin to be considered a strategic reserve asset. According to media outlet CoinPost and official records from the parliament, Hamada’s request speaks to the growing global trend towards Bitcoin being considered a national strategic reserve asset. Hamada specifically pointed to developments in Brazil and the United States, where authorities are reportedly exploring the possibility of holding Bitcoin as part of their treasury reserves. He suggested Japan follow suit by converting some of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Hamada highlighted the unique qualities of Bitcoin, stating: “Bitcoin’s neutrality and decentralized nature allows it to support economic activity without relying on any particular currency or institution.” Related News: World's Largest Digital Asset Manager Announces Fund Launch for Two Surprise Altcoins Hamada’s proposal highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to act as a buffer against geopolitical risks, arguing that Bitcoin, which is less influenced by specific countries or institutions, could provide economic stability in uncertain times. In a document titled “The Question of Understanding the Move to Create a National Bitcoin Reserve in the United States and Other Countries,” Hamada noted that Bitcoin could soon be recognized globally as a ‘national strategic asset.’ The Japanese government is expected to respond to Hamada's proposal in the coming weeks.

Following a period of subdued activity, recent metrics suggest renewed confidence among investors, potentially signalling an upward trend. At the center of this observation is the 90-day percent return metric, which has historically been a reliable indicator of market sentiment for Toncoin. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Explodes With 17% Rally — Can TON Sustain The Momentum? Toncoin Sees Renewed Positive Momentum: What Lies Ahead? CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared insights into the TON market in a recent post titled “TON Positive Momentum is Getting Back.” The analyst noted that the 90-day percent return has turned positive, currently sitting at around 9%. While this is a modest figure compared to the explosive 200% gains seen during TON’s previous rally, it marks a shift that could lead to greater market optimism. Notably, the 90-day percent return metric turning positive is a noteworthy development for Toncoin. This indicator reflects the average returns over a 90-day period, offering insights into investor behaviour and market sentiment. Historically, positive returns have often preceded significant upward trends in TON’s price. While the current 9% return signals growing investor confidence, it remains a cautious indicator, suggesting potential gains without confirming a definitive rally. Darkfost further reveals that during TON’s last significant rally, this metric soared beyond 200%, showcasing its capacity for really strong momentum when “conditions align.” He then emphasized that while this shift in returns is promising, it is too early to predict whether TON will replicate its previous performance. TON Market Performance Meanwhile, despite the positive momentum observed by Darkfost, Toncoin has been in a downward turn over the past week, dropping by nearly 10%. Even in the past 24 hours, TON is still seeing a form of bearishness in its price as it currently trades at a price of $6.27 pushing its price further away from its all-time high of $8.25 recorded in back in June. Particularly, at current market prices, TON is down by 24.2% from this peak and 3.1% in the past day. This decrease has also unsurprisingly affected the asset’s market cap which has decreased from over $17 billion seen earlier this month to now at $15.9 billion as of today. Related Reading: Toncoin Liquidity and User Activity Reviewed by Analyst: Insights on Market Impacts TON’s daily trading volume has also plunged from over $1 million on December 10 to roughly $402.8 million as of today.

Once this phase ends, analysts are predicting an 80% pump. However, with many uncertain when this pump will be, this AI-powered newcomer has caught the spotlight by offering a 100x potential surge as we enter 2025. Read on to find out why analysts are so positive about it and why you should get on board today. Dogecoin News: Accumulation Phase and Potential Gains Doge was originally designed to poke fun at cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, and has grown to become one of the most prominent meme coins in existence, making news thanks to its passionate community and endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s price history shows the extreme volatility of meme coins, seeing Dogecoin soar to the moon in 2021 to its ATH of $0.73 and then crashing. Since its launch in 2013, DOGE has experienced numerous rallies. Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.4 with a market cap of $59.93 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $4.8 billion. In the last month, DOGE’s price seems to have been consolidating, trading around the $0.4 level and seeing only a 5% increase. According to the latest Dogecoin news, as DOGE continues to consolidate, analysts predict an 80% increase in price after the accumulation phases end. However, while DOGE offers the potential for moderate gains, as shown in the predictions, its large market size may limit its upside compared to smaller, emerging projects like this newcomer.

Ahlgren, who failed to accurately report $4 million in Bitcoin sales between 2017 and 2019, was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay over $1 million in restitution. His case serves as a stark warning for crypto investors about the serious consequences of tax evasion. While many are rooting for the Trump administration to streamline tax policies, this case is a stark reminder for investors who think crypto assets are an easy way to dodge taxes. What Went Wrong? Ahlgren, an early Bitcoin adopter, made substantial profits by selling 640 bitcoins in 2017 for $3.7 million and additional sales in subsequent years. However, instead of reporting these earnings accurately, he inflated the purchase price of his bitcoins (cost basis) to understate his taxable gains. To avoid detection, he used multiple wallets and even exchanged Bitcoin for cash in person, aiming to reduce his digital trace. Despite these efforts, blockchain’s inherent transparency enabled investigators to track his activities. IRS’s Stance on Crypto Tax Evasion Taking the case as a serious crypto tax compliance issue Stuart M. Goldberg, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General highlighted that Ahlgren deliberately hid over $1 million in taxable earnings. Whereas, Lucy Tan Acting Special Agent in Charge of IRS-Criminal Investigation emphasized this as the first criminal tax evasion case centered on cryptocurrency, proving crypto transactions are traceable and tax evasion won’t go unpunished.

Shehan emphasized that cryptocurrency transactions are taxable, and the IRS treats tax defaulters in this sector very seriously. He noted that blockchain’s transparency makes crypto one of the worst asset classes to evade taxes since all transactions are permanently recorded and traceable. To avoid legal troubles, he stressed that crypto gains are taxable and advised investors to use tools like crypto tax software or consult with a CPA to ensure accurate reporting. His key takeaway is to be honest, as attempting to hide gains can lead to severe consequences, including prison time and hefty financial penalties.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-tax-evasion-bitcoin-investors-4m-misstep-lands-him-in-prison/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

SEC’s current chair Gary Gensler is set to step down on January 20. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, as the next chairman. The SEC claims Ripple violated securities laws by issuing XRP. Some of the XRP issuance was considered a security, while other parts were not. The SEC is appealing the ruling, and with a new SEC administration under Trump, there’s speculation on whether the case will be dropped. After Atkins takes office, many experts believe that the U.S. crypto market urgently needs clear, written laws, rather than inconsistent rulings from courts. Nevertheless, the Ripple case remains a significant moment in the ongoing battle against crypto regulation in the U.S. With major events unfolding, especially with the upcoming changes at the SEC, it’s a crucial time for anyone involved in crypto. When Patrick Bet David asked MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, “The community with XRP & Ripple, has anything changed since you and I were last together?” Saylor shared his view and said that he believes the current administration is supportive of crypto, particularly Bitcoin, and focused on freedom. He also pointed out the need for a digital assets framework that defines various crypto categories clearly, from digital currencies to NFTs and tokenized assets. If regulators provide this clarity, Saylor predicts significant growth for digital assets in the U.S. Saylor said, “I think you’ll have a pro-digital assets SEC, a pro-digital assets Treasury, a pro-digital assets White House, and a pro-digital assets House & Senate.” However, a lot of users and XRP enthusiasts noticed how Saylor dodged the question. A user said, “He literally didn’t answer the question which tells us exactly how he’s feeling.”",NEUTRAL,XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-lawsuit-news-michael-saylor-dodges-question-about-ripple-vs-sec/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Vincent Van Code, a widely followed software engineer, shares this sentiment. In a tweet, Van Code pointed out that XRP is forming an ascending triangle on the daily chart. He noted that in the absence of significant news, the price may follow technical analysis patterns.According to him, this typically happens when the market is awaiting news, causing it to trade sideways. While he acknowledged that daily price swings of 10 to 20% are common, he emphasized that the key move will come with a breakout above $2.90.Yet, he stressed that this breakout will likely occur once major news is announced. ""Let's wait and see,"" he said.Imminent News to Trigger XRPNotably, the XRP Army eagerly awaits at least three key developments , which they believe will ignite a new spark for XRP. Among them is the upcoming launch of Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD.Earlier this week, Ripple secured approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to list RLUSD. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that RLUSD will soon launch on partner exchanges.Other pro-XRP news in the works includes ETF approvals and the settlement of Ripple's ongoing lawsuit. However, these events will unfold in 2025.Meanwhile, the launch of RLUSD is imminent. With the news expected in the coming days, XRP proponents believe it could be the catalyst for XRP’s new bull run. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.51, up by 7.11% over the past 24 hours.XRP Targets After BreakoutVan Code believes XRP's breakout rally will gain significant momentum once the asset surpasses $2.90. At the same time, other market commentators have set ambitious targets for XRP enthusiasts to look forward to when the bull run resumes.Technical analyst Arjantit, in a tweet , noted that XRP is displaying a bullish flag pattern on the 8-hour chart, signaling the potential for a breakout. According to him, a break above the flag could push the price towards $2.91 and $3.20. He advised market participants to watch for confirmation of this setup. XRP chart by Arjantit In a separate post , analyst ""FinanceBro"" expressed a similar view, stating that XRP’s bull flag is ""officially complete."" In his view, the breakout rally will likely drive the price to $4.40. Meanwhile, he further suggested that $4.40 could merely mark the beginning of an even larger rally to the upside.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/experts-say-xrp-awaiting-major-news-for-breakout-targeting-2-90-3-20-and-4-40/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=experts-say-xrp-awaiting-major-news-for-breakout-targeting-2-90-3-20-and-4-40,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37621632,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312865,1734160952,OKX and Gate Wallet Communities in Battle for the Bluwhale Node Challenge,"December 12, 2024 – San Francisco, California In a first-of-its-kind contest, the exchange that is fastest to sell 1,000 nodes will be awarded 1,000 free nodes to share with its community. Bluwhale , an AI Web 3.0 start-up, today announces an innovative competition on its platform between two of the biggest and fastest-growing exchange wallet teams – OKX Web 3.0 versus Gate Web 3.0 – to see which exchange’s wallet holders will reach 1,000 common nodes first. The winning exchange wallet community receives 1,000 free nodes to distribute to its members who purchased Bluwhale nodes. The two exchanges have grown and demonstrated dramatic traction over the last year. OKX, one of the largest CEXs (centralized exchanges) globally, has more than $2 billion daily transaction volume for just Bitcoin, while OKX Wallet has more than 100,000 active users daily. The CEX Gate is an established blockchain platform founded in 2013. One of the fastest-growing exchanges this year, it is approaching the peak of the top 10 CEXs and delighting its users with a strong diversity of token offerings. Gate Web 3.0 is a comprehensive platform that drives blockchain technology innovation and adoption, providing DeFi (decentralized finance) services, wallet, Web 3.0 startup, Web 3.0 tasks, DApp and other features. With Gate Web 3.0, users engage in the crypto ecosystem and experience decentralized digital asset management and trading with efficient and secure on-chain services. The OKX Web 3.0 versus Gate Web 3.0 competition starts December 12, 2024, at 2:00 a.m. PST and ends when one exchange wallet team reaches the target of 1,000 common nodes sold. Participants can support their preferred exchange in the Bluwhale common node sale by logging in using either Gate Wallet or OKX Wallet and purchasing a common node at a 10% discounted price. Bluwhale launched the master codes capable of creating communities in November 2024, selling out tier one and tier two within 48 hours. It is now transitioning into common nodes that give buyers a lower entry price point – $50-$60 – and allow them to join communities for higher reward boosts. Han Jin, co-founder and CEO of Bluwhale, said, “Node sales have been quite technical where licenses with hardware requirements are being distributed to buyers, limiting attractiveness for retail to participate. “At Bluwhale, we turn nodes into a simple and fun concept by allowing communities to compete and run them on their smartphones. “We are extremely honored to have OKX and Gate Web 3.0 support our mission of decentralizing AI through nodes on mobile devices. “Like this year’s excitement around PvP (player versus player) competitions like Mike Tyson versus Jake Paul, we are hosting this digital one on our site , giving the winner community 1,000 free nodes to reward its members.” Bluwhale AI is the fastest-growing AI network on blockchains, an intelligence layer contextualizing cross-chain and off-chain information, powered by millions of mobile devices acting as nodes to share data, storage and computing for rewards. More than 3,000 businesses and approximately one million verified users currently are part of Bluwhale’s decentralized AI ecosystem. Purchasers of both Bluwhale master nodes and common nodes will have a more integral role in the network by running nodes on their smartphones and participating in the ecosystem’s revenue streams.

Recent developments have sparked increased speculation about XRP’s traditional investment prospects, driven by key market indicators and regulatory developments. Grayscale’s XRP Trust , launched in September 2024, has emerged as a significant point of interest for market observers. The trust has demonstrated remarkable performance, with its share price experiencing a substantial surge of over 300%. Initially priced at $10.85, the trust has climbed to $47.48, catching the attention of prominent market commentators and investors. Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, a.k.a Bitboy, highlighted this performance as a promising signal for a potential XRP ETF. The dramatic price appreciation of the Grayscale trust suggests growing institutional interest and potential market readiness for a more accessible investment vehicle for XRP. Greyscale's $XRP trust has recorded over 300% returns since May! Good sign an ETF is coming. — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) December 12, 2024 Is An XRP ETF Coming? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) historical stance toward XRP has been a significant hurdle for XRP ETFs. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple and its executives in December 2020, and both parties have been embroiled in this legal battle since. Although the court ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security, the SEC has not budged on its stance and appealed the ruling after the final verdict in August. However, the crypto market is as relentless as the SEC. Ripple has spent over $150 million fighting the lawsuit, and multiple asset management firms have submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs, indicating substantial institutional interest. Considering the current landscape and the impressive performance of the Grayscale XRP Trust, Armstrong is confident that an XRP ETF is coming. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 When Will We See XRP ETFs? According to regulatory timelines, the SEC typically requires 240 days to review ETF applications. With the most recent XRP ETF applications submitted in November 2024, potential approval could extend to July 2025 under optimal circumstances. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store has also argued that the timeline could be extended , as XRP ETF approval would require an established Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated futures market. The SEC has also revealed that it will not approve Solana ETFs under the current administration. This might extend to other altcoins. However, a new administration will come in on January 20, and this pause will likely be lifted. While the timeline for an XRP ETF is uncertain, the asset is one of the most popular among investors and institutions, and this pressure could expedite the approval process.

In a recently published report, VanEck provided next year's top ten crypto forecasts. The assertions mentioned Bitcoin’s trend in the first quarter of the year and its cycle peak price.Steep Correction Before Hitting $180,000VanEck stated that BTC will hit a cycle high of $180,000 next year. The Bitcoin ETF issuer speculated a spillover of the current market's bullish momentum to Q1 2025 before a steep correction.Notably, VanEck expects a surge to its first peak price in the first quarter of the year, followed by a 30% drop, driving altcoins down 60%. The firm mentioned indicators of the massive correction, including high funding rates, excessive unrealized profits, and mainstream speculation.However, the asset manager speculated that Bitcoin would rebound in the last quarter of the year, hitting $180,000. Furthermore, other notable assets like Ethereum, Solana, and SUI will respectively peak at $6,000, $500, and $10 in the same quarter.US to Create a Strategic Bitcoin ReserveMeanwhile, VanEck predicted that the US Bitcoin reserve agenda would actually be a reality. Per the report, the federal government or states like Pennsylvania and Texas will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.The leading asset manager asserted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under new boss Paul Atkins , will approve more crypto ETPs. Furthermore, the SEC or Congress would repeal the SAB 121 law , allowing US banks to offer crypto custody services.Other Notable Crypto ForecastNotably, VanEck also provided other interesting outlooks for next year.

Deaton Calls for SEC-CFTC Merger to Simplify Crypto Regulations appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News John E. Deaton, a vocal advocate for the crypto industry, has once again shared his views on the need for better regulation. He has often criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler and his approach, which many see as stifling the growth of cryptocurrencies. This time, Deaton is highlighting a potential solution: merging the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission). One Crypto, One Rule! On Mornings with Maria, Perianne Boring discussed how having two separate agencies oversee financial markets creates confusion and inefficiency. Deaton agreed, explaining that combining the two agencies into one could clear up the overlapping responsibilities and conflicts between them. This would make it easier for companies to follow the rules and provide a consistent approach to regulating both securities (like stocks) and commodities (like Bitcoin and other cryptos). Deaton believes that as cryptocurrencies often fall into gray areas between securities and commodities, having one unified regulator could simplify things for everyone. It would also align the U.S. with other countries that have a single financial regulator, making it easier for the U.S. to stay competitive in global markets. DOGE and the Push for Consolidation Moreover, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, both supporters of Dogecoin (DOGE), are emerging as potential advocates for merging the SEC and CFTC. This proposed merger could simplify regulations for new technologies like cryptocurrencies, providing much-needed clarity for investors and businesses navigating the current complex regulatory landscape. John E. Deaton also highlighted payments as another area where consolidation is urgently needed. He pointed out that over a dozen federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, FinCEN, and the SEC, are involved in regulating payment systems. A unified regulatory framework could streamline these processes. Deaton used XRP as a prime example of regulatory discord. Despite being classified as a virtual currency by FinCEN in 2015, the SEC declared it a security five years later, causing massive investor losses. Uniting Forces for Crypto Clarity U.S. Congressman John Rose introduced a bill on Sep 12, to foster collaboration between the SEC and CFTC via a Joint Advisory Committee on Digital Assets. Part of the “Bridging Regulation and Innovation for Digital Global and Electronic Digital Assets Act,” the committee would include industry experts, users, and academics to guide the agencies on harmonizing laws, measuring digital assets, and using blockchain for efficiency and consumer protection. The committee, with at least 20 non-government members and one representative each from the SEC and CFTC, would meet twice annually, with two-year member terms. Their recommendations would require public responses from the agencies, ensuring accountability. A strong crypto advocate, Rose aims to replace “regulation-by-enforcement” with a cooperative framework that fosters U.S. innovation. His pro-crypto stance includes backing the FIT21 Act and opposing excessive government control over digital assets.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/john-e-deaton-calls-for-sec-cftc-merger-to-simplify-crypto-regulations/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

For instance, Sui token is having a bullish momentum as it sets a new all-time price high. The token has also struck a new significant partnership with First Digital Labs (FDUSD). Meanwhile, crypto experts are bullish on the market trajectory of the XRP token. Some analysts are projecting as high as $18 surge for the XRP price in this alt season. In the same vein, Lunex Network (LNEX) presale has hit another milestone, reaching $5 million in cryptocurrency ICO funding with the price jumping up once again. Sui Token Sets New ATH, Partners with First Digital USD It has been a significantly bullish month for the Sui token. Firstly, the token has gained over 51% within the last 30 days. This has seen the Sui price climb past the $4 mark to a new all-time price high of $4.86, according to CoinMarketCap stats. As it is, the bullish momentum is strong and is likely to propel the token above the $5 threshold in the coming days. In another development, the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stable coin is now available on Sui wallet through the Binance platform. Following this integration, investors can now deposit and withdraw FDUSD on the Sui network on Binance. The announcement was made public via Sui’s official X handle, signaling the start of transactions involving FDUSD in Sui’s wallet. Meanwhile, both the Sui trading volume and market cap are witnessing massive rallies. Other technical indicators, like the Fear and Greed index, MA, MACD, and Momentum, are flashing buy signals. Is the $18 Price Target for XRP Token Viable? The XRP crypto is riding on one of the biggest rallying trajectories that is only rivaled by the bull run of December-January 2018, which saw the token reach its standing all-time price high of $3.84. Having gained over 290% in price value in the month-to-date chart , it is looking likely that XRP’s price can finally set a new all-time high. As the token trades at $2.4, it is just 36% away from matching its ATH. Several crypto analysts and experts are projecting continuous bullish momentum. From the perspective of Dark Defender on X, one of the analysts that are bullish on XRP’s growth, the token could rally to $18.22. While it may still be early days for some investors, the XRP token remains one of the top crypto coins in the industry. Another XRP influencer that goes by the username Amonyx on X thinks that the XRP price breakout has not started yet. The analyst thinks it will go crazy above $20. With the growing interest, the altcoin could hit 10x this season. More Incoming Presale Milestones for Lunex Network (LNEX) Lunex Network (LNEX) is onboarding a new milestone of raising over $5 million so far in the presale. This development is made possible by the continuous influx of investors who’ve found the Lunex project to be a key player in the crypto industry. Thousands of investors now hold over 2.2 billion LNEX tokens. A significant number of these investors are already swimming in profits as the LNEX price has jumped from $0.0012 to $0.0044, over 260% gains. With a projection of another 50x growth, now is the best time to jump into this DeFi project, which is set to revolutionize the $131B DeFi industry. Holding the token grants you access to the revenue-sharing model. Outside that, traders can stake the token for as little as 30 days and earn high APY yields. Holders are given discounts on transactions. With the listing fees set to be paid in LNEX, there is a high likelihood of the buying pressure pushing the token towards $1 soon. All these make LNEX one of the promising DeFi coins to accumulate at this early stage. As a platform, Lunex Network is developed to allow for on-chain buying, selling, and swapping of digital assets without the need for KYC or wallet connections. Built with advanced trading features, users have access to over 50k trading pairs at the lowest cost, a portfolio tracker to track multiple assets, and a unique DeFi wallet that allows traders to buy, sell and swap cryptos. Investment Choice Between SUI, XRP and LNEX There is no doubt that the Sui and XRP tokens are on raging bullish momentum. However, Lunex Network is presenting investors with the opportunity to be pioneer investors in a project that could become the next Binance. Investing now on LNEX will put investors in the position of recording exponential ROIs soon.

This means you have two more weeks to grow your money and all that you have to do is select the right crypto to invest in. So if you want to enter 2025 with a bang, we have picked the top 5 best cryptos to invest in at the moment. All of the tokens listed below are currently in their presale so you’ll definitely get a great deal. As per expert predictions, all 5 of them are expected to do great in 2025. Let’s take a closer look at some of the best meme coins to see which one might be the best fit for you. 1. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is still in its presale phase and has already managed to raise over $4 million. Its drastic growth has led some experts to believe that it has the potential to offer a x100 return. The platform is also offering staking rewards , encouraging investors to hold onto their tokens for 145% APY. This has driven countless investors to the project, further fuelling its value. Anyone interested in the staking rewards should definitely hurry up because the staking reserve is reaching its limit and the reward will also go down with time. 2. Cat Slap Cat Slap ($SLAP) has been off to a great start. Since its launch, its price has already increased by x20, hinting that it might have the potential to become the next x100 meme coin. This is an Ethereum-based meme coin based on the angry cat-slapping meme. It currently has a market cap of $33 million. Its current value is $0.004757. Experts predict that by the end of the year, it might hit an average price of $0.00746. By next year, its average price might jump to $0.0143 which is a 200% jump from the current price. 3. Flockerz Flockerz is another popular token that’s gone viral. In just 2 months of its presale, it has managed to raise more than $5.6 million. Its growth so far has led some experts to predict that it might be the next $PNUT (a very popular meme coin) and might give an x4000 return like the chill guy meme coin. But those are just speculations. For now, all that we know is its current price is $0.0062995 and it’s expected to double up to $0.0124 in 2025. Interestingly, 25% of the token supply is reserved to be distributed through a vote-to-earn mechanism, where investors can vote on simple questions to earn FLOCK tokens. 4. Crypto All Stars Crypto All Stars has already raised over $10 million in its presale. Currently, the token is only available to strategic investors and its presale is ending very soon. In the second half of December, it’s expected to launch on exchanges. As for its growth, there won’t be any major change in the last two weeks of the year. Its current value is $0.0016582. So by the end of December, the maximum value it’s expected to reach is $0.0067128. However, in 2025, experts are predicting an x24 growth. 5. Sponge V2 SpongeV2 is a second-generation token of the $SPONGE coin (the first one was called V1). It’s important to note that you cannot have both the tokens together. If you want V2 tokens, you need to permanently lock your V1 tokens which will ensure that the V2 tokens replace the V1 ones. Now speaking of growth, right now the average price of each token is $0.0025 but by the end of 2025, it can hit $0.0060, which is a 140% jump. Plus, the V1 tokens gave early investors a whopping x100 return on their investment. Who knows, maybe it can happen again. Invest Before the Year Ends From the predictions, it looks like Wall Street Pepe, Flockers, and Sponge V2 are expected to have the best year ahead. Out of these three, Wall Street Pepe followed by Sponge V2 has the most promising growth trajectory. But at the end of the day, it’s important to do your own research when investing because the crypto market is very volatile and things might have changed by the time you are reading this post.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-bonk-and-dogecoin-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37621203,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393027,1734160198,Avalanche Pushes $65 While Shiba Inu and DOGE Whales Look for Fresh Opportunities,"The post Avalanche Pushes $65 While Shiba Inu and DOGE Whales Look for Fresh Opportunities appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Although it has grown impressively, several factors point to Avalanche (AVAX) reaching the $65 mark soon. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are actively venturing into new investment opportunities, with the intriguing 1Fuel catching their eye. Thanks to its innovative features and strong presale momentum, 1Fuel is emerging as the best crypto for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios amidst the ongoing market rally. 1Fuel Could Launch a New DeFi Era of Wallet-Enhanced Features Although it recently joined the crypto space, 1Fuel is already making a name for itself as the best crypto to buy now. 1Fuel is designed to simplify how a crypto wallet works by removing extra network fees and the complexity of using multiple wallets. At the core of 1Fuel is its innovative one-click cross-chain transaction feature. In the past, users faced the daunting task of managing multiple wallets and tokens to complete safe crypto transactions across different networks. This often involved lengthy processes and technical jargon that could easily overwhelm anyone. In terms of security and privacy, 1Fuel prioritizes your safety. The secure crypto wallet includes a privacy mixer and cold storage, ensuring your assets are secure and shielded from unwanted scrutiny, facilitating safe crypto transactions. Avalanche Could Hit A New Price High Soon As the altcoin market continues its November rally this December, many cryptos like AVAX have maintained their upward trajectory. AVAX has exceeded the $50 mark and is approaching an 8-month high. The Avalanche token has risen over 50% in the past month and its market cap now stands at $22.09 billion (at the time of writing), which places it at the 11th rank of the top 20 cryptos on Coinmarketcap. If AVAX’s bullish momentum holds, it could test the $60 level this week. Sustaining this price might push AVAX toward the next resistance at $65. New Price Prediction for Shiba Inu Energes Following Impressive Surge So Far As a result of the current positive influence of the DeFi market, investor interest in SHIB has grown. This has fueled predictions that it could reach $0.0002 before 2025 ends. This projection is supported by SHIB’s track record in 2024. Since 2024 started, SHIB has risen by a whopping 206.32% and now has a market cap of almost $18 billion. While SHIB is currently in an upward earning phase, investors also focus on the new 1Fuel and its benefits. Hope In Sight For Dogecoin to Reach $1 While its market rival SHIB is growing impressively well, DOGE is also included in this growth trend. Over the past month, DOGE’s price has jumped 13.96% and it has been trading around $0.41 for the past week. As a result, DOGE now ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $61 billion. Based on its recent trajectory, analysts are starting to suggest that DOGE is steadily heading toward $1, with some predicting a bullish target between $1.30 and $1.50. However, it must first break past its $0.44 resistance. As DOGE investors hope this happens soon, they are also looking for new and potentially profitable projects to add to their crypto portfolios like 1Fuel. Conclusion While AVAX is set to reach a new price high, SHIB and DOGE investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel despite their current profitable positions. This shift is driven by 1Fuel’s significant growth potential in its ongoing presale, where OFT tokens are available at an attractive price of just $0.012 each. Don’t miss out—buy 1Fuel today!

XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost, and Borderless Cryptocurrency on the XRP Ledger XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. With an initial supply of 100 billion XRP, 80 billion were gifted to Ripple for further development and ecosystem support. Ripple utilizes XRP to enhance network liquidity and has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies, offering a digitally native, programmable currency that is resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. In the current market cycle, XRP’s focus on efficient cross-border payments may make it an attractive option for those interested in cryptocurrency technologies. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it started with 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, increasing SHIB’s visibility. SHIB’s Ethereum basis allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans include an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. This integration may enhance its utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s potential for broader application could make it an attractive option. Conclusion With XRP and SHIB showing less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by the end of its presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Mirroring tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real perks for early adopters.

37624728,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319452,1734159007,Ripple’s XRP ETF Launch Could Trigger a Bull Run – Is $10 Next?,"Optimism is growing around Ripple’s XRP as it nears the possibility of securing approval for an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The anticipation is fueled by expectations of regulatory shifts under Donald Trump’s administration, which has signaled support for a more cryptocurrency-friendly environment. Trump’s promises to establish the U.S. as a global cryptocurrency leader have set the stage for significant regulatory breakthroughs, with an XRP ETF potentially leading the charge. WOW! AN IMMINENT #XRP ETF LAUNCH IS PREDICTED, CITING THE EXPLOSIVE PERFORMANCE OF AN XRP TRUST BY A BILLION-DOLLAR ASSET MANAGER AS A POSITIVE SIGN! https://t.co/D87M4EJJ3k pic.twitter.com/mtP9jk55AP — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 13, 2024 A crypto-forward SEC chairman could expedite the resolution of Ripple’s legal battles, opening the door for institutional investors to embrace XRP through regulated ETFs. Historical trends from Bitcoin’s ETF approval show that such milestones can trigger massive price surges. Should Ripple secure this landmark, analysts believe XRP could hit $4.50 as early as January 2025, with a speculative rally to $10 achievable under sustained institutional inflows and global adoption. Ripple RLUSD Approval Boosts XRP Sentiment The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, signaling a major regulatory win for Ripple. This development has positioned XRP favorably compared to other altcoins, especially in the wake of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation. Ripple’s growing regulatory successes have already had a positive impact, with XRP’s price surging 250% over the last month . While weekly gains remain subdued, the stablecoin approval provides a foundation for sustained growth. Market speculation around BitBoy’s prediction of a potential XRP ETF has further bolstered sentiment, with firms like WisdomTree, Bitwise, and 21Shares filing applications. XRP’s Road to $4.50: Predictions and Trends Technically, XRP remains robust, trading at $2.51, up over 7% in the last 24 hours. Supported by an upward trendline and a strong pivot at $2.40, the asset is poised for further gains. Immediate resistance lies at $2.65, with key levels at $2.85 and $3.05 offering additional targets. Drawing parallels with Bitcoin’s price action following its ETF approval, XRP could see a substantial surge upon regulatory clarity. A breakout above $2.65 may drive XRP toward $4.50, with the ambitious $10 target depending on broader institutional adoption and macroeconomic trends. Key Drivers for $10 Projection: Sustained inflows into XRP ETFs, mirroring Bitcoin’s ETF-driven growth. Expansion of Ripple’s RLUSD adoption, solidifying XRP’s utility. Favorable U.S. regulations encouraging institutional participation.

37621003,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52125,1734158650,Can XRP Serve As RLUSD Reserve? Here’s an Expert Opinion,"After a lengthy regulatory process, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has officially approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. This marks a significant milestone for Ripple and its community, which has been anticipating the launch of the USD-backed digital asset for some time. Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, recently weighed in on details surrounding the stablecoin, noting that “RLUSD requires cash or cash equivalent backing, like Treasury bills, bonds, or cash, as per NYDFS approval of the token.” This regulatory mandate ensures that RLUSD maintains its peg to the U.S. dollar, reinforcing trust and transparency in its operations. Ripple promised this would be the case when the stablecoin was announced , and the NYDFS approval adds credibility to Ripple’s promises. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Digital Assets and RLUSD Collateralization Digital assets, including XRP and Bitcoin, are currently not acceptable to back RLUSD under NYDFS guidelines. Van Code noted, “XRP or any digital asset (including BTC) are currently NOT approved as cash equivalent to back RLUSD.” There were rumors that Ripple might custody its escrowed XRP as a reserve for RLUSD . This was quickly debunked by experts, pointing out that the regulators would not accept that. However, Van Code also speculated on the possibility of such assets being considered in the future, provided they meet stringent requirements. He also noted that the digital assets backing the stablecoins would need to be over-collateralized in case their prices drop. Such a scenario would allow digital assets to play a role in RLUSD’s collateral structure, though this remains purely speculative. Any move in this direction would require extensive regulatory approval and mechanisms to mitigate the volatility of digital assets. RLUSD Launch Timeline Addressing questions about potential hurdles delaying RLUSD’s launch, Van Code clarified that the asset has fulfilled all regulatory requirements. “NYDFS approved it. Now they are turning it all on. It takes a fair bit of time,” he stated. The implementation process involves creating the necessary infrastructure and demand for the stablecoin, ensuring a seamless rollout. Ripple’s stablecoin has already generated considerable excitement within the community, with many trustlines being created in anticipation of its debut. While the community remains optimistic about RLUSD’s potential to drive adoption and utility, immediate price impacts on XRP, Ripple’s native token, Van Code expects its impact on XRP to be modest. He emphasized that “the impact on XRP price won’t be immediate.” He pointed out that creating demand and utility takes time. He also mentioned that any price trend at this time is driven more by enthusiasm than by sustained utility-driven demand.

The bull swing continues to gain momentum, with experts tipping more gains ahead of Donald Trump’s second term. However, on-chain factors could spark a major sale, leading to a drop in sentiments. In a recent publication, Onchain Edge informed users of the impact of BTC supply loss in the market. According to the release, when the metric goes below 4%, users should mark exits out of the crypto leader and reposition assets for the next bearish low. BTC supply loss is used to determine the number of coins whose prices are lower than their previous transfer prices over a period of time. It shows the profitability or loss of Bitcoin in circulation and is commonly used to determine the wider market sentiment. Current values stand at 8.14% amid recent asset fluctuations. A 4% mark in BTC supply loss shows that more holders are in profits, creating a dicey situation for traders. According to the release, holding when most users become extremely greedy could lead to losses. The crypto market is determined by cycles due to volatility. As seen in previous downtrends, a major swing could impact its price, leading to huge liquidations. “ When the BTC supply loss % goes below 4% you should start dcaing aggressively out of BTC and wait for the next bear market lows. The current value is 8.14%. Why? Below 4% means a lot of people are in a profit this is the peak bull run phase. Trust me you don’t want to be bagholding because you thought we would never see a bear market again. Be fearful when others are greedy.” What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bitcoin trades at $101,923, a slight 1.89% increase in the last 24 hours and a 2.59% surge this week, wiping off previous losses. The present upward climb above $100K came with lots of optimism as macro factors flipped green for the asset. Most traders have projected the price to hit $150K amid surging institutional inflows. Institutional investors increased exposure to Bitcoin, driving an upward movement in price.

The crypto advocacy group expects to expand its influence across Asia, Europe, and Africa via several new partnerships and adding a new advisor. Earlier this year, Warren participated in a roundtable discussion with U.S. Congress members, a Biden administration adviser, and crypto executives, calling the conversation a “productive step forward” in approaching crypto as a nonpartisan issue. Warren reflected that when she first took on the role as CCI’s CEO three years ago, it was a different era, before the FTX collapse and as Gary Gensler’s scrutiny of the industry was beginning. Crypto executives expect growth under Trump’s administration and SEC changes Warren’s resignation news comes as growing confidence emerges among crypto executives, who believe Trump’s administration will support global crypto adoption. Marcin Kaźmierczak, co-founder and chief operations officer at RedStone, recently said that Trump’s presidency “could significantly accelerate” the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) . He noted that s uch an administration could advocate for policies that push DeFi from niche to mainstream, sparking an influx of innovation and investment . Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, known for his tough stance on crypto regulation, is set to leave the agency on Jan. 20, 2025. Donald Trump recently nominated cryptocurrency proponent Paul Atkins to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This move has been met with enthusiasm across the finance industry, which anticipates a more favorable regulatory environment under the upcoming administration. Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, stated that the past four years under Chair Gensler felt like a continuous anti-crypto campaign. She believes Paul Atkins will bring a fresh perspective supported by a strong understanding of the digital asset ecosystem.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homo-shiba-inu-homoshib-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37621002,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52123,1734156667,"Analyst Updates XRP 2017 Fractal Analysis, Sets Timeline for XRP to Hit $26","Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy), a popular technical analyst on X, recently updated his XRP price trend analysis. The update, shared on X, emphasizes how XRP’s current breakout closely mirrors 2017 price behavior. The analyst attributes this alignment to Bitcoin’s entry into genuine price discovery in early November, a condition he called critical for XRP and other lagging altcoins to exhibit significant price movements. $XRP 2017 fractal update FINALLY. it’s happening. i’ve been tracking this basically all year speculating on breakouts, but as i said before, i was ignoring that $XRP and most lagging altcoins do NOTHING until $BTC breaks out in REAL price discovery, not a fake breakout… https://t.co/ZPIin1s4Ew pic.twitter.com/dpIrM7JpL5 — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) December 13, 2024 He attached a chart illustrating a multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern, with XRP’s price consolidating within narrowing support and resistance lines since its peak in 2017. The chart shows that the digital asset recently broke out of this prolonged consolidation phase with its recent surge, signaling the beginning of a potential rally reminiscent of the 2017 bull run. Bitcoin’s Price Discovery and Potential ATH for XRP In March, a few months after the market-shaking Bitcoin ETF approval , Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high of almost $70,000. However, this run was short-lived, and Charting Guy described it as a fake breakout. He asserted that the genuine breakout of Bitcoin recently, which sent it above the $100,000 level, has set the stage for XRP’s recent upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projections Based on the 2017 Fractal The analysis draws direct comparisons to XRP’s behavior during the 2017 cycle, where its price escalated rapidly following a prolonged consolidation phase. Charting Guy believes that if XRP continues to follow this fractal, the cryptocurrency could reach $8 by January 2025. This projection represents a significant increase from XRP’s current price of around $2.3, as shown in the chart. However, he also cautions that the path to higher prices may not be linear. Following the anticipated surge to $8, Charting Guy predicts several months of sideways trading, or “chop,” before XRP advances further. His long-term target aligns with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, estimated at $26 by fall 2025. The technical setup highlighted in the chart and his analysis highlight several factors that support XRP’s ongoing rally. The breakout was decisive, and the timing of the breakout aligns with Bitcoin’s sustained move into price discovery—a phase where its price surpasses all previous highs and attracts renewed investor interest. If XRP adheres to the outlined fractal, the cryptocurrency could offer significant returns over the coming months, as the target of $26 represents a massive 1,030% increase for the digital asset. Notably, other experts have predicted that the digital asset could reach targets as high as $27 in January , with more to come in 2025.

Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point .

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it gained popularity due to its community and social media influence, notably from figures like Elon Musk. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, it remains a subject of interest due to these factors. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run gains momentum, tokens like DOGE show limited short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN is poised for significant growth. Designed for those embodying success and luxury, DOGEN expects 700% presale growth and potential thousand-fold returns. Following BONK, WIF, and Popcat, it builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

In this context, a CryptoQuant analysis highlights a key BTC metric that can serve as a valuable tool for crafting an exit strategy. Have Profits In Bitcoin? Keep An Eye On This Indicator In a Quicktake blog post published today, CryptoQuant contributor Onchain Edge shared insights into timing the sale of BTC during the current bull market. The analyst emphasized the importance of the Bitcoin supply in loss metric, noting its potential to signal when to start exiting the market to preserve profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report For those unfamiliar with Bitcoin, the supply in loss measures the percentage of BTC held at a loss based on its last moved price. A low percentage of supply in loss typically indicates peak market euphoria and serves as a warning to secure profits before a bear market correction begins. According to the CryptoQuant analysis, when BTC supply in loss drops below 4%, it signals a good time for investors to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) out of their BTC holdings and wait for the next bear market lows. Currently, the BTC supply in loss sits at 8.14%. DCA is an investment strategy where investors allocate a fixed amount of money to an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This method helps reduce the impact of market volatility and lowers the average cost per unit over time. The analyst adds: Why? Below 4% means a lot of people are in a profit this is the peak bullrun phase. Trust me you don’t want to be bagholding because you thought we will never see a bear market again. Be fearful when others are greedy. Analysts Confident Of Further Upside In BTC Price While tracking the BTC supply in loss metric can help investors safeguard their profits, recent forecasts from crypto analysts suggest there might still be room for further upside before this indicator becomes crucial. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC forms a classic cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. The premier cryptocurrency looks poised to break out of the bullish formation, with targets as high as $275,000. Similarly, Donald Trump’s victory has brought fresh optimism in the crypto industry. In the recently concluded Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, noted that BTC investors can “expect more than $100,000” during the ongoing market cycle. Other forecasts remain equally bullish. Tom Dunleavy, Chief Investment Officer at MV Global, projects BTC to reach $250,000, while Ethereum (ETH) might climb to $12,000 during this market cycle.

37637826,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105113,1734155857,Here is the Latest Update on Blackrock XRP ETF,"Amid speculation that BlackRock may be preparing to launch an XRP ETF, an executive from the company has provided an update. Over the past few months, several XRP enthusiasts have been anticipating an XRP ETF filing from BlackRock. It all began after a fake XRP ETF filing from the company was filed on the State of Delaware website last year. At the time, the price of XRP skyrocketed tremendously, soaring by over 15%. However, BlackRock quickly refuted the report, emphasizing that the filing was fake. Ever since, several asset managers like Bitwise , Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree have submitted separate applications to the SEC, seeking to launch XRP ETFs in the United States. Latest Update on BlackRock XRP ETF Consequently, speculation suggests that BlackRock could also join the race to offer an XRP ETF to its clients. On the contrary, fresh comments from BlackRock’s Head of ETF Department, Jay Jacobs, indicate that the world’s largest asset manager has no immediate plans to launch an XRP ETF. According to Jacobs, BlackRock is currently focused on its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs rather than introducing a similar product for other altcoins like XRP. Recall that BlackRock launched its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year, with both products attracting inflows of $35.88 billion and $3.19 billion, respectively. Despite this remarkable feat, Jacobs pointed out that only a small fraction of BlackRock’s clients currently own shares of iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Therefore, he emphasized the need to broaden their accessibility to a wider range of clients while stressing that there are no immediate plans to introduce new ETFs tied to altcoins, such as XRP. Bloomberg’s ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas shared Jacob’s comment on X earlier this week. Will the SEC Approve an XRP ETF Application? In the meantime, XRP enthusiasts are anticipating the U.S. SEC approval of at least one of the XRP ETF applications next year. This speculation soared following the reelection of Donald Trump, who has pledged an unwavering support for the crypto industry. Interestingly, Trump has also appointed a new pro-crypto SEC chairman, who could play a major role in deciding whether an XRP ETF could come to fruition. Nonetheless, whether the SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF next year remains to be seen.",NEUTRAL,ETH | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/here-is-the-latest-update-on-blackrock-xrp-etf/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-the-latest-update-on-blackrock-xrp-etf,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Market Optimism Drives Bitcoin Surge Bitcoin’s recent rally, crossing the $100,000 milestone , reflects heightened market optimism. Key drivers include macroeconomic factors such as the potential for a 25 basis-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which has a 96% probability according to CME Group data. Plus, the possibility of favorable crypto policies under a new Trump administration has further boosted sentiment. Analysts Eye a Bullish Period Ahead The broader market outlook for Bitcoin remains highly optimistic. Analysts predict a potential price target of $160,000 by 2025, driven by increasing adoption, institutional interest, and Bitcoin’s status as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Riot’s well-timed acquisition aligns with these projections, placing the company in a strong position to benefit from future price increases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Mining Giants Follow MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy, but at What Cost? , Riot’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation highlights its confidence in the asset’s long-term value and its role in the present market scenario.

37618784,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627292,1734155197,Bitcoin champion MicroStrategy joins Nasdaq-100 elite club,"Nasdaq has revealed that Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy firm will be included in the Nasdaq-100 Index. The exchange operator said on Friday, after a meteoric surge in the shares of the Bitcoin buyer. According to Nasdaq, the change comes into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23. Being added to the index usually drives up the stock’s price, as exchange-traded funds aiming to mirror the index’s performance purchase shares of the newly included company. According to a statement released by Nasdaq on December 13, MicroStrategy is one of three companies to join the index, alongside Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON). However, Gene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina, AI server maker Super Micro Computer, and vaccine maker Moderna were removed. MicroStrategy joins Nasdaq-100 as Bitcoin bet drives $94B surge MSTR now ranks among Nasdaq’s top 100 stocks by market cap. The aggressive investor in the world’s largest crypto asset has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost $94 billion. MicroStrategy, a software company, began buying and holding Bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned. It is now the most significant corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Analysts have stated that MicroStrategy’s choice to acquire BTC to safeguard the value of its reserve assets has increased the attractiveness of its stock, which generally tracks the cryptocurrency’s performance. Bernstein analysts predict that the market will likely focus on MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the S&P 500 in 2025 after its addition to the Nasdaq-100. The brokerage also believes the company’s outlook will continue improving next year as it anticipates “greater visibility and recognition beyond new ETF inflows.” Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks as the election of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump boosted the crypto sector’s optimism about reduced regulatory obstacles. Earlier this month, the digital asset soared above $100,000 for the first time. Bernstein analysts noted that management has shown no signs of slowing this (Bitcoin-buying) down and is comfortable buying the asset in the $95K-$100K range. The crypto industry reacts as MicroStrategy’s Nasdaq inclusion sparks optimism MicroStrategy held roughly 423,650 Bitcoins acquired for about $25.6 billion, based on the average purchase price as of Dec. 8. Based on Bitcoin’s previous close, the investment is worth around $42.4 billion. Crypto analyst Will Clemente shared his thoughts in a December 13 post on X, saying: Now that MSTR is getting added to the Nasdaq, every large pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, and individual retirement account in the world is going to have Bitcoin exposure. — Will (@WClementeIII) December 14, 2024 Jeff Park , head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, commented that the trade of the decade is just getting started and advised to buckle up.

37618357,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393004,1734155048,Bitcoin-Powered MicroStrategy To Join Nasdaq 100: What It Means for Bitcoin,"The post Bitcoin-Powered MicroStrategy To Join Nasdaq 100: What It Means for Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy, the well-known business intelligence firm linked with massive Bitcoin investments, is making headlines once again. The company, led by Michael Saylor, is set to join the prestigious Nasdaq-100 index, which includes big names like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla. This has created excitement among investors and could push Bitcoin to new ATH soon. Why MicroStrategy’s Inclusion Matters MicroStrategy’s entry into the Nasdaq-100 is a big deal. The index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, and MicroStrategy’s rapid growth this year secured its place. With a market value of $92 billion as of November, the company is expected to hold a 0.47% weighting in the index. This move means funds tracking the Nasdaq-100, such as the $300 billion Invesco QQQ ETF, will indirectly hold Bitcoin through MicroStrategy’s investments. The company currently owns around 423,650 Bitcoin , worth over $42 billion, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. Bitcoin’s Rising Popularity Bitcoin recently crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time, fueled by hopes of regulatory changes under President-elect Donald Trump. MicroStrategy’s continued Bitcoin purchases , even at high prices, show the company’s confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Analysts say MicroStrategy remains comfortable buying Bitcoin in the $95,000 to $100,000 range. Speculation On MicroStrategy’s Sustainability While this is a significant milestone, some experts believe MicroStrategy’s stay in the Nasdaq-100 could be temporary. Since most of its value comes from Bitcoin rather than its core business, it might eventually be classified as a financial company. Founder Michael Saylor has also hinted at transforming MicroStrategy into a “Bitcoin bank,” which could change its status further. For now, though, this inclusion is seen as a major milestone, further intertwining the world of cryptocurrencies with mainstream financial markets. As ETFs like SPY and QQQ align themselves with this shift, millions of investors may gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin, adding momentum to its broader adoption.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-powered-microstrategy-will-join-nasdaq-100-what-it-means-for-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37624727,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319447,1734154000,Bitcoin Price Boost? Argentina’s President Paves the Way for BTC Payments in 2025,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, is witnessing sustained bullish momentum, briefly surging to $102,507 before stabilizing around $100,364. This positive trend is fueled by key factors such as growing institutional confidence, exemplified by BlackRock’s 2% Bitcoin portfolio recommendation, and a surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows exceeding $50 billion. Adding to the optimism, Argentina’s President Javier Milei plans to allow Bitcoin as legal currency in 2025. Argentina’s Bitcoin Adoption Plan for 2025 Argentina’s President Javier Milei has unveiled an ambitious plan to allow all currencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), to circulate freely starting in 2025. This policy aims to give Argentinians the freedom to choose their preferred payment method, promoting financial flexibility. Milei’s pro-crypto stance mirrors El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption but is tailored to address Argentina’s unique economic challenges. BREAKING ARGENTINA'S PRESIDENT JAVIER MILEI PLANS TO ALLOW BITCOIN PAYMENTS IN 2025. pic.twitter.com/oTeoXnFpmh — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) December 13, 2024 In addition to supporting cryptocurrency, Milei has proposed cutting national taxes by 90%, enabling provinces to establish their own tax rules. This tax reform seeks to reduce the federal government’s economic role, foster local growth, and incentivize investment. Experts believe these measures could position Argentina as a key player in global cryptocurrency adoption. However, challenges persist. Ricardo Mihura of Bitcoin Argentina notes that disparities in tax treatment compared to the dollar or euro could hinder Bitcoin’s practical use. Despite this, the announcement has ignited optimism in the crypto community. Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Momentum Institutional investments continue to bolster Bitcoin’s price trajectory. BlackRock’s recommendation for a 2% Bitcoin allocation in portfolios has increased interest in crypto ETFs, which saw $50.5 billion in net inflows during their first year. Bitcoin ETFs now boast over $100 billion in assets, providing investors with a secure and regulated way to access the cryptocurrency market. Blackrock officially recommends a 2% allocation to #Bitcoin The world has $900T in assets and 2% of that implies a Bitcoin market Cap of $18T ~ $900K Per Coin. Are you paying attention? pic.twitter.com/RrOAO2mLIR — Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) December 13, 2024 This institutional confidence is further amplified by macroeconomic trends. The U.S. November CPI report, for instance, drove Bitcoin prices above $101,000 , reflecting optimism around the asset as a hedge against inflation. Analysts predict that 2025 will see even greater institutional demand, with sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowments increasing their Bitcoin holdings. South America’s Crypto Growth Argentina’s pro-crypto policies are part of a broader trend in South America, where cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating. Brazil is developing a national digital currency, and Venezuela’s crypto market surged 110% in 2024 . These developments position the region as a potential global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. Key highlights of Argentina’s 2025 crypto reforms include: Free circulation of all currencies, including Bitcoin . 90% reduction in national taxes , promoting economic flexibility. Support for financial autonomy and local economic growth. Political and regulatory shifts, including potential U.S. policy changes, are expected to further support Bitcoin adoption globally. With Argentina’s initiatives and growing institutional backing, Bitcoin’s price could see significant growth in 2025, solidifying its role as a global financial asset. Bitcoin Holds Above $101,000 as Upward Channel Supports Bullish Momentum Bitcoin is trading at $101,750 , showing a minor decline of 0.34% in the last 24 hours. The asset continues to hover within a well-defined upward channel, finding strong support near the $100,050 mark while facing resistance around $102,600 . Buyers appear to dominate above the psychological level of $101,000 , bolstered by the 50-day EMA, which is trending positively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 59 , indicating a moderate bullish momentum as BTC stays within its ascending trendline. Immediate resistance at $102,600 could pave the way for a test of $104,000 if breached. On the downside, a failure to sustain above $101,000 may expose Bitcoin to support levels at $100,000 and $98,500 . Overall, the upward channel structure underpins the bullish bias, with traders keeping an eye on breakout levels for the next directional move. Key Insights: Immediate Resistance: $102,600; potential breakout to $104,000. Immediate Support: $101,000; failure risks drop to $98,500. RSI near 59 reflects moderate bullish momentum. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 The post Bitcoin Price Boost?

37618953,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52119,1734153298,Here’s Why NYDFS RLUSD Approval Is A Big Deal For Ripple and XRP,"Vincent Van Code, a prominent crypto figure, recently emphasized the significance of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approving RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin. The crypto community has been anticipating this approval for weeks and was the final step delaying the stablecoin’s launch. In a post on X, Van Code described it as “one of the biggest things that has happened in crypto,” noting that RLUSD is the first token classified as a regulated financial instrument, or “bank-grade.” This sets it apart from other stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Implicit Recognition of XRPL and Ethereum The NYDFS approval of RLUSD carries broader implications for the ecosystems supporting it. Van Code highlighted that this approval indirectly validates the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchains, which host RLUSD, as suitable platforms for financial-grade operations. While these blockchains are not officially certified as banking grade, the approval signifies their capability to meet rigorous regulatory standards, as they meet the technical and security requirements necessary to host a regulated financial instrument. Key operational features of XRPL and Ethereum, such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency, align with the stringent standards of financial regulators. Furthermore, NYDFS oversight ensures that the platforms can support compliance needs, including real-time audits and reserve tracking. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why RLUSD Is Bank-Grade, but Blockchains Are Not While the NYDFS approval highlights the viability of XRPL and Ethereum for hosting regulated assets, it does not formally certify the blockchains themselves as banking grade. Van Code explained that the approval applies specifically to RLUSD under U.S. banking laws, rather than the broader suitability of the underlying blockchains for core banking functions. Van Code noted that for a blockchain to be classified as banking grade, it would require explicit recognition by major banking regulators, such as the Federal Reserve or the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Additionally, it would need to demonstrate widespread adoption for critical banking services like lending or central clearing. A Significant Moment for the XRP Ledger While RLUSD is revolutionary for many reasons, Van Code emphasized that the NYDFS approval of RLUSD is a milestone that signals the growing maturity of blockchain technology. In another post , he explained that this could be significant for the XRPL, as Ripple launched RLUSD on the Ethereum network to funnel people into the XRPL ecosystem. Launching on the Ethereum network allows exchanges that don’t support XRPL tokens to list RLUSD at launch, while the XRPL provides a cheaper and faster alternative to draw investors toward it.

The price recently hit a new ATH at $0.4245 and this breakout comes after the price passed key resistance levels. VLO’s price had recently traded above the $0.1722 resistance on December 6th but pulled back. On December 10th, the market printed a higher low and has now broken out once again. Velodrome is part of the Optimism network, aimed at making transactions faster and more efficient. The recent surge in Velodrome’s price came after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, listed its token with a seed tag. This listing exposes Velodrome to millions of Binance users. Even more exciting, its fork, Aerodrome, just secured over $20 million from Coinbase Ventures, straight from the open market. With big money backing it, VELO is rapidly gaining attention. What’s Next For VELO? Analyst Louie said that Velodrome is performing well, but with its price entering new territory, it’s unclear when or where it will peak. The analyst spotted a similar price pattern in PEPE before its big breakout, which helped identify the current movement. In PEPE’s case, the price hit resistance at the 2.618 Fibonacci level, marking its all-time high after just two weeks of breakout. If Velodrome follows a similar pattern, the 2.618 level could be a short-to-mid-term target. In the past, cryptocurrencies often saw a price spike when major exchanges list them, but these gains are usually short-lived as the excitement fades. However, with the start of the altcoin season approaching, Velodrome, like Aerodrome, is positioned to benefit from the market’s growing interest in altcoins. Velodrome is a coin with real-world utility, and as more investors look toward altcoins, it could see significant gains.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/velodrome-crypto-price-velo-jumps-135-to-new-all-time-highs-after-binance-listing/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

With time running out on the congressional calendar, the delay could lead to big changes at the SEC. What caused this holdup, and what happens if her term ends? The Vote That Didn’t Happen The committee was supposed to vote on December 11, 2024, to decide whether Crenshaw would get another term. But at the last minute, Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee’s chair, called off the meeting. No real explanation was given. When Brown tried to reschedule for later that day, Republicans blocked the effort. Now, there’s not much time left. If Congress doesn’t act soon, Crenshaw’s term will expire, leaving the SEC with just three commissioners. All of them would be Republicans. This could change how the SEC approaches major issues, especially in cryptocurrency regulation. Crypto Isn’t a Fan One reason Crenshaw’s renomination is getting pushback is her stance on crypto. Many in the i ndustry are unhappy with her opposition to Bitcoin ETFs and what they see as her tough approach to regulation. The CEO of famous crypto exchange Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, has urged senators to block her renomination calling her a “ failure of an SEC Commissioner ”. Source : X.com This isn’t just about Crenshaw, though. It’s part of a bigger battle between the SEC and the crypto world. Crypto leaders want less oversight, and with Crenshaw gone, they might get it. Politics Are in the Mix This delay isn’t just about policy or crypto, though. Politics are playing a big role. Senator Tim Scott, the committee’s top Republican, accused Democrats of rushing Biden’s nominees before President-elect Trump takes office. He called it a “last-minute effort” to stop Trump from shaping the SEC. Donald Trump could appoint someone else if Crenshaw’s renomination does not move forward. Names of other candidates for this position are already being floated. One name being in the highlights is Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner. He is well known for crypto friendly views. Such a shift would likely lead to a more business-friendly SEC, especially when it comes to crypto. What Happens Next? The committee needs to reschedule the vote, but with the congressional session wrapping up soon, time isn’t on Crenshaw’s side. With the expiration of her term, the SEC’s balance of power will shift immediately. That means a new commissioner could step in as early as January 2025. All this fuzz is not just about Crenshaw or her being the commission of SEC. It’s more about the future of the SEC and how it handles emerging industries like crypto.

The market is still in the midst of a larger upward trend, potentially forming a third wave in an Elliott Wave structure. However, an internal correction seems to be occurring, which is not fully visible on the broader time frame. XRP is currently positioned between the all-time high and the 2021 breakout point. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.47 and is up by more than five percent in the last 24 hours. A key level to watch is the $2.48–$2.49 range. A break above this level could signal a move higher. A sustained breakout above the price channel would suggest that XRP may target $2.76 or even higher. Key Support and Resistance Levels From a technical perspective, XRP’s key support levels are between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as prices hold above this range, there could be further upside. On the resistance side, the $3.23–$3.30 range, which includes the all-time high, is important. Longer-term, there is potential for XRP to reach $5–$10, but this could occur during either the third or fifth wave of the larger cycle. The overall trend remains upward, and close attention is being paid to any signs of additional upward momentum. Risk Factors to Consider The main risk areas lie between $1.50 and $1.79. There’s a chance XRP could stay above the 2021 high, avoiding a deep pullback. Instead, the price might experience a sideways correction. If the price moves higher, support levels will shift upward along with the price. Looking at the Shorter Time Frame On the smaller time frame, XRP is attempting to break out of its current price channel, though the breakout has not yet been confirmed.

37637825,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104355,1734151292,"Here’s How Much You Will Earn on Holding 100M Shiba Inu if SHIB Hits $0.0001, $0.001, $0.01, $0.1, or $1","With Shiba Inu projected to reach unprecedented levels in the future, here is how much 100 million SHIB will be worth if the token hits certain ambitious price levels. Shiba Inu is currently trading above the $0.00003 mark after experiencing a surge of 16% in the first week of December. Despite the latest surge, several market watchers believe the meme-based token is preparing for a major rally to unprecedented levels. Notably, most of these experts have set different targets for Shiba Inu, varying from modest to highly ambitious. The price targets include $0.0001, $0.001, $0.01, $0.1, and $1. With Shiba Inu trading at $0.00003128, several market observers believe the current price offers an opportunity for investors to acquire SHIB at a cheaper rate in anticipation of the projected targets.Value of 100M SHIB at $0.0001 For instance, at the current price of $0.00003128, it costs about $3,128 to purchase 100 million Shiba Inu tokens. These 100 million Shiba Inu tokens will spike tremendously in value if SHIB hits any of the aforementioned targets. Reaching the $0.0001 price would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for Shiba Inu. This target is 13.05% above the previous ATH of $0.00008845, set in October 2021. Also, Shiba Inu must surge by 219.69% from the current price of $0.00003128 to reach the $0.0001 target. Shiba Inu 1D Chart Analysts at Forbes speculate that Shiba Inu could clinch the $0.0001 target before the end of next year. If SHIB achieves this milestone, a portfolio containing 100 million Shiba Inu tokens will be worth $10,000, representing a return of $6,872. 100M SHIB at $0.001 Meanwhile, to reach the $0.001 target, Shiba Inu must surge by 3,096% from the current price. According to Changelly analysts, the $0.001 target could become a reality for Shiba Inu by 2033, with $0.0011 set as the maximum price target by then. If this happens, a holding of 100 million Shiba Inu tokens acquired at $3,128 today would be worth $100,000. This represents an ROI of over $96,000. Payout of 100M SHIB at $0.01 The one-cent dream, or $0.01, is one of the most ambitious predictions Shiba Inu has received since its inception. To hit $0.01, a hefty rally of 31,869% from the current price is required. Nonetheless, prominent analysts Yazan XBT and Jason Williams still think Shiba Inu could exceed the $0.01 target this cycle or before the end of next year. Should Shiba Inu reach the milestone, a portfolio of 100 million tokens will be worth $1 million, representing an ROI of $996,872. How Much 100M SHIB Will Be Worth at $0.1 The $0.1 price target for Shiba Inu is highly ambitious, requiring a jaw-dropping surge of 319,593% from the current price. However, there are not many predictions regarding the possible timeline for Shiba Inu to reach this target. Notably, popular AI chatbot ChatGPT predicts that Shiba Inu could trade at $0.1 per token by 2029. If the projection materializes, a 100 million SHIB portfolio will be valued at $10 million. This represents a return of over $9.99 million. 100M SHIB at $1 For Shiba Inu to reach this audacious target, it must rally by 3,196,830% from the current price of $0.00003128. Since this seems highly unlikely to happen, market observers have refrained from setting a timeline regarding when the prediction might come true. Nonetheless, if Shiba Inu ever clinches the $1 target, a portfolio of 100 million SHIB will be worth $100 million. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s hefty circulating supply of over 589 trillion poses a major challenge to SHIB’s potential surge to targets like $0.01, $0.1, and $1. Consequently, a huge portion of Shiba Inu’s supply must be incinerated to give Shiba Inu a chance of hitting these targets.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/14/heres-how-much-you-will-earn-on-holding-100m-shiba-inu-if-shib-hits-0-0001-0-001-0-01-0-1-or-1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-you-will-earn-on-holding-100m-shiba-inu-if-shib-hits-0-0001-0-001-0-01-0-1-or-1,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37616941,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52115,1734150854,Timelines for XRP to Reach $6 and $27 Based on Bifrost Bridge Analysis,"A leading market analyst, EGRAG, has shared new projections for XRP’s price trajectory, supported by his detailed Bifrost Bridge analysis. The cryptocurrency has recently experienced remarkable growth, setting the stage for a bullish outlook. In November 2024, the token surged by 283%, its most significant monthly increase in seven years. The positive momentum has continued into December, with a 26.4% gain recorded in the first 12 days. Drawing comparisons to XRP’s performance in 2017, EGRAG suggests the current market behavior could lead to milestones at $6 and $27. $6 and $27 XRP Price Targets Explained EGRAG’s predictions are based on Fibonacci retracement levels and historical price patterns. He highlighted parallels between XRP’s 2017 cycle and its ongoing rally. In March 2017, it gained 150% from a critical support level, which the analyst named the Purple Foundation. This initial move was followed by an extraordinary 1,330% rally two months later in May 2017. EGRAG believes the cryptocurrency is poised to replicate a similar trajectory. His analysis points to an immediate target zone between $4.3 and $6.4, corresponding to Fibonacci retracement levels of 1.414 and 1.618. He anticipates this could be achieved by the end of December 2024. Looking ahead to January 2025, EGRAG predicts a larger surge, potentially mirroring the 1,330% rally observed in 2017. This would place the asset in a secondary gold region, which spans prices between $13.7 and $27.3, aligning with another significant retracement zone. Addressing XRP Market Cap Concerns Skepticism surrounding these ambitious price targets often revolves around XRP’s market cap and liquidity requirements. EGRAG addressed these concerns by comparing the cryptocurrency market’s total valuation in 2017 and 2024. In May 2017, the total cryptocurrency market cap (TMC) was $60 billion. By December 2024, this figure had grown to $3.7 trillion, representing a 61-fold increase. Applying this multiplier to XRP’s 2017 market cap of $15 billion would result in a potential valuation of $900 billion for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP to achieve this, it would need to command a market share of 9% to 18%, depending on whether the TMC grows to $5 trillion or $10 trillion. According to EGRAG, such dominance is feasible given the asset’s established use cases, particularly in cross-border payments and financial settlements. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously projected the TMC could reach $5 trillion in the near future. Currently, the token is priced at $2.34, with a market cap of $133 billion and a dominance of 3.59%. If it regains its 2017 peak dominance of 31%, its market cap could exceed $1 trillion. These projections underscore the potential for significant growth, provided the token maintains its current momentum and market relevance. EGRAG’s analysis draws attention to XRP’s strong performance and potential to achieve substantial gains in the coming months. By leveraging historical patterns and technical indicators, the analyst has outlined a roadmap for the token to reach $6 and potentially $27. While challenges remain, the token’s role in global payments and the expanding cryptocurrency market make these targets worth monitoring.

37615912,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662183,1734150627,Bitcoin Derivatives Market Heating Up Again: Brace For Impact?,"Data shows that the indicators related to the Bitcoin derivatives market have recently been heating up, which could lead to more volatility in BTC’s price. Bitcoin Open Interest & Leverage Ratio Have Shot Up As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Open Interest has registered a sharp increase alongside the asset’s return above the $100,000 level. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to BTC that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Above $100,000 As Monthly Inflows Hit $80 Billion Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past month: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has witnessed a sharp positive change recently, which implies a large number of positions have popped up on the market. In the chart, Maartunn has highlighted the previous instances of the indicator observing a large percentage increase. It would appear that the price generally saw a cooldown when this pattern formed during the past month. As for the reason behind this trend, the answer is that more positions usually imply the presence of a higher amount of leverage in the sector. A chaotic event known as a squeeze can become more likely to occur in these circumstances. During a squeeze, a large number of positions are liquidated at once and provide fuel to the price move that caused them. The elongated price move then unleashes a cascade of further liquidations. A squeeze can be more probable to affect the side of the market that has the more leveraged positions. The previous increases in the Open Interest came alongside uptrends, so the new positions were likely long ones. This may be why the market ended up seeing a long squeeze to wipe out these excess positions. It’s possible that the latest Open Interest increase could also lead to a similar outcome for Bitcoin, since these fresh positions have also come alongside a rally. It all depends, however, on whether these positions are overleveraged or not. Unfortunately for the cryptocurrency, this requirement also seems to be fulfilled, as data for the Estimated Leverage Ratio shared by CryptoQuant author IT Tech in an X post suggests. The Estimated Leverage Ratio tells us, as its name implies, the average amount of leverage that the users on the derivatives market are opting for. Given that this metric has also spiked alongside the Open Interest increase, the new positions that have appeared could be carrying significant leverage.

37616940,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52071,1734149737,4 Must-Have Altcoins for Massive Gains This December 2024,"Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing significant activity this December, making it an ideal time to strategize investments. Whether you are an experienced trader or a newcomer to the space, identifying the best coins to buy and hold for the short term requires careful research and analysis. In this article, we will examine four standout options that present potential for quick gains: Qubetics ($TICS) , Arweave, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA), and Ondo. Each of these projects offers unique features and promising growth trajectories, positioning them as key contenders in the current market. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Leading the Web3 Revolution Qubetics has positioned itself as a transformative force in the blockchain world. With its 12th-stage presale already amassing over $5.9 million and more than 318 million tokens sold, Qubetics is rewriting the rules of crypto adoption. At just $0.0311 per token, the current price offers a golden opportunity for investors aiming for substantial short-term returns. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a stunning 703.21% ROI, with long-term prospects soaring even higher. What makes Qubetics a standout is its innovative multichain wallet . Picture this: a tech startup in New York is juggling assets across multiple blockchains. With Qubetics, they can seamlessly manage everything from one interface, saving time and reducing operational headaches. For individuals, the wallet offers unparalleled ease of use—whether you’re trading on the go or securing your assets with advanced encryption. Let’s crunch the numbers. A $8,500 investment at $0.0311 gets you 273,922 tokens. If $TICS hits $0.25, your investment skyrockets to $68,480. That’s the kind of short-term gain that’s hard to ignore. Why did this coin make it to this list? With its visionary approach, robust ROI predictions, and practical tools like the multichain wallet, Qubetics is undeniably one of the Best Coins to Buy and Hold for Short Term. 2. Arweave: The Perpetual Storage Pioneer Arweave stands out in the blockchain space with its unique focus on decentralised permanent storage. At a time when data security and immutability are critical, Arweave’s “permaweb” technology offers a revolutionary solution. This project is particularly attractive for content creators, businesses, and institutions seeking to store data forever without recurring fees. Currently trading under $10, Arweave’s AR token has been tipped by analysts to rally to $25 in the coming months, driven by increased adoption and strategic partnerships. Its seamless integration with blockchains like Solana further boosts its credibility and utility. Why did this coin make it to this list? Arweave’s innovative use case, growing market demand, and significant short-term price potential make it one of the Best Coins to Buy and Hold for Short Term. 3. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA): A Visionary Leap Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) brings together blockchain and artificial intelligence in a partnership aimed at solving real-world problems. With AI becoming a cornerstone of modern technology, ASIA’s mission to decentralise and democratise AI development puts it on the map as a project with immense potential.

37616938,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52113,1734149729,Bitcoin vs. Gold: Which One Is the Better Choice in 2025?,"In this decade, Bitcoin outperformed gold-the prior reigning champion of safe-haven investments. Where gold was conventionally used to hedge against economic downturns, Bitcoin has had such an incredible run that it attracted both retail and institutional investors into its fold. At the same time, some critics labeled Bitcoin a speculative bubble. Still, the constant growth and ever-growing utility told a different story. Perform secure and fast transactions of BTC to USDT via the well-known cryptocurrency exchange platform, Exolix. Why Bitcoin is Better than Gold 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity While it creates a deflationary asset with its capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin provides some degree of predictability in supply and a store of value. In contrast to gold, which can be mined, or fiat currencies, which are printed and affected by inflation, the supply of Bitcoin is hardcoded. Thus, scarcity in itself fosters demand; investors popularly regard it as “digital gold” for the modern age. 2. Institutional Adoption and Credibility Large companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have integrated Bitcoin into their balance sheets to illustrate digital currency’s role as a store of value. Further, giants in payments like Visa and PayPal have onboarded Bitcoin into their systems, making it more mainstream at large. Unlike other bubbles, Bitcoin developed some legitimacy as a financial asset because it was being taken up in more and more industries. Increased institutional interest has led to stronger market infrastructure that provides greater long-term stability for reduced volatility. 3. Hedge Against Inflation With governments printing trillions of dollars to curb economic crises, fears of inflation have rocketed. Bitcoin emerged as a hedge, but with a difference from gold: it is digital and borderless, thus even more versatile in a borderless economy. Investors seeking protection from the devaluation of fiat currencies have sought shelter in Bitcoin as a safe alternative increasingly. 4. Global Accessibility and Liquidity By design, Bitcoin is decentralized, and thus it can be accessed and sent essentially anywhere in the world without any of the constraints of physicality. Unlike gold, which is expensive to store and transfer, Bitcoin has unparalleled efficiency in terms of liquidity. Its borderless nature facilitates instant transactions. That makes it a plausible option for storing and sending wealth. So Why Is Bitcoin Not a Bubble? 1. Expanding Infrastructure Unlike other traditional bubbles, the value of Bitcoin is underpinned by an ever-growing ecosystem. Blockchain technology allows for secure, decentralized transactions; and platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken make access to buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin very easy. This growing infrastructure helps Bitcoin fulfill both roles of store of value and medium of exchange and thus secures its viability in the long term. 2. Real-World Use Cases But Bitcoin is much more than a speculative asset, with actual use cases in the real world. From cross-border payments to remittances, Bitcoin has become a lifeline for countries like Venezuela and Argentina facing hyperinflation or economic instability. In that aspect, the capability to shelter one’s wealth and transact is a distinguishing feature from other classic speculative bubbles. 3. Market Maturity In the last few years, the Bitcoin market has matured with increased institutional involvement and the development of financial instruments such as Bitcoin futures and ETFs. This has contributed to decreased volatility and a more diverse investor base. Unlike early speculative periods driven by retail hype, today’s market is supported by structured financial products and a mature investor base. 4. Regulatory Progress The governments of the day are working to develop regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies. Although varied by region, regulation, of a sort, means growing acceptance and a path to legitimacy for Bitcoin. Clearer rules also reduce fraud risk and encourage institutional participation, further stabilizing the market. Bitcoin’s in a Changing Financial Industry The utility of Bitcoin extends beyond being a speculative asset. It has proven to be a strong tool for financial inclusion, opening up global markets to underserved citizens of the world. Its decentralized nature rhymes with the growing demand for financial systems free from traditional gatekeepers. Therefore, for those who want to double their Bitcoin or move towards more stable currencies such as USDT, tools like BTC to USDT at Exolix offer secure, as well as efficient, means toward your goals. Bitcoin as a Transformative Asset Bitcoin’s rise to outperform gold underlines its transformation into a leading financial asset. With its capped supply, institutional support, hedging against inflation, and global accessibility, Bitcoin is anything but a speculative bubble. It represents a paradigm shift in how value is stored and transferred in a digital age. As the infrastructure for Bitcoin expands and adoption continues to grow, it is positioned to be a cornerstone in the financial landscape for years to come. For secure and seamless Bitcoin transactions, turn to trusted platforms like Exolix for BTC to USDT swaps and other cryptocurrency exchanges.

37616935,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52110,1734149037,10 Trillion SHIB In 24 Hours. Here’s What Happened,"Recent data reveals that over 10 trillion Shiba Inu tokens were transacted within 24 hours, primarily driven by whale activity. While the figure appears substantial, it falls short of historical transaction volumes during SHIB’s peak growth phases. This raises questions about the current state of the asset’s market momentum and its prospects for recovery or growth. Comparing Current Volumes to Historical Peaks In previous bullish cycles, Shiba Inu saw transaction volumes significantly surpassing 18 trillion tokens, particularly during rapid price increases. Such heightened activity often indicated strong interest from large holders and a robust market trend. By contrast, transaction volumes during bearish periods tended to dip below 10 trillion tokens, reflecting reduced enthusiasm and lower market engagement. The current figure of 10 trillion tokens places the asset above bearish thresholds but still far from the volume levels that typically signal a strong bullish trend. This subdued activity indicates that the market is neither experiencing significant accumulation nor facing aggressive selling pressure. Price and Support Analysis Chart data shows SHIB hovering near a key support level, with its recent rebound from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) providing a sign of attempted recovery. However, the current transaction volumes do not align with the levels of market participation needed to sustain a prolonged uptrend. This disparity between price action and trading activity suggests limited momentum, leaving the asset in a state of consolidation. Market Sentiment and Whale Activity According to analytics from IntoTheBlock , high transaction volumes are often a precursor to notable market movements, reflecting heightened activity from major stakeholders. However, the present volume does not display the clear patterns of accumulation or distribution that typically precede significant price swings. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This moderate activity indicates that the token may be at a critical juncture. A sharp increase in transaction volumes, particularly from whales, would be required to generate the momentum necessary for a bullish breakout. Until such a catalyst emerges, the token will remain in a consolidation phase. Although 10 trillion SHIB tokens were exchanged in a single day, this figure lacks the significance to signal a decisive market shift. The transaction volumes remain well below historical peaks, reflecting a lack of strong bullish sentiment. For SHIB to regain its former upward trajectory, renewed interest, and significantly higher trading volumes will be essential. Until then, market participants may need to exercise patience as the asset waits for a more definitive catalyst to drive its next major move.

37614977,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52106,1734148233,"Wall Street Expert Agrees that XRP, XLM Are Greatest For Generational Wealth","A Wall Street expert has endorsed XRP and Stellar (XLM) as two of the most promising investment opportunities for building generational wealth. This perspective, initially shared by market analyst Digital G, comes amid turbulent market conditions that have significantly impacted the cryptocurrency space. Market Challenges The cryptocurrency market has recently experienced a sharp downturn, wiping out over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions across nearly 584,000 traders. XRP was among the hardest-hit assets, particularly on Coinbase, where it suffered one of the steepest selloffs. The altcoin’s value declined by 14.87% on Monday, closing near the $2 price level. Despite these setbacks, the asset has demonstrated resilience, maintaining investor interest and optimism. This resilience is a key factor behind the confidence in the token’s long-term potential. Digital G, a former regulated fund manager in the U.K., recently highlighted XRP’s potential as an unparalleled opportunity for investors seeking to build generational wealth. He identified the token alongside Stellar (XLM) and XDC Network (XDC) as cryptocurrencies with significant potential for future growth. Linda P. Jones, a Wall Street analyst and author, has strongly supported XRP and XLM’s wealth-building potential. Jones, known for her expertise in wealth management, emphasized this view in her book, 3 Steps to Quantum Wealth . According to Jones, these digital assets offer life-changing returns on investments and could transform the financial landscape. I agree with this statement so much, I wrote a book about them and the life changing wealth building opportunity. #xrp #xlm #xdc https://t.co/yuULOtvc2B — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 9, 2024 Addressing Real-World Financial Challenges The appeal of XRP, XLM, and XDC lies in their ability to address critical challenges in the global financial system. These cryptocurrencies focus on improving cross-border payments and enabling efficient, low-cost, and scalable financial transactions. Partnerships with banks, governments, and financial institutions further strengthen their ecosystems, highlighting their real-world applicability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While these tokens faced underwhelming performance in previous years, recent developments and market activity have reignited interest. XRP, for instance, has seen a remarkable 303% increase since November. Similarly, XLM has surged by 448%, and XDC has recorded a 175% rise during the same period. Expert Price Predictions The impressive performance of these assets has led to optimistic forecasts from market analysts. EGRAG, a well-known analyst, recently compared the token’s price movement to Tesla’s 2018 growth pattern, suggesting a potential 50% decline before a significant rally of over 3,500%, potentially driving its price beyond $40. Other projections include a bullish outlook for XLM, with analyst, Charting Guy, identifying a pattern that could lead to a price target of $5. Meanwhile, Javon Marks has set a breakout target of $0.1814 for XDC based on its technical charting structure. The digital asset’s resilience and potential, alongside similar assets like XLM and XDC, continue to attract attention from financial experts and investors alike. As these tokens grow to solve real-world financial challenges, they are positioned to deliver significant long-term value. These developments make XRP, in particular, a great investment option for those seeking transformative wealth-building opportunities.

37614080,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626956,1734147000,Bonk vs Lightchain AI– How Meme Coins Compare to Tech-Driven Tokens,"The cryptocurrency world is a mix of humor and innovation, with projects ranging from playful meme coins to cutting-edge technological solutions. At one end of the spectrum is Bonk, a meme-inspired coin that thrives on community engagement and viral momentum. On the other side stands Lightchain AI ($LCAI) , a revolutionary token that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain to address real-world challenges. Don’t miss out on the ongoing Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to this groundbreaking project. In this article, we’ll compare Bonk and Lightchain AI, examining their core features, unique value propositions, and potential in the constantly evolving crypto market. Discover how meme coins measure up against innovation-driven tokens in today’s competitive landscape. Bonk: A Meme Coin with Community Appeal Bonk burst onto the scene as a dog-themed cryptocurrency designed to capture the attention of meme enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. Following in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Bonk leans heavily on its community for growth and adoption. Key Features of Bonk: Community-Driven Growth: Bonk’s strength lies in its loyal community, which drives engagement through social media campaigns, memes, and word-of-mouth. Low Entry Barrier: Like many meme coins, Bonk’s low price and minimal technical requirements make it accessible to novice investors. Entertainment and Virality: Bonk’s lighthearted branding and focus on fun have helped it carve a niche in the meme coin space. Challenges: Lack of Utility: Bonk’s value is largely speculative, with little real-world application to sustain long-term growth. High Volatility: Meme coins like Bonk are subject to rapid price fluctuations driven by social sentiment rather than intrinsic value. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence In stark contrast to Bonk, Lightchain AI is a tech-driven token that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver real-world solutions. Its focus on innovation and utility sets it apart in a market often crowded with speculative projects. Key Features of Lightchain AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s unique consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization. This creates a system where network security directly contributes to advancements in AI. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): The AIVM serves as a dedicated computational layer for executing AI-specific tasks on the blockchain. From predictive analytics to real-time decision-making, AIVM expands the scope of decentralized applications (dApps). Real-World Applications: Lightchain AI addresses inefficiencies in industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance by integrating blockchain transparency with AI’s computational power. Eco-Friendly Design: By prioritizing meaningful computations, Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism reduces energy consumption compared to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems. Decentralized Governance: $LCAI token holders actively shape the ecosystem’s future, ensuring transparency and community-driven innovation. Comparing Bonk and Lightchain AI 1. Utility: Bonk: Bonk’s primary utility lies in its role as a meme coin. Its appeal is more about entertainment and community engagement than solving real-world problems. Lightchain AI: $LCAI stands out for its tangible utility, addressing real-world challenges through AI-driven solutions and decentralized technology. 2. Technology: Bonk: Bonk operates on a basic blockchain infrastructure with no unique technological innovations. Lightchain AI: Lightchain AI’s PoI and AIVM represent cutting-edge advancements in blockchain and AI integration, positioning it as a leader in decentralized intelligence. 3. Market Potential: Bonk: While Bonk’s virality can lead to short-term gains, its long-term sustainability is questionable without a clear use case. Lightchain AI: With applications in high-demand industries and a focus on sustainability, Lightchain AI has significant growth potential and long-term viability. 4. Investor Appeal: Bonk: Bonk appeals to risk-tolerant investors looking for quick, speculative gains. Lightchain AI: $LCAI attracts investors seeking innovation, utility, and long-term value. Real-World Applications: Bonk vs. Lightchain AI Bonk’s Applications: Community Engagement: Bonk’s primary application is fostering a sense of community and entertainment through memes and social campaigns. Lightchain AI’s Applications: Healthcare: AI-driven diagnostics and predictive modeling transform patient care, making processes more efficient and accurate. Supply Chain: Blockchain transparency combined with AI-powered insights ensures efficient inventory management and logistics. Finance: Smarter risk assessment, fraud detection, and DeFi applications are enabled by $LCAI’s technology. Risks and Challenges Bonk: Volatility: Like other meme coins, Bonk’s value is highly volatile and susceptible to market sentiment. Sustainability: Without a clear use case, Bonk’s long-term viability remains uncertain. Lightchain AI: Market Awareness: Educating industries and investors about $LCAI’s value proposition is critical for adoption. Competition: As blockchain and AI integration gains traction, Lightchain AI must stay ahead through continuous innovation. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out While meme coins like Bonk have their place in the crypto world, Lightchain AI’s focus on solving real-world problems gives it a distinct advantage. Its unique features—such as PoI, AIVM, and real-world applications—make it a compelling choice for investors and enterprises alike. Final Thoughts Bonk and Lightchain AI represent two vastly different approaches to cryptocurrency. Bonk thrives on community engagement and meme culture, offering short-term excitement and speculative opportunities. In contrast, Lightchain AI focuses on innovation, utility, and long-term value, addressing real-world challenges with cutting-edge technology. For investors seeking sustainable growth and meaningful contributions to the blockchain ecosystem, Lightchain AI emerges as the clear choice. While Bonk’s appeal lies in its entertainment value, $LCAI offers a vision of blockchain’s future—one that combines transparency, scalability, and the transformative power of artificial intelligence.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field.

37612992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662163,1734145251,"Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week","According to Tony Severino, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), the Bitcoin price could surge significantly to $120,000 by next week. The analyst has grounded his bullish projection on Bitcoin’s daily Bollinger Bands (BB), highlighting that these indicators are expanding while BTC displays a similar price action observed in 2023. BTC Price Targets $120,000 ATH On December 12, Severino shared a chart demonstrating a technical analysis of Bitcoin using the Bollinger Bands and a historical correlation of late 2023 price behavior. The analyst predicted that if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could reach a $120,000 all-time high by next week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green Severino disclosed that Bitcoin’s daily Bollinger Bands are expanding, while its current price action reflects a similar bullish trend observed in 2023. Looking at the analyst’s 2024 price chart, Bitcoin’s upper and lower Bollinger Bands are represented by a respective red and green trend line. Typically, an expanding Bollinger Band indicates increasing price volatility. Bitcoin could start a bullish trend if it breaks above the upper band or enter a bearish phase if it drops below the lower band. Bitcoin has also tested the lower Bollinger Band at $92,560 and is now steadily approaching the upper band at $102,323. Additionally, the analyst has placed Bitcoin’s Bollinger Band basis at $97,442. Severino observed that the Bitcoin price chart on the right shows a historical instance in late 2023 when BTC broke above the upper Bollinger band and followed with a substantial price rally as it walked the bands higher. This historical trend is currently being replicated in Bitcoin’s 2024 price setup, indicating a potential for a significant upward price movement if similar conditions seen in 2023 are met. If Bitcoin’s price closes above the upper Bollinger Band with a buy signal, it could spark a rally toward $120,000. Currently trading at $100,219, Bitcoin would need to increase by 20% to reach the analyst’s projected target by next week. Analyst Confirms Bitcoin Bollinger Band Bullish Signal Also commenting on Bitcoin’s recent price action, Trader Tardigrade, an analyst on X, revealed that BTC’s Bollinger Bands and Bollinger Band Width (BBW) are signaling the potential for a strong uptrend continuation. Sharing a price chart, the analyst noted that Bitcoin previously dipped to the middle of the band but quickly recovered, underscoring the supportive nature of the mid-band. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything Trader Tardigrade has revealed that Bitcoin’s BBW has hit a lower contraction, while its recent price movements resemble those of early November, just before its price skyrocketed from $70,000 to $100,000. If Bitcoin’s price maintains its current bullish trend, the analyst predicts a surge that could drive the cryptocurrency to a new all-time high at $136,000. This substantial price increase would represent a massive 36% rally from Bitcoin’s current price.

37612934,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52103,1734144719,ChatGPT Says SHIB Will Hit This Price On Christmas Day,"According to ChatGPT, Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most talked-about meme coins in the cryptocurrency world, is set to make a strong comeback this holiday season. The AI-driven model has forecasted that SHIB could climb approximately 21.9% to $0.000035 by Christmas Day. This projection has stirred excitement among SHIB enthusiasts, especially as the token currently trades at $0.00002869, marking a slight 0.3% dip in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT’s Christmas Price Prediction for SHIB When asked about SHIB’s potential during the festive period, ChatGPT shared its bullish outlook: “Given current market dynamics, SHIB has the potential to climb to $0.000035 by December 25. This estimate reflects a 21.9% increase from its current price, buoyed by ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.” This optimistic projection aligns with the holiday spirit, as the Shiba Inu team rolls out strategic initiatives to bolster the token’s utility and user engagement. Holiday Cheer from the Shiba Inu Team One of the primary factors underpinning ChatGPT’s prediction is the Shiba Inu development team’s latest collaboration with K9 Finance . Together, they have announced a reward initiative aimed at increasing participation in Shibarium’s liquid staking feature. This program, timed strategically for the holiday season, seeks to incentivize first-time users, thereby driving more engagement and transaction volume within the ecosystem. The initiative underscores the team’s commitment to expanding the Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain, a crucial element of Shiba Inu’s roadmap. By offering financial rewards for staking, the team aims to attract retail and institutional participants, further strengthening SHIB’s position as a multi-functional asset rather than just a meme coin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Factors Supporting SHIB’s Rise Growing Ecosystem: Shibarium continues to gain traction as developers integrate more decentralized applications (dApps) and enhance its functionality. The staking reward initiative could accelerate this adoption, creating a positive feedback loop for SHIB’s utility and value. Holiday Sentiment: Cryptocurrencies often see heightened trading activity during the holiday season, as retail investors look to capitalize on end-of-year market trends. This seasonal bullishness could provide additional momentum for SHIB. Broader Market Recovery: With Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing positive price movements, the overall crypto market sentiment appears to be shifting towards optimism. Altcoins like SHIB typically benefit from such trends, as investors diversify into smaller-cap assets with high growth potential. ChatGPT’s 21.9% SHIB rally prediction is not just wishful thinking but backed by tangible developments and market sentiment. The Shiba Inu team’s focus on innovation and the holiday-themed incentive program, positions SHIB for a potential breakout.

Don’t Sleep on the Best Meme Coin Presale of 2024: BTFD is Here to Make Millionaires!,"Have you ever felt that pang of regret, hearing how early investors in meme coins like Brett (BRETT) turned mere pocket change into fortunes? If you weren’t among the lucky few riding the Brett wave, here’s your shot at redemption. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the best meme coin presale of the year, raising over $3.7 million in record time and captivating the crypto world. With its presale currently in its 12th stage and a stellar combination of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, staking, and community-driven initiatives, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight. Boasting an irresistible entry price of $0.00013, the coin is poised to list at $0.0006 after the presale. Early buyers are snapping up over 53 billion coins, with more than 5,000 Bulls already on board. And it’s no surprise—BTFD doesn’t just ride the meme coin frenzy; it’s creating a revolution. Brett (BRETT): A Tale of FOMO and Fortunes Launched in early 2024, Brett (BRETT) skyrocketed to fame as one of the most promising meme coins of the year. With an all-time high of $0.2342, Brett transformed countless early adopters into overnight millionaires. However, its price of $0.1749 today tells a story of missed chances for those who hesitated. What made Brett so popular? Its seamless integration into the Base Chain ecosystem, unique branding, and early listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase propelled it to stardom. Yet, like many meme coins, Brett wasn’t without its hiccups. Concerns over insider supply and market corrections made headlines, reminding us how volatile and rewarding this sector can be. But here’s the kicker—history is repeating itself, and this time, it’s wearing BTFD Coin’s bull horns. If you missed out on Brett’s meteoric rise, you don’t have to be on the sidelines anymore. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Bulls Are Charging, Don’t Miss the Ride! BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a movement. Built on the ethos of buying the dip, BTFD empowers its community to turn market volatility into opportunity. And boy, is it delivering on that promise. So far, the meme coin presale has smashed milestones, raising $3.7 million after hitting $1 million in just 10 days. With its P2E game beta version live and a robust staking system offering a juicy 90% APY, BTFD is all set to take the meme coin frenzy to uncharted territories. The Numbers Game Investors can still grab BTFD coins at just $0.00013, but time’s ticking. Consider this: with a $1,000 investment today, you’d secure 7,692,307 coins. Once BTFD lists at $0.0006, that $1,000 could become a whopping $4,615—a 361% return on investment. And it’s not just about returns. BTFD Coin offers unparalleled accessibility: 1 Ethereum buys 30,113,000 BTFD coins 1 Solana buys 1,739,846 BTFD coins 1 Bitcoin buys 769,053,846 BTFD coins Staking and Play-to-Earn Excitement The P2E game’s beta is now live, featuring the iconic Bulls Squad. While no rewards are currently available, this is just a warm-up act. By full launch, players can earn, stake, and cash out for serious gains. And the 90% APY staking rewards? That’s just icing on the cake. Referral Programme: Double the Fun, Double the Gains BTFD Coin’s referral programme is a game-changer, rewarding not just buyers but community builders. Here’s how it works: Connect your wallet on the presale page to receive a unique referral code. Share your code, and anyone using it to buy over $50 gets 10% extra BTFD coins. The top 20 referrers earn 10% of all purchases made through their code—paid directly in BTFD tokens . With over 5,000 holders already on board, this programme is an excellent way to amplify your earnings while promoting the coin. Why BTFD Coin Could Eclipse Brett’s Success While Brett’s rise was impressive, BTFD brings an entirely new level of innovation and community engagement. Its strategic roadmap includes 16 presale stages, each offering early adopters the best prices. By integrating meme culture with solid tokenomics and utility, BTFD has created a recipe for success. Moreover, BTFD’s Ethereum-based foundation ensures scalability, security, and accessibility, setting it apart from many competitors. With features like locked liquidity for three years and a transparent token allocation strategy, it’s clear this project is built to last. Don’t Let This Chance Slip Away Brett’s early adopters laughed their way to the bank, while latecomers watched in envy. Now, BTFD Coin is your chance to rewrite that story. With the best meme coin presale of 2024 in full swing, the only question left is: Will you seize the moment or let it pass you by? Get in on the action before the 12th stage closes, and secure your stake in what promises to be the next big thing in crypto.

Expert Insights appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XLM, Stellar’s native token, is poised for notable upside momentum, as predicted by a crypto expert in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). On December 13, 2024, the expert boldly predicted that XLM could reach $2, representing nearly a 350% increase in value. Expert Predicts XLM to Surge 350% to $2 However, experts believe the recent sharp price decline is just a temporary setback on the path toward XLM reaching $2. Current Price Momentum The past few days haven’t been favorable for XLM, as it hasn’t experienced any significant price changes. However, today the token saw an impressive price surge of over 5% in the past 24 hours. With this, the XLM price has now risen to the $0.437 level. Despite the price increase, its trading volume dropped by 13% during the same period, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Data also shows that over the past 7 days, the asset is still down by 13%. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level In addition to this prediction and recent price performance, CoinPedia’s technical analysis suggests that XLM is demonstrating bullish price action on its daily timeframe. According to the XLM daily chart, it appears that the asset is forming a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and is currently consolidating near the breakout level. Source: Trading View Based on price action, if XLM breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.47 level, there is a strong possibility it could initially rise by 32% to reach the $0.63 level. Furthermore, based on the pattern, XLM could potentially surge by 537% to reach the $3.04 level in the future. On the positive side, XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has sufficient room to rise in the coming days. $118 Million of XLM Outflow from Exchanges This bullish technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, XLM’s spot inflow/outflow data reveals that exchanges have experienced a significant outflow of XLM in recent days. Over the past 10 trading days, exchanges have witnessed a substantial $117.80 million worth of XLM outflow.

According to the top crypto analyst, the Dogecoin price is projected to surge to $10, and the Shiba Inu price to $1. While this top crypto analyst predicts these bold targets for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, he also predicts a $22 target for the trending Ethereum-based project ETFSwap (ETFS), which was recently listed on Uniswap . Why You Should Invest In ETFSwap (ETFS) First According to the top crypto analyst, ETFSwap (ETFS) is predicted to surge to $22 and possibly outperform the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price, even with their impressive prospects. The top crypto analysts attribute this anticipated surge of ETFSwap (ETFS) to its recent listing on Uniswap and its groundbreaking platform, which has ties to the trillion-dollar ETF market. For context, the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform is an innovative platform designed to enable the trade of tokenized ETFs backed by actual ETF securities on-chain. As the first decentralized ETF platform, ETFSwap (ETFS) provides investors with unique advantages like 24/7 accessibility and quick conversions of ETFs, Bonds, and Futures into cryptocurrencies. With no direct competition in this market segment, ETFSwap (ETFS) is poised to lead the growth of tokenized real-world assets by 2025. The platform’s launch on Uniswap coincides with what could be a significant bull run, as the platform is further expected to flourish through robust partnerships with MiCa-compliant banks that engage in trading both securities and cryptocurrencies. In addition to its ETF offerings, ETFSwap (ETFS) will provide extensive trading services for cryptocurrencies, enabling users to leverage market-making expertise and profit margins up to 10x to maximize profits. Interestingly, the ETFSwap (ETFS) team has successfully completed the KYC audit using SolidProof . The ETFS token has also been listed on CoinMarketCap , so users can now track the live price. This is a unique opportunity to buy the ETFS token while it is still affordable on Uniswap before it surges to the $22 mark. Moreover, when investors buy the ETFS token, they get the opportunity to earn an 87% APY from its staking pool. They are also entitled to AI-powered trading tools like the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, which analyze several market data points and recommend the best ETFs. With these interesting features and so many incentives, ETFSwap is bound to enjoy massive traction that will potentially send its price to $22 before the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Dogecoin Price Future Outlook The Dogecoin price has been consolidating after a significant surge in November. The Dogecoin price surged by over 160% in the past month, only just recently slowing down. Although currently experiencing a downturn, some analysts anticipate a significant rally for the Dogecoin price. Some analysts are projecting that it could surge by 2,272% to reach $10 in 2025 if historical trends hold. Renowned analyst Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin’s historical performance could serve as a guide for its future trajectory. According to his analysis, if Dogecoin follows its historical trajectory, the Dogecoin price can break past the $10 mark. Can The Shiba Inu Price Touch $1? The Shiba Inu price is currently trading at approximately $0.000025, generating significant buzz within the crypto community. The excitement stems from Shiba Inu’s Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution that has contributed to a remarkable 40% increase in the Shiba Inu price over the past month. Analysts think the Shiba Inu price will keep going up, predicting a target of $0.000041 to $0.000049 by 2025. Even though these numbers show that things are getting better, reaching a $1 price is virtually impossible. According to analysts, it would require a market cap of around $589 trillion – many times larger than the global economy and Bitcoin’s current market cap. Conclusion While the Shiba Inu price and Dogecoin price are predicted to hit $1 and $10, respectively, achieving these targets may be unrealistic. Reaching such prices would require their market caps to scale into the trillions, far exceeding the current market and economic conditions. ETFSwap (ETFS) , however, presents a genuine opportunity. Its innovative ETF platform and recent Uniswap listing have positioned it for significant growth. With major exchange listings expected soon, top crypto analysts predict the ETFS token could soar to $22. So, join the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform now when the token is at an attractive price.

37610913,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/hbar-at-a-turning-point-pepe-moonshot-ahead-and-tits-ready-to-explode-crypto-weekend-showdown,1734141504,"HBAR at a Turning Point, PEPE Moonshot Ahead, and TITS Ready to Explode: Crypto Weekend Showdown","Weekend Crypto Insights: Bloody Monday/Tuesday, HBAR’s Next Moves, and the Wild World of Memecoins This week in crypto started with a bang—and not the good kind. Bloodbath on Monday and Tuesday brought market chaos, and as we approach the final weekend before the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, all eyes are on the macro stage. Earlier this week, the European Central Bank cut rates, and the U.S. is widely expected to follow with a 0.25% reduction. According to the CME Group, the likelihood of this cut is a staggering 93.4%. source : https://www.cmegroup.com/ For crypto, rate cuts should be bullish—but, as always, ""should"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting. In this weekend review, we’ll focus on three different projects:= $ HBAR (ranked 18, mcap: $11.85B), a blockchain favorite of institutions, as it seems &navigating critical support levels atm. $ PEPE (ranked 21, mcap: $10.34B): the leading large-cap memecoin defying market turbulence. $ TITS (ranked 3036, mcap: $128 million): the degen’s ultimate thrill ride, now at a pivotal chart juncture. Let’s dive into the charts and see where the opportunities lie. HBAR: Testing Its Limits—Critical Levels and Next Moves Hedera’s (HBAR) performance this year has been nothing short of impressive, with a 600% rally from its lows to a yearly high of $0.392. However, after hitting an overheated RSI of 88 (weekly) and 93 (4-hour), a 40% correction has brought HBAR to a defining moment. Key Levels and Scenarios Support at $0.228 (Golden Pocket) Why It Matters: This Fibonacci retracement zone (61.8%-65%) aligns with historical volume support, offering a high-probability bounce area in bullish trends. Strategy: Enter long only if confirmed by rising volume and a bullish close above this level. Set stop-loss below $0.206. Resistance at $0.33 Why It Matters: Former double bottom breakout target, now flipped into a major resistance zone. Strategy: Look for volume-backed breakout above $0.33 to target $0.40+. Use a trailing stop to secure gains. Structural Safety at $0.185 Why It Matters: This is the last support for HBAR’s broader bullish trend. Strategy: Consider long-term accumulation if prices return here. Moving Averages in Focus (4H Chart) 50 MA ($0.307): Immediate resistance for short-term momentum. 100 MA ($0.267): Now a flipped resistance after the recent breakdown. 200 MA ($0.187): Long-term structural support (also Fib 0.786); losing this could indicate a broader trend shift. Conclusion HBAR is at a crossroads. $0.228 remains the must-hold support long-term, while $0.33 is the next breakout level to watch. Follow volume, respect levels, and let the chart guide your moves. PEPE: The Strongest Frog in the Pond The memecoin juggernaut PEPE is on a roll, recently hitting an all-time high of $0.00000284. Unlike $DOGE , which is struggling to overcome $0.50 resistance (well, even 42c atm), PEPE has shown resilience, cementing its place as the current leader in the memecoin sector. Key Levels and Scenarios Support Zones $0.0000215 (50 MA): Holding this dynamic support keeps the short-term bullish structure intact. $0.0000157–$0.0000177 (Golden Pocket): Strongest structural support, reinforced by a 4-hour Fair Value Gap (FVG). Resistance Zones $0.00000284 (ATH): Breaking this level opens the door to the bullish pennant target of $0.00000410. What PEPE Needs Volume Surge: A breakout above $0.00000284 must come with a volume spike to confirm momentum. DOGE Revival: DOGE breaking $0.50 could trigger a broader memecoin rally, lifting PEPE higher. Conclusion PEPE has the momentum, but it needs DOGE to join the party. Watch for a breakout above $0.00000284 with volume confirmation—this could push PEPE to uncharted waters. $TITS: From Drama to Potential Comeback Few memecoins live up to the drama of $TITS, which tumbled from its rising wedge only to form a bullish falling wedge. This setup has the potential to flip the narrative entirely, with a breakout signaling a rally to 32 cents or beyond (currently around 12.5c). The Fundamentals (Yes, There Are Some) Fully Circulating Supply: 999.93M tokens, eliminating fears of sudden unlocks. Community Power: Entirely driven by hype and memes, $TITS relies on its ability to keep buzz alive. Why It’s an utmost Gamble: Rug Pull Risks: Without fundamentals, the project lives and dies by momentum. Thin Volume: With just $2.37M daily trading volume, whales can easily cause chaos. Actionable Play Watch for a falling wedge breakout. If confirmed, 15 cents is the immediate target. Failure, however, could send prices back to 2 cents in no time. Conclusion $TITS is pure speculation, but the wedge breakout could deliver outsized gains for degenswilling to take the risk. Final Thoughts The crypto market is teetering on the edge of opportunity and risk as macroeconomic pressures loom. A Fed rate cut might be bullish for digital assets, but markets are rarely that simple. Liquidity remains fragile, institutional interest is cautious, and retail enthusiasm, while improving, is nowhere near 2021’s peak. For HBAR, the key is whether the Golden Pocket holds at $0.228. This level represents a crucial line in the sand for its bullish structure. For PEPE, it’s a battle of momentum versus macro. Can it maintain strength while DOGE, its sector heavyweight, continues to flounder? And for $TITS, it’s a high-stakes gamble that’s as much about timing as it is about conviction. This weekend, play with discipline: Watch the volume: Momentum needs fuel, and low participation spells traps. Respect your stops: The market doesn’t care about your hopes or your account size. Stay realistic: A rally in one coin doesn’t mean the entire market will follow. The golden rule remains: plan your trade and trade your plan. FOMO is the quickest route to tears, while patience is a trader’s best weapon. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Five cryptocurrencies, including the new meme coin DOGEN, make investors’ shortlist for 10,000% ROI potential. Table of Contents DOGEN rockets as Trump’s win propels meme coins Solana Avalanche Polkadot Chainlink Conclusion In an ever-evolving digital currency landscape, a select few cryptocurrencies are capturing attention with their potential for massive growth. These hidden gems are on the radar of savvy investors, promising to significantly boost portfolios. DOGEN rockets as Trump’s win propels meme coins DOGEN, the unapologetically bold meme coin for alpha investors, is poised for a significant rise as Trump’s recent U.S. election victory injects fresh excitement into the crypto world, particularly among meme coin enthusiasts. Trump’s pro-crypto agenda is already making waves, promising to solidify the U.S. as a global crypto powerhouse. Adding Elon Musk, Dogecoin biggest cheerleader, suggests a combustible mix for meme coin success. With these two titans sparking market enthusiasm, DOGEN is primed for its moment. In the wake of the election, Dogecoin jumped from $0.15 to $0.39, delivering a 130% gain in one week. Similarly, DOGEN is riding the wave, climbing from $0.0003 to $0.0011 — a 300% leap. With 13 presale stages leading to its token generation event (TGE), DOGEN is projected to hit $0.0019, marking a 500% increase from its launch price. For those who loved DOGE’s meteoric rise, DOGEN might be the next golden ticket. The heart of DOGEN lies in its vibrant community, which has already contributed over $3,000,000 to its presale. DOGEN’s multi-level referral program sweetens the deal, offering: 7% USDT rewards for direct referrals 2% rewards from second-tier referrals 1% rewards from third-tier referrals This structure ensures everyone wins while driving unparalleled engagement. DOGEN isn’t just a coin; it’s a lifestyle. With exclusive investor campaigns, luxury perks, and access to top-tier opportunities, DOGEN is a ticket to living large. Interested investors can flex hard and potentially earn big through the DOGEN presale. Solana Solana is a blockchain platform designed for high scalability and fast transactions. It supports decentralized applications and offers an alternative to platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions by using a unique architecture to quickly process thousands of transactions. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, running programs, and rewarding network participants. The SOL coin supports a range of projects on Solana, and its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on factors like market trends and adoption by developers and users. Avalanche Avalanche is a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and rapid transactions, capable of processing 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable subnets and employs a hybrid consensus mechanism, aiming for transaction finality in less than two seconds. Avalanche consists of three interoperable chains that facilitate various operations, including transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, Avalanche’s native token, is crucial for settling transaction costs, network security, and operating subnets. With its strong utility, AVAX holds significant potential. You might also like: Whale-endorsed crypto eyes 46,700% gains, leaving PEPE and BONK Polkadot Polkadot is a decentralized protocol that allows value and data to be shared across blockchain networks without intermediaries, using parachains to improve speed and scalability. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within its network, enabling holders to participate in the development and verification processes. Polkadot’s technology has potential due to the growing need for interoperability. Chainlink Chainlink is a decentralized network that links smart contracts to external data sources, APIs, and systems. It allows smart contracts on the blockchain to access real-world data, enhancing their usefulness. Chainlink ensures data accuracy through a reputation system. The LINK token rewards those who provide data and supports staking to keep the network secure. By enabling interaction between blockchains and real-world applications, Chainlink has significant potential. Conclusion Though SOL, AVAX, DOT, and LINK may have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, the alpha meme coin anticipates 700% growth by presale’s end and potential thousand-fold returns.

Here's Why Investors Are Buying These Altcoins Instead,"There is much speculation that Ripple will soon reach the $3 level after its recent rapid appreciation. Meanwhile, Avalanche looks primed for a pump as one of its holders is about to reach the White House, and the promising Rollblock ($RBLK) presale rolls out sports betting as analysts predict incredible 50x returns! Ripple ($XRP) ETF Approval In The Works? Ripple has fallen 1% to $2.44. Many Ripple investors were wiped out by the recent leveraged flush to $2.35, as open interest in the Ripple market reached unsustainable levels. Despite this, Ripple holders found themselves up an astonishing 340% in a month, as this token that many crypto analysts had written off as a “dinosaur” coin rocketed its way up the rankings to become the third-largest crypto asset. Speculation is rife that Ripple will be next in line to receive its own dedicated spot ETF fund as more S-1 applications reached the desk of the SEC recently. This would be incredibly bullish for the Ripple ecosystem, as would the rollout of the imminent RLUSD dollar-backed stablecoin launch on Ripple. Recently, Ripple whales were detected adding over $4.7 billion to their holdings. This could be enough to launch Ripple to $3 in the near term. Avalanche ($AVAX) Counts Future VP As A Fan Avalanche has recovered 9% from 10% loss in the last 24 hours to find support at $52.15. Despite this short-term “buy the dip” opportunity, Avalanche holders are still riding high after adding over 74% to the value of their holdings in just one month. Avalanche recently rolled out the Avalanche9000 upgrade, improving the usability and scaling potential of the Avalanche chain. It was recently revealed that Donald Trump’s choice of vice president, J.D. Vance, is a fan of Avalanche and has been holding the Avalanche token for some time now. This is likely to result in favorable consideration for Avalanche products going forward, ensuring a bright future for U.S.-based Avalanche holders. Rollblock ($RBLK) Delivering On DeFi Gaming Vision Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is well on the way to achieving its goal of bringing decentralized finance to the Las Vegas gaming experience. $RBLK recently reached $0.041 as investors keep on piling in. This DeFi GambleFi upstart delivers on a truly outstanding gaming platform with its promise to bring trust and transparency back to the $450 billion online gambling sector where it belongs. Rollblock offers over 7,000 classic games, from old favorites such as roulette and Monopoly to many brand-new launches such as Candyland. The Rollblock sports betting feature also recently went live to hugely positive fanfare from the Rollblock community. Now the Rollblockcommunity can earn huge amounts of $RBLK by placing wagers on their favorite sporting tournaments. Everything is fully regulated and community-backed, as players enjoy competitive PVP modes and live dealer settings. Each week, the platform will buy back masses of tokens using its operating profits, leading to 60% of these purchases being burned for all time and the remaining 40% acting as yield for loyal Rollblock stakers. The $RBLK token is a powerhouse and destined for crypto stardom this cycle thanks to its incredible utility and attractive deflationary supply.

For the crypto travel agency, which lately revealed having reached $100 million in annual revenue, this increase marks a turning point. From $0.80 to $30.1, the price of AVA has exploded, courtesy of growing interest in the use of digital currency in the travel industry. Related Reading: Expert Eyes $35 XRP Price, Says Holders To Become ‘Filthy Rich’ Binance Early Investment Binance had already invested in Travala before the pandemic, as disclosed in Zhao’s tweet on December 12. Both investor confidence and Travala’s position as a frontrunner in the space of crypto bookings were bolstered by this statement. At the time of writing, AVA was trading at approximately $2.51, showcasing its remarkable recovery since hitting an all-time low earlier this year. Travala Strategic Initiatives Travala has come up with a new way to handle bank reserves, which includes both AVA and Bitcoin (BTC). This change was made purposefully to strengthen its market position and urge more people to use cryptocurrencies to book travel. According to Juan Otero, CEO and co-founder of Travala, the plan shows their commitment to better customer experiences while keeping their finances strong.

The platform allows users to reserve hotels, flights, and activities in 230 countries, offering a wide option for visitors looking to use digital currencies. AVA And Cryptocurrency In Travel The rise in AVA’s price points to a more general trend towards digital currency integration in the travel sector than just temporary change. Platforms like Travala are likely to get rather popular as traditional travel companies become convinced of blockchain technology’s possibilities. The disclosure of their treasury reserves is expected to attract more investors looking for innovative ideas in the crypto field.

Thanks to Bitcoin’s momentum, Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) are seeing significant growth. But Cutoshi (CUTO) is promising in this bull run too. Solana Sees More Upward Potential Solana (SOL) is standing to gain from the coming meme coin market boom. Currently, SOL is trading at $211, with a month-to-date rise of 2% SOL seems to be losing momentum. However, with an all-time high upward of $260 this month, SOL could definitely see some gains again. The latest bull run for Solana started after the US elections, as the crypto market started to boom. Notably, investors expect the Trump administration to make some moves for crypto. At the same time, Elon Musk, who won a seat in the new administration, is a known Dogecoin advocate. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and Musk’s meme coin support have the potential to further catalyze the market. In this context, Solana, a DeFi giant and the biggest meme coin platform, stands to gain significantly. For this reason, analysts see SOL at roughly $240 in a month. Fueled by regulatory changes and a potential meme coin surge, Solana is in a strong position to grow further. Avalanche Is Melting Skepticism After a year of decline, Avalanche (AVAX) is finally recovering some of its losses. Currently, Avalanche is trading at $44 , with a modest year-to-date increase of 22%. Still, the token has recently gained momentum. Despite a year of underperformance, traders are turning back to Avalanche, seeing the potential of its technology. The token is specifically designed for dApps and features custom blockchain for specialized use cases, as such, it is attractive to institutional players. For that reason, Ava Labs already secured partnerships with major players such as Amazon and Visa. Still, the road for Avalanche is not easy. The project will have to counter trader skepticism over major token unlocks, which tend to depress the price. Despite this, analysts predict a price target of $56 in a month and $63 in three months for Avax. Solana And Avax Holders Look To Viral Cutoshi With Avax and Solana seeing mixed performance, their traders are diversifying. One of the tokens that recently caught their attention is the viral memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO). Just weeks after the start of its presale, Cutoshi raised over $1 million, gaining viral status on X. Currently, Cutoshi managed to raise over $1.36 million in presale investments. This success shows that traders are interested in its blend of memes and DeFi utility. Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi project. It hopes to use the viral nature of meme coins to bring more people into DeFi, explaining the values of self-custody and decentralization. Its multichain DEX will offer a safer alternative to centralized exchanges while also benefiting users with low fees. At the same time, the project’s learning platform is all about onboarding people that are new to DeFi. With more people entering the crypto market, projects like Cutoshi are key to educating these new users on the benefits of DeFi. They offer a potential for decentralized technology to challenge the dominant centralized exchanges.

Two coins currently garnering attention are NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) and Altura ($ALU). While both have their unique strengths, Altura emerges as the clear winner for investors seeking high-growth potential in an AI-driven era. Here’s why. Understanding NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) NEAR Protocol is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain designed to make decentralized applications (dApps) easy to build and use. Its focus on scalability, simplicity, and user-friendly tools has made it a popular choice for developers.Key Features:- Sharding Technology: NEAR uses a unique sharding approach called ""Nightshade"" to achieve scalability.- Developer-Friendly Tools: With support for languages like Rust and JavaScript, NEAR simplifies the dApp development process.- Eco-Friendly: NEAR operates with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, reducing its carbon footprint.Growth Potential:Despite its technological advancements, NEAR’s market capitalization limits its upside potential. With a current valuation in the multi-billion-dollar range, the coin might offer a 2-3x return in the best-case scenario. This is respectable but falls short compared to smaller-cap gems like Altura. Why Altura ($ALU) is the Superior Investment Altura is revolutionizing the gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors by providing a blockchain-based smart NFT platform. Its lower market cap and growing adoption position it as a coin with unparalleled potential for explosive growth.Key Features:1. Smart NFTs: Altura’s smart NFTs are dynamic, meaning their properties can change based on in-game events or external data, offering unprecedented utility in gaming and beyond.2. AI-Driven Innovations: Altura is integrating AI into its platform to personalize gaming experiences and automate NFT functionalities, making it highly relevant in today’s AI-driven market.3. Developer Ecosystem: Altura empowers game developers with tools to integrate blockchain technology seamlessly, bridging the gap between traditional gaming and Web3.Growth Potential:Altura’s current market cap is significantly smaller than NEAR’s, making it a prime candidate for exponential growth. Realistically, $ALU could achieve an 8-20x return, especially as AI and gaming sectors gain momentum. Market Cap Comparison: Why It Matters Market cap is a crucial factor when evaluating investment potential. Here’s how NEAR and Altura stack up:- NEAR Protocol: With a market cap in the billions, NEAR’s upside is limited by the law of large numbers. Even a 3x increase would place it among the top blockchain platforms, requiring substantial market adoption.- Altura: Altura’s smaller market cap means it has more room to grow. An 8-20x increase would still keep it within a reasonable valuation compared to other projects in the gaming and AI sectors. The AI-Driven Future: Why Altura is Better Positioned Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of industries worldwide, including blockchain. Altura’s proactive integration of AI gives it a competitive edge:- Personalized Experiences: AI-driven customization for gaming ensures users remain engaged.- Scalability: AI algorithms optimize performance, ensuring smooth operations as the platform scales.- Dynamic Growth: The fusion of AI and blockchain opens doors to innovative applications, giving Altura a head start in an untapped market.In contrast, NEAR, while technologically robust, lacks a strong AI narrative, which may limit its appeal as AI adoption grows Conclusion: The Case for Altura ($ALU) NEAR Protocol is a solid investment for conservative growth, but for investors looking for exponential returns, Altura stands out as the superior choice. Its focus on smart NFTs, gaming, and AI-driven innovation aligns perfectly with current market trends. With the potential for 8-20x growth compared to NEAR’s 2-3x, Altura represents a much better risk-to-reward ratio.For those ready to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation, $ALU offers a golden opportunity. Don’t miss out on what could be one of the most lucrative investments in 2025. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Table of Contents CYBRO to list early following 450% surge and $7M presale NEAR Protocol shows strong gains but faces overbought conditions FET nears key resistance Conclusion CYBRO, a new AI token valued at $0.06 is attracting keen interest from crypto millionaires. With some speculating a potential 20,000% surge, this digital asset is stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency world. CYBRO to list early following 450% surge and $7M presale CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain platform, is fast-tracking its plans to list on major exchanges following an impressive presale performance. The project secured $7 million in funding and attracted nearly 20,000 investors, cementing its position as a leader in DeFi. During the presale, CYBRO’s token price skyrocketed by 450%, rising from $0.01 to $0.055. The token’s debut on major exchanges, including Gate.io, is scheduled for December 14th, with a listing price of $0.06. CYBRO attained several other milestones during its presale, including: CYBRO app launch: Introducing over 30 vaults with competitive APYs to cater to diverse investment strategies. Blast Index rollout: A one-click investment solution that streamlines DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols. Platform expansion: Establishing the foundation for a seamless, user-focused DeFi ecosystem. CYBRO is on a mission to democratize DeFi. Its roadmap through 2025 outlines plans for advanced features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-driven tools. CYBRO’s listing coincides with a surge in interest in AI-enabled financial platforms. With its strong presale momentum and a launch price of $0.06, CYBRO is poised to attract attention from both retail and institutional investors. As the platform gears up for its market debut, its approach and rapid growth trajectory position it as a key player to watch. Interested investors can still be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum. You might also like: How this low-cap AI coin could outperform 2024’s top cryptos NEAR Protocol shows strong gains but faces overbought conditions NEAR Protocol’s price has climbed over 28% in the past month, currently ranging between $6.75 and $7.95. It sits slightly above its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, both around $6.95. The Relative Strength Index is above 70, signaling overbought conditions, while the MACD indicates positive momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $8.32, with support at $5.67. If the upward trend continues, NEAR could reach the second resistance at $10.14, marking a significant increase from current prices. However, the high RSI suggests a potential pullback. Traders are watching for a break above resistance or a dip below support to determine the next move. FET nears key resistance FET has been trading between $1.78 and $2.17, showing a 26.98% increase over six months. The price is approaching the nearest resistance at $2.48. The Relative Strength Index is at 66.70, indicating momentum toward overbought levels. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are close at $1.85 and $1.83, suggesting consolidation. The MACD level of 0.04 signals mild bullish momentum. If FET breaks above $2.48, it could target the second resistance at $2.97, offering substantial gains. However, if it fails to surpass this level, the price may pull back toward the support at $1.49. Conclusion Amid the ongoing bull run, established tokens like NEAR and FET may offer limited short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO seeks to provide exceptional opportunities to amplify earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO will deliver a superior user experience featuring effortless deposits and withdrawals. Its strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality sets it apart, drawing significant interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Grant Holihan says he believes his Chase debit card information was skimmed at an ATM that he used in Queens, reports CBS New York. Soon after he left the ATM, Chase alerted him to an illicit purchase in Las Vegas. Holihan closed the account, but says new charges from the state of Pennsylvania poured in anyway, fully draining his life savings. “It was four different Giant supermarkets in Pennsylvania, where [scammers] took out a little over seven grand in under an hour… They still deny my claim, and it’s been over a year later, and I still haven’t seen my money.” Holihan says he can prove he was in New York when the charges were made, but Chase says each purchase was fully authorized and verified. “This customer’s claim was denied because the charges were authorized with their PIN and verified via phone call.” Holihan says he’s simply looking for the bank to stand by him and do the right thing. “It’s not even a thousandth of a percent. It’s nothing to them.

The Nasdaq-100 Index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is filled with dominant market names like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Costco.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) added modestly to earlier gains, topping $102,000 in the minutes following the Friday 8 pm ET press release from Nasdaq announcing the inclusion.  On Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.  As comparison, Apple — prior to this year's rebalancing — had the index's largest weighting at just under 9%; Qualcomm had the 20th largest weighting at just above 1%.  The addition will exponentially increase the Nasdaq 100's exposure to bitcoin (BTC), of which MicroStrategy owns about $42 billion worth, and expose MSTR to billions in passive investment. ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 have more than $550 billion in assets under management, said Balchunas. Easily the largest is Invesco's QQQ Trust (QQQ) with more than $300 billion in AUM.  “The inclusion of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100 is possibly the second biggest story of 2024, after the launch of the US spot listed ETFs,” said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. “These funds are often buyers at any price level on a monthly basis which will add to another buyer of MSTR, when Michael Saylor continues to issue the at-the-market (ATM) offering, to dilute shareholders but will have a bigger base of buyers.”  Balchunas' colleague James Seyffart cautions that there’s a chance that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the index might be short-lived as the company could be re-classified as a financial firm in March since its value comes almost entirely from its bitcoin holdings and not the actual operating business. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Michael Saylor has even said previously that he plans to turn the company into a “bitcoin bank,” making it even less of a technology operation.  “The game theory now sees the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), the largest of all ETFs with about $650 billion in AUM, as maybe needing to include MSTR to rival their competitor,"" van Straten added. ""Millions of investors will now have indirect bitcoin exposure adding to the flywheel effect.""

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

Ripple’s XRP is demonstrating robust stability, maintaining support above key price levels. Simultaneously, emerging projects like XYZVerse (XYZ) and established networks such as Cardano (ADA) are poised for potential breakout moves, capturing the attention of investors eager to capitalize on new opportunities. XYZVerse, a meme coin uniting sports enthusiasts, aims for remarkable growth inspired by previous high-performing tokens. Its unique blend of meme culture and sports passion is fostering a dynamic, community-driven ecosystem poised to make a substantial impact. XYZ ready to deliver a 99,900% knockout Donald Trump’s stunning election triumph has sent shockwaves through the crypto world, triggering the “bull run of the century.” While the old guard of major coins limps along with meager double-digit gains, meme coins are strapping on their gloves and entering the ring as the real heavyweights of this financial frenzy. Forget PNUT’s 4,500% spike or FRED’s 6,000% leap, those stories are yesterday’s news, mere flashes in the pan. They crumbled under the weight of FOMO-fueled sell-offs, leaving would-be millionaires clutching at thin air. But a new titan has entered the arena, poised to obliterate profit records with a 99,900% surge. Dubbed the first-ever all-sports meme coin, XYZ is tailor-made for crypto fanatics who live for the thrill of competition and the sweet scent of victory. This is not a run-of-the-mill meme coin; this is a juggernaut backed by a no-nonsense sports mentality and a fearless swagger that screams winner takes all. As Trump rallies his forces, the crypto battlefield is transforming into a no-mercy zone where only the strong survive. XYZ is the alpha predator, embodying the unapologetic boldness of men like Joe Rogan and Dana White — guys who don’t flinch at the prospect of a high-stakes showdown. XYZ isn’t just flexing potential — it’s already delivering knockout returns before hitting the big leagues. Launch Price : $0.0001 Current Price: $0.001 (+1,000%) Next Stage: $0.001333 (+33% boost incoming) Ultimate Target: $0.1 From its humble beginnings to its upcoming Token Generation Event, XYZ is set to shatter expectations.

According to a Bloomberg article , the round now values Liquid AI at over $2 billion. OSS Capital, Duke Capital Partners, and PagsGroup also participated in the series A round. Liquid AI previously raised about $46.6 million in seed funding in 2023. Liquid AI wants to develop more efficient models The development comes as consumer generative AI, which captured global attention following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 to immediate success has spurred developments across the world. The tech is now at the center of the fast-growing AI sector, which has seen investors pour billions of dollars into generative AI startups. For Liquid, the startup’s new models are known as Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) which the company says can deliver performance comparable or superior to traditional large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI, Google Cloud, and AWS. The LFMs are lightweight, general-purpose AI models requiring less data and compute power. The models strangely uses mathematical approaches discovered by studying a worm’s brain, as per Crunchbase. According to SiliconAngle , Liquid’s models are based on the concept of “liquid neural networks.” This classification is different from generative pre-trained transformer-based models or GPTs that support popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Google LLC’s Gemini. “At Liquid, our mission is to build the most capable and efficient AI systems at every scale.” Liquid CEO Ramin Hasani. “Since our inception, we have demonstrated the scalability of our technology by releasing text-based models, unveiling multimodal LFMs, and collaborating with key partners to showcase real-world impact,” added Hasani. AMD partnership will allow Liquid AI to optimize its LFMs According to SiliconAngle, the AI startup offers three model sizes, that is LFM-1B, a dense 1.3 billion parameter model for on-device such as mobile phones, LFM-3B, a 3.1 billion parameter model optimized for edge developments, and the LFM-40B Mixture of Experts, designed to tackle complex tasks. Liquid AI said LFMs have a reduced memory footprint compared to GPT architecture, which is more substantial for lengthy inputs, for instance when processing extremely long documents or video. The LFM-3.1B model, according to Liquid AI used significantly less memory than other small models when deployed than models such as Google LLC’s Gemma 2 2B-it or Meta’s Llama3.2 3B. Now, with this funding, Liquid AI has joined a strategic partnership with AMD bolstering its ability to optimize its foundation models with the chipmaker’s graphic, central, and neural processing units. The funding will also help the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup to develop tailored LFMs for industries like consumer electronics, biotechnology, telecoms, financial services, and e-commerce.

It’s never looked this approachable—or this much fun. Leading the pack is none other than BTFD Coin, the rallying cry of every trader who knows how to “buy the dip.” The coin’s presale has bulldozed through the market, with a jaw-dropping $3.7 million raised, over 53 billion coins sold, and more than 5,000 holders locking horns for their share of the action.

37607003,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662121,1734134452,Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon – Top Trader Sets $2 Target,"Dogecoin is testing demand above the $0.40 level following several days of consolidation below its yearly high of $0.484. This period of choppy price action has kept traders on edge, as Dogecoin’s price appears poised for a decisive move. Despite the temporary pause in upward momentum, market sentiment remains optimistic, with many investors anticipating another breakout. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Dogecoin’s potential for a massive price surge. According to Hardy, it’s only a matter of time before DOGE breaks into new all-time highs. His analysis suggests that Dogecoin is building a strong foundation, and continued consolidation at current levels is a bullish signal. If Dogecoin maintains support above $0.40, the stage could be set for a significant rally in the coming weeks. However, much will depend on broader market conditions and the ability of DOGE to sustain buying pressure. All eyes are on its ability to overcome resistance and resume its bullish trend. With whale activity and trading volumes showing signs of growth, Dogecoin could soon retest its highs, ushering in a new chapter of price discovery. Dogecoin Consolidates At Current Levels Dogecoin is consolidating below its yearly high of $0.484 after an impressive rally, and it appears this phase of sideways movement may persist for some time. While the price action has calmed, investor sentiment remains notably optimistic, with many viewing this consolidation as a stepping stone toward even higher price levels. Top analyst and trader Hardy recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, offering a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. According to Hardy, DOGE’s current price action is a healthy consolidation within a broader uptrend. He emphasized that the asset is building a solid base, which increases the likelihood of a significant breakout. Hardy’s projection suggests that Dogecoin is poised to surpass its yearly high and is also on track to achieve a new all-time high (ATH). In his analysis, Hardy highlighted key support levels around $0.40 and $0.36, indicating these areas as crucial for maintaining the bullish structure. He also mapped out a potential price trajectory, predicting that Dogecoin will consolidate at current levels for several weeks before resuming its upward momentum. His optimistic target for DOGE is $2, which he believes could be reached if the broader market remains favorable and buying pressure intensifies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At $94.5K As STH Realized Prize Signals Strength While consolidation may test the patience of traders, Hardy’s analysis aligns with the broader view that Dogecoin is preparing for another major leg up. A new ATH could be just around the corner as long as it holds key support levels and sentiment remains positive. DOGE Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.40 after a 24% retrace from its local highs. Despite this pullback, the price has exceeded this key demand level, signaling resilience among bulls. Market participants are closely watching the $0.40 zone, representing a critical point for determining the next move in DOGE’s price action. If DOGE can reclaim the $0.43 level in the coming days, it would likely set the stage for a retest of its yearly high at $0.484. A breakout above this resistance could reignite bullish momentum and pave the way for further upside, potentially attracting renewed interest from traders and investors. However, maintaining support and gaining traction is essential for this scenario to unfold. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Increased Their Holdings By $1.4 Billion Yesterday – Details On the flip side, losing the $0.40 level could signal that bearish sentiment is gaining market control. In this case, DOGE might face a deeper correction, with the next critical support levels likely emerging near $0.36. Such a move would challenge the bullish outlook and delay DOGE’s efforts to reach new highs.
