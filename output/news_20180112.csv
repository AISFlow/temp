42380250,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaZn,1515791700,Korea's Crypto Crackdown Talk Draws Backlash From Users and Politicians,"More than 100,000 South Korea residents have signed petitions asking the government there to step back from any plans to close the country's cryptocurrency exchanges.  Earlier this week, the South Korean Justice Ministry announced that it was preparing legislation to close the country's online exchanges amid a speculative boom in cryptocurrencies. That shot across the bow was paired with the news that tax authorities were investigating at least some of the exchanges in Korea, and in the hours to come.  Yet the proposal drew swift pushback from within the South Korean government – the president's office, in particular, said no move is ""finalized"" as of yet – as well as cryptocurrency supporters and traders in the country who cried foul as the statements sparked a fall in cryptocurrency prices.  The public backlash against the proposed move appears to be accelerating. On the Korean president's Blue House website, more than 4,000 petitions have been filed related to ""virtual currencies"" since Jan. 10.  One petition asking the Minister of Justice to step down in light of the move received more than 30,000 signatures on its own. According to Reuters, one petition alone has attracted more than 100,000 signatures and the website itself became inaccessible at one point due to excessive traffic.  Comments on the government's website included a petition from a user who claimed to have lost money due to the Justice Ministry's saber-rattling.  Another petition compared cryptocurrency trading with the stock market, but claimed the latter is much more speculative.  Yet another petition struck a supportive note on the development of new rules but called for the government to consult with the wider cryptocurrency community before implementing any such rules.  Opposition pushback  Other members of the Korean political scene are reportedly crying foul as well.  A new report from Korean daily newspaper The Hankyoreh states that leaders of several opposition parties are moving to criticize what they deem a unilateral crackdown without any discussion or debate.  One opposition lawmaker said the ban was not a government position, but rather one that the Ministry of Justice and, possibly the president, hold themselves.  The lawmaker continued (according to a translated statement):  ""The government announcement should be based on detailed reviews and coordination. If there is a problem, we should warn and prepare in advance.""  Path toward regulation  In recent months, the government has made efforts to tamp down on what it refers to as speculation surrounding cryptocurrencies.  These efforts included new regulations for banks conducting transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges. On Jan. 8, regulators inspected six banks to ensure compliance with the new regulations, which included strict know-your-customer identification rules, among other measures.  However, rather than comply with the new rules, some banks said they would simply cease trading with cryptocurrency exchanges altogether, according to the Korea Times.  South Korea’s largest bank, Shinhan Bank, said on Friday that it would be closing down the virtual currency accounts it offers in order to comply with new regulations surrounding their use.  An official from Shinhan said the bank had initially built a system to comply with the new regulations before deciding to just de-risk.  ""We've developed a system to introduce identifying virtual [currency] account customers in accordance with the government's efforts to curb the cryptocurrency craze. However, we decided to scrap the service enabling the trade of digital tokens which has become a serious social issue,"" the representative told the publication.

42380245,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaQz,1515783648,Tennessee Might Also Recognize Blockchain Data Through Proposed Law,"A lawmaker in Tennessee has filed a new bill that recognizes blockchain signatures as legal electronic records, marking the latest legislative effort to do so in recent weeks.  The bill  , submitted to the Tennessee House of Representatives by state lawmaker Jason Powell on Jan. 10, echoes similar pieces of legislation filed in Florida and Nebraska.  The measure states:  ""A signature that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature. A record or contract that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic record.""  Like the other pieces of legislation, the bill clarifies that smart contracts – or self-executing agreements that trigger when certain conditions are met – would also have legal bearing within Tennessee.  ""No contract relating to a transaction shall be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because that contract contains a smart contract term,"" the text reads.  The move highlights the growing interest among state lawmakers in the concept, with Arizona's government finalizing a similar law last spring. Indeed, it points to a push to harmonize state laws around electronic records with blockchain-based data.  But as with the efforts in Florida and Nebraska, it remains to be seen how other lawmakers will react as the measures move through the debate process.

42380246,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaSF,1515780048,Former Customers Sue Crypto Exchange Vircurex Over Frozen Funds,"Four years after cryptocurrency exchange Vircurex lost its funds due to alleged hacks, the firm is being sued by its former customers.  In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Colorado, a former Vircurex customer accuses the exchange of breach of contract, conversion of funds, fraud and unjust enrichment. The suit explained how only a few of the account holders had received their funds after the exchange froze all withdrawals due to a claimed lack of reserves. At present, the frozen accounts contain a combined $50 million.  The exchange has allowed customers to deposit funds over the past four years, and continues to operate today, according to the lawsuit.  In 2014, the exchange reported it was near insolvency after losing large amounts of its reserve funds. According to the lawsuit, part of this loss came from ""two purported hacks the exchange experienced in mid-2013."" Yet more of its reserve funds were depleted by large withdrawals by some of its customers.  As a result, the Vircurex froze withdrawals of bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin and terracoin. At the time, the company stated it would begin refunding users using its own profits, according to as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The filing claims the exchange refunded small amounts of cryptocurrencies to a few of its customers, but the bulk of the funds owed remain with the exchange. The last time the exchange transferred any funds to its customers was in January 2016.  Furthermore, the plaintiff, Timothy Shaw, claimed that the exchange was refusing to speak to its customers, despite several customers making attempts to contact the exchange over the past four years.  The suit continued:  ""As detailed herein, rather than repay the Frozen Funds, Defendants took steps to string along Plaintiff and the Class with deceptive statements and false promises, and made efforts to cover their tracks and create impediments designed to deter accountholders from bringing suit to recover the Frozen Funds, and efforts to ultimately attempt to vanish without a trace.""  Vircurex's steps to prevent its customers from suing included stating it was incorporated in Belize, which it is not, as well as indicating it might be based in Beijing. The lawsuit states the exchange is actually based out of Germany, but has never been legally incorporated in any jurisdiction, meaning it is not recognized as a formal business by any government.  In addition to the exchange itself, the lawsuit names its two operators as defendants, identifying one as Andreas Eckert and referring to the other as ""John or Jane Doe.""

The so-called ""initial miner offerings"" are said to have caught on since regulators in China banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) back in September of last year, according to a new statement from the National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA). The idea behind an initial miner offering is that mining hardware – used for the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – is sold and intended to process a particular cryptocurrency or token.  The new model, according to the group, constitutes a ""disguised ICO,"" according to a translated version of the statement. It noted the prevalence of promotional events and materials published around such offerings, warning consumers to beware of the risks – particularly in the light of the regulatory action taken last fall.  ""[The] Internet Finance Association called for the vast number of consumers and investors [to] recognize the nature of the relevant model...to enhance awareness of risk prevention, rational investment...[and] not blindly follow the trend of speculation,"" the group said.  Last year, the same organization warned against ICOs, noting that organizers might use fraudulent information to sell their tokens. Just days after that, Chinese officials moved to ban the blockchain use case.  Editor's Note: Statements in this article have been translated from Simplified Chinese.

Mnuchin remarked on the process during an appearance at The Economic Club in Washington, D.C. after being asked about the topic of bitcoin.  ""We are very focused on cryptocurrencies,"" Mnuchin explained, pointing to discussions with other regulators within the U.S. government and later stating: ""We want to make sure that bad people cannot use these currencies to do bad things.""  Mnuchin added that the issue was one that the U.S. government would engage with the G-20 international group as well. As previously reported, Mnuchin's French counterpart called for more action from the G-20 in December, highlighting ""a risk of speculation"" at the time.  On that subject of speculation, Mnuchin said that he is concerned about the issue as well.  ""I want to make sure that consumers who are trading this understand the risks because I am concerned that consumers could get hurt.""

Zcash Eyes Gains Against Bitcoin,"Privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash is solidly bid against the dollar and could soon see a spike against bitcoin.  As per data source CoinMarketCap, zcash (ZEC) has appreciated by 12 percent in the last 24 hours. As of writing, it is trading at $718 levels – that's down 24.83 percent from the lifetime high of $955.26 set on Jan. 7, but, week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 22 percent.  ZEC's retreat from the record high of $955.26 could be associated with overbought technical conditions and broad-based drop in cryptocurrency prices due to fears of trading restrictions in South Korea. Prices hit a low of $601.87 on Monday, and have since struggled to extend gains above $730 levels.  That said, the price chart indicates an upside break could happen soon.  ZEC chart  The above chart (prices as per Bifinex) shows:  Strong dip demand below $600 as shown by candles with long tails (gap between intraday low and close).  A series of higher lows (as represented by rising trend lines) indicates bulls are in control.  10-day moving average (MA) carries a bullish bias (sloping upwards).  The RSI is holding above 50.00 (bullish territory).  View  A break above $732.78 (yesterday's high) would add credence to above listed bullish factors and open doors for retest of $800. Further gains towards $1,000 cannot be ruled out in the short-term, given the RSI is well short of the overbought territory.  On the downside, only a close (as per UTC) below $571.18 (Jan. 11 low) would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  ZEC/BTC chart  As of writing, ZEC is trading at BTC 0.05. The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows a long-term bullish trend reversal:  A breach of the descending trendline followed by an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (bullish reversal pattern).  The 50-day MA has bottomed out.  The fact that ZEC witnessed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout at the bottom of the long-term downtrend adds credence to the argument a long-term bullish trend reversal has been confirmed.  View  ZEC looks set to test BTC 0.0749 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) in the short-run, and may even extend gains to BTC 0.10.  Short-term overbought conditions may yield a pullback, though the outlook would remain bullish as long as prices hold above the 50-day MA (currently seen at BTC 0.0337).

42380252,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MacJ,1515762000,Blockchain in Your Pocket? The Phone Behind Sirin's $157 Million ICO,"Does the world really need a blockchain phone?  Sirin Labs is betting it does. The startup, which recently raised $157 million in an initial coin offering (ICO), is building an Android smartphone from scratch with special features for cryptocurrency enthusiasts: an app store for distributed apps (dapps), cold storage for private keys and easy conversion between tokens.  The Switzerland-based company says the product will fill a need in a fast-growing market: a secure device that can simplify the use of cryptocurrency across multiple applications. But as an old tech adage goes, ""hardware is hard,"" and in blockchain it may be even harder, since devices must be engineered to protect not only information but unrecoverable money.  In a nod to the device's target audience, Sirin has dubbed the phone ""Finney,"" after computer scientist and bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney.  Estimating this audience's growth over the years, Sirin Labs CEO Moshe Hogeg told CoinDesk:  ""You have more than 10 million people that are all in crypto in one way or another. I think the community will at least double in size by the end of this year.""  The phone is expected to retail just shy of $1,000, putting it in the high-end range with the likes of Apple's iPhone. And it can only be purchased using Sirin's crypto token (based on the ERC-20 standard). The firm sold 40 percent of the 573 million total tokens it created during the recent ICO.  As an Android device, the phone will include all the usual applications, including the full Google Play store. As Hogeg explained, ""We're talking about user experience. If you don't have Facebook then forget about it.""  But what makes Finney different is that sirin tokens will also be stored on the device to facilitate payments for a wide variety of dapps.  Crypto app store  The decentralized app store on the Finney phone will provide users with access to a whole host of dapps – the products of a host of blockchain-based projects that have issued tokens via ICOs.  These could include blockchain-based alternatives to popular tech companies such as Uber, which Hogeg said would be better for users by connecting providers directly to customers, reflecting the industry ethos.  As such, the Finney would provide a one-stop shop for crypto enthusiasts to browse through dapps and spend their crypto on products and services. And through a partnership with Bancor, the decentralized liquidity market that raised $150 million last June in an ICO, Sirin's software will convert users' sirin tokens to whatever cryptocurrency is needed for a particular transaction.  ""A user shouldn't care about technology. He shouldn't care about how things work. He should care about the value of them,"" said Hogeg. Hence, ""the experience should be simple.""  Simplicity will be a prerequisite for these token-based platforms to gain traction, he said.  ""If we want those technologies to become mainstream, we have to fix this issue of multiple tokens,"" Hogeg said. ""Our software is going to allow the user to seamlessly convert between different tokens within our phones.""  Sirin faces some competition in the decentralized app store arena. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstong is also working on a browser for dapps called Toshi.  In a recent Medium post, Armstrong similarly talked about the need for one platform for consumers to manage dapps. Yet, while Coinbase's solution wouldn't need specialized hardware, Hogeg said he believes that by the time these decentralized marketplaces are ready, early adopters will want a distinct device to safely store the cryptocurrency they'll use.  And while it's proven to be difficult to get developers to switch from the two marketplaces currently dominating mobile (the Apple store and the Google Play store) to a new development platform, Hogeg said he has a way to convince them.  ""We raised enough money to incentivize a community of developers,"" he said.  Security focus  But while Hogeg has a plan for incentivizing developers, the harder part might be luring consumers to purchase the pricey device.  But he says that for crypto users, the phone's security features will be hard to resist. Not only does the Finney phone use behavioral monitoring to detect possible exploitation, it also allows for multiple types of biometric identification and comes with cybersecurity protection from the operating system through the application layer, according to Sirin.  All of these features, Hogeg admitted, can be found in one form or another on other devices, but there's one feature on the phone that stands out: cold storage.  The Finney phone allows users to disconnect their cryptocurrency's private keys from the rest of the device and from the internet, Sirin says. This provides added protection since hackers would have to physically go to the phone's storage vault where the private keys are held to get access.  Hogeg told CoinDesk:  ""I think it will differentiate us. I think it's unique, and it will grow.""  But Peter Todd, a prominent cryptography consultant and bitcoin developer, was skeptical about the effectiveness of cold storage in this context, telling CoinDesk, ""Why does that protect you? You need to connect to the internal electronics to accomplish anything anyway, at which point the attack can happen.""  Still, a spokesperson for Sirin contended cold storage still reduces risk, which is why people use crypto-wallets like Trezor and Ledger. He explained, ""We do all the signature 'foreplay' in advance of the actual signature"" – that is, making the connection as brief as possible. ""This is a well known cyber security methodology of decreasing the attack surface and time exposure,"" he wrote.  Further, even Hogeg acknowledges that security doesn't sell hardware. So Sirin is also setting up the devices to be able to cooperate and share resources, for instance, in a way that allows strangers can pay each other in microtransactions for borrowing computing power or bandwidth.  The tangle  Yet that raises another issue.  In Sirin's whitepaper, these services lean heavily on the ""Tangle,"" a technology pioneered by the distributed ledger startup IOTA.  Pitched as a solution tailor-made for the internet of things, IOTA requires devices to make a few proof-of-work computations in order to participate in the chain, rather than pay a fee to miners as with bitcoin.  ""This is how we allow it to be fee-less,"" Hogeg said.  Yet, IOTA and its technology have been a flashpoint of controversy since over-the-counter trading of its cryptocurrency began in 2016. For instance, MIT Media Lab actually disputed the claims in an MIT Technology Review article describing the security of IOTA.  Further, the lab's Digital Currency Initiative found a serious security flaw in Iota in September. The IOTA Foundation acknowledged the researchers' work, while arguing that it did not represent a realistic attack and said it has always planned to submit its final cryptographic design, once ready, to academic review in order to insure its solidity.  Val A. Red, a security researcher with experience in IoT systems, told CoinDesk that any blockchain-based application raises issues.  ""If I were looking at this outside of cryptocurrencies and from the perspective of a secure mobile or BYOD [bring-your-own-device] network administrator, I would also have reasonable concerns looking at a proposal involving interoperability with IOTA or any digital ledger technology in production.""  Hogeg didn't dispute that there are doubts about the protocol at present, but said, ""Maybe we're going to change to a different fee-less network, and there are a bunch who are talking about it. Probably it's going to be IOTA.""  Although he continued, ""We are not going to announce 100 percent it is IOTA until we are 100 percent satisfied.""  Hogeg confirmed that IOTA is not an investor in Sirin.  Next steps  But even with the Finney project's blockchain architecture still up in the air, Hogeg is confident the phone will be released by the end of this year.  And, he said, prototypes of the device should be available soon at retail stores the company plans to open in cities around the world, where people will be able to pre-order phones and talk to staff about its structure.  That may sound expensive, but remember that Sirin raised $157 million in its token sale, triple what it initially estimated it would need to develop the phone.  Also in the works is a Finney PC, based on the Android OS.  If this all sounds overambitious, it's worth noting that Hogeg has been effective at generating chatter around his projects. In 2014, he created the joke app Yo, a messaging app that initially only allowed users to send the single word ""yo"" back and forth.  Around the same time, he snagged backing from Leonardo DiCaprio, Lance Armstrong and Serena Williams for his short-form video service, Mobli.  At Sirin, he has already had some success in manufacturing mobile devices, building a privacy-oriented Android phone called Solarin, which came with a $13,800 retail price tag.  Still, his projects have also not matured without some stumbling blocks. In 2016, even though it had some real traction, Mobli was shut down, and in early 2017, Sirin laid off 30 percent of its staff after sales of the Solarin phone failed to support the business model (they are still sold, though).  But according to Hogeg, the way in which the software for Finney was built, allowing other Android manufacturers to use it in their devices as well, hedges the company's bet on building a piece of hardware from the ground up.  Addressing the uncertainty of the business, but also his optimism going forward, Hogeg concluded:  ""Could be that we will become a very big phone manufacturer. Could be. Could be, also, that phone manufacturers will use our software … and we give them everything we do for free, as long as they use our token as the engine for everything.""

42380236,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MXwF,1515758438,Bitcoin Eyes Consolidation as Price Flirts with $14K,"Bitcoin's price is back around $14,000 and is eyeing a short phase of rangebound trading.  Despite yesterday's bearish price action, the sell-off in the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization seems to have come to a halt today.  As per Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin (BTC) found takers at $12,878.60 (price at 00:44 GMT) and moved to an intraday high of $13,773.34. Soon before press time, prices were at $14,090 levels – that's up around 9.4 percent from the 12-day low of $12,878.  The sharp recovery indicates the markets may have digested reports of a trading ban under consideration in South Korea. Further, investors may have realized that South Korea is unlikely to announce the move anytime soon, if at all.  So bitcoin may have found a short-term bottom, but that doesn't necessarily mean the cryptocurrency is heading back to record highs, as fears of a Korean clampdown could remain in the air for some time yet.  While, BTC could have a hard time seeing big gains in the short-term, the technical charts do point to consolidation ahead.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Despite the bearish price action, BTC defended the ascending trend line (drawn from Nov. 12 low and Dec. 22 low).  BTC caught a bid wave today after the bears failed to cut through the trendline support.  The 50-day moving average (MA) continues to rise in favor of the bulls.  A bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day MA, and the 5-day and 50-day MA (short term average cuts long term average from above).  Weekly chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  The sell-off ran out of steam near the upward sloping 10-week MA (currently at $12,743)  The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $12,573.88 acted as a strong in the last week of December. Further, last week's candle shows signs of bearish exhaustion near the Fibonacci level.  View  The bullish (upward sloping) 10-week MA, 50-day MA and the repeated bearish exhaustion near the 38.2 percent Fibonacci level of $12.573 indicates any dips below $12,000 are likely to be short-lived.  That said, the bearish continuation pattern (rising wedge breakdown confirmed earlier this week) and the bearish MA crossovers listed above are likely to keep BTC bears in the game. Thus, in the short-run, cryptocurrency could have a hard time holding onto gains above $16,000.  The odds of a fresh sell-off towards $8,000 would improve if bitcoin spends next few days consolidating in the range of $16,000–$12,000. Such a move would allow the 50-day MA to top out (shed bullish bias). So, bulls need to capitalize on the successful defense of the ascending trendline seen in the last 24 hours.  Bullish Scenario: A close (as per UTC) above the upward sloping 50-day MA, followed by a move above $17,174 (Jan. 6 high) before Monday could open doors for a rally to record highs over $20,000.

The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      2017 was the year that cryptocurrency became mainstream.  But what’s even more exciting to many of us who have been investing in the sector for the past several years is the development of the underlying technology.  Blockchain technology, which powers most cryptocurrencies, is in nascent stages. This past year, we started seeing some early proof points of how this new infrastructure can be used, including the announcement by the Australian Securities Exchange that it would replace its current post-trade settlement process with a blockchain system, after running both concurrently.  This reminds me of the process large enterprises went through in the late 1990s and early 2000s as they moved from client-server software to web-based software, transitioning their supply chain and procurement processes online. They conducted extensive return on investment (ROI) studies to justify the upfront cost of replacing current systems. Twenty years later, the ROI is obvious, but many companies viewed the risk as significant at the time.  I believe we’ll continue to see more companies across more industries in 2018 take a look at how blockchain technology can create efficiencies (and potentially new business models in the future).  When I launched Future\Perfect Ventures in 2014 around the thesis of decentralization, I was most excited about the combination of blockchain with other emerging technologies, including machine learning/AI, security and internet of things. In this way, I expect 2018 will be the year that we start to see the convergence of these technologies to truly create the decentralized computing and communications platforms of the future.  Decentralization, by its very nature, requires that more intelligence shifts to nodes instead of residing in one central server.  We will continue to see the development of semiconductors that are capable of advanced computing in smaller and smaller devices. As devices at the edge become smarter, the smart contracts enabled by blockchain platforms will work better with more advanced data analytics capabilities.  I see a mini-brain in each of our devices, ranging from simplistic ones to ones capable of processing larger datasets and making decisions based on that data.  The open availability of more data and smarter processing at the nodes will enable broader datasets available to more companies and people, instead of proprietary data ownership that currently exists within companies such as Facebook and Google. More importantly, that data will be diverse and representative of the world we live in, instead of being filtered by a few companies that reside in one geography.  While this may not all happen within the next year, we have started an inevitable march towards that future, one that will be even more transformative than the internet was.

42380226,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MXjf,1515740446,Jonas Schnelli Wants You to Run a Bitcoin Full Node,"200 gigabytes.  That's the maximum load some personal laptops will store. It's also roughly the amount of space the bitcoin blockchain currently requires.  These bloating storage requirements are a longstanding problem for the community's efforts to keep bitcoin decentralized. But Bitcoin Core contributor and maintainer Jonas Schnelli has spent the past few years trying to make full nodes easier to run for a wider audience despite this huge data cost – and in turn, make bitcoin more resistant to centralization.  With so much information to download, setting up a bitcoin full node currently takes days or even weeks. This issue was at the heart of bitcoin's years-long scaling debate. While increasing transaction capacity by raising the block size limit might have eased the network's steadily rising transaction fees, it also would have disqualified more users from running bitcoin's core infrastructure.  And even though the block size held steady, the pressures favoring centralization remain, because of the storage space and time it takes to set up a full node.  Yet, developers argue that running a full node is the best way to use bitcoin (some even going as far as to claim that without a full node to validate bitcoin transactions themselves, users are just wasting their time on cryptocurrency). In this way, users take full advantage of all bitcoin's benefits, including censorship-resistance and the minimization of trust in third parties.  ""It’s very important to run bitcoin full nodes. It's the main or at least a significant reason to use bitcoin,"" Schnelli told CoinDesk. ""If we throw that away we lose one of the more interesting parts of bitcoin.""  Schnelli's particular focus is on making Bitcoin Core, the most popular bitcoin software implementation, more user-friendly, for people he calls ""non-geeks.""  And he feels, perhaps, a stronger commitment than most to this cause, saying:  ""I think it’s our duty as developers to make it possible to run full nodes.""  To be sure, you could argue that most of the 15,000 updates to the codebase implemented over the years are geared toward the same goal, making bitcoin more efficient and faster to download.  Yet, Schnelli is specifically focused on the software's user experience, coming up with creative ways to make it easier for people to run these full nodes.  Bitcoin on the go  And Schnelli doesn't want those full nodes leashed to the places they were set up, such as a user's desktop computer at home or the office, where it can only verify transactions from one location.  Instead, Schnelli wants bitcoin full nodes to be mobile.  ""We've almost reached that goal,"" he said, adding that other developers have been helping him bring recent additions to Bitcoin Core – such the ability to load multiple separate wallets when starting the software – that would help bring full node mobility to fruition.  Once all the pieces are in place, users will be able to securely connect smartphone wallets to their full nodes running from home.  Further, Schnelli is developing a hybrid Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) mode, which allows users waiting for their full node to download to still use Bitcoin Core to validate and make transactions in the meantime.  With an SPV wallet, the user has some information about the bitcoin transaction history, but must rely on trusting other full nodes to ultimately verify transactions.  This scenario is one many bitcoin developers would like to avoid, but it would only be used for the time it takes to download the full node.  Depending on the hardware and internet speeds being used to download a full node, the process can take days, and sometimes, weeks – which is an ""unacceptable user experience,"" Schnelli said. Hence the need for some kind of connection in the interim.  And once the full node download is complete, the software switches back to the more secure full node.  Like Apple TV?  Another project Schnelli is getting started on, in an effort to cut down the time it takes to set up a full node, is building devices that already have a bitcoin full node downloaded and set up on them.  This comes from the knowledge that users generally need to buy ""dedicated hardware,"" which can cost a few hundred dollars, to run bitcoin full nodes.  Also the co-founder of hardware wallet Digital Bitbox, Schnelli is calling the project a ""full node in a box."" He hopes to sell those devices in the future. While unsure how much they would cost, he said they would save a lot of time.  ""You could have a black box similar to an Apple TV or router that you just plug in and it works,"" he said.  There are similar full node-only devices on the market, ""but not in a way that I think is useful,"" Schnelli said. ""It's hard to get affordable hardware that syncs pretty fast,"" and building a ""good"" full node device requires knowing the ins and outs of the Bitcoin Core code.  BitSeed devices, for example, cost between $200 and $350. Schnelli said he thinks he can ship a product that slashes this cost, partly by doing the marketing required to attract a few hundred or thousand buyers.  Schnelli envisions the ""full-node-in-a-box"" device as a computerized auditor someone would run in their home to ensure their bitcoin finances are in check. Less entertaining than streaming television shows on an Apple TV, but perhaps producing greater satisfaction in the long run.
