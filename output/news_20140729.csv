42377496,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71Uk1,1406671674,Steve Stockman: New York's Bitcoin Regulation Could Crush the Industry,"For Steve Stockman, US Representative for the 36th Congressional District of Texas, bitcoin presents an opportunity to provide much-needed fuel to a struggling US economy while creating a new class of jobs that redefines the Internet.  But, if regulations like those proposed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) proliferate, Stockman fears the bitcoin business space - and its community - will face pressures that may ultimately prove insurmountable.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Stockman said the NYDFS proposals are too onerous considering the relative infancy of bitcoin. Further, he argued that state-based regulators like those in New York are being too aggressive in their efforts to impose rules on digital currency.  Stockman told CoinDesk:  “I think New York is putting the cart before the horse.”  He added that the regulations, far from laying the foundation for future growth for bitcoin companies, are actually more beneficial to the industries to which bitcoin poses a threat.  Traditional banks, financial services providers and payments companies, he says, won’t face the same level of scrutiny that bitcoin companies will in New York should the proposals be approved.  Overregulation will ‘crush the industry’  Throughout the interview, Stockman cast the proposed NYDFS regulations as a banker-friendly, growth-harming framework that fails to recognize bitcoin’s unique characteristics and ability to jumpstart a new era of digital commerce and value exchange.  Echoing statements made by former US Mint director Ed Moy, Stockman said that the bitcoin sector itself should be the source of regulation rather than agencies that don’t fully understand digital currency. Using the US healthcare system as an example, he stated that government intervention and rule-making not only stifles innovation but keeps investment activity out entirely.  Stockman explained:  “Many [doctors] are dropping out of the profession because it’s overregulated. Now, what may happen to the bitcoin community is that, if there’s so much regulation, there’ll be a lot of people who say, 'You know what, I’m done with this. I’m not gonna do it,' and it’s going to crush the industry.”  Proposal a win for bankers  According to Stockman, the clear winners should the NYDFS proposal pass in its current state would be banks who face competition from bitcoin's underlying technology.  Stockman told CoinDesk that not only would the regulations make it tough for bitcoin businesses to get off the ground in the first place, but actually competing as an alternative to traditional banking and payment systems would become a difficult task:  “I think the regulation, from the standpoint of the banks, is a banker’s dream come true. It’s basically putting a hedge around the banks, protecting the banks.”  The problem, Stockman continued, is that banks and companies that handle money in general do not and will not receive the level of regulatory focus that is being proposed for bitcoin companies. Using cash as an example, he said that hypothetically, a business would have to collect information on where each customer had received their cash.  As a result, any competition that banks might face from bitcoin companies will be stymied, he argues.  Apathy to regulation a deeper problem  At the heart of the matter, Stockman explained, is the failure of the bitcoin community to recognize the problems inherent in the NYDFS regulation.  Citing his recent appearance at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), Stockman said that far too many people were ambivalent about the proposed regulations. Saying he was “alarmed” by the feedback, Stockman added that many operated under the belief that, in the future, regulations for bitcoin will be lax given its unique qualities.  But, citing historical precedent and a front-row perspective on regulation, Stockman said this rosy outlook is far from certain. The failure to recognize this problem threatens efforts to lobby both Congress and the greater public on digital currency and its various uses.  Making matters worse, opinions on both if and how the bitcoin ecosystem should be regulated risk fracturing the community further and dampening adoption and outreach efforts. Stockman joked that if you ask 25 people in the bitcoin community a question, you get 50 different answers.  Kidding aside, the congressman reiterated that a lack of agreement among decision-makers and grassroots-level activists on the topic of regulation will be costly if the situation continues.  He said:  “We’re having problems solidifying the position, which then weakens our position. That’s a real serious problem for the bitcoin community to have.”  Stockman concluded by saying that the bitcoin community needs to adopt a greater sense of urgency as regulations are being drafted. Otherwise, they risk ceding control of the conversation and leaving the rule-making process to those who might not fully understand bitcoin.  Congress not ready for action  When asked whether or not Congress was ready to pass a digital currency bill like the one he has authored, Stockman said that US lawmakers aren't yet educated enough to take action on the measure.  He cited events on Capitol Hill involving members of Congress as positive developments, as they give attendees more opportunities to use digital currency and better understand the technology. Through efforts like these, he hopes, more lawmakers will see a compelling reason to protect what Stockman feels can revolutionize commerce.  The lack of institutional knowledge on the part of Congress, Stockman said, makes advocacy efforts more of an uphill battle. Yet, by introducing a digital currency bill that he says is a simple, pro-growth legal framework, the educational process will continue and, in time, result in legislative action that both protects and advances the bitcoin cause.

The seed funding round, closed in June, included Bitcoin Foundation board member Brock Pierce’s AngelList syndicate. 500 Startups, along with Blumberg Capital.  With the announcement, former Wells Fargo investment advisory representative Jim Griffin will join the company as its senior vice president of currency and foreign exchange.  Griffin indicated that he believes that the funding is a validation of the company's strong plan to become the primary payment network for digital currencies, stating:  “With the current state of the financial market, digital currencies are increasing in popularity and adoption. This is an exciting time to join ZipZap and be a part of its growth and the evolution of currency on a global scale.”  The investment brings ZipZap's total to-date funding to $2.7m, and follows the company's recent expansion of its cash-to-bitcoin services into 34 new markets.  Global bitcoin services  The new funding finds ZipZap seeking to capitalize on its unique position as an experienced payments specialist operating in the bitcoin space.  Launched in 2010, ZipZap originally served as a competitor to cash payment services such as PayNearMe, allowing consumers to make payments with cash at physical locations simply by printing off a payment slip.  The company first entered the cash-to-bitcoin space in late 2013, when it announced it would introduce cash-to-bitcoin services at its 28,000 UK merchant locations.  Speaking to CoinDesk in June, CEO Alan Safahi indicated that the company is seeking to position itself as a leader in digital currency remittance services.  How ZipZap works  ZipZap partners with bitcoin exchanges to act as a bitcoin brokerage for global consumers, though the company says it plans to add support for popular altcoins such as litecoin and dogecoin in the future.  To take advantage of the service, consumers sign up for the service online and 'Add Funds' to their account to create a payment voucher to be redeemed at a ZipZap merchant partner.  ZipZap users can pay for bitcoin with cash at a merchant location, or by bank transfer or wire transfer.  ZipZap users can currently buy bitcoin with cash in the US, the UK and Brazil, according to its official website. Wire transfer purchases are available in 75 countries.

The easyHotel Holland website offers a 'pay in bitcoin' option upon checkout that generates a BitPay invoice, QR code and wallet address included, to settle the payment.  The easyHotel brand has become increasingly popular in Europe, following the success of UK-based easyGroup’s airline and airport transfer brands, easyJet and easyBus.  While the easyHotels in the Netherlands have embraced bitcoin as a payment option, other members of the hotel family in Europe and the UK have not as yet.    @emilyspaven Please contact our Dutch franchisees as they are working with Bitcoin fnot all of easyhotel. http://t.co/SoZClxuSfn      — EasyHotel.com (@easyhotels) July 29, 2014    CoinDesk was unable to reach the Benelux franchisee for comment.  Travel industry embraces bitcoin  The easyHotels integration highlights the continuing growth of bitcoin into the hotel and travel industries.  Last month online travel giant Expedia also began accepting bitcoin payments, but for hotel reservations only. The company has since announced that its bitcoin profits have exceeded expectations.  Travel agency CheapAir, which initially began accepting bitcoin for flight bookings, began integrating bitcoin payments into its booking system this February, making the service available to 200,000 hotels and Amtrak rail reservations.  Although the easyHotels franchise is not an intermediary site like Expedia or CheapAir, it is a prominent and trusted name in low-cost travel options in the UK and Europe, and the company could see a lot of the same customers paying in bitcoin.  Whether easyJet and the other easyGroup brands will follow suit remains to be seen. The Benelux region easyHotel franchisee acts under the holding company DanZep Hotels.  Growth for bitcoin in the Netherlands  More assuring is the Netherlands’ enthusiasm for incorporating the digital currency into daily life. Despite how cautious its regulatory bodies have been toward the idea of more officially adopting bitcoin, much of the country leads its European counterparts in showing grassroots support for the cryptocurrency.  This spring, the city of The Hague unofficially renamed two streets that run along one canal as ‘Bitcoin Boulevard’, with nine restaurants and an art gallery all opting en masse to accept bitcoin to help launch the rebranding of the boulevard.  The Dutch city of Arnhem also launched its own 'bitcoin boulevard' scheme, the second in the country, in May, dubbed Bitcoincity. Bitcoin enthusiasts have expressed interest in pursuing similar endeavors in other Dutch cities like Amsterdam.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/29/dutch-easyhotel-franchisee-accepts-bitcoin-for-room-reservations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92fa9c28c6c13fd962b95cf300062ceb346fdb15-1181x511.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425939,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhBlh,1406656504,Alpha Technology Blames PayPal Dispute for ASIC Delivery Delay,"UPDATE (22nd December 12:13 GMT): Andrew Laurus contacted CoinDesk to say that, as of 21st December, he surrendered his shares in Alpha Technology Ltd and is no longer a shareholder, nor has any role or connection to the company.      Manchester-based mining outfit Alpha Technology has missed its July delivery target, stating that technical problems and a dispute with PayPal have caused delays.  Alpha Technology, which began taking pre-orders for its ASIC miners in January this year, now says it aims to deliver by September.  “We may have perhaps overpromised,” Alpha Technology’s 23-year-old managing director Mohammed Akram wrote on the company’s blog.  The announcement, which comes after months of updates about Alpha Technology's progress, has done little to appease customers, some of whom are now complaining the company is not responding to requests for refunds.  One Alpha Technology customer, Texas native David Sutherland, said the delay will make it impossible to get a return on his initial investment.  “By September, unless Alpha Technology once again promises a vastly increased hashrate for our same investment, there will be no way to see a return on the investment. All one has to do is look at the amount to be paid and the hashrate promised,” he said.  Sutherland said he is now contacting other Alpha Technology customers to begin civil action in the UK to get his money back:  “I give them credit for trying, they seem like a good bunch of people trying their best, but I think the lack of experience in dealing with the process of ASIC manufacturing and implementation really hurt them.”  Speaking to CoinDesk, Akram said that the company had the necessary funds to ship all the hardware its customers had ordered, and that its initial terms of sale stated products might not ship until the end of Q3 (September). He rejected the suggestion that the team was inexperienced and said that the company had always been clear about its refund policy and funding model, saying:  ""This is a pre-order model and most of the pre-order money was used to fund the project, we have always made this clear from the start. If the customers did not agree with this model and did not agree with the terms, then I feel they should not have ordered.""  He said the delay was due to the company not being able to access customer funds on PayPal.  “We did expect to ship this month, even with the technical error which occurred during tape-out. [We] would have corrected the issue much quicker if we had access to PayPal funds,” said Akram.  “We have had an investor on board to help correct this issue, plus with our other sources of funding, it is now enough to take us from tape-out to mass manufacturing to shipping.”  “The delay is purely down to PayPal,” he said, adding that the company has decided to offer its first-batch customers shares in Alpha Technology, in addition to their miner.  ""Any future mining operations and any future batches we do, our customers will gain a share of the profits via dividend distributions,"" said Akram, promising further details of the deal ""soon"".  A promising start  Founded in April 2013 by Mohammed Mubasher Akram as Cheshire Technology Limited, Alpha Technology held promise as a different type of mining outfit.  The company posted its address and phone number online and only asked for a 30% deposit on pre-orders, unlike the 100% deposit required by other mining companies.  In July 2013, the company shed the Cheshire Technology name and legally changed address from Stockport to a Manchester address shared by Akram’s father’s accounting company – M. Akram and Co. That summer the company’s blog was regularly updated with news of technical progress.  Akram, who holds a Masters of Engineering degree in electrical and electronic engineering but declined to name the university or other details, was gearing up for a launch in early 2014. In late December, he announced pricing details for the company's mining hardware and an estimated shipping date between April and September 2014 (Q2–Q3).  “Our goal is to improve significantly on our shipping estimates of Q2/Q3,” he wrote on the company’s blog on 24th December 2013.  Already the company’s refunds policy was attracting criticism. Depending on the time elapsed from your purchase, the company would refund less and less of your initial deposit and charge a £70 fee in all cases. Consumers in the UK have the right to a full refund if a product is not fit for purpose.  “This refund policy is fair as we are not taking 100% upfront,” said Akram in the same post.  By 2nd January the company was almost ready to begin sales. It released a video on YouTube, which now has almost 30,000 views, showing a demonstration of their mining hardware.  Money rolls in  Two days later, pre-orders opened. Customers could pay with PayPal, bank transfer or bitcoin. Just four days after that, on 8th January, the company was already nearing its target for the first batch of hardware and announced it would close its first-batch of pre-orders on 10th January.  At this stage, Akram was “targeting the end of Q2 [June] as our delivery date,” and released a roadmap that placed 15th July as the end date for the completed hardware.  Two months on and the first rumblings of trouble began to surface. The company announced it would take further pre-orders on 28th March but also noted that it would no longer take payments via PayPal, writing that PayPal had not been as ""friendly and receptive as we had hoped to not only our project but cryptocurrency in general”.  Crowdfunded projects have long had trouble with PayPal, which often declines to release funds until a product ships. For crowdfunding projects that rely on pre-funding to complete development of their product, this can cause serious cash flow problems.  Alpha Technology made no mention of having any such issues, reassuring customers that the shift was “purely a behind-the-scenes business change”. Indeed the 27th March blogpost said the company's “imminent release is hampering competitor sales”.  The company did not have cash flow problems when it stopped accepting PayPal payments, Akram told CoinDesk, saying the problems only arose ""recently when we need to correct [technical] issues"".  Fresh investment  On 5th April, Akram’s older brother, Mohammed Jafar Akram had his directorship of the company terminated. He had been appointed on 29th December 2013, shortly before the launch of pre-orders in January. On the same day, their father, Muhammad Akram, resigned as a director, after being appointed a month earlier.  At some point between 30th November 2013 and 11th July 2014, former Lehman Brothers bonds salesman Andrew Laurus invested in the company.  According to Alpha Technology's July 2014 annual return, Laurus now owns 10% of Alpha Technologies Limited, with managing director Akram owning the other 90%.  Akram said that his father and brother had been involved in the company in order to help get the business up and running, and left when their skills were no longer needed. He declined to say when Andrew Laurus invested in the company or how much he paid for his 10% stake.  ""Laurus is an asset to the organisation with respect to the large projects he's previously been involved in and the contacts and experience he brings to the table,"" said Akram.  Laurus was previously cited in an August 2013 The Wall Street Journal article that claimed currency trader Joe Lewis was investing $200m in bitcoin mining company Avalon.  ""The bitcoin deal was put together by Andrew Laurus, a former government bonds salesman at Lehman Brothers who is also an investor in the [Phoenix Fund],"" the article read.  The story later turned out be false.    Spoke to Joe Lewis this morning who says of reported Bitcoin investment: ""Completely Untrue"". Tells me he's ""Never heard of Phoenix Fund""      — Scott Wapner (@ScottWapnerCNBC) August 5, 2013      CoinDesk has reached out to Laurus, but did not receive an immediate response.  Issues finally surface  As late as the end of May 2014, Alpha Technologies was still pointing to July as the shipping date, though it had begun to make alterations to the final product, removing Wi-Fi connectivity and the LCD screen in an effort to make a “back-to-basics” miner. At the same time, Alpha Technologies promised a massive jump in the hashing power of its products, from 90Mh/s to a ""minimum"" of 250Mh/s for its high-end miner.  Some customers responded with scepticism, claiming the increase was a cynical bid to keep customers on board, a claim Alpha Technology has strongly denied.  Akram told CoinDesk that it was not until the end of June and beginning of July that they ""became aware of the full extent of the problem delay"" and that before that point they believed they could still meet the July deadline.  No further announcements were made on the company’s blog until 20th June, when Alpha Technology apologised for not responding to emails – “We will be up to date on our emails within a matter of days” – and warned customers posts on the forum would be deleted if they concerned orders: “We cannot discuss orders on a public forum.”  It would be almost another month before the next update. The company's 15th July announcement that customers could now pay with credit card included an admission that the July shipping date would be missed.  “We are aware it is half way through July (and passed our best case scenario date) and hope to be able to give you a shipping date as soon as possible so stay tuned,” the statement read.  With yesterday’s announcement  , that shipping date has now been given.  The company has again rejected claims that its refund policies contradict UK law, saying that consumer laws don’t apply to what it argues are business purchases.  “As far [our policy] contradicts with consumer laws; this is not possible as such regulations only apply to consumer products,” the 28th July blogpost reads.  It goes on to say that its sales are classed as “business purchases” due in part to the fact that its hardware “can only be used for mining cryptocurrencies which is legally a business practice and a taxable activity according to HMRC.”  The HMRC decision the blogpost references  to support its argument was released on 3rd March 2014, almost two full months after Alpha Technology opened pre-orders in early January.  ""Our legal advisers have advised us this from the start, long before HMRC released their brief,"" said Akram. ""These mining machines are effectively money making machines [...] our legal team and we are positive that there is no other way to look at this, they are what they are.""  He added that their argument did not solely rely on HMRC's tax position, saying that Distance Selling Regulations (DSR), which cover the sale of goods online, were a ""legal matter"".  With some disgruntled customers now saying they may take civil action against Alpha Technology, that legal matter may well be resolved in a court.

The 'ANX Vault' app now includes the all-important send and receive functions vital to any bitcoin wallet. Although always available on the Android version, these features have only now appeared for iOS.  ANX  has also upgraded the Android version. Both Android and iOS editions of ANX Vault now feature the ability to send bitcoin via email to recipients who do not yet have bitcoin addresses.  Security features  Both versions of the app support optional three-factor authentication, although, to still allow fast transactions, the app allows users to set daily spending limits that bypass the security feature.  The exchange says that other security features include the ability to disable send privileges from a user's desktop account in the event of a lost mobile device, OTP (one-time password) support for logging in and sending funds, and 'industry standard' encryption for all data communication.  Multi-currency platform and sending  Although based in Hong Kong, ANX aims for an international client base for both its full exchange and mobile apps. The platform supports the world's most-traded fiat currencies (AUD, CAD, GBP, CHF, EUR, HKD, JPY, NZD, SGD and USD) and some of its most popular cryptocurrencies (BTC, DOGE, LTC, NMC, and PPC).  Users set a home currency in which to view their total portfolio balance, and can view up-to-date exchange rates between cryptocurrency and fiat trading pairs. All cryptocurrency assets are viewable in a single comprehensive listing.  BTC, LTC and DOGE can be sent to any other supported cryptocoin address with conversion performed by the exchange. The Android version also allows this feature for PPC and NMC.  Standard features on any serious trading app are live updates and configurable price alerts, which ANX Vault also allows its users to set.  The apps are available from their respective outlets: Apple's iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.  ANX exchanges  Although founded in June 2013, ANX has quickly grown to have the world's sixth-largest trade volume, thanks to its wide selection of currencies. In Hong Kong, where it is licensed as a Money Services Operator, the exchange manages a bitcoin ATM and physical shopfront-style trading point.  The company recently launched a bitcoin debit card service, giving users another way to withdraw and spend their cryptocurrency wealth in a still fiat-dominated world.  Its founding partners come from a financial industry background and have stated that transparency and regulatory compliance are high priorities.  The company has two online exchange platforms, the consumer focused ANXBTC and the ANXPRO exchange aimed at professional traders.

The Skyhook machine, which was installed inside the Bookmans Entertainment Exchange, Tuscon, was operated by Javelin Investments LLC.  Brian Williams, founder of the company, told azcentral.com that the building was struck by lightning, which caused a power surge and knocked out some of the ATM's components, adding:  ""It's kind of like getting punched in the face. I'm trying to pick up the pieces and trying to figure out where we are at.""  Williams told the website that about a dozen people had used the ATM in the few days it was operational. Most bought relatively small amounts of bitcoin, around $5-$10 per purchase, but one user bought 1 BTC (worth around $581 at press time). Williams said, because of its larger value, he did that transaction in person, using a laptop.  Picking up the pieces  Williams says he is currently trying to determine the amount of damage to the ATM. The surge affected one of the machine's core components, he said, but other components may have been damaged as well, such as the touchscreen and the ATM's bill acceptor.  On the upside, the power surge did not affect any of the accounts linked to the machine and Williams was able to recover all of the hard currency stored inside.  Williams described the unfortunate event as a ""totally avoidable thing"" and apologised to users who were inconvenienced by it.  Currently there are about 23 bitcoin ATMs in the US. Following the strike, Arizona's bitcoiners are out of luck, as the closest bitcoin ATMs are installed in Las Vegas and Tijuana, Mexico.

42425958,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhCFh,1406610035,"Coinapult Launches LOCKS, Aiming to Eliminate Bitcoin Price Volatility","Bitcoin's price volatility has long been viewed as one of the biggest barriers to mainstream consumer adoption, but while a long-recognized problem, the issue has yet to be addressed by any specific market solutions.  That could be set to change, however, with the introduction of a new service from Panama-based bitcoin wallet provider Coinapult. Called LOCKS, the offering allows users outside the US to peg the value of their BTC to the price of gold, silver, British pounds, US dollars and euros.  Coinapult CEO Ira Miller told CoinDesk that despite suggestions that consumers in the developed world may be less concerned with bitcoin's volatility, this doesn't mean that the bitcoin industry shouldn't move to address this potential pain point in a bid to better court the market.  Miller explained:  ""I think that [global consumers] have a higher tolerance for [price volatility] because they have been forced to suffer through a lot more volatility from their own currencies. It's not necessarily because bitcoin is volatile and that's something they're comfortable with, it's that they look less volatile compared to their national currency and if they had access to something like gold for instance, maybe they'd prefer that over either.""  Of course, Miller sees the solution as broadly appealing, mentioning the potential usefulness of LOCKS for bitcoin businesses that want to better manage their supply chain as well as the growing number of employees that are paid in bitcoin, adding:  ""People can't really afford to hold bitcoin for very long. You've got to pay rent at the end of the month in euros or dollars, you may even at this time convince your landlord to pay rent using the bitcoin network, but at at the same time, you may have market action that happens during those 15 days that means you can't cover that anymore.""  Founded in 2012, the release marks the first new consumer offering from Coinapult in some time. Miller explained that Coinapult has been primarily focusing on B2B solutions, merchant processing and other verticals that position it to better serve Latin America, as well as its SMS and email-based bitcoin sending solutions.  Miller added: ""We think that these new consumer-facing services are going to be really big in Latin America and we see Latin America as the hottest emerging market for bitcoin all around.""  How LOCKS works  When users first log in to their Coinapult wallet, they can navigate to the 'My Locks' screen for the option to lock a certain portion of their wallet holdings to a selected asset.  Coinapult charges no fees for using the locking service, and does not sell bitcoin to consumers. At the point a user locks in a value or unlocks the value of their BTC, Miller explained, Coinapult quotes the user for a certain number of coins at a certain price.  ""If you exercise [locking or unlocking the funds], we're guaranteeing that we'll provide you a certain number of coins at that price,"" Miller said. ""If I lock 0.0085 BTC to the price of the US dollar, I will always have $5 worth of bitcoin to spend. What that specific amount is at the time is dependent on the market, but it will always be the same. It will always be [$5 worth of bitcoin].""  All funds are only redeemable in bitcoin, meaning users who peg a certain amount of BTC to an ounce of gold cannot receive an ounce of gold from Coinapult.  Users can also increase or decrease the amount of their lock should they want to access their holdings for expenses or other purposes.  ""Let's say I think the pound is strong and I think I'm going to have expenses in pounds coming up. It takes me to a confirmation page. I click 'Yes'. At this point it's made me a quote, it's giving me a price for this transaction.""  Miller further clarified: ""If the BTC-to-[dollar] exchange rate doubles, then tomorrow I get half as much bitcoin back.""  Using Miller's $5 example, a user who locked in this value at current market prices would be redeemable for 0.0042 BTC in this circumstance.  Easing introductory conversations  Though Coinapult does not sell bitcoin to new users, Miller still sees his tool as one aimed at helping to onboard consumers to the bitcoin ecosystem.  For example, he described Coinapult as a service that could appeal to consumers in Kenya who want to settle a debt at a bar or restaurant, saying:  ""You buy a drink for your friend and he says 'I don't have cash, why don't I just send you some bitcoin?'. If that guy doesn't have a wallet already, it can be kind of a challenge to actually get him to accept the payment. Even if he's willing and curious, he still needs to get set up and you need to work through some logistics to make that initial payment.""  Miller sees LOCKS as a solution to this issue, one that would allow the bitcoin sender in the scenario with a way to introduce the receiver to bitcoin while preserving the value that he paid in the original transaction.  ""They can receive their first bitcoin payment and immediately lock it to gold or their local currency, and at that moment they've experienced bitcoin the payment network for the first time, and hopefully the locking action will eliminate one or two of the things that will be very new and uncomfortable for them about that experience,"" Miller said.  First to market  Given that finding solutions to bitcoin's price volatility could prove integral to increasing adoption, Miller also discussed why he believes his company was the first to come to the market with a solution.  For example, Miller noted that gold-backed bitcoin initiatives have fallen short for consumers due to their inability to find a middle ground between fiat and digital currency.  Miller said:  ""The fundamental misunderstanding is that gold is gold and dollars and euros are centralized assets, so you can't decentralize them, you need a central party to be a steward of whatever the centralized asset.""  The CEO also went on to state that Coinapult's willingness to operate outside of the US market was a factor, as regulation there, he said, makes it unclear whether such a solution could be provided.  Miller also believes that bringing the solution to market is a testament to what his team has achieved, adding:  ""We think we've hit a sweet spot on the legal front, nothing like this has existed before. And where we choose to operate from, that's all very fine balance that we spent a lot of time working out.""
