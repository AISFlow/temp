Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin trades near $48,000, while layer 1 token ALGO gains on incentive program news  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a hiatus for the holidays. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing a piece from CoinDesk reporter Damanick Dantes’ Year-End Review series, whichrecaps this year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,394 -0.3%  Ether (ETH): $3,742 -1.66%  Markets  S&P 500: 4,793 +0.14%  DJIA: 36,488 +0.25%  Nasdaq: 15,766 -0.98%  Gold: $1,803 -0.15%  Market moves  Bitcoin continued to fall, trading at about $47,000 on Wednesday, after a sharp drop of more than 6% a day ago.  The No.1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization had another day of low volume across centralized exchanges due to the year-end holiday season. The center of the market is still at the expiry of the options contract on Dec. 31.  A total of 124,700 option contracts worth nearly $6 billion are set to expire on Friday, according to data provided by Skew. Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.  At the same time, smart contract platform tokens algorand (ALGO) and near (NEAR) led the biggest daily gains during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday. ALGO’s gains came after Algorand Foundation announced a liquidity incentive program with Algorand’s first algorithmic money market and stablecoin protocol Algofi.  Year-end market wrap  Market Wrap Year-End Review: Institutions Cash Out of Bitcoin: One investment firm pocketed big profits by selling bitcoin near the market top in April before the price tumbled.  Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap this year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (If you’re looking for today’s prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  In a recent episode of this year-in-review series, we recapped the onslaught of fear, uncertainty and doubt – “FUD,” in crypto-speak, meaning really any negative headlines – that shook crypto markets in April and May. Mood dampeners included the threat of higher U.S. capital gains taxes, China’s reinvigorated efforts to stamp out cryptocurrency trading and mining and the potential environmental harms from the Bitcoin blockchain’s extensive electricity usage.  Today, we’ll show additional reasons for widespread selling that occurred in April and May. After bitcoin’s powerful rally to start the year, fueled by fear of fast inflation, some large investors grew concerned about rampant speculation in the almost-anything-goes market and a slowdown in global money supply growth. In fact, some price chart indicators were already suggesting that bitcoin was overvalued. By June, BTC had stabilized at around $30,000, and guess what happened then? Traders bought the dip.  Funds cash out  Ruffer Investments, a U.K-based asset management company, was one of the earliest big institutional investors to bet on bitcoin – starting in November 2020.  As prices shot up during early 2021, Ruffer essentially rode the wave while other fund managers were just warming up to crypto, lured by its potential for high returns.  “Last November we gained exposure to bitcoin. We viewed it as an option on an emerging store of value with a highly skewed and attractive risk/reward profile,” Duncan MacInnes, investment director at Ruffer Investments, wrote in a blog post on July 9.  But even Ruffer was taken aback by the ferocity of bitcoin’s price rally at the start the year to a new all-time high of around $65,000. And Ruffer cashed out. The market seemed to be unsustainable.  “In 2021, the excitement is in cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. The promise is real. But so, too, is the surge in excess liquidity generated by fiscal stimulus and ongoing quantitative easing. Excess liquidity looked to us to be peaking in April,” MacInnes wrote.  The Sunday Times reported in June that Ruffer made a $1.1 billion profit in five months.  Extreme bullish sentiment  In terms of the market reversal, it sure didn’t help that several crypto-market indicators were flashing signs of excessive buying activity in the month or so leading up to bitcoin’s April price peak. For example, around March, Alternative.me’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached the highest level since June 2019, which had preceded a nearly 60% BTC price sell-off.  There were other warning signs in both blockchain data and price charts. (See the chart below, which looks at technical indicators on bitcoin’s “market value to realized value” ratio, a blockchain-based market metric known as MVRV.)  Crypto industry responds to ESG concerns  As nagging environmental concerns over bitcoin’s environmental footprint continued to weigh on the market, crypto-industry executives took steps to respond.  Elon Musk – the billionaire Tesla CEO whose market-moving tweets earlier in the year revealed an on-again, off-again infatuation with bitcoin – sounded a fresh openness to crypto industry dialogue over the Bitcoin blockchain’s electricity usage. Toward the end of May, Musk tweeted that he spoke with bitcoin miners about using renewable energy resources. He wasn’t turning his back on bitcoin completely, which provided some hope for discouraged bulls.  The announcement on May 24 of the Bitcoin Mining Council, which banded together miners and large investors, including MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, sent BTC immediately higher by almost 12%. At that point, market panic from the April sell-off began to fade, and some traders began to buy the dip.  BTC’s price eventually stabilized at about $30,000 in June as extreme selling pressure began to slow. The chart below shows the nearly 50% price drop between April and June. And then, over the course of July and August, bitcoin mostly traded sideways, establishing a new price range as some technical indicators suggested BTC’s price was oversold.  The question in the minds of crypto traders was whether the new market environment represented a pause on the way down or the foundation for a fresh leg up.  Price movements were far less volatile than they had been in recent months, and it seemed as though many investors still believed in bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value. Bitcoin miners claimed to be looking for ways to reduce or mitigate their environmental footprint, and most of the network’s mining power relocated away from crypto-unfriendly China.  Plus, traders weren’t using as much leverage, and market conditions seemed to calm markedly. In other words, there wasn’t much froth.  A key takeaway was that, despite what suddenly seemed to an unrelenting onslaught of negative headlines for the bitcoin market, the price was holding up remarkably well on a historical basis: The April all-time high of around $65,000 was now looking far away, but so was the 2020 low of around $3,850.  Speculation was still running high in other areas of the crypto market. In the next episode, we’ll show how some traders flocked to alternative cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT) while bitcoin traded sideways.

Don&apos;t Value Bitcoin In Dollars Presently, one bitcoin is trading for around $51K. This apparent value is derived from the dollar, which confers a fiat value upon an asset that was created to replace it. Pompliano says that this should not be so.

The so-called “white hat,” known as “Leon Spacewalker” on Twitter and GitHub, reported an exploit in a critical Polygon smart contract that held more than 9 billion MATIC tokens on Dec. 3, then worth around $20.2 billion. Core developers rushed a fix by Dec. 5.  It wasn’t fast enough to protect all the contract’s funds, according to Immunefi, the crypto security startup that managed Polygon’s bug bounty program. Separate hackers pilfered 801,601 MATIC tokens (then worth around $1.4 million) on Dec. 4. Polygon Foundation said it took the hit.  Still, the fix, a hard fork live across 90% of network validators by Block #22156660, according to Polygon’s timeline of events, protected a massive trove of funds for the Ethereum scaling tool. Polygon hadn’t publicly discussed the reasoning for the hard fork before Wednesday.  Consulting the record  CoinDesk reviewed the Polygon Discord server’s validator channel on Dec. 5. It contained multiple validators expressing anger over the core developers’ silence on pushing what is usually a major and well-publicized software upgrade through the shadows.  Indeed, the abrupt hard fork had spillover effects for the network as validators unprepared for the shift were knocked offline, according to the Discord logs.  Polygon’s developers acknowledged on Wednesday their initial silence created a precarious position. “There is a natural tension between security and transparency,” the team said in its blog post. They said a “minimal” initial disclosure followed the Ethereum community’s “silent patch” standard.  “What’s important is that this was a test of our network’s resilience as well as our ability to act decisively under pressure,” co-founder Jaynti Kanani said in a blog post. “Considering how much was at stake, I believe our team has made the best decisions possible given the circumstances.”  Polygon’s bug bounty program awarded Leon Spacewalker $2.2 million in stablecoins; a different white hat who reported the same bug after the initial thefts won 500,000 MATIC.

42375665,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9e8x,1640812653,"Market Wrap Year-End Review: El Salvador Adopted Bitcoin, Then Bought the Dip","Hi Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap this year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts that started on Dec. 20 and that will run through Thursday, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest crypto-market prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  In Tuesday’s post, we explored how alternative coins or “altcoins” rallied during the first part of the year – illustrating just how far the year’s explosion in popularity for digital-asset markets extended beyond bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization sharply declined between March and May as traders shifted attention to other areas of the crypto universe. Then from June through August, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) became all the rage among artists and crypto investors. Even though bitcoin trading volume was relatively low, investors were able to seek out opportunities far and wide in the alt space. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted his nostalgia for the days of high bitcoin volatility.  But BTC’s sideways trading pattern didn’t last long. Today, we’ll show how bitcoin was able to break out of its two month-long price range of around $30,000 as El Salvador, the tiny Central American country that previously had used the U.S. dollar as the country’s primary currency, came to the rescue.  El Salvador buys in  In June, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, announced that bitcoin would become legal tender, making his country the first to make that move, which also meant no capital gains taxes for bitcoin holders there.  Bitcoin rose about 70% from a low of around $30,000 toward a high of nearly $50,000 in early September as traders reacted to the news from El Salvador – seen by many fans of the 12-year-old digital asset as a long-awaited validation of its potential to serve a global currency. El Salvador’s bitcoin’s law went into effect in September.  Bitcoin dips  When the law actually took effect, bitcoin’s price began to sell off – a classic “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact” scenario. (A similar thing had happened earlier in the year, when the big cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase held its direct stock listing on the Nasdaq exchange.)  Bukele tweeted that El Salvador was ready to buy on price dips even as BTC continued to fall. A growing number of users on social media platforms, including Twitter and Reddit, called for people to buy small amounts of bitcoin in support of El Salvador’s bitcoin policy, Bloomberg reported. Many investors were already betting the news could give the oldest cryptocurrency a price boost.  On Sept. 13, software company MicroStrategy purchased an additional 5,050 BTC for about $242 million in cash. Still, BTC continued lower.  BTC declined from $50,000 toward $40,000 and ended September on a down note.  Concerns were growing over a possible credit default by the Chinese property developer Evergrande Group, shaking speculative assets including equities and cryptocurrencies; lower risk appetite among investors also contributed to bitcoin’s September slump.  The takeaway for crypto traders from the July-August price action was that El Salvador’s decision to make BTC legal tender wouldn’t be enough to keep the cryptocurrency’s price elevated at $50,000. Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks increased along with the credit concerns in China.  Still, the nearly 7% BTC drop in September looked far less severe than the 50% price crash in April and May. After some ups and downs, bitcoin’s price had again stabilized at well above 2020 levels as some traders began to anticipate a $100,000 BTC price by year end.

42375668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9eCj,1640796947,Gas DAO Token Struggles to Maintain Momentum After Airdrop,"Following the shooting-star success of SOS, another airdropped token, GAS, is now on offer to Ethereum wallets everywhere.  With no product, no plans for a product and no utility, the freshly minted GAS token’s run may be even more short-lived, however.  On Tuesday night, Gas DAO announced the launch of GAS, the project’s governance token, in a series of tweets.  The token was distributed to nearly 650,000 Ethereum users who had fulfilled certain on-chain parameters, including having spent over $1,559 in gas fees. So far, some 26,000 users have claimed the token, which had a peak market capitalization in excess of $50 million earlier today.  Unlike its spiritual predecessor, SOS, which airdropped its token to NFT marketplace OpenSea users on Christmas day, GAS has failed to enjoy an initial price surge and may already be trapped in a death spiral, however.  Read more: OpenDAO’s SOS Token Hits $250M Market Cap Despite Unclear Goals, Security Risks  Utility  Neither SOS or GAS currently has a working product, and Gas DAO doesn’t have a stated plan for one, either.  While SOS’ early promotional materials floated use cases such as “support art preservation” and “support NFT communities,” in a blog post the Gas DAO team simply wrote, “In the coming days Gas DAO will publish another post outlining the governance structure for Gas DAO.”  Because of crypto’s open-source nature and the speed with which new concepts can proliferate, exciting new verticals are often copied and manage to attract investors despite a lack of innovation, ultimately creating sector bubbles. One example is the trend of yield farms and “vampire attacks” devolving into “food farms” during the DeFi Summer period of 2020.  Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment  However, this latest trend of targeted airdrops stands out both for the absence of an interesting initial idea and for the speed with which it has reached unsustainable absurdity.  Liquidity providers delight  So far, the token has managed to attract an active market – though not necessarily a healthy one.  The Uniswap decentralized exchange pool for GAS/ETH is listed among blockchain analytics firm Nansen’s “hot contracts,” and multiple Ethereum addresses with the “smart money” label are providing liquidity to the pool.  Providing liquidity to airdropped tokens is a popular strategy among advanced users, as airdrops often feature high volatility and volumes, and therefore allowing them to harvest a greater amount of trading fees.  Per CoinGecko, GAS is one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by trading volume despite only barely reaching the top 1,000 by market capitalization on a 24-hour basis. Nonetheless, the price of GAS has also been stuck in a near-continuous downtrend since its listing early Wednesday morning. Likewise, SOS is tanking: the token is down 33% in the past day, per CoinGecko.  Jumping the shark  While casual users have delighted at the “free” money and liquidity providers at the tantalizing volume, multiple developers and other observers have expressed disappointment with what has seemingly already devolved into an absurd trend.  While some have compared SOS and GAS to the recent Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token airdrop, others note that ENS had a working product for a number of years prior to tokenization and forced claimants to vote in a founding governance constitution.  Read more: Missed the ENS Airdrop? Here Are the Crypto Projects Rumored to ‘Decentralize’ Next  As ENS contributor Brantly Millegan pointed out, this is a stark contrast to SOS and GAS, which have no product (and, in GAS’ case, currently no stated plans for a product), and had to target other communities in order to form their user base.  Likewise, prolific DeFi developer Andre Cronje called on users to “stop voting with your attention span” and to instead focus on tokens with working products.  “I get that [Crypto Twitter] has the attention span of a gnat, but seriously, in crypto, you vote with your money, if you keep voting for low energy scams, you will keep getting low energy scams,” Cronje wrote.",NEGATIVE,ETH | ENS,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ENS | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/29/gas-dao-token-struggles-to-maintain-momentum-after-airdrop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ae1a3c53d905841df46df7d3f42970d8a51ca12-3000x1990.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Davidson.  The Wall Street investment bank believes that Marathon’s shares have compelling upside after a recent sell-off.  “With its new low-cost Texas facility and massive new Bitmain order, we project MARA to reach 23 EH/s by 1Q23 without additional capital raises,” analyst Christopher Brendler wrote.  Brendler sees upside for all six miners that he covers, as he expects better returns in mining stocks than via bitcoin itself. However, Marathon is his top pick as the shares have been one of the hardest-hit mostly due to what he called “misplaced concerns” about a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry.  “Our biggest concern has been the ability to maintain margins as competition pushes hosting costs up, but Marathon’s timing, scale and expertise are clearly driving advantaged access,” Brendler wrote.  Brendler has a buy recommendation on Marathon’s stock with a 12-month price target of $65. His other buy rated miners are Core Scientific, Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG), Hut 8 Mining (HUT) and Argo Blockchain (ARGO).  Marathon recently agreed to buy 78,000 Antminer S19 XP bitcoin miners from Bitmain for $879.1 million, which is expected to help the company reach mining power of 23.3 EH/s by early 2023, a 600% increase from current levels.  Marathon’s shares have fallen more than 50% since their peak on Nov. 9, while bitcoin has dropped about 30% over the same time period, according to TradingView data.  Marathon’s shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading.

42421261,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXklcD,1640793907,Why I Decided to Spend New Year’s Eve in the Metaverse,"In “Snowcrash,” the groundbreaking novel in which he coined the term “metaverse,” Neal Stephenson writes, “See, the world is full of things more powerful than us. But if you know how to catch a ride, you can go places.”  With this holiday season’s trifecta of omicron, travel cancellations and a 41% chance of rain in New York City this Friday, I’ve decided to take the legendary sci-fi author’s advice. I’m catching a ride to the metaverse to see what New Year’s Eve will be like in virtual reality.  On a recent Zoom chat, I was intrigued to hear Digital Currency Group had partnered with real estate investment and management firm Jamestown to recreate One Times Square (and the surrounding architecture and plaza space) in Decentraland for New Year’s Eve. (Disclosure: CoinDesk is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is an investor in Decentraland.)  Join CoinDesk in Decentraland: CoinDesk TV will play the best moments of 2021 in the CoinDesk auditorium. Join the Virtual One Times Square NYE Party on Dec. 31 here.  Metaverse mania  The first question that went through my mind was possibly the most obvious: When is midnight in the metaverse? Despite a fair amount of searching, I learned there does not yet seem to be an accepted metaverse timezone. For now, however, no matter where in the physical world users log in from, New Year’s Eve in Decentraland will be tied to its physical twin of Times Square: at 12:00 a.m. ET.  To get a sense of what to expect, I connected my MetaMask and outfitted my avatar to explore Decentraland. I threw on a beige work shirt, brown pants, sunglasses and some gold sneakers that were airdropped to me via an NFT collection I own – I must admit, I would have worn this outfit IRL – and took to the virtual streets.  Read more: An Advisor’s Guide to Popular Crypto Wallets  First impression: wow. Decentraland has undergone a lot of development since the last time I visited. There has been an explosion in land development and there are many more players in the world than before. Over the course of an hour, I visited three art galleries, played blackjack with a frog in one of the many casinos, attended a Playboy holiday event and almost got hit by a meteor in an early version of a play-to-earn game. I also learned a few dance moves, which was probably the most appropriate skill needed for a New Year’s party.  Indeed, there will be live musical performances to dance to in this virtual Times Square event. There’ll also be crypto art, immersive games, a custom CoinDesk auditorium showing specially tailored year-end content and, of course, all the billboards and advertising of the actual Times Square.  Even so, you’re probably wondering, why would I choose to ring in the new year with byte-based people when I could spend it with the flesh-and-blood variety?  Two reasons: First, in the past three weeks a family member and many of my friends contracted the omicron variant of COVID-19, so it felt a bit precarious to surround myself with real-life humans at this moment; second, this event offers a chance to satisfy my expanding curiosity over where this technology is headed.  The rise of virtual real estate  With all of the talk of immersive online experiences, combined with the significant appreciation in many blockchain-based metaverse tokens, we seem to be approaching a tipping point in how marketplaces, ownership and communities are developing simultaneously online and off. This New Year’s Eve bash offers a glimpse of where we are headed.  “The future of retail, hospitality, business and events will be a consistent experience in the real world and across all online platforms,” said Simon Koster, CEO of DCG Real Estate. “Your business card will list your physical address and your metaverse address, bringing a similar ethos to both. The metaverse location is a supplement for people who want to come to your real space, yet aren’t able to get there in person. It will feel akin to your physical space.”  Perhaps this is why we’ve seen a virtual land boom recently. In just one week in December, we saw $300+ million in land sales, Nike’s purchase of metaverse studio RTFKT and the announcement of a Metaverse Fashion Week. People are betting that we want our environments, clothing, cars and artwork to live in both physical and digital space simultaneously.  Explore CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 list at the Virtual One Times Square NYE Party on Dec. 31. Enter here.  There is also an opportunity to erect architecture that does not exist in physical form.  “So many projects have been designed and have never been built. Architects and designers are well ahead of the real estate industry in that they design natively in 3D but do not always get made due to logistics and construction costs,” Koster said. “The metaverse can give them a platform to bring those to life.”  As for this Friday’s event, Jamestown President Michael Phillips said “300 million eyes watched Times Square ring in the New Year in 2020;” his firm’s activation in Decentraland aims “to bring this to a wider audience and see how the metaverse can enhance it.”  The largest events in Decentraland tend to hover around 10,000 attendees. Expectations for NYE are 10x that or more. With all of this activity (and with much easier access to a bathroom), I look forward to seeing how Friday plays out in the metaverse and to having a virtual toast with many others from around the globe.

Jamestown, the owner of One Times Square, is recreating the 26-story tower at the heart of New York’s New Year’s Eve ball drop in Decentraland. The company announced the plan Wednesday as a partnership with Digital Currency Group (DCG), the longtime Decentraland backer with major holdings in the platform’s MANA and LAND tokens. (DCG is the parent company of an editorially independent CoinDesk.)  As the value of virtual real estate in popular metaverse games like Decentraland and The Sandbox continues to soar, involvement from real-world real estate developers like Jamestown could be a trend to watch.  It comes at a time when the real Times Square ball drop will be limited to 15,000 socially distanced and fully vaccinated attendees due to a rise in COVID-19 cases. The event typically hosts 58,000 and is watched on TV by many more.

Virtual billboards will tie the experience to the event’s meatspace counterpart via livestreams of New York City.  How much Jamestown spent on its virtual real estate wasn’t disclosed, though the construction project was said to be part of the firm’s “larger digital asset strategy.”  “The metaverse is an important part of the evolution of real estate and the built environment,” Jamestown President Michael Phillips said in a press release. “Whereas physical real estate is largely limited to people with geographic proximity, the metaverse can give people around the world meaningful access to places through immersive virtual experiences.”  Jamestown and DCG tapped metaverse development firms GrowYourBase and MetaVenture Studios for the construction.

42375673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9eGV,1640793088,Thetan Arena Battles Axie Infinity in ‘Play-to-Earn’,"Thetan Arena, a new video game fueled by cryptocurrency, claims to have quickly amassed over twice as many users as Axie Infinity, the digital-asset darling that leapt to a dominant market position earlier this year in the “play-to-earn” sector.  Some analysts are pointing to Thetan Arena as the “next Axie,” but others say the two play-to-earn games aren’t comparable. “Play-to-earn” refers to video games where players can earn cryptocurrency rewards and use those for in-game purchases or just to cash out.  The e-sport multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game launched late last month, and its governance token Thetan Gem token (THG) currently has a market value of more than $500 million, based on data from Thetan Arena’s developer, Wolffun Game, a game studio led by Vietnamese developers, as well as pricing listed on the website CoinMarketCap.com.  The THG token’s performance has been marked by considerable volatility, however. It started trading in September following an “initial decentralized offering” that was marred by two cyber attacks. Initially changing hands around $1.35, the price of THG leapt to an all-time high around $20 in late November before retreating to about $6.04 now.  The current market valuation is still a small fraction of the $6.7 billion for Axie’s AXS tokens, but it’s the reported user-growth figures that look so impressive. According to the company, Thetan Arena has already racked up over 7 million users. That compares with Axie Infinity’s 2.5 million average monthly users.  On-chain users  When looking at the raw blockchain data of daily on-chain users on Thetan Arena, the figures are small compared with Axie Infinity’s. So the project may have some catching up to do before it poses a real threat in the play-to-earn sector.  For example, check the user statistics reported by DappRadar, which tracks data for unique active wallets interacting with a given decentralized application, such as marketplace and box activity (in-game NFTs trading activity). This on-chain data does not include users who play the game via an app off-chain.  According to DappRadar, Thetan Arena has 4,800 daily active users and 26,500 weekly active users, while Axie Infinity has 106,000 daily active users and 302,000 weekly active users.  CoinDesk examined available blockchain data using contract addresses provided on the pricing website CoinGecko for Thetan Arena and Axie Infinity.  According to the data, there are about 79,000 holders of the THG tokens on Binance Smart Chain and 1,930 holders on the Kardia blockchain, as well as 34,630 holders of the project’s Thetan Coin (THC) tokens on Binance Smart Chain. Meanwhile there are 116,801 holders of Axie Infinity’s AXS tokens on the Ethereum blockchain’s Ronin sidechain, 46,943 on Ethereum and 65,520 on Binance Smart Chain.  Aleksander Larsen, Axie Infinity’s co-founder, said that the daily active user numbers shown on Thetan’s website seem to be mostly off-chain users who do not interact with the blockchain economy on a deeper level.  “I think it will be quite challenging to turn the free ‘grinders’ into on-chain users without a solid economy,” said Larsen.  A Thetan Arena representative, who initially replied to several of CoinDesk’s queries, didn’t respond to a request for comment on which users are included in the 7 million figure it claims.  Ranking on Apple’s App Store  Thetan Arena, which is compatible with Apple’s iOS operating system as well as Android and PCs, allows players to earn THC tokens, which are used to speed up progress in the game and unlock weapons, heroes and abilities. Players can form teams, battle with others and earn token rewards with a combination of gaming skills and teamwork.  In the first seven days of Thetan Arena’s launch, the game ranked first on Apple’s App Store in 11 different countries and second on the App Store in all categories, according to a press release.  Jason Chapman, managing partner at Konvoy Ventures, a venture fund investing in early-stage companies in the video gaming industry, said he doesn’t see Thetan Arena and Axie Infinity as direct competitors.  “Thetan Arena is attacking a completely different genre,” Chapman said, “which as a gamer I am excited to see.”  “I don’t view the two as direct competitors, the same way that I don’t view most games that are in different genres as direct competitors,” Chapman said.  Axie’s barrier to entry  Thetan Arena’s surge in popularity can be attributed to a combination of an effective social media presence on platforms like Discord, and also by offering users the option to play for free and start earning tokens straight away.  There also might be a void in the number of play-to-earn projects that have actually gone live.  Alexandre Lores, a crypto analyst at Quantum Economics, pointed out that there’s a gap in the market for released play-to-earn games, which could contribute to the game’s sudden peak in popularity online.  “This gaming community has been hearing the hype about crypto gaming for months in a market saturated with cryptocurrency tokens and very few actually released games,” Lores said.  Unlike Axie Infinity, Thetan Arena requires no initial investment to start. Players do not need to pay a starting fee or own anything – such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – before beginning. That’s in contrast to Axie Infinity, where players must own three NFTs (costing roughly $1,065 according to DappRadar) to start their play-to-earn journey unless they secure a so-called scholarship.  “Axie’s starting cost is definitely a significant barrier to entry,” said Chapman. “There is a big difference between getting a free-to-play user and someone you are asking to invest a significant amount of money to start playing the game.”  Alternatively, there is a paid option called NFT Heroes on Thetan Arena that allows users to participate in various special events to earn more THC than in the free version. These THC tokens serve as the currency for in-game rewards and purchases, whereas the THG tokens offer holders a hand in the project’s governance.  “If there’s one game out right now to end up flipping AXS, it’s THG,” tweeted Jonny, host of “In the Game” on the YouTube channel Crypto Banter.  Thetan Arena’s gameplay  A student from Singapore told CoinDesk that he plays both Axie and Thetan Arena but prefers the latter, saying he finds it less of a “chore.”  The student is part of Thetan Arena’s Discord group and was contacted via Discord. He agreed to comment but asked that his identity remain confidential. He said that he is able to make around $40 a day by playing Thetan Arena on his phone or PC, whereas with Axie he only made $10 a day.  “I used to play Axie daily, but Thetan is much more fun because it has more engaging gameplay,” the student said.  Another player, who goes by “Baze” and lives in Australia, said he plays Thetan Arena because he cannot afford the starting fee for Axie. Baze said in a Discord interview with CoinDesk that he earns around 72 THC ($10) daily on average by playing the game but recently has experienced burnout.  “Teammates play too much of a role in determining your wins/loses in Thetan,” said the player.  According to Thetan Arena’s website, “The game allows you to form a team, battle with others or earn money with just your skills.”  Baze said that the emphasis on team playing is a flaw of the game and needs to be better developed.  Future of play-to-earn  One thing about Thetan Arena that’s hard to dispute: It’s positioned in one of the hottest parts of the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry.  Play-to-earn games and metaverse-related projects have surged in popularity over the last year, with Wall Street firms predicting large investments, and the associated tokens surging to lofty market valuations. The U.S. bank Morgan Stanley recently predicted that the metaverse will be the “next big investment theme,” in a note to clients this month.  Chapman said that after a successful year for the gaming industry, there are no signs of the sector slowing in 2022.  “People want to engage in more interactive entertainment and we will continue to see a shift away from passive entertainment,” such as TV, he said.  The gaming industry continues to explode and is growing at a compound annual growth rate of about 9%, and the player base grew by over 5% in 2021 to over 3 billion players, according to Chapman.  In cryptocurrency markets, gaming- and metaverse-related tokens have soared, with Axie Infinity’s AXS price up 17-fold this year, and The Sandbox’s SAND price up 16-fold.

42375620,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9I6h,1640782800,"Aoki, Alameda Back Algorithmic Stablecoin on Arbitrum at $200M Valuation","A yield-paying stablecoin on Arbitrum is the latest dollar-pegged crypto asset to bet that crafty algorithms can stand in place of fully-backed reserves.  Sperax launched its algorithmic stablecoin, USDs, on the Ethereum scaling solution on Dec. 23. Anyone who posts token collateral can mint USDs and, according to Sperax’s team, receive interest payments from the revenue their collateral yields. Sperax plans to lessen the collateral demands over time as it shifts more power to its algorithms.  That vision was enough to capture crypto VC interest: Amber Group, Alameda Research and the DJ Steve Aoki recently invested $6 million in Sperax’s governance token SPA at a $200 million valuation, project leads told CoinDesk. The project plans to use the money to scale up its Solidity developer team.  Launching a dollar-pegged (not dollar-backed) stablecoin can be a tricky business in decentralized finance (DeFi). Projects have blown up spectacularly when the mechanisms propping up their value goes awry, like in Iron Finance’s June collapse. Even so, the promise of using code instead of collateral to build more efficient capital markets keeps teams like Sperax chipping away at solutions.  Read more: The Quest for a Truly Decentralized Stablecoin  Algorithms “allow you to scale much faster” than a fully-collateralized stablecoin would, Marco Di Maggio, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and paid advisor to Sperax, told CoinDesk in an interview.  He said Sperax will ease its protocol into algorithmic mode. At first, it will require users to post collateral in SPA and their choice of USDC, USDT and ETH that is roughly equal to the dollar value of their desired USDs.  “At the beginning, we have to prove that we are indeed, you know, stable, that we can make it happen, and so we’re gonna start on the conservative side. But then as the demand for the stablecoin increases, we’re going to shift towards a more and more algorithmic one,” Di Maggio said.  The upside for users is escaping, at least partially, the influence of stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, which are both issued by centralized entities and subject to censorship demands by state actors. Sperax’s white paper called Tether “at odds with the core principles of DeFi.”  Still, Sperax users can post their collateral in UDST – meaning its fully on-chain solution, as business developer lead Alec Shaw put it, could be at least partially collateralized by crypto’s most controversial asset.  He said Sperax’s team “debated extensively” over whether to whitelist USDT before the stablecoin’s market dominance ultimately won out. Despite lingering questions over its backing, the crypto community has decided to trust the stablecoin with “the largest market cap and the deepest liquidity,” and so Sperax would too.  That community will ultimately have a strong say in the direction Sperax and USDs takes. Like many projects, its pledged to decentralize itself with steps that grant SPA token holders voting authority over issues such as acceptable collateral.  Sperax is “finishing up the design of the DAO,” Shaw said. In mid-2022, Sperax’s developers will burn their admin keys and transfer governance rights to their token holders. Meaning that Steve Aoki and other SPA holders will have a say.  So too will Jump Capital. According to an October blog post from Sperax, the quietly massive crypto venture giant invested an undisclosed sum in SPA tokens.

The Merge itself will not be as initially glamorous as many market participants and outsiders may believe. However, the underlying improvements and the foundation it sets will allow Ethereum to onboard millions of users without sacrificing decentralization.  Lower energy consumption – Changing Ethereum’s consensus layer to proof-of-stake rids the network of miners and replaces them with validators. Under proof-of-work, Ethereum requires miners to compete for hash power by consuming electricity. By using randomness to assign block production, proof-of-stake is able to run with significantly lower energy consumption. The Ethereum Foundation predicts that after the Merge the network will use at least 99.95% less energy than it does in its current state.  Deflationary ether – An Ethereum research report modeled the impact the combination of EIP 1559 and proof-of-stake will have on ether’s circulating supply. The transaction fee burn combined with lower rewards and ether locked for validating will drive the circulating supply equilibrium down to between 27.3 and 49.5 million ETH. For comparison, the current supply is sitting at 118 million ETH and is still slightly inflationary after the addition of EIP 1559.  Same execution layer – Ethereum’s current execution layer will be ported over to the incoming proof-of-stake consensus layer and supported by the clients that are currently in charge of Eth1. For existing users and application developers, this means that interacting with Ethereum will remain incredibly similar post-Merge.  Increased/similar transaction fees – While impossible to predict, it is entirely possible that transaction fees will initially increase or remain the same post-Merge. Once Ethereum sheds the narrative that it consumes more energy than a moderately sized country, new users and entities may come onboard to use the technology and increase the current demand for blockspace. However, impending upgrades (such as sharding, rollups and calldata improvements) to the network after the Merge will focus on increasing scalability without sacrificing decentralization.  A road to decentralization and scalability – Running a validator on the Beacon Chain requires 32 ETH, an upfront investment of over $120,000 at current prices. While this is not a low barrier to entry, it still removes the economy of scale that exists in mining proof-of-work chains. By replacing hash power with randomness/statistics and keeping block size low, Ethereum enables any user with average hardware to profitably run an Ethereum validator. Additionally, under proof-of-stake, the Ethereum network will have the capability to implement sharding and other scalability focused upgrades that will lower transaction costs down the road.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week.

Validated takes  Teenage suspect wanted in Canada after hacking DeFi protocol Indexed Finance earlier in the year. BACKGROUND: The hacker known as “Andy” exploited $16 million using a flash loan in October. After his identity was discovered by the team at Indexed Finance, Andy vowed to fight with the argument “code is law” in court, but failed to appear this Tuesday. The trial will likely set a precedent for future DeFi exploits, which are currently semi-ungoverned.  B.Protocol raised $22 million to bring further efficiency to DeFi lending protocols by democratizing liquidations. BACKGROUND: B.Protocol allows users to provide “backstop” liquidity to decentralized lending services, in the event that loans become undercollateralized. The protocol further shows the potential for removing middlemen from finance, including centralized exchanges and market makers.  Gnosis created a beacon chain (GBC) to act as an Ethereum frontrunner before important updates on Eth2. BACKGROUND: The Gnosis Beacon Chain will allow Ethereum developers to see how future updates will affect the network in a “real-world value environment” as well as Ethereum’s test networks. The current Gnosis Chain was formerly known as xDAI and will be merged into the GBC in the coming months.  Blockbuster DAO is currently looking to raise capital to purchase Blockbuster from Dish Network and turn it into a decentralized streaming service. BACKGROUND: While Constitution DAO failed to win the bid for a copy of the U.S. Constitution, it likely paved the way for further crowdfunding and governance-backed acquisitions. Blockbuster DAO could be an interesting experiment in integrating aspects of decentralization into traditional finance, in what is essentially a form of a “people-owned” SPAC.

42375686,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9eRp,1640769785,Fantom Surges in Latest Layer 1 Bet,"Tokens of layer 1 blockchain Fantom (FTM) were among the few positive gainers in larger cap cryptocurrencies on Wednesday amid a slide in the broader market.  FTM prices have advanced 9% in the past 24 hours even as bitcoin, ether and others declined as much as 7%, data from analytics tool Messari showed. The Fantom tokens bounced from the $2 level on Tuesday morning to gain 30 cents on Wednesday.  Layer 1 blockchains refer to individual blockchain platforms such as Ethereum or Avalanche. Layer 2 networks are built on top of one of the layer 1 blockchains.  Prices are up nearly 77% in the past two weeks, data from CoinGecko show. The surge follows rising interest for layer 1 blockchains billed as Ethereum alternatives. Ethereum has been criticized for slow transaction times and fees that can reach as high as $100 during busy periods, making it an unusable network for the average, everyday user.  This has led to increased interest in alternatives such as Avalanche and Fantom. That has spurred gains in the prices of their native tokens and in the amount of value locked on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. DeFi products rely on smart contracts instead of third parties for offering financial services to users.  DeFi applications on Fantom locked over $5.6 billion as of Wednesday morning, according to data from analytics tool DeFi Llama. Nearly $1.2 billion was added since last week. The all-time high of $6.15 billion was hit in November.  Cross-chain router Multichain is the lending DeFi application on Fantom, locking up over $2.48 billion in value. Algorithmic stablecoin platform Tomb Finance and decentralized exchange SpookySwap are next on the list with slightly over $1 billion each in locked value.  Wednesday’s move in FTM follows gains for tokens of other layer 1 blockchains. A basket of three leading Ethereum competitors – Solana, Terra and Avalanche – dubbed the SoLunAvax trade – has gained 400% since May. Some high-profile funds, such as Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital, have even cut back from investing in the Ethereum ecosystem to fuel bigger bets on products building on Avalanche instead.",POSITIVE,FTM,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FTM | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/29/fantom-surges-as-investors-seach-for-next-layer-1-bet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2314b46a4f58d35572eba1e8ce70f4389b64783-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
