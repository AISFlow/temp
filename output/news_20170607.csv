42427612,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbxh,1496876575,Uniting Exponential Tech? Think Tank Event Heralds Blockchain's Bright Future,"The impact of bitcoin and blockchain technology was on full display at the opening session of Exponential Finance, a conference that kicked off today to examine the intersection of artificial intelligence, blockchain and any other technology that benefits directly from its own improvements.  The idea behind Exponential Finance, hosted in New York by Singularity University, is that some technologies can be classified as ""exponential"" because of the way they are able to grow and improve more rapidly over time.  Called ""exponential technology"", the power of these largely nascent fields was demonstrated by Singularity University vice president of strategic relations, Amin Toufani, who discussed everything from the ability of artificial intelligence to save lives to how a ""soft robot"" could some day keep a human heart beating forever.  But it was at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain where the professor who teaches what he calls ""x-conomics"" started to riff on the power of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Addressing a crowd of about 700 entrepreneurs, technologists and academics, Toufani described a future he sees where smart contracts executed on a blockchain clear up traffic jams and much more.  Toufani said:  ""What if your car offered some bitcoins to the car in front of you? And if and when the cars clear the lane the contract is settled? Enforcement is automatic, you do not need to trust the cars in front of you.""  Co-founded in 2008 by Ray Kurzweil, now Google’s director of engineering, and Peter Diamandis, founder and CEO of the XPrize, Singularity University's mission is to educate the world's leading thinkers on how technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchains can be used to solve humanity's challenges.  Since 2014, that work has included hosting the Exponential Finance conference, which views technology through a global lens, focusing on the kind of progress that might be enabled when the combined computing power of all humanity can be purchased in a cell phone for $1,000.  Focus on blockchain  Increasingly, blockchain has been taking center stage at Exponential Finance, though that may not be a surprise. Last year, Singularity University CEO Rob Nail explained to CoinDesk why he believes blockchain is a technology that's experiencing exponential growth.  But this year's event actually kicked off with a ""technology bootcamp"" designed to teach event attendees who come from a wide range of other industries how to accelerate the rate they integrate blockchain solutions into their products.  Throughout the three-day event, held at the Marriott Marquis hotel, other blockchain speakers on the agenda include Nuco CEO Matthew Spoke; Deloitte principal Eric Piscini; BitNation partner Toni Lane Casserly; vice chair of the board at Blockchain Canada, Anne Connelly; and DLT Education founder, Robert Schwentker.  With other events that cover energy, health and quantum computing, Singularity University professor Toufani argued that blockchain could end up being a financial layer that helps connect them all via increasingly sophisticated smart contracts.  ""To have a contract with someone, you need to trust them, and you need to have an enforcement mechanism,"" said Toufani.  He concluded:  ""Blockchain technology is showing us a path to where you can bypass both. Enforcement is automatic and your can trust you counterparty.""

42427597,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbbh,1496865005,New Hampshire Governor Signs Bitcoin MSB Exemption Into Law,"The governor of New Hampshire has signed a bill into law that exempts digital currency traders from the state's money transmission regulations.  Public records  show that Gov. Chris Sununu signed measure on 2nd June, more than a month after the state's legislature completed work on the bill. The measure was first introduced in January.  According to the text of the bill, the new rules exempt ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"" from the state's money transmitter regulations.  The bill is notable given that it enjoyed strong grassroots support in the state, yet its top regulators largely blasted it during public hearings. During a hearing in April, advocates strongly urged legislators to adopt the measure, while representatives from the state's Banking and Justice Departments called for it to be scuttled.  Divisions among state lawmakers on the bill could be seen during a vote in March, when it cleared the House of Representatives by a 185-170 margin. When the State Senate took up the measure in April, it passed by a 13-10 vote, public records show.  The newly-signed bill also stands out for what is effectively deregulation for the state's trader community, whereas other states have looked to beef up rules for those who engage in similar activities. As might be expected, the effort was cheered by community members who have called for fewer regulations for those who work with digital currencies like bitcoin.  The law goes into effect on 1st August.

42427592,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbRh,1496859348,UC Berkeley Partners With Blockchain Startup For Health Data Research,"The University of California, Berkeley is working with blockchain startup Bitmark on a pair of research studies focused on secure data sharing.  Centered on public health and medical information, the two research projects will be funded by Bitmark. The project comes months after Bitmark raised $1.7m in funding, drawn from a group that included Cherubic Ventures and Digital Currency Group, among others.  In one, study participants will contribute data about their diabetes remission using Bitmark's tech. A second study will focus on whether the availability of solutions based on the technology would encourage more involvement from test subjects that are contributing personal health data.  A statement from the school reads:  ""The School of Public Health at UC Berkeley is excited to partner with Bitmark Inc on this research fellowship. It is a great opportunity for our young researchers to gain valuable hands-on experience at the intersection of public health and technology.""  That UC Berkeley would undertake a pair of blockchain-based projects is perhaps unsurprising, as the school is home to a student-run organization centered on blockchain development.  However, the announcement comes amid an uptick in interest in blockchain technology at major universities, with some academics reporting that training students for opportunities in the sector is almost impossible given its rate of change.

42427593,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbTh,1496851854,Australia's Government Publishes Blockchain Research Studies,"The Australian government's top research agency has released twin reports focused on blockchain technology.  The two reports reflect the scope of research conducted by Data61, the innovation arm of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). One focuses on four possible scenarios for blockchain adoption in Australia, while the other centers around the opportunities and risks for the tech in several application areas, including government registries and agricultural supply chains.  Australia's government has taken a proactive stance toward the tech, issuing a broad-ranging policy statement last spring. Last month, the government made good on its promise to address a much-maligned tax issue around bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The government framed the release as a way to provide information to both public and private sector organizations that may be exploring or testing blockchain.  Australian treasurer Scott Morrison said of the release:  ""It will give decision makers in business and government guidance on matters they need to consider in developing a system that uses blockchain technology. The reports demonstrate the benefits of this technology could be profound – delivering productivity, security and efficiency gains.""  Data61 also made several recommendations to policymakers and regulators. Key among those: to ""implement technologically-neutral regulation and policy"", echoing calls from the industry for that approach.  The organization also called for more resources for research and development into blockchain, as well as ""indicative guidance on sufficient evidence for regulatory acceptance of blockchain-based system[s]"".

42427603,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbjh,1496846710,Montana Boosts Local Bitcoin Miner With $416k Grant,"In a US first, Montana's state government is providing public funds to a local bitcoin mining firm as part of a broader effort to fuel job creation.  Announced yesterday as part of a $1.1m local job aid package, a grant of $416,000 is being awarded to Missoula County to support a bitcoin mining firm called Project Spokane. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, while also securing the history of transactions.  The grant is drawn from a public aid program called the Big Sky Economic Development Trust Fund Program, aimed at supporting long-term job growth. Notably, it represents the first time that a US bitcoin miner has received state funding to support its operations.  According to statements from the office of Montana Governor Steve Bullock, 65 jobs will be supported by the grant.  The funds, the state government said in a release, will be used for the ""purchase of equipment, machinery, furniture and software and for wage reimbursement"".  ""As Montana's strong economy continues to grow, Main Street businesses in communities across the state are adding jobs and seeking a skilled workforce to fill them. These funds will help businesses plan for responsible growth and train employees for success,"" Governor Bullock said.

42427599,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbVh,1496842208,US Congressional Group Calls on IRS to Clarify Bitcoin Tax Guidance,"The leaders of a US Congress caucus focused on blockchain are calling for more guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding the tax requirements for digital currencies like bitcoin.  In a letter dated 2nd June and penned by Representatives Jared Polis and David Schweikert – co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus, a congressional group which was founded last autumn – the two called on the tax agency to ""issue additional guidance on the tax consequences and basic tax reporting requirements for transactions using virtual currencies"".  The letter invokes recommendations issued last November by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), which criticized the IRS for its lack of a comprehensive strategy around digital currencies. At the time, TIGTA said that the agency's shortcomings were leaving investors in the dark and increasing the risk of possible tax avoidance.  Polis and Schweikert encouraged the IRS to ""consider the recommendations of the TIGTA and take action based on those recommendations"". Notably, they urged the IRS to work with the digital currency space directly as it moves forward.  The co-chairs wrote:  ""Further, we encourage the IRS to engage with virtual currency exchanges to better understand their ability to engage in information reporting, including recordkeeping to track realized gain or loss and identify the amounts of virtual currency used in taxable transactions.""  This is the second letter sent to IRS from Congress in recent days on the subject of digital currencies. Late last month, a group including Senator Orin Hatch requested a response from the agency about its investigation into digital currency exchange Coinbase. That response is due today, though whether it has been formally delivered to Congress has not yet been announced.

42427610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbvh,1496838606,Chain is Now Working on Six 'Citi-Sized' Blockchain Networks,"Fresh off the news that Chain helped orchestrate a live blockchain integration that successfully connected Nasdaq's stock exchange and Citi's banking infrastructure, founder Adam Ludwin is revealing new details about the scope of his company’s as-yet-unannounced projects.  According to Ludwin, there are several other similar networks currently in the works behind the scenes at his company, which he reports has now grown to include roughly 30 full-time employees.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We are working on about a half a dozen networks right now. You don’t want to take on more than you can chew, and we think at our scale six feels right.""  Ludwin said the specific industries being served by the unannounced ""minimum viable networks,"" as he called them, include payments, capital markets, banking, insurance and supply chain.  While Ludwin said non-disclosure agreements prevent him from sharing details about the work, he added that the projects all tend to follow a similar structure as its previously announced Visa and Nasdaq networks, which were in large part guided by the infrastructure providers. Banks and other entities that are part of the various networks tend to be involved more as participants than as leaders, he said.  However, he distinguished the work with Nasdaq and Citi from some of the other stealth efforts, in that Citi actually wants the project to serve as a gateway of sorts to expand the network.  ""Citi intends to integrate with more over time,"" said Ludwin. ""We have not only the beginning of a network between Citi and Nasdaq, but also Citi-built capabilities which can connect to other networks over time.""  Startups within a startup  Founded in 2015, San Francisco-based Chain has so far raised $43.7m in venture capital from an impressive collection of over 20 different investors. And while Chain remains secretive about the other networks it's currently helping build, a trend has started to emerge where its investors end up also being clients.  In September 2015, all three of Chain’s public partners joined the startup’s blockchain working group and participated in the startup's $30m Series C investment.  Three other investors listed as partners in the original release – Capital One (valued at $38bn), Fiserv (valued at $27bn) and French telecom giant Orange (valued at €41bn) – joined the working group as well.  Both Orange and Capital One have announced blockchain projects in the healthcare space using unspecified technology. Fiserv seems more focused on payments according to its own announcements.  While Ludwig couldn't comment on which of the investors also had projects in the works with his company, he did say ""most of the projects under wraps are not investors in Chain"".  Speaking in more general terms, he explained why he believes working with organizations that already serve their own networks are more efficient than serving blockchain consortia formed specifically to capitalize on the technology.  ""These are big opportunities and given that each one of them requires building this minimum viable ecosystem to get them over the initial barriers,"" he said, concluding:  ""Each one is like a startup.""

42427613,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbzh,1496833887,Colu Open-Sources Protocol to Help Central Banks Issue Digital Currencies,"VC-backed startup Colu is open-sourcing its banking infrastructure known as Bankbox in an effort to remove the technical barriers and reduce costs for central banks that want to issue digital currencies.  The Israeli firm’s technology was previously based on the bitcoin blockchain, but the company is overhauling its approach for its Colored Coins initiative, evolving into a more blockchain-agnostic platform.  Mark Smargon, vice-president of blockchain and co-founder of Colu, told CoinDesk he envisions a world of multiple ledgers for different use cases. He described Bankbox as a ""business logic layer that’s capable of plugging into several different blockchains"".  Specifically, Bankbox lets digital currency issuers and custodians issue currencies, verify asset credentials, track assets and fund wallets.  Smargon said:  ""What we decided to do is take in everything we’ve built in the back-end, open-source it and really focus – not on the ease of issuance, which is already a good tool we have – but on installing a node and running a node.""  To help enable that functionality, issuers and custodians will now be able to handle customer funds on an external, shared ledger that has been cryptographically signed by the customer, providing proof of identity to regulators.  Colu's open-sourcing of the protocol is part of a growing industry trend which aims to increase adoption among digital currency issuers by making blockchains more accessible to traditional banking institutions.  Central bank adoption  Also announced today, Colu, which has raised $12.1m in venture capital, revealed Bankbox already has a central bank user.  Barbados-based digital asset exchange Bitt is deploying Bankbox for the issuance of a digital Barbadian dollar on the bitcoin blockchain, partnering with the Barbadian central bank to do so.  ""[Bitt] uses the protocol to provide the regulatory proof of how much currency they issue to the regulator. The currency is tracked on the blockchain so you can have a proof of reserve,"" explained Smargon.  The broader protocol would allow central banks to carry out their monetary policies more effectively, he said, adding:  ""You can, in the future, provide a proof of solvency, you can allow different central banks to interact with each other.""  Colu also announced partnerships with asset brokerage firm eToro and asset trading app Lykke, though there are no specifics on how they'll be deploying the protocol just yet.  Those partnerships align with Colu's aim of fostering a wider community of developers working on Colored Coins with greater peer review, Smargon said. In addition to joining Hyperledger, the firm is currently reviewing other solutions including JPMorgan's Quorum and R3's Corda.  He concluded:  ""We’re very interested in how we can move value from private to public ledgers. In our view public and private ledgers are not mutually exclusive.""

42427598,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbXh,1496830897,Western Union Reveals Pilot Coinbase Integration,"It’s not every day you get to hear from the CTO of a financial incumbent who has actually mined bitcoin.  So, interest was high as David Thompson of global remittance giant Western Union took the stage at MoneyConf 2017 in Madrid, Spain. And he did not disappoint, facing the digital currency issue head on.  “Customers have been asking us if digital currency is going to wipe out the remittance business,"" he said.  According to the CTO, the answer is no. Thompson revealed cash-based transactions are on the rise in many of Western Union’s developing country markets. And anyway, he added, “the regulators are really pushing back on digital currencies because of the anonymity.”  It may come as a surprise, therefore, that Western Union is trialing an integration with digital currency exchange Coinbase, in which Western Union will appear within the web app of the exchange.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Thompson revealed that the project entered into development last fall, and is currently being piloted with Western Union employees. No launch date has been set, but an announcement could be forthcoming.  Thompson stressed, however, that it will not be for digital currency transactions, but instead, on the back-end for fiat transfers.  He said:  ""Until digital currencies become regulated and integrated into the law, we are not going to include that on the platform. Our regulators are quite direct with us; it’s not something they are [allowing us] to enable.""  Thompson went on to detail other blockchain developments the remittance company is working on.  After a planned pilot with Ripple a few years ago failed to materialize (there was apparently not broad enough adoption among banks), the team has continued to investigate possible use cases for the technology. One that's compelling is using blockchain to standardize bank integrations (Western Union's app currently integrates with about 2 billion bank accounts), Thompson said.  But, perhaps one of the use cases with the most immediate effect on Western Union's bottom line is blockchain's possible role in streamlining compliance. Thompson revealed that Western Union is working on a blockchain-based know-your-customer (KYC) compliance pilot, focusing on bringing down its hefty compliance costs, which currently reach approximately $240m a year.  In addition, Thompson said, Western Union is investigating how the technology can be leveraged for real-time settlement, integrated smart contracts for import/export transactions and alternative payment types. Could the alternative payment types one day include digital currencies? Thompson conceded that may happen “over time as changes are made in regulation around the world”.  While non-committal, Western Union does appear to be getting ready for that day.  And as digital currency regulation advances, and assuming the integration goes smoothly with Coinbase's platform, the remittance company will be in a strong position to bridge the gap between incumbent financial services and alternative stores of value.
