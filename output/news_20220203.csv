13401073,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=226813,1643931052,What is Blockchain Technology’s Role in Data Security for Consumers?,"One of the most significant technological advancements of the century is Blockchain. It enables firms to remain competitive without relying on the trust of a third party. Customers can now disrupt business services and solutions by using blockchain technology. As global services in a variety of fields expand, this technology will emerge as the front-runner. Additionally, blockchain secures all types of data, not only financial data. Data protection for individuals and consumers is of the highest priority when it comes to blockchain. What Role Does Blockchain Play in Achieving this? Below are some of the ways in which blockchain plays a crucial role in Data Security for customers. Encryption Everything can be handled with blockchain technology, which ensures that data is never tampered with. Because blockchain is by its very nature encrypted, it can provide adequate validation. Smart contracts can be used with Blockchain to ensure that specific validation occurs when certain circumstances are met. When someone modifies data, it is verified by all ledgers on all network nodes. The data&apos;s integrity is preserved this way, and it can be updated as needed. Defend Against Attacks When it comes to blockchain, it&apos;s nearly impossible to hack or assault. Blockchain data can be trusted since it is decentralized, encrypted, and cross-checked. Hacking the majority of nodes on the blockchain at the same time is challenging due to the densely...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/what-is-blockchain-technologys-role-in-data-security-for-consumers/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42416775,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY9qv,1643930731,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Is Flat in Muted Trading; Ether Declines,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin remained largely flat, while its spot volume reduced further.  Technician's take: BTC buyers have consistently lost ground to sellers.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $37,004 -.03%  Ether (ETH): $2,666 -1%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP +8.3% Computing`  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −9.8% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −7.8% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT −7.3% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: 4,477 -2.4%  DJIA: 35,111 -1.1%  Nasdaq: 18,878 -3.7%  Gold: $1,806 -0.1%  Market moves  Bitcoin 's (BTC) price late Thursday was roughly flat after dipping in earlier in the day, while spot trading volume remained muted.  After a more than 4% drop on Wednesday, bitcoin’s selling pressure was mostly gone during U.S. trading hours on Thursday despite the continued price plunge of Meta Platforms' shares following the former Facebook’s disappointing earnings results and outlook. A sell-off on tech stocks also eased during late trading after shares of Amazon.com and Snap soared on their quarterly results.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was changing hands at $37,000, roughly where it was 24 hours earlier, according to CoinDesk data. Bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges continued to drop from a day ago.  The reduced spot trading volume has been a trend in crypto for most of January, according to data provider CryptoCompare. January’s spot trading volume for the crypto market across major exchanges reached their lowest level since December 2020, CryptoCompare wrote in a report published on Feb 3.  In the broader cryptocurrency market, most of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) were also in red on Thursday. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at about $2,660, down approximately 1% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Capped Below $40K Resistance; Support at $35K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers and sellers are at a stalemate, evidenced by low trading volume and muted price action over the past few days.  The cryptocurrency is trading in a tight range between $35,000 support and $38,000-$40,000 resistance. Most technical indicators are neutral, which means BTC could remain in a narrow price range going into the Asia trading day.  Buyers have consistently lost ground to sellers given the persistent downtrend since November. Based on the overwhelming selling pressure, the downward-sloping 100-day moving average on the four-hour chart has been a useful gauge of downtrend resistance.  Still, initial support at $35,000 could stabilize the current pullback. Stronger support is seen around $30,000, a critical price zone that could determine a shift from a bullish to bearish price trend.

42416771,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY9e5,1643930033,Sphere 3D to Buy 60K NuMiner Machines for $1.7B,"Sphere 3D (ANY), the data management firm that is merging with bitcoin miner Gryphon Digital Mining in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction, has agreed to purchase 60,000 of NuMiner Technologies' high-end NM440 machines for $1.7 billion.  Sphere 3D will fund the deal with about $400 million of capital stock, $29 million in cash, up to $1.1 billion in vendor purchase financing and up to $185 million in additional milestone payments, according to a statement.  Shares of Sphere 3D were rising 25% in post-market trading on Thursday after the announcement of the deal.  NuMiner said that its NM440 mining computers have 440 terahash per second (TH/s) of mining power and power efficiency of 20.2 joules per terahash (J/TH), according to a separate statement. That makes the mining rigs the most powerful and efficient mining machines on the market. In comparison, Bitmain’s most recent offering, the Antminer S19 Pro+ Hyd., has a hashrate of 198 TH/s and efficiency of 27.5 (J/TH).  “The NM440 boasts a 440 TH/s processing hash rate, more than 8x the average bitcoin miner, with ~75% less energy usage, as substantiated by leading third-party testing company TÜV Nord’s certified lab BTL,” said Anthony Melman, chairman of NuMiner’s global board of directors. Melman was also appointed to Sphere 3D’s board, effective March.  Sphere 3D is paying about $28,000 for each machine. The miners are being produced in coordination with technology suppliers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Foxconn and Xilinx, according to NuMiner’s statement. Deliveries will start in the second quarter.  Sphere 3D said that the deal puts it on pace to be one of the “largest carbon neutral bitcoin miners,” as contracted deliveries of all the miners would represent a total hashrate of 32.4 exahash per second (EH/s) if fully deployed today. The Bitcoin network’s total hashrate was about 202 EH/s as of Wednesday, according to data analytics firm Glassnode.  By comparison, Marathon Digital, one of the world's largest publicly traded miners, said on Jan. 3 that its computing hashrate was 3.5 EH/s and that it planned to increase that figure to 23.3 EH/s by early 2023.

42416773,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY9ni,1643927483,Who’s Using the Metaverse? Poker Players in Decentraland,"In a metaverse often criticized for being devoid of things to do, the poker tables in Decentraland’s ICE Poker virtual casino have never been busier.  The play-to-earn poker platform from Decentral Games is host to around 6,000 unique players each day, which makes up more than 30% of Decentraland's daily users. In the past three months, the game has generated more than $7.5 million in revenue through its various income streams, according to Decentral Games founder Miles Anthony.  “At any given time, we have over 1,000 players playing poker,” Anthony told CoinDesk in an interview. “It doesn't sound like a lot of users, but when it comes to the open metaverse, it's pretty substantial considering the main issue right now with metaverses is that they’re empty.”  For as much press as “Web 3” is garnering, it’s important to remember the numbers are still small. The number of wallets (the pseudonymous, but not exactly precise, measure of actual humans interacting with Ethereum-based smart contracts) touching OpenSea on a daily basis is just 50,000, according to DappRadar. The non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace was valued at $13.3 billion in a funding round last month.  Read more: This Casino in Decentraland Is Hiring (for Real)  Decentral Games bet big on the metaverse a year and a half ago when it started acquiring virtual land in Decentraland. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) says it’s accumulated more than 1,000 of the game’s parcels to date. That effort was backed in part by an investment from Decentraland itself in September.  The success of Decentral Games’ ICE Poker should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with online gambling platforms, which have been a hit among virtual communities for decades.  Anthony says the platform sees itself as the genre’s Web 3 iteration, requiring users to purchase one of its NFT wearables before being able to win actual coin. The casino issued two separate tokens – ICE and DG – to support its Vegas-esque ecosystem.  The wearables, sold in drops on the platform in limited supply, already fetch high prices on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea, holding onto a floor price of 2.46 ETH (around $6,500) at the time of writing.  With a high-priced point of entry, guilds have become a core aspect of the game’s ecosystem, Anthony said. He says the game has intentionally avoided relying on mega guilds like YGG for accessibility. Gaming guilds typically rent out key crypto assets for a share of future profits from retail users.  “To be 100% honest, I actually think large guilds are really detrimental to game economies,” Anthony told CoinDesk. “Obviously, the valuations for [guilds] have been pretty wild. And it can be great for even the short term, but I think a lot of these deals kind of overlook long-term effects.”  Read more: Crypto VCs Are Making a Big Bet on Gaming Guilds. Why?  Anthony says the platform solves this problem with a built-in delegation system, where players can loan an NFT wearable to another user in exchange for a 60-40 share of any revenue earned with it. Users who delegate just a single NFT make up the majority of the platform's lenders.  Despite the enormous hype around the future of the metaverse in recent months, few poker platforms have been able to successfully enter the space, in part because of regulation.  Virtue Gaming became the first play-to-earn poker platform with a Malta Gaming Authority license in December, though its platform differs from ICE Poker’s in that it makes money off traditional casino mechanics rather than from tokenization.  Anthony said Decentral Games is also preparing to launch a mobile iteration of ICE Poker in the coming months.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MANA | MARKET,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/03/whos-using-the-metaverse-poker-players-in-decentraland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45f3680bc18f2d5e340aec9bab2b9638772f717c-1965x1071.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394558,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBk6t,1643926440,5 Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake: An In-Depth Guide,"Despite the crypto market’s wild volatility, holding cryptocurrency long term has proven to be an effective trading strategy when it comes to making a return on investment. According to Lookintobitcoin data, holding bitcoin has been profitable for 3,825of its 4,377-day lifespan (87.4%) – hard to believe, but true.  While some capitalize on market volatility by actively trading crypto, many are simply looking for a more hands-off way to grow their portfolio. Among the options available, staking assets is considered one of the top ways to earn passive income for crypto holders.  What you need to know  Before you get started, it’s important to note that staking can be done only with certain cryptocurrencies whose blockchains use the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This system selects transaction validators – people who voluntarily help add new data to the blockchain – based on the number of coins they lock up as opposed to how many mining machines they possess (known as proof-of-work, which is used by the likes of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin).  The proof-of-stake method offers faster transaction speeds and is easier to use, and it also has a much lower impact on the environment compared with proof-of-work-based assets – something that’s becoming increasingly more desirable as nations around the world tackle climate change.  So, if you’re interested in learning how to stake your assets to earn a passive income, here is everything you need to know about leading PoS cryptocurrencies you can start staking today.  Solana (SOL)  Solana (SOL) is a blockchain-based smart contracts platform specifically designed for deploying decentralized applications (dapps). Solana’s native SOL cryptocurrency is a stakable token that is used to facilitate on-chain transactions and pay for network fees.  Solana's staking requirements  Solana staking rewards can be earned by users participating in the network as validators or delegated stakers. Validators are responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the Solana network. Delegated stakers are SOL holders who delegate their tokens to stake pool operators for staking rewards using Solana wallets like Phantom.  Validators are required to run and maintain a validation node (called a “Cluster”), which requires consistent uptime and hardware with sufficient specs. Solana implements slashing, which occurs when validators act maliciously or suffer poor performance. To offset the costs associated with maintaining a cluster, validators can collect commission fees from delegators.  A full guide on how to stake SOL tokens can be found here.  Solana blockchain breakdown  Solana is unique from other notable PoS blockchains because it uses a timestamping system known as a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus. By combining PoS and PoH, Solana is able to clock an incredibly fast block time of 400 milliseconds. By comparison, Cardano’s block time is 20 seconds, and Ethereum produces a new block every 13 seconds.  SOL’s yearly inflation rate started at 8%, but is decreasing by 15% every year until it hits a rate of 1.5%. SOL added into the ecosystem through Solana’s inflation schedule is distributed to delegated stakers and validators every epoch (two days).  How profitable is Solana staking?  The rewards structure for validators and delegators on Solana is mutually aligned. Validators with more SOL delegated receive more opportunities to record transactions on the blockchain, which provides more rewards for both the validator and delegator. In turn, validators may reduce their commissions earned from delegators in order to stay more competitive against other validators. Further, both validators and delegators are affected by slashing, which gives delegators an incentive to stake with the best-performing validators.  Both validators and delegator staking rewards depend on Solana’s adjusted staking yield. Under the staking dilution structure, staking rewards are dynamic and change relative to the amount of tokens staked out of the total current supply of SOL.  According to Staking Rewards, the current annual percentage yield (APY) for delegated staking is around 5.28%. Assuming you are staking 1,000 SOL, you would earn around 52.8 SOL next year. Based on SOL’s 52-week high of $259.99, you would be staking $25,999 for an annual profit of $2,129.32.  Cardano (ADA)  Cardano (ADA) is regarded as a “third-generation” blockchain platform and is designed for building and running smart contracts. ADA, the native cryptocurrency of Cardano, is a staking token that is used to incentivize network security and facilitate transactions on the network.  Cardano staking requirements  Staking rewards on Cardano can be earned through stake delegation and running a stake pool. Stake delegation lets ADA holders delegate their ADA into staking pools and doesn’t require network participation like running a node or any specific hardware. ADA holders looking to stake their tokens can get started with staking pools using IOG’s Daedalus wallet or Emurgo’s Yoroi wallet.  Stake pools are run by stake pool operators. Those are individuals who can run a network node with consistent uptime in order to keep the network secure. The Cardano network uses game theory to determine which stake pool will create the next block on the chain where the probability of getting selected as a ""slot leader"" increases by the total amount of ADA staked. Every time a pool is selected as slot leader and validates a transaction block, it receives a reward that is distributed among stake delegators. Time is divided into five-day sections called “epochs,” where each epoch contains 420,000 one-second “slots.""  Read more: How to Stake Cardano (ADA)  Staking rewards are distributed to stake delegators at the end of each epoch and are equally distributed based on the delegator’s total ADA staked 25 days before the end of the cycle.  Cardano blockchain breakdown  Staking ADA is possible through its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. It can handle around 250 transactions per second (tps), though IOG has claimed its new Hydra layer-2 scaling protocol could boost that number to one million tps.  How profitable is Cardano staking?  Cardano offers a staking reward calculator on its website to provide users with an estimate of how much staking rewards they can expect for delegating or running a staking pool. According to its calculations, a delegate staking 1,000 ADA would earn 46.08 ADA (4.61% APY), while a delegate running a stake pool could earn up to 77,185.05 ADA (7,718.51% APY).  At ADA’s 52-week high of $3.20, this translates to around $147.46 for delegating and $254,710.67 for running a staking pool. Overall, Cardano staking can be very profitable for those who are able to run a staking pool and can keep pool-related fees well managed. It's recommended users should check stake pools regularly and move funds around to ensure they are getting the best possible rates.  Polkadot (DOT)  Polkadot (DOT) is a blockchain interoperability protocol that connects several different chains together in a single network, allowing parallel transaction processing and exchanges of data between different chains. DOT, the native cryptocurrency of Polkadot, is primarily used for governance, staking and connecting to new “parachains.”  Polkadot staking requirements  Polkadot uses a nominated a proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus algorithm, letting users earn staking rewards as a validator or a nominator. Validators are responsible for validating transactions on the Polkadot network, while nominators ensure that validators are behaving appropriately.  Slashing occurs if a validator acts maliciously and causes both validators and their nominators to lose a percentage of their staked DOT. This is carried out automatically by smart contracts coded into the protocol.  Nominators have less responsibility than validators do, and becoming a nominator has fewer requirements to get started. There isn’t a minimum requirement for staked DOT for nominators, and there’s no need to run a node or use specific hardware. But because the network is limited to a maximum of 22,500 nominators, there is an implied minimum of about 120 DOT in order to nominate.  Earning staking rewards as a validator is a bit more complex. The total DOT required to become a validator varies and requires about 350 DOT to get going. Validators must also run a node, which typically requires launching a cloud server on Linux. To do that, it's suggested that your computer should have an Intel Core i7 CPU @ 4.20 GHz or better, 80 to 160 gigabytes of solid-state storage and at least 64 gigabytes error correcting code (ECC) of memory.  Staking rewards for DOT start to accumulate at the start of a new era, or 24-hour period. At the end of each era, your payouts from the previous era are available to claim. Usually, a validator or nominator will claim the staking rewards, which will cause all payouts to be distributed to everyone else automatically. Both validators and nominators can claim their staking rewards via the Polkadot JS wallet or through Ledger.  A full guide on how to stake DOT can be found here.  Polkadot blockchain breakdown  There is no upper limit on Polkadot’s maximum supply. New dot tokens are released into circulation in perpetuity, at a stable annual inflation rate of 10%.  Inside each 24-hour Era there are six four-hour windows called “epochs.” Each epoch consists of 2,400 six-second time periods called “slots.” One block is produced roughly every slot, though some slots can pass without a block being produced.  How profitable is Polkadot staking?  Nominators profitability depends on the validator. Validators can charge commissions for staking rewards, which is subject to change at any time. Further, only a validator’s top 256 nominators get paid out at the end of each era. Regardless of the total amount of DOT staked with a validator, nominators all split staking rewards equally.  According to Hodlpolkadot, the average APY for a nominator in the top 256 is around 13.5%. Assuming you are staking the minimum 120 DOT, you would earn around 16.2 DOT over the next year. Based on DOT’s 52-week high of $55, that would hypothetically translate to staking $6,600 for a yearly profit of $891.  All validators split payouts equally, although they can vary slightly based on era points. Era points are rewards paid out every era for completing certain positive actions on the blockchain, such as issuing valid statements for parachain blocks. Validators can receive additional rewards via tips from users transacting DOT. One hundred percent of the tips go to validators and are used as an incentive for validators to prioritize certain transactions.  According to Polkadex, validators receive an APY of 112%. Additionally, validators receive a commission from the platform's nominators. Let's say you are running a validator that qualifies for Polkadot’s Thousand Validators Program, which requires 5,000 DOT staked and a maximum commission of 3%. Not including additional staking rewards from era points, you would receive 5,600 DOT from self-staking and 124.41 DOT from nominator commissions for a total of 5,724.41 DOT. With the price at the 52-week high, running a validator would require you to stake $275,000 and would yield a return of $314,842.55 in a year.  Ethereum 2.0 (ETH)  Ethereum 2.0 is the long-awaited upgrade to the Ethereum protocol that will see the transition of Ethereum’s consensus algorithm from PoW to PoS. Among other benefits of the network upgrade, such as faster transaction speeds, Ethereum 2.0 will make mining available to ETH holders.  Read More: What is The Merge?  Ethereum staking requirements  In order to get started with Ethereum staking, a validator needs to lock up a minimum of 32 ETH into the official deposit contract address (see below). While Ethereum staking pools exist to give you the opportunity to stake without 32 ETH, Ethereum 2.0 doesn't permit delegation. In addition to the minimum ETH requirement, Ethereum staking requires you to run specific software to access the network known as a node client to verify transactions on the blockchain.  With its move to a PoS protocol, Ethereum 2.0 will have a much lower barrier to entry for mining. Prior to the update, significant upfront investments in hardware were required to participate in mining. With the switch from PoW, prospective miners will no longer need to purchase graphics cards and run up a high energy bill.  A full guide on how to stake Ethereum can be found here.  Ethereum blockchain breakdown  The new upgrade of Ethereum – which is no longer called Ethereum 2.0 – will see improvements to the blockchain and its validation time in addition to its switch to PoS. Ethereum’s speed will improve from 24 tps to speeds potentially as high as 100,000 tps.  This massive increase in speed will be made possible as Ethereum introduces sharding, or the breaking up of the blockchain into several (64 in the case of Ethereum) different shards. Validators can run their own shards, spreading out the requests for validation and improving the workload for validator’s devices.  How profitable is Ethereum staking?  Ethereum 2.0 staking rewards vary and depend on the total amount of ETH staked. When there is more ETH staked, rewards are reduced and vice versa. Additionally, staking ETH also gives participants network rewards, which are a portion of daily transaction fees.  The current annual percentage rate (APR) for staking on Ethereum 2.0 is 5%. If you were holding the minimum 32 ETH to run a validator, you would see a return of 1.6 ETH at the end of the year. At ether's 52-week high, that would hypothetically result in a gain of $7,826.72.  Tezos (XTZ)  XTZ is the native cryptocurrency of Tezos, which is an open-source smart contract platform used to issue new digital assets and create dapps. XTZ fuels the Tezos platform and enables holders to participate in voting on Tezos protocol proposals.  Tezos staking requirements  Holders of XTZ can commit their tokens in exchange for the ability to validate blocks, winning rewards for doing so in a process known as “baking.” Participants who stake at least 8,000 tokens on the network also get voting rights, which allows them to weigh in on the project’s governance. Unlike traditional PoS platforms, Tezos lets holders delegate their XTZ to “bakers,” which enables users to participate in on-chain governance without the required 8,000 tokens.  Tezos blockchain breakdown  It takes about five weeks in order to start receiving rewards for staking. That's because you must first wait 21 days (seven cycles) in order for your XTZ to become eligible for rewards. After your XTZ becomes eligible for rewards, you need to wait an additional 15 days (five cycles) for the rewards to be paid out. After you have waited for a total of 12 cycles, staking rewards will be paid out once every three days (one cycle).  How profitable is Tezos staking?  Baking profitability can be different depending on whether you are a solo baker or are delegating your rewards. Solo bakers can earn 16 XTZ for every block baked in the system, or an 8% APY. Endorsers (network participants who validate the blocks created by bakers) are randomly selected to verify the last baked block and can receive an endorsement reward of up to two XTZ per verification.  For delegation, the current APY is about 6%, less the total fee charged by the validator. For example, Tezos staking is made available on Coinbase, which requires only a minimum balance of 0.0001 XTZ and an APY of nearly 5%.

42416777,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulY9u8,1643923532,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Range-Bound as Altcoins Underperform,"Bitcoin was stuck in a narrow range of between $36,000 and $37,000 on Thursday as some analysts remain cautious on speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies, while macroeconomic risks continue to linger.  Recent price jumps in both crypto and equities have stalled, while oil prices approached six-year highs on Thursday. Choppy trading conditions may reflect uncertainty among investors, many of whom typically rotate into less volatile assets during the early phases of a tightening cycle (rising interest rates).  And the threat of rising inflation could force central banks to drain liquidity from financial markets, which has underpinned the rise in stocks and cryptos over the past year.  ""We expect that inflation will continue to surprise the Fed on the upside, especially next year and beyond, when inflation is likely to trend above 3% for some time instead of easing toward 2% as the Fed expects to achieve with its benign policy hiking cycle,"" Prajakta Bhide, a strategist at MRB Partners, wrote in a Thursday briefing.  Similar to equities, crypto markets have also shifted from risk-on to risk-off over the past two weeks. Traders typically overweight bitcoin because of its lower risk profile relative to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). And on Thursday, altcoins underperformed, suggesting that some crypto bulls remain on the sidelines.

Ether options volume rise  Deribit, the biggest crypto options exchange, wrote in its newsletter to investors Thursday that the volume of option trades on its platform in ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, rose 36% in January from December. For bitcoin options, volume rose 10% during the same period.  The increased volume was partly due to trading strategies around the price drop in January. Despite the significant number of transactions, lower underlying price levels made total volumes measured in U.S. dollars slightly lower than last month.  Altcoin roundup  Blockchain bridge Wormhole hacked and backed by parent company: On Wednesday night, the Wormhole bridge suffered an exploit to its Solana-Ethereum bridge, with an attacker fraudulently minting 120,000 ether worth over $320 million.

What Happens Below $35,511 Technical analyst Mark Newton has put forward a bullish outlook for bitcoin if it falls below this point.

42394312,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWAn,1643919746,Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error,"Yesterday, beginning at 18:24 UTC, someone or something exploited a security vulnerability on Wormhole, a tool that allows users to swap assets between Ethereum and a number of blockchains, resulting in the loss of 120,000 wrapped ether (or wETH, worth about $321 million) on the platform.  This is the second largest decentralized finance (DeFi) attack to date, according to rekt’s leaderboard, in an industry where security exploits are fairly common and part of users’ risk curve. There’s a whole business made out of code reviews, a lexicon of industry-specific jargon to explain what’s going on and something of a playbook to follow if and when “hacks” inevitably occur.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Wormhole, apart from catching and patching this bug earlier, has seemingly tried to do the right thing: They shut down the platform to prevent further losses, notified the public of what they know and announced Jump Trading is on the line to replenish the stolen coins.  Read more: Blockchain Bridge Wormhole Suffers Possible Exploit Worth Over $326M  Furthermore, in a move that’s becoming increasingly common, the Wormhole Deployer has posted an open message to the exploiter on Ethereum offering them a “white hat agreement” and $10 million for an explanation of the attack in exchange for the stolen funds.  Excuse the simile, but this is like waiting for a magician to pull a rabbit from a top hat. The world is waiting to see whether they’re dealing with a “white” or “black” hat hacker, terms meant to explain a hacker’s motivations. The reality is likely to be a little more gray.  Hacks vs. exploits  “Black hat hackers are criminals who break into computer networks with malicious intent,” according to Kaspersky security experts. They may use malware, steal passwords or exploit code as it’s written for “self-serving” or maybe “ideological” reasons. White hats, aka “ethical hackers” or “good hackers,” are the “antithesis.”“They exploit computer systems or networks to identify their security flaws so they can make recommendations for improvement,” Kaspersky writes.  Due to the way crypto networks are designed, it’s often unclear who it is you’re dealing with. Users exist as long strings of alphanumeric gibberish, and their past is reduced to a series of transactions connected with their address.  This system has some benefits. Even if platforms don’t “know” their “customers,” all transactions are recorded on-chain and anyone can “verify” which coins belong to whom. DeFi exploits are often dead ends: Exchanges, used as on and off-ramps to and from the crypto economy, can blacklist stolen funds, reducing those token’s utility and value to nothing.  That may explain why some of the most prominent exploits see masterminds return their bounties. For instance, last August, the Poly Network “hacker,” as they came to be referred to, returned nearly all of the $610 million worth of stolen crypto assets, and asked for people to see their exploit as a “white hat hack,” meant to bring awareness to a disastrous bug.  This might be rewriting history – a post hoc explanation for an attack that was ultimately poorly executed? It might be happening again: We don’t know the Wormhole exploiter’s motivations, but the bridge’s team seems to be asking that they eat the bug in exchange for a tidy $10 million.  In a sense, the system is set up in an attacker’s favor. When someone uses the code as it’s written, but not as intended, technologists will refer to that as an “exploit.” Code is given precedence above human action, so that human errors – like fat fingering a bad transaction or missing a gaping security hole – are explained as a natural process of the code.  An attack is only elevated to the level of a “hack” when the code is rewritten or broken. This is an important technological distinction, even though the terms likely stem from the gaming industry where “hacking” a game to gain an unfair advantage is often frowned upon whereas “exploits,” or finding loopholes in the game, are boasted about.  It’s probably fair to say this recent attack wasn’t part of the Wormhole Deployer’s plans or motivations. A mistake in the code was seemingly made, or not found, and solutions are being worked out. It might point to the “fundamental security limits of bridges,” as Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin noted in a prescient blog posting a few weeks ago.  The attacker conducted a series of transactions so that Wormhole “smart contract” confused falsely minted wETH will the real stuff – a full breakdown here. It was a loophole that someone with deep knowledge and a lot of time was able to exploit.  Some people will consider this attack as a contribution to the overall body of knowledge about crypto. Some have even said this process may ultimately lead to “unhackable code,” as every smart contract is a potential “million-dollar bug bounty.”  So, it’s worth asking if the language crypto uses to explain its myriad vulnerabilities (risks stacked on risks) contributes to the ongoing business made out of hacks.

The Boston Fed and MIT have been jointly researching CBDCs for nearly two years, after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard – who was recently nominated to be the Fed’s vice chair – announced the Boston branch of the U.S. central bank was investigating blockchain and a digital dollar. Thursday’s publication brings the central bank one step closer to a technical framework that could support a U.S. CBDC.  Boston Fed Executive Vice President Jim Cunha – who was then a senior vice president – told CoinDesk at the time that the branch was looking at technical issues in CBDC development, including whether distributed ledger technologies could even support a digital dollar.  “I would think we're probably looking at 30 to 40 different either open-source or private solutions at a very high level first, and then doing a deeper dive into a few of them because we're in the early stages of this, and we want to make sure we have the broadest view possible,” Cunha said in 2020.  Thursday’s publication, which includes OpenCBDC and a research paper, explain that the Boston Fed was able to develop “a core processing engine” for a general purpose CBDC that could support nearly two million transactions per second with high-speed settlement finality.  Project Hamilton, as the research effort was known, is now public for any contributors.  In a statement, Cunha said the research created a “scalable CBDC research model” that can help developers better understand “these technologies and the choices that should be considered when designing a CBDC.”  According to the white paper, developing OpenCDBC was only the first phase of the project. Phase two will test the different designs and features not included in phase one, as well as assess what, if any, trade-offs there might be with different sets of features.  Privacy and interoperability are two of the issues to be analyzed in phase two.  The Boston Fed’s research comes weeks after the Federal Reserve published its own white paper addressing policy questions raised by CBDCs and their use cases.  Privacy and financial stability risks were two key issues raised by the policy paper. The Fed also said it would want an explicit law from Congress authorizing it to issue a CBDC before it considers adopting or creating one as well.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/03/boston-fed-mit-publish-open-source-cbdc-software,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8f6cbcd7a250875adf95e93c6d3dd26c439ca73-2400x1799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act"" – an amendment to the Internal Revenue Service's tax code announced on Thursday by Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) – would simplify tax burdens on daily crypto users who must now report even the smallest capital gains.  “Virtual currency has evolved rapidly in the past few years with more opportunities to use it in our everyday lives,” DelBene said in the announcement. “The U.S. must stay on top of these changes and ensure that our tax code evolves with our use of virtual currency.”  The lawmakers last introduced the legislation as the “The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020” in January 2021. Consumers must now report changes in a cryptocurrency’s value in dollars from when they purchased the crypto to when it was used in a transaction, including even minor retail purchases.  If it becomes law, the legislation would retroactively apply to all qualifying transactions from Dec. 31, 2021.  Jerry Brito, executive director of the crypto think tank Coin Center, which has lobbied for the bill, said the legislation would ""relieve users from having to keep track of small personal transactions ... Not only will this create a level playing field for digital currencies, it will also help unleash innovation on applications like micropayments, which can consist of dozens of transactions per minute and thus are difficult to square with the current law.""

42394329,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbXKb,1643912313,"Kanye West, NFTs and 'Building Real Products in the Real World'","Earlier this week, the American rapper and entrepreneur Kanye West implored people to stop asking him to do a “f***ing NFT.” There was something cathartic about reading his words, written by hand in black marker on a physical sheet of paper. “My focus is on building real products in the real world,” he said.  Both the note and the caption of the photo were written in all caps, as if to convey an outburst of exasperation. The post suggested that he has been inundated with requests from agents, hucksters, companies, shills and fans to create or promote non-fungible token projects. With more and more celebrities sharing hollow endorsements for NFTs that appear to be thinly veiled paid advertisements or money-grabs, it seems likely West has been dealing with a deluge of petitions to get involved in this nascent market. His statement is particularly refreshing to read because of this context: it stands in contrast to all of the public figures promoting crypto products they seem to otherwise know or care little about.  Jill Gunter, a CoinDesk columnist, is a venture partner with Slow Ventures, where she invests in early-stage crypto and Web 3 projects. She is also a co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system.  Even those stars who are educated and coherent about crypto and do seem genuinely passionate about the promise of Web 3 – Paris Hilton, for example – still struggle to tie NFTs back to the “real world.” Her recent appearance on the “Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” alongside her Bored Ape NFT, has gone viral over the last couple of weeks for the awkwardness and disingenuousness with which she and Jimmy fawn over how “cool” their Apes are. It was her previous appearance on the show that stood out to me, however. She provided Jimmy and the audience with a very reasonable, high-level explanation of NFTs: “It’s a non-fungible token, which is a digital contract that’s on the blockchain. So you can sell anything from art to music to experiences, physical objects.”  I cannot fault her explanation. It’s not very specific, but then again she is speaking to an audience that is as mainstream as it gets. I have provided many skeptical friends with similar descriptions over my years of working in crypto. The retort they always level at me in different variations is a fair one: “What does any of that mean in the real world?” Unfortunately, Paris, there is little utility today in anyone minting digital versions of physical objects as NFTs.  Even those of us who are not skeptics, who have hitched our livelihoods to this experimental industry, regularly speak about crypto and Web 3 in contrast to the “real world” as if to express self-awareness that we are inhabiting another planet. We talk about tokens and NFTs versus “real world assets;” we talk about DeFi applications juxtaposed against “real world finance.” We all know that we have not yet delivered real products in the real world. Kanye West is right.  One common critique of crypto applications is that they are self-referential. DeFi in particular largely functions this way: Stake your magic beans to earn yield in internet money that you can trade on margin for derivatives of yet more digital tokens. In a way, this is an incredible achievement. As an industry, we have created a separate, mostly functional financial system almost wholly unlinked from the real world.  On the other hand, that crypto is in a universe unto itself lends the whole space a fragile quality – as if it is all a collective illusion and, once the first person awakes, it could all evaporate.  Crypto has built castles in the air. They are very complex, compelling, sophisticated castles but they are, as of yet, without foundations connecting them to terra firma.  Read more: Jill Gunter - The Right (and Wrong Way) to Get Web 3 Adoption  In a postscript to his NFT note, Kanye West scrawls, “Ask me later.” It is as if he is leaving the door open for us to build the foundations for those castles and to make NFTs and the rest of Web 3 matter to the real world. Maybe someday NFTs will be of interest to him and to the rest of the inhabitants of planet Earth.  How do we as an industry answer West’s implied call to action? What does it mean to make crypto matter to the real world? I believe the answer lies in building the right infrastructure to get us to mass adoption.  There are still so many flaws with the layer 1 and layer 2 technologies that support all of the early Web 3 applications that render the apps unusable for many would-be consumers and participants. Transaction fees on Ethereum frequently stretch into the hundreds of dollars. Layer 2 scaling systems face challenges around delayed withdrawals. More expandable layer 1 protocols struggle with maintaining uptime. There are limited privacy guarantees made by existing smart contract platforms. Even the most user-friendly wallets present challenges to users who are largely unfamiliar with concepts of private key custody.  There is so much work to be done just to get the platforms we are building on into a state where they can support the full range of users and use cases, including those that extend to the real world.  Part of why the use cases of crypto are limited today is because the infrastructure on which they are built continues to have limitations. Okiki Famutimi, a product builder who has contributed to companies including Circle and Aave, wrote a few years ago about the notion of “post-threshold companies”: companies that are building products for the point in time after mainstream adoption has been achieved. There are a lot of post-threshold companies in crypto, he pointed out, building products that assume eventual mainstream adoption when it is not yet even clear we will ever actually get there. These premature post-threshold companies can create a lot of hype and noise and distraction and cause skeptics to question what value these products, built on as-of-yet unfit foundations, will ever offer the real world.  For those who are less concerned about immediate mainstream utility, the nascent products of these post-threshold companies like NFTs, decentralized exchanges and decentralized autonomous organizations can offer a glimpse of the future. If the infrastructure supported better user experiences and onboarding, cheaper transactions and created reasonable privacy guarantees, we could squint and see the future of art, music, finance, governance and collective action.  Our explanations of exactly how this will all pan out may yet be a little hand-wavey, as Paris Hilton’s was on ""The Tonight Show."" Her description reminded me of another celebrity speaking in grand generalizations about a nascent technology. In a BBC interview from 1999, David Bowie spoke of the internet as “ an alien life form,” while his interviewer squinted skeptically. “The context and the state of content is going to be so different from anything we can imagine at the moment.

This measure is made of the simple moving average (SMA) of the token in question, the standard deviation of the token&apos;s price. Furthermore, add and subtract that amount from each point along the SMA by multiplying the standard deviation by two- the upper and lower bands are created by this. The simple moving average and the upper and lower bands of the standard deviation of the average trend lines make up this measure. Bollinger bands can be used to determine whether a cryptocurrency is oversold or overbought, as well as the likelihood of asset volatility. Bollinger bands are sometimes known as lagging indicators because they only infer information after a change has occurred. Bollinger bands can be used by traders to confirm whether or not a long-term trend has moved. In this post, we&apos;ll show you how to use Bollinger Bands for crypto trading to help you understand one of the most reliable indicators ever produced.

42394314,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWFv,1643908967,The 5 Big Risk Vectors of DeFi,"As the decentralized finance (DeFi) market grows, the subject of risk is taking center stage. DeFi holds the promise of automated, transparent and decentralized financial platforms that challenge some of the key foundations of financial markets, but the different risk dimensions in DeFi products remain, for the most part, understudied.  What makes risk management in DeFi so challenging is that it doesn’t quite conform with the traditional risk management theory in financial instruments. For decades, capital markets have evolved around risk management models focused on market factors such as volatility. That is mostly because other factors can be mitigated by the risk and reputation of intermediaries. By replacing those intermediaries with automated financial technology – smart contracts – DeFi achieves unprecedented levels of financial automation, but also introduces new risk vectors that we haven’t seen before.  Risk Management in Capital Markets vs. DeFi  Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson once claimed that “Wall Street stands on the shoulders of Harry Markowitz.” While the comment may be an exaggeration, it emphasizes the importance of Markowitz’s contributions to modern portfolio theory and risk management in capital markets. Intellectuals like Markowitz or his student William Sharpe provided the mathematical foundation for a quantifiable approach to portfolio construction based on risk-adjusted returns. Common market terms such as value-at-risk or beta are the foundation of risk analysis in modern portfolios. While the notion of risk is intrinsically complex, most factors are related to the variations in volatility and prices of a given asset or related assets.  Part of the reason why the risk management theories of Sharpe, Markowitz and others worked in capital markets is because they are built on the notion of trusted intermediaries and a stable infrastructure. Regulators, central banks and other entities play a role in de-risking macro factors from assets in ways that don’t affect portfolio composition. The infrastructure for buying and selling those assets is assumed to be so stable that investors don’t even think about it.  Traditional risk management theory doesn’t apply to DeFi because by relying on programmable smart contracts and a new infrastructure instead of trusting intermediaries, DeFi introduces new risk elements that don’t have an equivalent in traditional capital markets.  5 Risk Vectors that DeFi Investors Should Know About  If traditional risk management theory doesn’t quite apply to the world of DeFi, then other methodologies are needed. The first step toward efficient risk management models in DeFi is to qualify the different risk dimensions of its investment and trading. Most investors in DeFi are aware of the so-called smart contract risk, but the reality is that there is no such a generic concept. There are different forms of smart contract risk and other peripheral risk factors that affect DeFi protocols.  While there are many vectors of risk in DeFi, most of them fall into some of the following five groups:  1. Intrinsic Protocol Risk  DeFi platforms automate specific financial primitives in the form of smart contracts. The dynamics of those protocols are one of the most important dimensions of risks in DeFi applications. Intrinsic protocol risk refers to risk mechanics embedded by default in the design of a protocol. They still present important risks to investment strategies even if the protocols are working as expected.  Intrinsic protocol risk in DeFi comes in all shapes. In DeFi lending protocols such as Compound or Aave, liquidations is a mechanism that maintains lending markets collateralization at appropriate levels. Liquidations allow participants to take part of the principal in uncollateralized positions. Slippage is another condition present in automated market making (AMM) protocols such as Curve. High slippage conditions in Curve pools can force investors to pay extremely high fees to remove liquidity supplied to a protocol.  Intrinsic risk in DeFi protocols is one of the main examples of risk transference from centralized, human counterparties to programmable mechanics in a protocol.  2. Exogenous Protocol Risk  While intrinsic protocols are based on native dynamics, DeFi trades are often exposed to exogenous factors that alter the protocol’s expected behavior. Attacks exploiting the underlying mechanics of a DeFi protocol such as oracle manipulations, flash loan exploits or attacks that take advantage of bugs in the smart contract logic are prominent examples of this category. Recent exploits in protocols such as Cream Finance or Badger DAO highlight that exogenous protocol risk would be an omnipresent factor in the evolution of DeFi.  3. Governance Risks  A unique aspect of DeFi, decentralized governance proposals control the behavior of a DeFi protocol and, quite often, are the cause of changes in its liquidity composition in affecting investors. For instance, governance proposals that alter weights in AMM pools or collateralization ratios in lending protocols typically help liquidity flow in or out of the protocol. A more concerning aspect of DeFi governance from the risk perspective is the increasing centralization of the governance structure of many DeFi protocols.  Even though DeFi governance models are architecturally decentralized, many of them are controlled by a small number of parties that can influence the outcome of any proposal. This aspect is not as concerning as it seems as many of the large parties able to influence the outcome of DeFi governance votes are in that position only because of their active participation and alignment in the DeFi ecosystem – a clear sign of interest alignment.  From a risk management perspective, however, DeFi protocols are functionally exposed to governance attacks. In general, DeFi could benefit from more robust governance models. Firms like Andreesen Horowitz have outlined some novel DeFi governance models that are worth exploring.  4. Underlying Blockchain Risk  DeFi protocols take a level of infrastructure dependency on their underlying blockchain. Compromising aspects such as the consensus mechanisms on a specific blockchains can materialize into vulnerabilities on DeFi protocols running on that platform. A typical example of this are the so-called validator cartels in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks in which a number of validators collude to influence the rewards distribution in the network and can effectively stop the functioning of DeFi protocols.  5. Market Risk  We tend to obsess about the protocol and infrastructure aspects and often ignore the native market risk exposure of investments in the space. For instance, investments in non-stablecoin AMM pools are vulnerable to loss if the price of the assets diverges drastically from the time when the liquidity was supplied to the pool. Another example is abrupt crashes in the price of an asset that could trigger the massive removal of liquidity from a pool, causing major levels of slippage.  The programmable nature of DeFi protocols means that they can natively react to traditional market risk elements such as volatility and price in ways that can cause cascading effects impacting investors’ positions.  DeFi-First Risk Management  Traditional risk portfolio theory is designed for markets of trusted intermediaries and infrastructure. By replacing these intermediaries with programmable smart contracts, DeFi introduces new forms of risks that we haven’t seen before in capital markets. In order to streamline institutional adoption, it is likely that DeFi will require a native risk management models that encompass the native protocol, infrastructure and market risks of the sector.  Native DeFi risk management models could be implemented both at the protocol level as well as part of tier 2 financial services dapps (decentralized applications). For instance, we can think of next generation DeFi protocols that automatically create incentive models when liquidity pools become unbalanced or native DeFi insurance models that protect against slippage or impermanent loss.  Just as risk management models built the foundation of modern financial markets, they are likely to become an essential component of the next wave of DeFi protocols. But like many other things, DeFi requires us to reimagine risk management theory for a new world of decentralization and automation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/03/the-5-big-risk-vectors-of-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dac42135cbf8c2ab6e459b65c59919a2b35265b1-1024x749.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, there have been some kinks to work out with the bitcoin wallet, and one of those kinks being the ability to function properly for all of the residents of the country has led to the relaunch of the Chivo wallet.

42396096,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ljU,1643906644,Jump Trading Backstops Wormhole’s $320M Exploit Loss,"After one of the most devastating exploits in crypto history, the parent company for a popular cross-blockchain bridge has reportedly stepped in to backstop funds – a move that may have prevented widespread damage in the Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  On Wednesday night, the Wormhole bridge suffered an exploit to its Solana-Ethereum bridge, with an attacker fraudulently minting 120,000 ether (ETH) worth over $320 million. The attacker moved the majority of the funds to the Ethereum main chain, while keeping 40,000 wrapped ETH on Solana and trading portions of that ether for other assets.  On Thursday, three people familiar with the matter confirmed to CoinDesk that Jump Trading is responsible for replenishing the lost ETH. After publication of this article, Jump confirmed the move in a tweet:  The unbacked ETH briefly appeared as if it might lead to chaos across popular Solana platforms. Blockchain bridges often work by locking an asset into a smart contract and issuing a parallel, “wrapped” asset on another chain. Because the exploit minted wrapped ETH, it left Wormhole’s real ETH reserves unbacked.  Read more: Blockchain Bridge Wormhole Suffers Possible Exploit Worth Over $326M  Step Finance co-founder George Harrap told CoinDesk on Wednesday that a number of Solana-based protocols that accept ETH as collateral could become insolvent due to the exploit.  ""If nobody backs it and the coins are truly gone then Wormhole ETH is worth [zero] and everyone who has a balance of it becomes worthless, DeFi protocols, users, everyone,"" he said.  However, Harrap said that he expected Jump Trading, a large crypto venture capital and trading firm that purchased Wormhole developer Certus One in August, to step in to back the lost ETH.  ‘Restored’  In a tweet this morning, Wormhole confirmed that funds had been restored and that the bridge’s operations had resumed after the attack vector had been patched:  The backstop from Jump was well-known in Solana DeFi circles, where Jump is an active investor and trader.  “Daddy Jump has a lot of money,” wrote Mango Markets’ Daffy Durairaj in the project’s Discord.

If in mid-January 2022 the LUNA price moved in the consolidation range of $79-$90 and inspired the idea of ​​global continued growth, now there are no such opinions on the market. The sharp start of the Terraluna price correction took place at low volumes. The global liquidity zone, which is likely to start a strong rebound of the LUNA price is in the range of $34-$40. It is this range that significantly slowed down the growth of the LUNA price in the period from August to November 2021. The bad news is that this liquidity range is still about 30%.

This is the largest attack to date on Solana. A competitor to Ethereum that&apos;s progressively gaining grip in the non-fungible token (NFT) and DeFi ecosystems. The $600 million Poly Network crypto heist was bigger, but it involved cryptocurrencies rather than blockchain technology, which may explain why critics call this new development &apos;pretty historic.&apos; The heist occurred on Solana&apos;s side. The discovery of a vulnerability on the Solana side has raised concerns that it could be similarly vulnerable to Wormhole&apos;s bridge. The Wormhole team announced that they would replenish the Ethereum (ETH) supply to make sure wETH is backed 1:1, but it&apos;s not clear where those funds come from or when. The assailant managed to hack into a smart contract and steal $321 million worth of wETH. The heist happened at 6:24 pm UTC on February 2nd when 120,000 wETH were minted by an attacker who then redeemed 93,750 wETH for ETH, equivalent to $256 million. These funds allowed them to buy SportX (SX), Meta Capital (MCAP), Finally Usable Crypto Karma (FUCK) &amp; Bored Ape Yacht Club Token (APE). With the remaining WETH swapped for USDS and SOL on Solana, the hacker now holds 432,662 SOL ($44 million) in Solana wallet.

That is, there is no clear interest of buyers to change the situation in the XRP market. The best case scenario for the XRP market at the moment is a price rebound from the lower limit of consolidation with the first target of $0.8.

The NFT collection is being done in collaboration with the cult toy brand Superplastic, which is also working with the designer luxury brand Gucci on a separate NFT drop.  Hilton’s digital collectibles are being released on Origin Protocol, where Hilton is both an investor and advisor. The NFTs feature Paris Hilton and Superplastic’s synthetic superstar, Dayzee.  “This collaborative project has been in the works for close to a year and represents more than two decades of my journey in the public eye,” Hilton told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “With this collection I also want to send a message that ‘The Truth Will Set You Free’ and help empower women.”  Hilton first discussed the NFT drop during an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in January. Last November, Hilton married venture capitalist Carter Reum, and the NFT drop represents her “symbolic closing of one chapter of her life and moving onto the next.”  In an interview with CoinDesk last April, Hilton said she has been into crypto “forever,” adding that “NFTs have literally taken over my entire mind and soul. I’m obsessed. It’s all I think about. I've never been so excited about something in my life because I really see this as the future.”  Many celebrities and luxury fashion brands have been launching NFTs recently. For some stars, the launches are strictly an investment, while others may believe they’re participating in a movement, but it’s a trend that continues to gain momentum in 2022.  “I am excited that we are building something absolutely unique and unprecedented, and bringing it to the people around the world,” Hilton told CoinDesk.

Other crypto assets were not included in the audit.  Accounting firm Armanino completed the independent audit on Dec. 31, 2021, a Kraken representative told CoinDesk. A culmination of “years” of work, said Chief Product Officer Jeremy Welch, that required reconstructing a merkle tree to prove every coin was proper.  The audit’s release comes as crypto firms race to burnish their credibility amid mounting scrutiny from regulators and traders. Kraken itself has made no secret of its plans to go public, making brand perception all the more important.  It also sends a message to the entire industry, Welch argued.  “We do hope that all companies in this space continue to take the kind of transparent and secure approach that we know is possible,” he said in an interview. “That's the unique thing about this industry, right? It's not even possible in the older financial system to do something like this.”  Welch said Armanino will be posting a copy of the audit to its website.  Kraken intends to commission public proof-of-reserve audits periodically: perhaps once a year or quarter, Welch said. It last released the results of such an audit in 2014.  Customer data is kept private in the audit, Welch said. He further noted customers can check their accounts against the results of the audit using a website tool.  Future audits could see more coins included. This one stuck to the top two cryptos for technical reasons because Welch said that’s where most of Kraken customer crypto rests.

42394327,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbX5D,1643896200,An Incumbent Enters the Disruption Game,"Beyond the popularity of investing in digital assets, futurists envision blockchain technology as a disrupter poised to reshape the entire finance and investment industry from top to bottom – and this future might not be as far off as we once thought.  “If you want to know what’s coming down the pike, it’s a tremendous amount of institutional and high-net-worth capital,” said Alex Lemberg, CEO of the Nimbus Platform, a decentralized finance (DeFi) investment service offering a series of income-generating strategies. “That’s not necessarily innovation, but that’s saying the market is growing from a liquidity perspective.”  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Yet the growing market is itself pushing innovation, said Lemberg, who named the non-fungible token (NFT) space as one area that he’s watching closely.  “We can now fractionalize anything with an NFT, and that allows us to take any physical asset we’re very confident in the pricing trajectory for over the next 50-100 years and fractionalize the risk of ownership and make it liquid so people can trade it whenever they want to,” said Lemberg. “That’s a huge innovation because that is how the stock, bond and commodities markets work – now you’ll see cars, watches, art and physical assets creep in and gradually start to trade in the same way.”  Lemberg’s vision is another step closer to reality. Last week, traditional asset manager WisdomTree announced that it is launching WisdomTree Prime, a digital wallet that will be made available to investors via a mobile app.  What is WisdomTree’s wallet?  Like any digital wallet, WisdomTree Prime allows investors to buy, hold, save and spend digital assets, said Will Peck, head of digital assets for WisdomTree.  “For us, that could mean bitcoin, that’s certainly the case for many investors, but it will also mean other tokenized versions of mainstream assets, like blockchain-enabled funds that can invest in securities,” said Peck, who added that WisdomTree is in the process of launching a line of such products. The company is also pursuing tokenized gold, real property and cash. “We think about it as offering a neobank-like experience in a digitally native wallet.”  The result is an offering unlike any currently available to investors, said Peck, where they can see their cryptocurrency, other digital assets, stocks, bonds, real property and banking assets within the same architecture and the same user experience.  WisdomTree is perhaps best known as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) sponsor, said Peck.  “We were asking if we could do to the ETF what the ETF did to the mutual fund,” he said. “We asked ourselves if there was some sort of superior technology that could act as a wrapper for products and types of exposures, and we pretty quickly came to crypto and blockchains for that.”  Peck and WisdomTree came to the conclusion that issuing and owning assets on the blockchain would ultimately improve the user experience because they reduce costs and increase the options available to investors.  A unifying force  In the traditional world, for example, payments, banking and investment technology stacks are kept separate, but cryptocurrencies have shown that people like having all three concepts built into a unified architecture –tokens like bitcoin and ether are capable of serving all three purposes.  Similarly, when securities are traded, there are usually an “immense” number of counterparties and intermediaries involved, said Peck, but over time blockchain is going to remove or consolidate those entities and offer users more transparency on costs.  “We believe there are a lot of efficiencies and consumer benefits to be gained from the unified user experience,” he said. “In the future we will offer new services and types of assets that will help remove intermediaries and lower the cost for people.”  As opposed to the wallets offered by cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini and Crypto.com that give investors access to large lists of crypto assets, WisdomTree is going to offer a curated experience.  Peck believes that blockchain technology will continue the process started by investment technologists like Charles Schwab in making investing cheaper, easier and more widely available.  Eventually, WisdomTree will bring this technology to financial advisors.  “We’re starting at retail because that is the path we think makes the most sense to start our journey, but we’re not stopping there,” said Peck. “We will have an institutional user portal over time and serve institutional clients as well as advisory firms. We’re going to be expanding out in 2022 and 2023 to tailor this offering to financial advisors.”  WisdomTree is simultaneously continuing its pursuit of a spot bitcoin ETF, Peck said.  'Tokenize the world'  But DeFi thinkers like Lemberg believe the greatest potential lies in tokenizing any investable asset.  “There isn’t a single instrument that has been invented in the past 100 years that can’t be tokenized,” he said.  Lemberg added that though tokenization can present a better way of doing things, it likely won’t replace the incumbent financial industry.  For one thing, much of the investment and innovation to come in blockchain will be from institutions like banks and traditional asset managers like WisdomTree, said Lemberg.  “Because they already have some of the best technological resources out there, they will still be the biggest players, even in blockchain,” he said. “There is absolutely no worry that blockchain will compete with every bank, asset manager and hedge fund on the planet, their ability to deploy technology and research is a heck of a lot more mature than anything we see in the DeFi space.”  Instead, the big disruption will come from blockchain enabling more participants in the financial system.  “As someone who has been through a few decentralization events in finance over the last 30-plus years, I will tell you that initially it will be tough,” said Lemberg. “When I started you couldn’t trade an equity or an option on your own, you had to call me first. If you wanted to know what a quote was, you had to call me. Most of your ability to see a quote came out every day in the Investor's Business Daily or The Wall Street Journal.”  “When the ability to see markets trade in real time on your computer, when you got the ability to bypass brokerage services and trade on your own, both those things were mass decentralizations to the tune of trillions of dollars,” he continued.  “Now think about what we’re watching today. Did any of that really disrupt investment banking? No, it ended up being a huge positive for them. But for individual investors, there’s going to be a huge learning curve.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/03/an-incumbent-enters-the-disruption-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/429121dbb09100b5c38cb2fa3de93381a0d5d3d7-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394320,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWkh,1643896200,Are Crypto Assets Securities?,"Last September, after perhaps the most “2021” of all possible 2021 insider-trading scandals, NFT marketplace OpenSea’s head of product, Nate Chastain, stepped down from his role.  The reason? Chastain purchased non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that he knew were set to display on the front page before they appeared there publicly. It was a seemingly innocent act, similar to a Foot Locker employee purchasing a pair of Air Jordans with his employee discount before the sneakers hit the shelves – right?  Wrong. NFTs aren’t shoes; they’re digital assets minted on a blockchain, and in some cases, they can even be considered securities. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) counts NFTs when you do your taxes – even receiving an NFT as a gift triggers a taxable event. And U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has a reputation for being crypto-friendly, told CoinDesk last October that consumers should be “very careful” when trying to determine if the crypto assets are securities.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Emerging crypto regulation  While it wasn’t the SEC that investigated Chastain – collectors tracked his wallet activity on the blockchain, which instigated an internal investigation by OpenSea – the story raises questions about whether federal regulators are tracking blockchain activity, too.  Legal measures against crypto insider trading are still fuzzy, particularly at this time when the industry produces new utility tokens, NFTs and altcoins every day. Innovation is constant in the crypto world, happening organically to meet new needs and build solutions, and often through significant venture capital funding.  The crypto scene is tight-knit. Despite the wide-scale appeal and booming popularity of crypto, its decentralized nature means a lot of information gets shared through community-generated means such as Twitter, Discord channels and in-person fireside chats and social events. Professionals, for the most part, use discernment (except for instances like Chastain’s NFT opportunism), but overall, the general vibe is that crypto folks are pretty open book. Furthermore, like the OpenSea incident proves, there’s a certain amount of self-regulation built into the ecosystem through the public nature of blockchains (sort of like a pickup basketball game).  Do regulators consider cryptocurrencies to be securities?  In all the euphoria, however, it’s easy to want to open up your MetaMask or Coinbase wallet like you would your Robinhood or E-Trade app and add a few extra coins or tokens to your portfolio once you learn about exciting new projects and developments. But when traders – even hobby traders – get information from insiders about any new cryptocurrency or product, they should ask themselves whether those details are privileged, says Chicago-based Lisa Bragança, a former SEC branch chief.  “The best way to approach it is to presume that every time somebody makes a recommendation about a token, that it is just like a stock,” she told CoinDesk.  The SEC considers just about all cryptocurrencies to be securities, according to Bragança. The only ones that are safe (i.e., just assets) are bitcoin – it truly is decentralized, says Bragança – and ether.  But even these guidelines are still debated among insiders. The SEC’s allegations against crypto exchange Ripple, for instance, demonstrate that the issue of what defines a crypto security is still being determined.  “We should get a ruling in that trial some time here in the next couple of months maybe,” Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who's now CEO of consulting firm Patomak Global Partners, said during a CoinDesk “First Mover” interview last month. “That may be an indication of where things are going to go,"" he said.  But while we wait to see how these lawsuits play out in court, the central question of what is a security will be the elephant in the room around which the nearly $2 trillion crypto industry is built.  “The SEC does not have jurisdiction over a trading platform if it’s not trading a security. So we come back to that essential question,” Atkins said.  Blockchain compliance and enforcement  Given the current back and forth, plus the novelty of blockchain technology, the likelihood of consumers getting nabbed for insider crypto trading with the same regularity and enforcement as they would with traditional securities is low – for now.  “The SEC doesn’t have a practice of going and checking the blockchain to see what transactions are being reported,” Bragança says. “And even if they could, they would have to figure out who was engaged in that trading because it’s often anonymous.”  Then comes the issue of enforcement. The ability to enforce insider-trading laws for crypto, according to Bragança, is “really impaired” and not something that’s happening regularly.  Regulators, however, do have the ability to cherry-pick when suspicious activity is flagged.  “Let’s say somebody is getting divorced,” Bragança says. If a spouse finds out or knew that their ex was engaging in insider trading on a decentralized exchange, that disgruntled spouse could report that to the SEC. “And then the SEC could investigate,” Bragança says.  The same considerations to determine if someone is guilty of insider trading apply to crypto as traditional assets: The information must be material – i.e., important enough that share prices could potentially be affected – and not public.  While crypto exchanges aren't regularly sending consumer data to regulators, Bragança argues that centralized exchanges in particular are more than likely going to seek compliance with federal regulators over time.  “As these exchanges are seeking to get more authority, they are seeking legitimacy and status in the markets,” Bragança says. “So that’s when you will probably see, even without a law, [an exchange] decide to crack down and report suspicious trading.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/03/are-crypto-assets-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78263f1c8286d2f32f97d5de1adb92a8e128e10b-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Atomyze, a firm which sells tokenized metal from Russian mining and smelting giant Nornickel's inventory, will be able to legally issue tokens and provide wallets to users in Russia. The company uses blockchain technology based on Hyperledger Fabric.  Atomyze and Nornickel have a common shareholder, Interros Group. Interros Group is owned by Vladimir Potanin, one of Russia's richest men. Potanin is a major advocate for digital assets, according to a CoinDesk interview in 2019.  In 2020, Russia adopted a law which allows licensed companies to issue digital assets. Firms need to be registered with the Bank of Russia, satisfy certain criteria and report to the regulator.  Atomyze applied for the license last January, along with a handful of other firms, including Russia's largest retail bank Sberbank, which was planning to issue its own stablecoin.  It took the regulator a year to approve the application, head of digital economy and innovation at Interros Group, Denis Klimentov told CoinDesk.  Atomyze is a partner of the Global Palladium Fund, a subsidiary of Nornickel. Similar entities, which will be working on foreign markets, are now in the process of licensing in Switzerland and the U.S., Klimentov said.  In January, Bank of Russia called for a ban on trading and mining cryptocurrencies.

The comments by Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa were made during an earnings news conference Thursday, Reuters reported.  This comes a week after another giant in the Japanese gaming industry, PlayStation creator Ken Kutaragi, came out against the metaverse, calling it “isolating” and VR (virtual reality) headsets “annoying”.  In contrast to this hesitation on the metaverse, in mid-January Microsoft acquired game developer Activision for $69 billion, the largest gaming deal in history, as it said the move would “provide building blocks for the metaverse."" That deal is being reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission.  Historically, Nintendo has been extremely protective of its intellectual property (IP) and prefers to keep it in-house rather than licensing it to third parties. On expanding Nintendo’s empire through licensing, Furukawa said: ""It wouldn't be a plus to suddenly bring in people who don't have Nintendo's way of thinking.""  This has been to the chagrin of Nintendo’s investors, who want the company to expand its IP licensing regime and embrace mobile gaming.  The company has aggressively gone after NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and crypto projects that use the likenesses of its characters.  Despite Nintendo’s noncommittal stance on the metaverse, many metaverse indexes hold the company's stock.

Russian miners shrugged off the news, saying it will affect only illegal mining. The increased demand has been leading to power outages, Tass reported. The jump in the price of bitcoin last year along with China’s crackdown on crypto made miners flock to Irkutsk, Evgeny Vechkanov, director at the Irkutsk Electric Grid Co. told Tass.  In the first half of January, seven Boeing-737s loaded with mining rigs from China arrived in Irkutsk, said Oleg Prichko, CEO of Baikal Energy Co.  Irkutsk is “probably the biggest region with illegal mining. Some (miners) use residential tariffs, close to $0.01, so the government is chasing them,"" Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of CMG Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group, told CoinDesk. An investigation was started in November, he said.  Data center businesses, including legal mines, have to pay around three times the residential price for electricity, Sergey Arestov, a co-founder of BitCluster, told CoinDesk. If you are engaged in industry, you must pay for electricity accordingly, he said.  Residents are even installing mining rigs in dog kennels, Andrey Zhbanov, head of the criminal investigation department in the ministry of internal affairs, told Tass.  The regulatory debate  While Irkutsk tracks illegal crypto mining, agencies at the federal level are discussing crypto regulation.  Last month, the Russian central bank proposed a ban on crypto mining, which the ministry of finance opposed five days later. President Vladimir Putin called for a consensus, signaling support for crypto mining.  Zhbanov said that a crypto mining ban is necessary, while Vechkanov thinks mining should be recognized by lawmakers as an entrepreneurial activity, Tass reported. Industrial scale miners need to be separated from parts of the grid that supply electricity to the population, Vechkanov added.

The BOE on Thursday raised official borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 0.5%, matching estimates. The central bank's policy statement showed four members voted for a 50 basis-point hike, signaling the potential for a faster tightening than historical standards. Officials unanimously voted to begin shrinking the balance sheet.  The central bank was widely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points, while pushing back against market expectations of a total of five quarter-percentage-point hikes by the end of 2023. ""Most were already discounting a raise from the BOE, but not the ECB,"" Acheson said.  The ECB, as expected, kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25%, while maintaining that higher inflation will fade by year end. Dessislava Aubert, senior research analyst at Paris-based crypto market data provider Kaiko, said the growing monetary policy divergence between the Fed and the ECB might lead to a stronger dollar and weaker bitcoin.  ""While the Fed is expected to hike rates several times this year, the ECB has adopted a more sequential and slow-go approach to monetary policy tightening – explicitly ruling out a rate hike for this year. This will likely impact the U.S. currency relative to the euro,"" Aubert said in a WhatsApp chat.  ""There is already a rate differential, with between the U.S. yields which have increased since November and German yields which are up only a little. Stronger dollar is generally bearish for equities and bitcoin with BTC moving in the opposite direction to the greenback over the past months,"" Aubert added.  The BOE and ECB rate decisions failed to inject volatility into the bitcoin market, leaving the cryptocurrency largely steady at under $37,000.  Europe matters  Europe has been a major source of demand for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Both the ECB and BOE have contributed to the two-year global liquidity deluge commonly associated with the Fed and have fueled unprecedented risk-taking in financial markets.  Data tracked by ByteTree Asset Management shows the number of bitcoin held by U.S. and Canadian closed-ended funds and Canadian and European exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has risen 165% since early 2020 to 842,153 BTC.  A Chainalysis report released in October mentioned Europe as the world's largest crypto market. ""Central, Northern, & Western Europe (CNWE) has the biggest cryptocurrency economy in the world, receiving over $1 trillion worth of cryptocurrency over the last year, which represents 25% of global activity,"" the blockchain analytics firm said.  Together, the Fed, the ECB, BOE, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have $27 trillion worth of assets, according to Bloomberg. That's up from $14 trillion at the start of 2020. Thus, monetary policy revisions by the European and North American central banks can influence bitcoin's price.  ""Broader monetary policy trends do matter for the medium term as it sets the tone for global liquidity and global risk appetite,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in a Telegram chat.  Fed rules the roost  While central banks in advanced nations have worked in tandem to flood the global economy with cash, the Fed sets the worldwide narrative and draws the most attention from financial markets.  ""While all macro decisions matter, the Fed is the most important as it drives the global policy,"" said Charlie Morris, founder and chief investment officer of ByteTree Asset Management.  The Fed is widely seen as the lender of the last resort because of the dollar's global reserve status, as explained in a Council on Foreign Relations article dated September 2020. The popular theory states that the dollar's reserve status ensures constant demand for the greenback in the global market. That allows the Fed, in theory, to print to infinity without worrying about sharp currency depreciation and a surge in inflation.  The U.S. central bank has taken a sharp hawkish turn since November, retiring the word ""transitory"" from inflation discussions, setting the stage for at least four interest rate hikes this year and an end to the liquidity-boosting bond-buying program in March.  Bitcoin, widely touted as an inflation hedge, has declined by 45% since mid-November, predominantly due to the Fed jitters.  Speculation of global tightening has been doing the rounds since the Fed's hawkish turn. Thus, impending anti-stimulus comments or actions from other central banks, if any, may not have a significant negative impact on bitcoin.  On the flip side, the battered cryptocurrency may see a relief rally if the likes of ECB squash fears of aggressive monetary policy tightening, though the central bank has little room to do so given inflation is running at multiyear highs. ""If ECB and BOE do not pull the trigger, this will offer up some short-term tailwinds with the price of bitcoin,"" said Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETF expert and director of CEC Capital.  That said, overall, the environment for risk assets, including bitcoin, is gloomy, according to Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange. ""The cryptocurrency could continue to trade sideways until bottom fishing emerges,"" Balani told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp call. ""That looks unlikely as long as macro factors remain bearish.""

42394549,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjMj,1643886558,Sports NFTs: How to Get in the Game,"If you’re an avid sports fan, cryptocurrency is rarely out of reach. Look around you: After deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars were signed, the Staples Center was renamed the Crypto.com Arena and Miami’s premier sports venue is now called the FTX Arena.  You can now see a small FTX logo on all Major League Baseball umpire uniforms. Sports stars, including Serena Williams, LeBron James and Tom Brady, are often plugging blockchain technology.  However, there’s one piece of technology that’s becoming increasingly central to sports’ crypto play: non-fungible tokens (NFT). They’re everywhere – Deloitte predicts the sports market will generate more than $2 billion in NFT sales this year. Here’s the lineup when it comes to NFTs and sports.  Trading card and collectible NFTs  NBA Top Shot  NBA Top Shot is one of the largest crypto trading card games. The National Basketball Association developed it with Dapper Labs, the creators of the ERC-721 standard and the viral CryptoKitties game. While CryptoKitties runs on the Ethereum blockchain, NBA Top Shot runs on Dapper Labs’ proprietary blockchain, Flow.  The concept is simple: It’s a database game that revolves around the ownership of “moments” – tiny video clips of famous NBA plays. You can buy packs of them, virtual renditions of the trading card packs of yore, plus trade your moments on Top Shot’s secondary market.  Top Shot is the fifth-largest NFT project of all time, having generated $886 million in sales, according to CryptoSlam. However, the game’s popularity has long since peaked, as most of the sales took place in February and March 2021.  NFL All Day  Dapper Labs has also inked a deal with the National Football League. The NFL’s NFT game is called NFL All Day and it plays similarly to NBA Top Shot.  Like NBA Top Shot, the game concerns the trading of “iconic highlight collectibles,” and you can build up your collection or sell your NFTs on an in-game marketplace. The project is in closed beta right now, meaning you can’t play it without an invitation from the NFL. The game is set to be open to the public by the end of the football season. To kick-start its launch, attendees atSuper Bowl LVI, which takes place on Feb. 13 at SoFi Arena in Los Angeles, will all be offered NFTs from NFL All Day.  Read more: NFT Marketplaces, A Beginner’s Guide  UFC  Alongside the LaLiga soccer league, the NFL and the NBA, Dapper Labs has continued its expansion through a partnership with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC NFTs launched on Jan. 23 on UFC Strike, replete with audio clips of the screams and cracked bones of its brawlers.  Again, the economy revolves around “packs” of virtual NFT clips, which you can sell on a proprietary marketplace. The first set of packs, which each cost $50, propeled 100,000 NFTs into the economy.  Sorare  Sorare accomplished for soccer what NBA Top Shot achieved for basketball. It’s a trading card game that also functions as a fantasy European football league. Like NBA Top Shot, Sorare’s trump card is its licensing; Sorare claims to be officially licensed with 215 clubs, including titans Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain.  According to CryptoSlam, Sorare is the 16th most popular game, with $202 million in all-time sales.  NFT memorabilia and tickets  Athlete NFTs  Trading NFTs through licensed trading card games isn’t the only way to get your hands on sports-based NFTs. Some athletes have gone directly to market, selling NFTs on platforms such as Nifty Gateway and OpenSea.  German professional footballer Mesut Özil sold avatars on Nifty Gateway and recently retired Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady sold his own NFT collection on Autograph – an NFT marketplace Brady co-founded. Brady’s collection, which went live in December, grossed $1.3 million in under 10 minutes. Tony Hawk, Simone Biles and Wayne Gretzky are among the star athletes who have NFTs on Autograph.  Read more: How to Buy a Tom Brady NFT  Sports tickets  NFTs aren’t just for collecting, they’re also useful as digital sports tickets where the premise of a unique digital asset is especially important. NFTs could cut out scalpers selling fakes – or, conversely, tap into crypto’s 24/7 economy to spark a market that’s more efficient at pricing tickets according to demand.  And NFT tickets could one day become collectible items, much like how tickets to historic sports games can hold their value or rise over time. AlphaWallet, for instance, tokenized 20,000 FIFA tickets.  Attendees of Super Bowl LVI are not only getting to see the big game in person, but each one will receive a unique NFT based on their ticket, although it remains to be seen if they will function as more than keepsakes or evolve beyond souvenir status.  What’s next?  Esports  Athletes may no longer be required to exert physical effort to generate huge NFT sales.  Although Steam has banned the technology, esport gaming teams like the New York Subliners are lining up to launch NFTs. In tandem with Moonwalk, esports company Andbox will also enter the NFT market on the Flow blockchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FLOW,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/sports-nfts-how-to-get-in-the-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7925019f066dfcdb783b6426de870bc296b0d6f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In contrast to the Bank of Russia, which advocates a ban on crypto, Siluanov suggests banks can be authorized to provide cryptocurrency exchange services and licensing rules will be introduced for other types of businesses as well. For companies that aren't licensed, providing crypto services would be treated as a criminal offense. Both the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Russia agree that cryptocurrencies cannot be legal tender in Russia.  The Bank of Russia and Rosfinmonitoring, Russia's anti-money laundering (AML) agency, must have access to the information about cryptocurrency-related transactions, and the Transparent Blockchain transaction tracking system must be used, Siluanov said.  Such an approach would put cryptocurrencies on an equal footing with precious-metal accounts in banks and other regulated investment tools, with obligatory know-your-customer and AML checks for buyers, taxation and regulated fiat on-ramps, Kommersant wrote.  According to Siluanov, Russians own about 2 trillion rubles ($26 billion) worth of crypto, which constitutes a small percentage of the population's total savings. These funds will need to be legalized after the proposed new regulations come into force, Kommerstant wrote. Mining and foreign cryptocurrency trading platforms will also need to be licensed, which will bring additional 180 billion rubles of taxes ($2.3 billion), the regulator said.  Several bodies of the Russian government earlier agreed on a roadmap for cryptocurrency regulation, which must be created by the end of this year. The move was prompted by the Bank of Russia, which published an analytical report earlier in January, calling for a full ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining in the country.  Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the government and the Bank of Russia to find a common ground on cryptocurrency regulation, mentioning that Russia has advantages on the global mining market.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/03/russias-minister-of-finance-suggests-letting-banks-sell-crypto-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/253fd4606e2457e2e0497ab7b182973ad6cd26a5-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396132,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0oiS,1643885550,Long-Term Buyers Unfazed by Bitcoin's Recent Drop to $33K,"Long-term bitcoin holders were not too bothered by the cryptocurrency's drop in the last few months, according to analytics firm Glassnode.  Bitcoin's price fell as low as $33,100 in the last week of January after beginning the year around $47,500 amid falling sentiment for risk assets. One of the biggest price drops came towards the end of January when bitcoin fell by $10,000 from Jan. 20 to Jan. 22, trading data shows.  Since then the crypto has recovered to $38,800, where it encountered resistance and then fell to $36,800 at the time of writing.  Despite the drop, bitcoin flows suggest long-term holders continued to add to their positions while short-term holders paused, according to metrics from analytics firm Glassnode.  Glassnode’s balance on exchanges metric, which tracks the amount of bitcoin held by wallets of crypto exchanges, reached 2.52 million this week – a level last seen in April 2021, when bitcoin reached an all-time high of $69,000. The metric gradually rose to over 2.7 million in July, before falling to 2.56 million in October, and has gradually fallen since.  Some analysts say asset movements out of exchanges, coupled with a price recovery and bitcoin holding support levels, is an overall bullish sign.  “The percentage of bitcoin on exchanges continues to decrease. Since the all-time high at $69,000, Glassnode shows that 42,900 bitcoin has left exchanges,” explained Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at crypto brokerage GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk. “These indicators suggest that as the price has decreased by over 50% over the past few months, whales [large holders] have been accumulating, while short-term holders [are] capitulating.""  Metrics for long-term holders, or bitcoin held by wallets for longer than five months, support this analysis. Data shows that nearly 100,000 bitcoins have been added to long-term holder wallets since December, despite a fall in prices. This suggests that long-term sentiment among traders remained intact despite short-term price falls.  Sotiriou pointed out that most bitcoin flows in recent times were from ""young"" coins, or those acquired by holders recently.  “High values for dormancy flow mean that old coins are moving,” he said. “Extremely low values, like we are seeing currently, show that most of the coins being transacted are young, suggesting that short-term holders are capitulating while long-term holders are holding/accumulating.”  Dormancy flow refers to the average number of days each coin remained dormant or unmoved before a transaction, a gauge of the market's spending pattern.

42396131,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0ofV,1643881750,IRS Offers Tezos Staker Refund on Rewards Tax in Break From Current Policy,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offered a Tennessee couple a refund on income taxes paid for unsold staking rewards as part of what appears to be a settlement in an ongoing legal fight – a move industry experts say signals an important shift in the way the IRS views crypto staking.  In 2019, Joshua Jarrett paid income tax on 8,876 tezos tokens he earned through staking. In 2020, Jarret asked the IRS to return the taxes he paid, arguing the tokens were not income but “created property.” The IRS currently treats digital assets as property for tax purposes, but assets generated through staking may also be taxed as income, as happened in Jarrett's case.  Jarrett filed a lawsuit against the agency after the IRS did not respond, funded in part by the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA).  In December 2021, attorneys for the IRS wrote to Jarrett and his wife’s attorneys to inform them the IRS had been “authorized and directed to schedule an overpayment of $3,793, plus statutory interest.”  For POSA, the IRS’ concession that Jarrett’s taxes were an overpayment is a signal the agency agrees with the plaintiff’s position that tokens he generated through staking are property and not income until they are sold.  “The IRS basically waved the white flag and said, ‘Here’s your refund,’ and they wouldn’t do this after litigation has already started unless they thought there were some teeth to [Jarrett’s’] arguments,” said Alison Mangiero, the acting executive director of POSA.  The IRS declined to comment. The agency has not published any formal statement or otherwise indicated whether a settlement offered to a single plaintiff is a sign of a broader policy shift.  According to court records, a bench trial is currently set to begin in March 2023. The judge overseeing the case asked both parties to make ""a good faith attempt to resolve the case"" after the discovery process ends. Discovery is set to end by March 18, 2022.  As proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana, Avalanche and Tezos continue to grow in popularity, both individual crypto stakers and groups like POSA have pointed out the need for tax clarity from the IRS.  Jarrett’s (and POSA’s) desire for clarity has pushed the lawsuit forward.  Not willing to settle for just the refund, Jarrett and his lawyers declined the IRS’ offer and are seeking the issuance of guidance from the IRS on whether tokens created through staking constitute taxable income at the time of their creation or, as Jarrett suggests, just when they’re sold.  Mangiero told CoinDesk the Department of Justice (DOJ) has received Jarrett’s rejection of its offer, though it has not yet responded, and the case will proceed.  “If the court reaffirms [Jarrett’s] claim that these staking rewards should be taxed as created property, then there is a legal opinion that other taxpayers can rely on, and they can feel confident when they file their taxes every year,” Mangiero said.  Mangiero hopes the case will force the IRS to issue formal guidance.  “They have never issued guidance specifically on staking rewards,” Mangiero said. “And the only guidance they issued on mining, which is tangentially related, was back in 2014. There are a lot of people out there like [Jarrett] who are really trying to do the right thing and pay their taxes, and this would help them to do that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | SOL,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/03/irs-offers-tezos-staker-refund-on-rewards-tax-in-break-from-current-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a7e761ba5754b5548fafa6a0238c8c707dcdd73-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0odX,1643876234,Solana's SOL Tumbles 10% After $326M Wormhole Exploit,"The price of Solana’s SOL token dipped below the $100 mark after attackers took advantage of an exploit on Wormhole, a popular bridge between the Solana and Ethereum networks. Bridges are tools that transfer native assets and data between two separate blockchains.  SOL fell 10% in the past 24 hours, trading at $98 during Asian afternoon hours, down from the $110 level during U.S. evening on Wednesday.  Charts show the price of SOL briefly fell below the $98 resistance level before traders pushed the price up to $99 during early Asian hours. The price fell as low as $97.32 before gaining 40 cents at the time of writing.  Nearly $13 million worth of liquidations occurred on futures tracking SOL, according to data from analytics tool Coinglass. Over $5.6 million of these occurred on crypto exchange Binance, followed by $4.26 million on FTX. Liquidations occur when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open.  The price drop came after Wormhole was exploited on Wednesday night. Wormhole confirmed the exploit in a tweet during early Asian hours on Thursday. Wormhole also said that it will add ether (ETH) over the next hours to ensure wrapped ether (wETH) – a representation of ether on Solana – was backed on a 1:1 basis with ether to prevent malfunctioning of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi applications use smart contracts to provide financial services, such as trading, lending and borrowing, to users. Concerns loomed among traders and developers after the exploit. ""If nobody backs it and the coins are truly gone then Wormhole ETH is worth [zero],"" George Harrap, founder of Solana DeFi platform Step Finance, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""Everyone who has a balance of it becomes worthless, DeFi protocols, users, everyone.""  Attackers stole over 120,000 wETH by tricking a series of smart contracts on Solana to digitally ""sign"" on an illicit transaction, as reported.  “The attacker could effectively lie about the fact that the signature check program was executed. The signatures weren't being checked at all,” explained Ethereum developer Kelvin Fichter in a tweet. Signature checks are an automatic step used by Wormhole to verify transactions between networks.  Sentiment among industry observers on Twitter remained mixed. “This bridge that Solana (sic) hyped as 'secure, trustless' a few months ago just got hacked for 80,000 ether,” tweeted Evan Van Ness, founder of crypto fund Starbloom Ventures.  Adam Cochran, the founder of crypto fund Cinneamhain Ventures, said that blockchain bridges should have inbuilt security mechanisms to control the loss of funds in case of an exploit.  “Feels like bridges should have some sort of second contract that acts like a timelock cold storage,” he tweeted. “Set capital control limits on how much outflow can happen max and has governance voting for a freeze.”",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/03/solanas-sol-tumbles-10-after-326m-wormhole-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e19d0523cadf594dc1894155581fc39ddd9a5289-1813x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0oZb,1643857690,Texas Crypto Miners Shuttering Operations as Winter Storm Approaches,"A number of crypto miners in Texas are already shutting down some or all their operations as the region awaits an Arctic blast that is likely to test the state’s power grid this week.  The miners, many of whom flocked to the state in recent months to take advantage of Texas’s low energy costs, say they will reduce their energy consumption to help avoid a power failure similar to the one Texas experienced in 2021. That outage left about 4.5 million homes and businesses without power and led to nearly $200 billion in property damage.  These efforts will dovetail with those of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the Texas grid and said on Wednesday that it would use “all tools to manage the grid.” Some of the miners will also be taking advantage of state incentives to ratchet back their power usage.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Is Reshaping the Energy Sector and No One Is Talking About It  Riot Blockchain, one of the biggest North American miners, has already reduced its energy usage at its Whinstone facility in Rockdale by 98$%-99%, Trystine Payfer, Riot’s director of communications, told CoinDesk. “We will continue to do so as needed until there is no extreme stress on the ERCOT grid,” she added.  Compute North, which hosts bitcoin miners in its data centers, told CoinDesk that it is also closely eyeing the storm. “We are prepared to respond [in] real time to curtail our operations in order to support ERCOT, grid stability and power demand,” Compute North Director of Energy Peter Liska said.  Nathan Nichols, the co-founder and CEO of Texas-based miner Rhodium, tweeted that miners in the state were “curtailing their load starting TODAY to help provide excess power reserves for #WinterStormLandon.”  To be sure, in Texas there are programs available for heavy power consumers such as crypto miners to give them incentives to lower their energy usage during peak demand periods. For example, in exchange for helping ERCOT stabilize the grid, Riot gets to participate in load management programs and other services, including some long-term, lower, fixed-pricing agreements, Payfer said.  Compute North’s Liska said that demand response programs, which allow customers to reduce their electricity usage when energy prices are high, are one way for the company to balance power generation and consumption during peak demand.  “Rather than incremental energy production, we reduce our load giving power back to the grid, which is more cost effective and efficient than spinning up additional energy reserves,” Liska added.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/03/texas-crypto-miners-shuttering-operations-as-winter-storm-approaches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60cc808bafefc24e4de7753aeacee09d5392ec75-459x612.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
