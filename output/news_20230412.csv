The company has managed to maintain somewhat stable mining production despite facing various challenges. Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, short-term risks for Riot Blockchain still tilt downward. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) has been going through its fair share of knocks recently due to the crypto bear market, but there are signs that its fortunes are changing. When I wrote this article, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining companies were very much in the mud due to the rapid shift to unprofitability brought about by the Bitcoin selloff that brought the reward associated with earning a token close to the direct costs associated with mining one for most major mining companies and way under the usual $30,000 mark for profitability for most miners. Since then, cryptocurrencies have rebounded sharply, and Bitcoin is now hovering around the $30,000 mark. Riot Platforms has benefited greatly from this move, and the stock is up 119.5% since my last article. Today, we will discuss what investors can expect going forward from Riot and see if this is still a good level to start the position. Production update Throughout the recent crypto bear market, we have seen a plethora of production disruptions brought about by various reasons. Apart from the Texas winter storms, Riot Platforms has been one of the more stable names in the space. This is due to its relatively strong balance sheet, the company's prudent approach to balancing liquidity, and the need to increase its mining fleet. We have seen the other side of this story in companies like Core Scientific (CORZ) that may have suffered due to management's decision to grow their fleet too quickly. This prudent approach made Riot a great choice for any investor looking for a Bitcoin mining company that would most likely weather the bear market. In times of hardship, mining companies tend to throttle production or sell tokens to maintain liquidity. We can see below that Riot has managed to keep mining productions more or less stable recently, but they have not been immune to the pressure to sell. We can see that over the past few months, the company has been selling most of what it has been mining, which isn't great. Month Bitcoins Produced Bitcoins Sold Net Proceeds Self-mined Bitcoins Held Deployed Miners Hash Rate Capacity December 659 600 ~$10.2M ~6,952 16,128 9.7 EH/s January 740 700 ~$13.7M ~6,978 82,656 9.3 EH/s February 675 600 Not given 7,058 87,264 9.8 EH/s March 695 675 ~$16.7M 7,072 94,176 10.5 EH/s Author's Estimates The recent move in Bitcoin prices has greatly improved the valuation of the company's treasury and added a layer of feasibility to mining operations that has been missing over the past few months. It is important to remember that Riot Platforms has had direct costs hovering around the $10,000 mark for some time, which means that there is a contribution to other operating costs for each token mined and sold above this level. Theoretically, as the company scales its operation, it should become more profitable as more tokens are produced to spread around the firm's fixed cost, holding constant difficulty rates. A New Look on the Inflation Story The Federal Reserve has made notable progress in its fight to tame inflation, which will be very welcome for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was (arguably) an unintended casualty of the Federal Reserve's fight to tame out-of-control prices. This led many to criticize Bitcoin's role as a hedge against inflation. This dynamic and the general fear of a crippling recession brought the token down to historic lows. We are now seeing some buying action in the space due to speculation that the Federal Reserve may pause soon and declare victory in the inflation battle. Data by YCharts I believe the celebrations may be premature, as inflation is still elevated following one of the fastest hikes in history. The Federal Reserve is likely to keep rates elevated for some time unless the economy really begins to roll over, as a return to surging inflation would be extremely unwelcome. Another topic that has been hot on the lips of crypto investors is the joint effort by BRICS nations to reduce global reliance on the US dollar. Many believe this may open the door to a central bank digital currency, which has been discussed at length in the media. It is difficult to see the US dollar losing its status as a reserve currency in the near term since there is no great unifying factor for BRICS nations apart from fear of US sanctions. There is also the fact that China has so far sweetened the deal for many of these nations, and it is difficult to see this kind of relationship happening in perpetuity. In any case, the argument put forward by the US dollar bears is that as the world rejects the currency, more and more US dollars will make it back into the domestic economy, which will cause hyperinflation. As of today, we have not seen a decrease in appetite for the US dollar so much as the willingness to transact in alternatives. It is also difficult to imagine these nations agreeing on a shared currency for an extended period of time, as each of them will want to print money as needed, and one could easily see conflicts arising from the fluctuations that would do to a relatively illiquid secondary reserve currency. But no one really knows how this story ends. If the US dollar faces a currency crisis, then it is likely that speculators will pour cash into Bitcoin and other tokens for perceived safety from the impending hyperinflation. If that were to happen, Bitcoin could ironically work out as an inflation hedge. Valuation and Forward-looking Commentary As we can see below, the company is trading at historic lows from a valuation perspective, but there is a good reason for that. Despite the recent move in Bitcoin prices, short-term risks are still asymmetrically downward. Data by YCharts We have also seen some truly horrific EPS numbers come out from the company relative to expectations. Seeking Alpha Unless Bitcoin continues its move higher, we will likely see further challenges down the line. But the biggest issue with the purchase here is the starting point. You see, Bitcoin miners tend to provide superior returns after big selloffs in the crypto space when compared to the Bitcoin token. For crypto bulls, this means that buying the ugly with these miners can lead to outsized returns. I made this point clear in my past articles, but the main issue is the starting price is much higher now, and it is perhaps better to purchase the token when the market is trending upward if you missed the move. Data by YCharts The negative variance makes sense when you consider that the mining companies often rely on dilution and external financing to fund operations when prices are unfavorable. While the supply of Bitcoin is being diluted constantly, the risk of a secondary offering still outweighs this effect, especially considering the implications increasing difficulty rates have on production costs for miners. The Takeaway To sum up, the Federal Reserve's recent strides in controlling inflation, along with ongoing debates about the potential diminishing role of the US dollar as a global reserve currency, have sparked renewed enthusiasm for digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin mining stocks may yield higher returns following considerable market selloffs, today's elevated entry prices could make investing directly in the digital currency more appealing during periods of positive market movement.

42387706,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQqTsz,1681340150,Ether Trades Flat After Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade,"CORRECTION (April 12, 2023, 21:10 UTC): This story previously said ETH was up since the upgrade happened and said trading was volatile; neither was actually the case.  Ethereum's long-awaited Shanghai upgrade has been deployed, and the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is basically unchanged after the monumental event went live.  Ether is trading around$1,914 – about where it was right before the upgrade happened – as validators unstaked tokens that had previously been locked up since Ethereum shifted to proof-of-stake last year. ETH is up 1.1% versus 24 hours earlier.  Analysts were divided on potential price action in the lead up to the upgrade, with many predicting that fresh supply would increase sell pressure while others thought it may become a psychological battle where traders punish the over-crowded short trade.  In an email to CoinDesk, Brent Xu, CEO of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Umee, wrote that he didn't expect a big decline for ETH or related liquid staking tokens (LST) in the near future.  ""The momentum is just too powerful,"" Xu wrote. ""Right now, there are many institutions holding ETH and LSTs. Retail basically isn't in the picture, and retail would be the ones who would dump at this moment. But the institutions won't really be impacted by this upgrade because their investing time horizons are longer term.""

This comes even as several prominent crypto figures now find themselves under indictment for a laundry list of alleged financial crimes. The rally is part FOMO, but there are some big drivers behind it that suggest Bitcoin's fundamental value is increasing. Fundamentally, Bitcoin is tremendously valuable, but there's a wide disagreement as to what its true value is. Why you should play BTC with GBTC. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is now up over 81% for the year as of my writing this after a spate of high-profile bank failures. March's chaos sparked intense investor interest in alternatives to the US banking system. Bitcoin's rally has mirrored a broader explosion in investor risk appetite that has sent Apple ( AAPL ) up 29% on no news, Tesla ( TSLA ) up 72%, and meme stocks like Carvana ( CVNA ), AMC Entertainment ( AMC ), and GameStop ( GME ) up anywhere from 30% to 100%. In less than 90 days, investor sentiment has swung from fear to uninhibited greed. In general, when something surges this much in a short period of time along with other speculative investments, it's likely to reverse! There are plenty of warning signs that the broader risk-on rally is being driven largely by FOMO. But is there more to the story with Bitcoin than just being caught up in a speculative frenzy among investors? Of the reasons to buy Bitcoin, ""because it's skyrocketing"" is probably one to avoid. However, there are some interesting developments under the surface that point towards the fundamental value of Bitcoin increasing. There are some pros and cons to Bitcoin to weigh, and there's an interesting legal situation that can offer big upside to investors in the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as well. Data by YCharts Arguments In Favor Of Bitcoin 1. Global Adoption Continues Inflation in Argentina recently topped 100% annually , Bolivia is beset by a huge dollar shortage and rumors of an impending currency devaluation, and inflation in Turkey is hovering around 50% annually. Moreover, Colombia and Brazil have both elected left-wing governments over the past year, leading many of those with accumulated wealth to head for the exits. Bitcoin is an important check on the ability of governments to redistribute wealth by printing money. The more fear of this there is around the world, the more demand you can expect for Bitcoin at any given time. Overall market data shows steady adoption for Bitcoin, with an all-time record high number of addresses now holding at least one coin . This has allowed Bitcoin to stage an impressive price recovery after being in the dumps in late 2022 during the fallout of several alleged Ponzi-style crypto schemes that failed. While many of the bets coming in on Bitcoin are related to false rumors of new money printing in the United States, Americans' worst economic fears have been the day-to-day reality for many third-world countries over the last 150 years. Wherever you are in the world, Bitcoin represents insurance against rampant currency debasement. Even Argentina has acquiesced to crypto as their political situation has worsened, recently allowing Bitcoin futures to trade in Buenos Aires. The small Central American country of El Salvador has led the charge with Bitcoin adoption by making it legal tender. President Nayib Bukele's authoritarian style attracted his fair share of controversy along the way. However, under his watch, murders in El Salvador fell by 57% in 2022 and are now at levels comparable to the US. There, Bitcoin makes a nice complement to the US dollar, which is used as the currency in the country. 2. Bitcoin Is Insurance Against Government Default The market currently believes that the US Federal Reserve will be successful in bringing down inflation. We know this because the 10-year inflation breakeven for TIPS is about 2.3%. If inflation is subsequently higher, then you can buy TIPS and make more than you can make in US Treasuries. If inflation is lower, you'd make more by buying nominal Treasuries. It's possible for inflation breakevens to be wrong- after all, they didn't predict the inflation surge of the 2020s so far. Of course, you can buy TIPS and make more if inflation comes in higher, but Bitcoin offers a hedge against a potentially more severe outcome, that being the Fed throwing in the towel and letting inflation soar to 20% per year or more- effectively defaulting on US government debt and ending the US dollar's reign as the world's reserve currency. Rampant vote buying and massive budget deficits are what got countries like Argentina and Turkey in so much trouble, and if the US were to repeatedly make the same mistakes that developing countries have we would eventually get the results they've gotten. Such a scenario would be an unmitigated disaster for the US economy and I don't think it will happen, but if it does, you'd be glad you owned some Bitcoin, as people in the US would dump savings held in dollars en masse for alternatives like crypto. For these reasons, Bitcoin carries some insurance value against huge devaluations in the dollar. For the record, after studying the situation extensively, I don't think will be America's future. Replacing the patchwork system of state and local sales taxes with a 20% VAT (like a national sales tax) would effectively fix government budget deficits, and could be paired with modest tax cuts in income taxes. I firmly believe that the US would rather do this than devolve into economic and political chaos, but you never know! That's why Bitcoin is so attractive now, and why gold has held its appeal for thousands of years. Arguments Against Bitcoin A few arguments against buying Bitcoin here that are worth discussing. 1. Will More Crypto Misdealings Be Exposed? Of course, the crypto world has had its own share of characters that have taken advantage of the lack of regulation in the space. These don't have anything to do with Bitcoin, but they're part of the broader crypto world. Terra ( LUNA-USD ) co-founder Do Kwon recently was arrested in Montenegro for his role in the $40-billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna coins. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried recently got new charges by US prosecutors added for allegedly bribing Chinese government officials, in addition to the charges from the massive FTX implosion. Crypto mogul Changpeng Zhao has moved to Dubai ( UAE ) amidst mounting investigations in the US and other countries into Binance's business practices. The UAE notably has no extradition treaty with the US. Bitcoin's early adoption was largely among nerdy libertarians, and the project's success turned thousands of them into young multimillionaires. However, it didn't take long for criminals, scammers, and money launderers to follow them into the crypto world looking to make quick money or get around the law. The number of investigations still pending and questions about the solvency of large crypto projects is a shoe that is going to drop for BTC at some point. I'd view it as a buying opportunity because there would be forced sellers, but this isn't a risk you can totally ignore. I view the odds that all of the "" bezzle "" has successfully been rooted out of the crypto ecosystem as fairly low. Rate hikes are likely to expose the rest in time. There's simply no way to know how much crime is still present in crypto, and we're less than a month removed from two large crypto-focused banks shutting their doors. 2. Bitcoin Pays No Interest The clearest argument against Bitcoin now is that you don't earn any interest on your money. Bitcoin does have a negative real yield as the current rate of inflation is 1.8% (this comes from mining). Next year Bitcoin will undergo a halving that will bring the rate of inflation down, but the US dollar is starting to offer some interesting competition. If we assume inflation ticks down to 3% by year-end and the Fed keeps cash rates near 5%, then Bitcoin will have a similar inflation rate but no interest. Many long-term comparisons of fiat currency vs. gold conveniently omit compound interest for fiat currency. However, choosing the wrong fiat currency has ended in disaster, as investors in China and Russia found out in the 20th century. All things considered, I do consider it a drawback that Bitcoin doesn't pay interest when money market funds are paying nearly 5%. Throughout the 2010s and until 2021, this drawback didn't really exist. If you believe in BTC long-term, this does make it easy to be patient though, because you can have your savings in money market funds and dollar-cost average into Bitcoin over time. 3. Bitcoin Has Maniacal Shareholders This giant rally in risk assets has stemmed in large part from a belief among speculators that the Fed isn't serious about getting inflation down. But historically, there's nothing unusual about a 5% cash rate and a 3% inflation rate. To the extent, BTC is tied to all the other speculative assets, its fortunes in the short term are likely to rise and fall with them. Put another way, it's a risk when you put your money in the same place as hordes of reckless speculators. Sometimes they're right about the assets they choose, but often they distort prices with their fear, greed, and FOMO. The thing about Bitcoin is that it's clear that there's tremendous value in its existing, but also a wide disagreement over what this value is. Bitcoin's current market cap is a bit under $600 billion, which is about 50% bigger than the value of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), but only about 1/5 of the value of Apple. What should the value be for a global system for storing, saving, and sending wealth via the internet and outside of the control of central banks? That's essentially what Bitcoin is. There's tremendous disagreement about what the proper value is, but I'd say it's worth quite a bit. GBTC: A Higher-Upside Way To Buy Bitcoin As part of this wide disagreement over the true value of crypto, the market tends to be less efficient than the stock market. For example, Bitcoin futures used to trade at a large premium to the underlying coin, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust traded at a large premium as well, and now trades at a big discount. Data by YCharts The discount is currently about 35% to the value of the underlying Bitcoin, meaning you can make a 54% return if the underlying value can be realized. To calculate your return, simply take the value of the NAV divided by the price you're paying. In this case, 1/0.65= 1.54, or a return of $1.54 for every dollar you put in. So how would this happen? Grayscale is currently locking horns with the Securities and Exchange Commission over converting their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. This would allow them to create and redeem shares until they've equalized the market value of the ETF with the net asset value. The SEC denied Grayscale's request but has previously approved a Bitcoin futures ETF ( BITO ). Grayscale appealed the decision to federal court in DC. This has been going on for over a year, but the reporting from the appellate court is that the judges seem to be open to the idea of letting them convert. I think Grayscale will win here. Grayscale isn't the most popular these days, and they've also come under immense activist pressure over the persistent discount in GBTC. One way or another, I expect the billions in sequestered value to be unlocked from this fund. There's a management fee of 2% per year, but that would pay for well over a decade of the current discount. This has been a trade that's been dead money for quite a while, but something will ultimately unlock this. Bottom Line The broader rally in risk assets is speculative and likely overdone. However, the fundamental case for Bitcoin is intriguing compared with other risk assets. Combined with a roughly 54% kicker if GBTC is able to convert GBTC into an ETF, I believe that the risk/reward is good for a small to moderate-sized investment in Bitcoin via GBTC. A ruling in the case is expected sometime in Q3 of this year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4593766-bitcoin-surges-81-percent-ytd-is-the-rally-for-real-or-just-fomo?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11692633.jpeg

The Shanghai upgrade was triggered at 22:27 UTC, and finalized at about 22:42 UTC.  Roughly half an hour after the Shanghai upgrade was activated, some 285 withdrawals in epoch 194,408 had been processed, for about 5,413 ETH ($10 million worth), according to beaconcha.in.  Read More: LIVE BLOG: Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade  The much anticipated hard fork – essentially upgrading the blockchain by splitting off a new one – has been characterized by members of the Ethereum community as a historic milestone, completing its multi-year transition to a full proof-of-stake network.  In a proof-of-stake system, users “stake” cryptocurrency as a form of guarantee to help secure and confirm new data blocks. Last year, the blockchain left behind its original proof-of-work consensus mechanism – the same one the Bitcoin uses – but until now users had been unable to withdraw their staked ether or redeem accrued rewards, a crucial feature of the new paradigm.  The price of ETH remained largely flat at the time the Shanghai hard fork was triggered, while about 4000 people tuned into a Shapella Mainnet Watch Party hosted by Ethereum Cat Herders.  At the livestream, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, said that ""we're in a stage where the hardest and fastest parts of the Ethereum protocol's transition are basically over. Very significant things still need to be done, but those very significant things can be safely done at a slower pace.""  Buterin said that scaling – making transactions faster and cheaper – will be the next issue that the blockchain tackles after Shanghai. ""If we don't fix scaling before the next bull run, we know people are going to be stuck paying $500 transactions. If, on the other hand, we don't have Verkle Trees before the next bull run, well, things might might suck, but you know, it's a much smaller problem than, you know, $500 transactions, right?""  Digital-asset market analysts have speculated for months whether the Shanghai hard fork would be a catalyst for either a price rally or a crash: Will its success boost market sentiment, or will stakers redeem their ETH en masse and rush to dump their holdings?  Validators and staking  When Ethereum went through the “Merge,” the hard fork that switched out its old consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), the project introduced a new breed of “validators” to keep the blockchain running. While the PoS consensus mechanism reduced Ethereum’s energy’s consumption by 99%, developers also believed that under PoS, the network would be more secure and would enable more decentralization.  “It’s always been our aim that Ethereum is something that is an army of tens of hundreds of solo node operators, not you know, three or four large pieces of data,” said Ben Edgington, product lead for Teku, a ConsenSys client for Ethereum. (A client is a software that runs the blockchain.) “I believe we have designed a protocol that enables that, which I think is a big step forward from PoW.”  Vitalik Buterin wrote in a blog post in November 2020 that PoS would lead to “higher wealth concentration over the long term.” This is because in PoS, you just need ether to stake and can get more ether through staking. In PoW, you still earn ether, but need outside resources to do so. So over the long term, Buterin argued that PoS “coin distributions risk becoming more and more concentrated.”  In order to participate in the block validation process and secure the Ethereum network, validators have to “stake” at least 32 ETH by sending them to a smart contract where the funds are locked in. The more ETH a validator stakes, the more likely they will be tasked with proposing a “block” of data transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain. When a validator proposes a block and it is approved by the other validators, that validator gets an extra reward.  When the PoS chain was launched, 32 ETH was about $15,000. Since then, ETH has appreciated tremendously, now about $58,000. The price gains represent one reason for the speculation that some investors might choose to sell their ETH – to book profits.  Not everyone has that amount of ETH lying around to be able to stake a full 32 ETH. So liquid staking providers came to be as an alternative, where users who wanted to participate in the staking process could contribute any amount of ETH they want, and third-party providers would stake that ETH and run the validator on behalf of the collective of clients.  Lido, the largest liquid staking provider, controls about 23% of all ETH staked. Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, some of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, control another 22% of staked ETH.  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain  Shanghai: Unstaking now ready  There are numerous ways in which validators can unstake, though the two main types of unstaking are partial withdrawals and full withdrawals.  A partial withdrawal is when stakers take out the rewards they earned from staking but leave the original ether that was staked. Solo stakers running their own validators had to migrate their credentials to a 0x01 withdrawal credential. Without it, partial withdrawals can’t happen automatically.  Partial withdrawals became accessible when the upgrade was triggered (so the blocks didn’t need to finalize), allowing users to reap their long-awaited rewards immediately. However, Ethereum can only process 16 partial withdrawal requests in a single slot (which happens every 12 seconds). Depending on how many requests will occur, the queue for withdrawals could take hours.  “During the first few epochs, there most likely won’t be any partial withdrawals, as the first few hundred validators are all 0x00,” said Barnabas Busa, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation. This is because those are genesis validators who joined the network when the Beacon Chain went live, and thus have the old withdrawal credential set. (Long-time Ethereum devotees might be more interested in continuing to secure the network than cashing out.)  Full withdrawals – where stakers also redeem their original principal – went live at the same time, allowing validators to fully unstake their 32 ETH and any rewards they’ve accumulated. By exiting the chain, the validator stops participating in the block validation process and stops contributing to the security of the network.  Full withdrawals don’t happen automatically, so those validators that want to exit have to send a message to the blockchain to get added to the queue.  Staking services are on their own timelines for the release of staked ETH withdrawals. Coinbase said earlier they would start processing withdrawal requests for their stakers about 24 hours after Shanghai is complete. Lido said stakers won’t be able to retrieve their withdrawals until the protocol goes through another upgrade in May.  Read more: Ethereum's Shanghai Is Nearing, but When Can I Withdraw My Staked ETH?  Is the sell pressure on?  Since the Beacon Chain went live in December 2020, more than 18 million ETH has been staked (about 15% of total ETH supply). Now that Shanghai is live, about 1.1 million accrued ETH from rewards is eligible to be immediately withdrawn.  Market analysts have feared that the unlocking of ETH deposited into the Beacon Chain might start a rush by stakers to liquidate their tokens.  CoinDesk has also reported that there could be additional selling pressure from entities that are facing financial pressure. Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network could sell its staked ETH balance of 158,176 ETH to recover a portion for creditors. Kraken, a U.S.-based crypto exchange, recently agreed to shut down its staking operations in the U.S. to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges, thus likely having to unstake all of its 1.2 million ETH.  Some market analysts believe that selling pressure for ETH will likely be distributed over several days given the withdrawal queue, allowing buyers to watch and analyze the selling pressure.

While staked ETH withdrawals is the main focus of Shanghai, there are also four smaller mechanisms to Ethereum (known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs) that will improve gas fees for developers.  EIP-3651, which accesses the “COINBASE” address, a software used by validators (no connection to the popular exchange), at a lower gas cost. This code change to the blockchain could improve Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) payments for users  EIP-3855, which enables “Push0,” a code that will lower gas costs for developers  EIP-3860, which caps gas costs for developers if they use ""initcode"" (a code used by developers for smart contracts)  EIP-6049, which will notify developers of the depreciation of a code known as “SELFDESTRUCT,” which also reduces gas fees  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Blockchain’s Shanghai Hard Fork, and Why Does It Matter?

Adidas first released its Into The Metaverse collection in December 2021, promising holders of the NFTs ""exclusive access to collaborative merchandise and virtual land experiences throughout 2022."" Its first Web3 exploration, a collaboration with NFT influencer gmoney, PUNKS Comic and Bored Ape Yacht Club, allowed holders to burn their NFTs to receive a new ERC-1155 token from the next phase of the project and claim physical clothing items.  Holders of NFTs from the first two phases of the Into The Metaverse collection can now burn their NFTs to receive a new NFT from the Ethereum-based ALTS by Adidas collection, paying only for gas fees. The new stage in Adidas' Web3 journey involves a dynamic NFT with eight different ""ALT[er] egos"" that correspond to different rarity traits and interactive storylines.  The new collection will offer various utilities for holders, including a stake in the ALTS by Adidas ecosystem, some commercial intellectual property (IP) rights to their character, access to exclusive virtual wearables, entry to holder-only community gatherings and token-gated Discord channels, among others.  At the time of writing, the Into the Metaverse collection has a floor price of 0.57 ETH (about $1,000) and has done 48,771 ETH (about $93.4 million) in trading volume since its launch. The ALTS by Adidas collection has a floor price of 0.59 ETH (about $1,100) and has done 320 ETH (about $613,000) in trading volume so far.  Adidas has continued to bring its sporty style to Web3 through digital apparel collections and a virtual styling tool for existing profile picture (PFP) NFTs. It has also released several NFT collections, including the sports-themed Blue Pass, an art collection titled Raws x Adidas and a council badge for the 15 members elected to advise the company on its Web3 expansion.  Adidas previously partnered with Italian luxury house Prada on a Polygon-based NFT collection and most recently, the brand showed off new styles in Decentraland during the platform's Metaverse Fashion Week.

11692324,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4593763-cleanspark-production-growth-on-track?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1681338064,CleanSpark: Production Growth Is On Track,"Summary CleanSpark has purchased 65k Bitmain miners in recent months. These machines will help CLSK achieve end of the year EH/s guidance. The company appears to have navigated the ASIC market very well. Buying S19J Pros before prices increased and S19 XPs after prices decreased. CleanSpark is the most efficient top 5 miner by return on exahash. If you believe BTC continues to rally, CLSK is a ticker to consider. When I last covered CleanSpark (CLSK) in December it was on the heels of a fairly large reduction in the company's Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings. Selling down BTC in 2022 was not an uncommon action for the public bitcoin miners and we saw that when miners with large debt loads sold BTC, it was generally a sign of problems ahead. For CleanSpark, this was not necessarily the case as the company has one of the lowest debt to equity ratios in the industry: Data by YCharts This lower-debt approach has been more conservative from a balance sheet liabilities standpoint but it has come at the expense of long term shareholders through dilution: Data by YCharts Here we can see CleanSpark has been one of the bigger dilution offenders after having gone from 41.5 million common shares outstanding at the end of December 2021 to 71.7 million common shares outstanding at the end of December 2022. While stock-based compensation more than tripling from $8.5 million in 2021 to $31.5 million last year is definitely a concern long term investors should consider, until CleanSpark management misses on exahash guidance, I think CLSK is a ticker that will reward more medium term stock buyers well in a rising BTC price environment. Exahash Growth CleanSpark has been guiding for 16 EH/s by the end of 2023 and recent mining machine acquisitions put that figure well on track: CleanSpark On Tuesday, the company announced the purchase of 45,000 additional S19 XP machines that will boost CleanSpark's total production rate by over 6.3 EH/s once the rigs are deployed. This latest round of rigs purchase will see 25k machines delivered in August and with the remaining 20k delivered by the end of September. The company is projecting the full order to be online and operational by the end of the year. CLSK's CEO Zach Bradford noted the XP prices had been expensive relative to the S19j Pro machines for quite some time: We have chosen other units such as the S19j Pro+ over the S19 XP in the past because we believed the gap would close on the delta between the ROI of other units and the XP. Our patience has paid off. Back in February, CleanSpark purchased 20,000 S19j Pro machines at a 25% discount. The S19js from the February order will add over 2.4 EH/s to CleanSpark's 6.6 EH/s that is currently online. Judging by Hashrate Index's ASIC price tracking, it looks like the CleanSpark team navigated the ASIC market quite well: HashrateIndex According to Hashrate Index, the prices of the higher efficiency, sub 25 joules/TH rigs have come down dramatically in the last 3 months. The S19 XPs have a quoted efficiency of 21.5 joules/TH. So those prices have come down in recent weeks. Additionally, the S19j Pros have an advertised joules/TH closer to 30. Meaning the prices of the S19j Pros that CleanSpark purchased in February have likely gone up since those buys. This is pretty impressive work by CleanSpark and indicates the company was able to get advantageous pricing on all of these machines. Machine Efficiency Together these recent machine orders are projected to bring CleanSpark's operating exahash to 15.9 EH/s. Assuming these rigs are all delivered and energized without issue, these additions to the fleet will make CleanSpark one of the largest public miners by far. This scale is particularly noteworthy given CleanSpark's history of efficiency. Relative to other industry leading producers, CleanSpark has generally been the most efficient of the top mining producers: BTC per EH/s RIOT MARA CORZ CLSK CIFR August 2022 77.9 57.5 61.9 116.2 September 2022 63.4 63.2 53.9 107.7 October 2022 73.8 87.9 89.9 104.3 November 2022 67.7 67.4 88.1 97.3 December 2022 67.9 67.9 91.4 74.8 80.4 January 2023 79.6 94.1 89.8 105.6 79.8 February 2023 68.9 71.9 81.6 87.3 76.5 March 2023 66.2 71.7 87.6 89.3 72.5 Source: Company disclosures Going back the last eight months, CleanSpark has consistently been the most efficient of the top 5 public bitcoin producers measured by BTC return on exahash. Core Scientific (CORZQ) took that title briefly in December but it has been all CleanSpark for the majority of the last year. With the addition of 45k new S19 XPs, the company should be able to maintain its efficiency leader status among industry peers. Bitcoin is Moving Bitcoin is back above $30,000. As the price of BTC continues to move up, these public miners see their profit potential increase. And right now, the BTC chart is making moves: TradingView We're just a couple months removed from a golden cross of the 50 day moving average over the 200 day moving average. There's still plenty of room for Bitcoin to run both from an RSI standpoint and from a resistance standpoint. We could see some chop in this $30k area, but I wouldn't be surprised if BTC tests $35k before the market figures out where to take it from there. That would be music to the ears of bitcoin miners like CleanSpark. In my view, the longer term question is pretty simple; is this finally the relief rally BTC bulls have been waiting for or is it the beginning of a new bull cycle? I would caution the super bulls that BTC rallied from $3,500 in late 2018 up to nearly $14k in mid-2019. It wasn't until after another trip back below $4k that BTC took out its previous cycle high in late 2020. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. As long as CleanSpark can navigate the BTC market as well as it has navigated the ASIC market, I think we'll see good revenue growth this quarter. Risks There is no guarantee the money CleanSpark spent on these new machines will return a profit. At today's bitcoin prices the S19j Pros will take about a year to return the investment. But, there are positive signs from this company. While I'd be concerned about things like dilution, I'm less concerned if that dilution is to help scale a very efficient fleet at a great price. It stings shareholders even less if BTC is rallying. Summary I maintain that most of these public miners are probably bad long term investments. Bitcoin's halving is expected to be 12 months from now. That means shortly after CleanSpark has reached its 16 EH/s goal, the block reward will be cut in half. With that comes a drastic revenue decline if the price of BTC stays constant. It also means it might take longer to return the investment on the rigs. Of course, the cure for some of these fundamental problems is higher BTC prices. I am of the opinion that Bitcoin will eventually make a new high. I would like to see CleanSpark produce as much BTC as it possibly can before the halving and with 16 EH/s, it should be able to scale a BTC position quite nicely if it shifts its balance sheet management to a HODL approach at the right time. I don't like all of the miners. But I do like this one.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4593763-cleanspark-production-growth-on-track?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11692324.jpeg

42410992,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvINE,1681333245,"Bitcoin Bulls, Bears Wrestle Amid Hopeful Signs in Latest Inflation Data","Crypto bulls and bears jockeyed for position as the March consumer price index (CPI) offered hope the U.S. Federal Reserve would be able to avoid lowering interest rates at its next meeting in May.  The latest inflation data coincides with shifts in whale activity and the unveiling of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade later Wednesday.  The CPI rose 0.1% in March, better than the estimate for 0.2% growth. Core CPI, which removes traditionally more volatile food and energy prices, aligned with estimates for 0.4% growth, down from 0.5% the month prior.  The latest readings continue a months-long trend of easing inflationary pressures. The March 31 release of the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index (PCE), showed prices increasing 0.3%, down from 0.6% the prior month. PCE data is arguably Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s preferred inflation indicator.  Declining inflation and recent turmoil in the banking industry have led investors to speculate whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will pause rate hikes in 2023. The 2 p.m. ET release of FOMC minutes offered few hints of the central bank’s path forward.  As crypto bulls and bears tried to find meaning in the CPI, bitcoin’s price rose to $30,400 before sinking briefly below $30,000. BTC is currently trading just above that threshold.  Ether (ETH) took a slightly different path, pushing higher initially before flattening. Ether investors on Wednesday were weighing not only inflation but the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which could send ETH’s price spiraling as stakers of ether un-stake their tokens to potentially sell them. A number of analysts believe the so-called hard fork will have little impact on prices as traders who have long known about the upgrade would have already sold off.  ETH was recently trading 60% higher for the year to date.  While BTC finds its footing, investors might want to monitor unique wallet addresses, particularly larger ones. Among these wallets holding significant amounts of crypto:  The number of wallets holding between one and 99 BTC and those with more than 10,000 BTC has been growing since January.  Over the same period, the number of wallets holding between 100 and 9,999 BTC has also been growing.     One explanation could be that investors on the precipice of 10,000 BTC are optimistic, locked into the asset and increasing their exposure – ready to move into a higher tier.  This may represent a base of support for BTC prices because investors who went long the digital asset in January are up 80% year to date.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/12/bitcoin-bulls-bears-wrestle-amid-hopeful-signs-in-latest-inflation-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6db83b7fb35cfb4a6233d47527ecfeb23fad1ee8-2245x1263.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dorsey of the District of Delaware.  Dietderich told the court that the team of professionals who took over FTX after former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was forced to step down was working hard to build balance sheets from scratch and track down assets for customer recovery. So far, according to a presentation made by Dietderich, the company has recovered a whopping $7.3 billion in mostly liquid, distributable assets, up nearly $2 billion from the figure lawyers gave at a hearing in January.  The company plans to file a preliminary plan of reorganization in July, Dietderich added, and tentatively expects to set a customer bar date – the deadline to file a proof of claim against FTX, which will be done using a still-to-be-made customer portal – by the end of September.  Part of that plan could include restarting the exchange, though Dietderich said that was just one option among many.  Read more: Crypto Exchange FTX Could Reopen, Its Attorney Says; Firm’s FTT Token Surges  In addition to tracking down the firm’s missing $8 billion, Dietderich said FTX’s leadership has been working extensively with U.S. law enforcement agencies that are investigating Bankman-Fried for fraud. Several other members of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, including former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang, have all pleaded guilty to their roles in the alleged scheme.  Dietderich said Wang in particular has been helping FTX’s new leadership “locate additional assets.”  A Sunday report from FTX CEO John J. Ray III, who was brought in following the exit of Bankman-Fried and his lieutenants, highlighted the sloppiness of FTX’s operation under the former CEO’s leadership, and painted a picture of an environment where millions of dollars were misplaced and basic accounting was not done.  “Mr. Bankman-Fried repeatedly, pervasively, and often persuasively lied to stakeholders and customers and creditors in order to maintain a digital con game,” Dietderich told the court. “[FTX] was a facade, a digital Potemkin village or, perhaps more apt, a video game,” he continued. Behind the user interface there was no correspondingly sophisticated reality, no equivalent process for segregating assets or reconciling trades, no reliable relationship between the positions reflected in the online game and the underlying positions held in the real world.”  Attorneys for Bankman-Fried appeared at Wednesday’s hearing to petition Judge Dorsey to lift the automatic stay motion preventing the now-disgraced CEO from accessing insurance benefits provided by FTX that would help pay his legal costs. He is reportedly currently paying his lawyers with money he gifted to his father – Stanford law professor Joseph Bankman – from Alameda’s coffers.  Judge Dorsey denied Bankman-Fried’s motion, claiming he had been shown “no evidence” that such relief was appropriate.",POSITIVE,FTT,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FTT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/12/ftxs-bankruptcy-lawyers-the-dumpster-fire-is-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04f649e78bd678313c1c04ee964644486e6a8acd-1199x674.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387714,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQqUL3,1681328127,DeFi Insurer Nexus Mutual Demands $2M Refund From Euler Hack Claimants. One User Traded it Anyway,"Leaders of the crypto insurer Nexus Mutual told CoinDesk its governing body may lawyer up if policyholders who lost money in the recent Euler Finance hack and filed claims for their losses don’t pay back the insurance project.  Euler suffered a $200 million hack last month, but the culprit returned nearly all the money. So, Nexus Mutual covered losses for people who ended up not actually having losses.  Nexus Mutual, one of the largest insurance platforms covering high-risk decentralized finance (DeFi) deposits, is waiting to get paid back by five clients who filed claims after the March incident, according to on-chain data. Together, those clients represent about $2 million in crypto of the nearly $2.4 million in total claims Nexus Mutual paid.  The situation underscores how parts of DeFi still rely on trust despite crypto proponents’ insistence that crafty code could supplant that most fundamental aspect of traditional financial systems.  At press time Euler’s redemptions portal had returned $133 million in value to 457 users, six of whom were also Nexus Mutual policyholders. Of those six, four have returned some $380,000 in various cryptocurrencies to the group. The two that haven’t can be seen on chain swapping their redeemed cash for other cryptos, sending them to other addresses, and just generally being a degen. Their share of the pot amounts to nearly $400,000.  Problem is, it’s not their money to spend. According to Nexus Mutual’s pseudonymous head of communications, BraveNewDeFi, those holders agreed to return the value of their claims to Nexus Mutual if they got their money back from Euler. That situation has come to pass: Euler’s hacker returned the funds and so Euler on Wednesday began processing redemptions, including to those already paid by Nexus Mutual.  “This is the first claim event where an exploited protocol was able to recover the lost funds from the attacker,” said BraveNewDefi.  In a Telegram message, BraveNewDeFi said one policyholder has traded away the 200 ETH (over $380,000) they owe to Nexus Mutual. CoinDesk attempted to reach out to the owner of that address but has not heard back. Most of the other eight have either paid back the Nexus Mutual decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or haven’t yet redeemed with Euler, BraveNewDeFi said.  Losing one six-figure payout would likely not impact Nexus Mutual’s financials in a meaningful way. The insurer is the strongest coverage provider in DeFi as measured by loss ratio, a metric that captures the health of its insurance business, according to data compiled by Richard Chen, general partner at the crypto ventures firm 1confirmation.  Still, Nexus Mutual’s team is keen to avoid losing even a penny. They’ve been in contact with Euler and even got that team to add a notice to the claims portal that alerts policyholders to the money they owe.  If that doesn’t work, then lawsuits might follow.  “Nexus Mutual DAO members have deep connections to legal professionals within the industry,” the protocol’s founder, Hugh Karp, told CoinDesk on the project’s Discord server, referring to the so-called decentralized autonomous organization that runs the platform. “Already four out of the nine claimants have returned funds and if Nexus Mutual DAO members feel it's necessary to engage legal counsel to pursue the remaining claims then they should do so.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/12/top-defi-insurer-paid-millions-to-euler-hack-victims-now-nexus-mutual-wants-its-money-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c46e94de262b02daaacac4b3ee5a61565ac1b6ba-1472x828.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the CPI came in lower than expected, indicating a cooling down of inflation, the impact on the market was anything but steady. Bitcoin (BTC) managed to reclaim the $30,000 level, but the question remains: will it continue to soar to new heights, or is a correction on the horizon? Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull Will Bitcoin Reach New Heights Or Experience A Correction? Although the report revealed a CPI rate of 5.0%, which was lower than what many had anticipated at 5.2%, Bitcoin’s current price movement and momentum appear weak. Despite the possibility of BTC’s rally continuing, the cryptocurrency has difficulty firmly consolidating above the $30,000 mark. Despite the lower-than-expected CPI rate of 5.0%, the Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, has increased from the previous month, indicating that inflation may not be easing as quickly as anticipated. However, Michael Van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, has recently highlighted the impressive performance of Bitcoin in comparison to other assets in a recent newsletter, which has resulted in the underperformance of other cryptocurrencies in the industry. Van de Poppe has highlighted the BTC.D chart on a 2-day time frame as being at a critical juncture. He suggests that Bitcoin’s strength could continue to increase if there is a successful breakout and BTC experiences a bullish continuation following a retest of the range high. On the other hand, if the market surpasses the range high and then retreats into the range, it may present opportunities for altcoins to gain momentum Furthermore, according to Van de Poppe’s analysis, a drop in the price of Bitcoin within the range of $28,400 to $28,800 could positively impact the overall price movement of the cryptocurrency. This particular zone may serve as a robust support level, as it was previously a significant obstacle to overcome but has now transformed into a crucial threshold for BTC. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $29,950 and has been moving sideways for the past 24 hours, experiencing a slight decline of 0.8%. However, if BTC can withstand a possible pullback toward the $28,600 zone, it could regain its bullish momentum and reach a new yearly high. On the other hand, if BTC cannot maintain its position and falls below this level, it may experience a further retracement toward the $27,200 zone. This level could prove significant, as a successful bounce back from this point could help Bitcoin consolidate above $30,000.

The growing prevalence of staking, where participants pledge ether to participate in running the blockchain in return for yield, could help establish benchmark interest rates for blockchain-based money markets.  Read more: Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Is Complete, Starting New Era of Staking Withdrawals  “We do think this is actually a game changer,” Chen told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday about the network’s Shanghai (or Shapella) upgrade. “If you think about it, this is the first time that Ethereum has a long-term, market-risk-free yield curve that can actually go for a long run.”  The upgrade, which is slated to take place on April 12 at 6:27 p.m. ET (22:27 UTC), will mark the network’s completing the transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system. With the upgrade, token holders will be able to withdraw the ether they’ve staked. The upgrade is also intended to make it easier to participate in the network‘s validation process while increasing security, lower fees and create more room for the network to handle more transactions.  While concerns linger that Ethereum’s upgrade will cause a substantial withdrawal of ETH, Chen said that institutional investors see the event as more of a “trust vote” in the future of the blockchain.  He said RockX plans to “encourage some customers to withdraw” some ether out of the 240,000 ETH the company has staked, to show that RockX trusts the network’s upgrade.  From a technical perspective, Chen said the upgrade is a rather “boring and peaceful event.” However, he said use cases for decentralized applications, or dapps, may soon become evident.  “From the dapps or application layer, we’re expecting a lot of innovative financial products, and also, different types of new products,” he said.

The token is reacting to the news of FTX’s potential relaunch. Related Reading: Over 3,000 Validators To Withdraw After Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade As of this writing, FTT is trading north of $2 for the first time since February and could continue to reclaim previously lost territory. The token moved sideways for months, and today’s news was the first time it recorded positive price action. FTX To Relaunched? FTT Traders Go Long According to a report from Reuters, FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings have been partially successful. The company’s new administration recovered $7,3 billion in fiat and digital assets, according to FTX attorney Andy Dietderich, that testified in a U.S. bankruptcy court hearing. This amount represents an increase of around $1 billion in the company’s effort to recover its users’ funds. The failed crypto exchange is evaluating its options after spending months “collecting resources” and trying to figure out what went wrong under the previous administration, led by its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. In that sense, Dietderich claims that the company overcame the “worst” of its situation and can start thinking about re-opening operations. FTX’s new CEO, John Ray, has been hinting at relaunching the crypto exchange for some time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Ray said the measure could allow them to “recoup value” for their clients. A separate report from CNBC claims that FTX’s intentions are “unclear” as the new administration needs to provide further details about a potential reboot. If FTX returns, can users withdraw their money and trade with digital assets, or will the company attempt to become profitable to repay its debts to creditors? These issues and others related to taxation, security, and user experience still need to be answered. Daniel Tramel Stabile, a partner at law firm Winston & Strawn, told CNBC the following: When we talk about restarting — rebooting — it’s not totally clear what they have in mind. There could be a rebooting in the sense of reopening the exchange with a limited purpose for getting assets off the exchange.

42412318,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4bXU,1681324284,New Privacy Blockchain Namada Proposes First-Ever Shielded Airdrop to Zcash,"Namada, a new blockchain that focuses on multichain privacy, has proposed an airdrop of its upcoming Namada staking token (NAM) to holders of zcash (ZEC), the cryptocurrency native to privacy-focused blockchain Zcash, according to a release shared exclusively with CoinDesk.  This will be the first-ever direct airdrop to shielded ZEC holders – zcash users who choose to keep their transaction details private. They will not only be able to anonymously claim the NAM, but also receive more of it than transparent ZEC holders (who will also be recipients of the airdrop).  Both Namada and Zcash use zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), a type of cryptography, to verify transactions without revealing the sender, receiver or the transaction amount. ZK-proofs are a technique for proving the validity of information without revealing the information itself. ZEC users can either keep transaction details confidential (shielded) or public (transparent).  The Anoma Foundation, the organization behind Namada, says it’s targeting a May 2023 mainnet launch, after which the exact timing and mechanics of the airdrop will be finalized. The foundation also stewards Anoma, a separate privacy-preserving protocol.  The airdrop will be part of Namada’s retroactive public goods funding – a way of giving back to specific projects and communities such as Zcash, that have contributed to Namada's technology. The foundation will allocate at least 20% of the initial NAM supply – projected to be 1 billion NAM – to retroactive public goods funding.  “Namada is a new privacy-oriented blockchain that they are about to announce, and,it is intended to be a partner with Zcash and to give back to the Zcash ecosystem in terms of both money and technology,” said Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Electronic Coin Company (ECC), creator of Zcash.  Namada has issued a proposal to the Zcash community seeking collaboration on research and development.  “Namada couldn’t have come into existence without the technical contributions and socio-economic program of the Zcash community,” said Christopher Goes, a board member of the Anoma Foundation.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently at $30,030, off a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s data. BTC’s price reached as high as $30,548 earlier Wednesday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ much-watched inflation reading showed the CPI rising 0.1% increase in March, slower than economists' 0.2% forecast for the month and then February’s 0.4% reading. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI was higher by 5%, down from 6% in February and against expectations of 5.2%.  BTC's profit-taking is ""intensifying"" following the report, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.  “It seems the momentum rally for bitcoin might be over for now,” Moya wrote. “Inflation hedge and or a breaking of its correlation from equities might subside for a while.” He added that BTC looks poised to consolidate as ""it will clearly need a robust catalyst to keep the rally going.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, was recently trading at $1,914, up 0.3% from Tuesday, same time.

Bill SB 1751 passed the Senate with uninanimously and is now heading to the House. If approved, it will have to be signed into law by Texas Governor Greg Abbott.  The bill aims to limit bitcoin miners participating in demand response programs – under which they get paid in credits to turn off their operations when the power grid sees a surge of demand – to 10% and abolish tax abatements for the industry.  The House vote is expected to be more contentious, in part because bitcoin miners have cranked up their advocacy against the bill. Three lobbying groups including the Texas Blockchain Council, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, and Satoshi Action Fund launched a campaign against the bill on Monday, which they say is ""anticompetitive.""  Bill SB 1751 will likely fail in the House because ""the opinions in the House are much more aligned with the positive aspects and the benefits of bitcoin mining,"" said Fred Thiel, CEO of bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), which has some of its operations in Texas.  Industry members and supporters argue that miners' flexibility in powering on and off is an asset to the Texas grid. Miners can fund energy generation capacity when there is little demand for power, and turn off when power is needed for the rest of the grid.  But to critics, such as Texas resident Jackie Sawicky, who has organized hundreds of local residents in a group called Concerned Citizens of Navarro County to campaign against Riot Platforms (RIOT) – one of the largest miners in the state – the program amounts to subsidizing miners for their operations.

In the runup to the significant event – which is also called Shapella – very little ETH appears poised to be withdrawn, according to data from Nansen.  The blockchain analytics firm says nearly 4,000 validators have already unstaked 141,499 ETH (worth about $270 million) that’s currently waiting to be withdrawn. This represents less than 1% of Ethereum’s total validators and staked ETH, according to Nansen. Crypto exchange Huobi is waiting to remove almost 40,000 ETH, making it the largest entity in the withdrawal queue.  All validators cannot withdraw at once; there’s a daily limit. “Currently, eight validators can exit per epoch which is about 1,800 [validators] per day,” Nansen data engineer Edgar Rootalu told CoinDesk over Telegram.  Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization of its native cryptocurrency, will undergo a hard-fork upgrade around 22:27 UTC Wednesday to change its execution and consensus layer. This will complete Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, allowing stakers, who secure the network, to withdraw their staked ETH as well as the rewards they’ve accrued.  Walter Teng, vice president of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CoinDesk in a private message on Twitter there’s a few possibilities from unstaking, “1) restake with [liquid staking derivatives] 2) sell tokens 3) use tokens to lever up 4) hold tokens to sell later.” Teng’s “hunch is that 1 will actually be dominant” and that “everyone is overweight 2.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Sage D.

One potential option discussed was to let FTX's creditors convert a portion of their holdings to a stake in a reopened exchange.  FTX's FTT token more than doubled in price following the news.  Andy Dietderich, the lead attorney for FTX, told the court that re-starting the exchange was one of many potential options being considered for the future of the company.  If that path is taken, Dietderich said, the plan would require significant capital to be raised, and said there was internal debate over whether that capital should come from the FTX estate's capital or third-party capital.  ""There are possibilities that customers could have an option to take part of their proceeds that they would otherwise receive in cash from the estate and receive some kind of an interest in the exchange going forward,"" Dietderich said.

According to the update from Shibburn, 25 million of the total burned tokens came from a single wallet. The community has consistently been burning Shiba Inu, and billions of tokens have entered the dead wallets. The burn initiative is to reduce the meme coin’s circulation and possibly boost its price. Active Shiba Inu Addresses Increase An April 12 update from the SHIB burn tracker, Shibburn, noted that 34,924,913 Shiba Inu tokens entered the dead wallets in 3 transactions. The largest of the three burn transactions came from a Coinbase-linked wallet called Coinbase 10. Related Reading: South Korea Plans A Key Arrest Relating To Terra (LUNA) Crisis On-chain data shows the wallet transferred 25,313,097 SHIB, worth about 25.31 million, to the dead wallets in a single transaction. Following this development, Shiba Inu burn rates spiked by 1,108% against the previous day’s 2.3 billion SHIB tokens burned. Over the past seven days, the Shiba Inu community has burned approximately 1.27 billion SHIB tokens, with the debut token Koyo (KOY) executing the highest. According to reports, Koyo (KOY) initiated an incredibly massive burn transaction on April 9, wiping 1.10 billion SHIB tokens from circulation. The massive spike in burn rate has yielded positive results for the Shiba Inu community as the number of active SHIB holders increased. At press time, approximately 1.28 million unique wallet addresses hold Shiba Inu tokens. And the community expects this to increase further to 1.3 million in no time. SHIB Price Outlook Amid New Community Developments Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu community is still pursuing more ecosystem developments. The developers of Shiba Inu’s metaverse project have released an update regarding the progress of their endeavor. The team unveiled its developmental goals while announcing a new Twitter handle dedicated to increasing the project’s awareness in the crypto community. SHIB is trading in a downtrend below yesterday’s closing price of $0.00001106.

It is trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a short-term bearish sentiment. However, it is still above its 200-day SMA but is descending and might drop below the indicator.

42411174,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQgw,1681319596,Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum's Big Upgrade,"Ethereum is set for its largest upgrade since the Merge, when the most-used crypto network fully transitioned to proof-of-stake. The Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, will finally enable users to unlock their staked ether (ETH) – some of which has been locked up since the “deposit contract” went live in 2020.  Many predict this event could force major selling pressure on ETH. Others say this is just the impetus Ethereum needs to regain institutional interest, as unstable ETH rewards (paid to “validators” who stake their assets to secure the network) could be treated as something like Ethereum’s risk-free rate. In either case, the situation is like anything else in crypto – where it likely made sense to buy ETH weeks or months ago rather than now because many will “sell the news.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Of course, time will tell. CoinDesk has published a number of explainers, guides and articles all about Shanghai and what it could mean for Ethereum going forward. Here’s a quick roundup in case you need to get up to date.  Shanghai + Capella = 'Shapella': How Ethereum Devs Now Refer to Upcoming Upgrade – Margaux Nijkerk  The Shanghai hard fork has been a long time coming. But so has the Capella update. If you’re confused about the nomenclature, CoinDesk tech reporter Margaux Nijkerk has you covered with this account of how both upgrades came to be and what exactly they’ll do. “Technically the Shanghai upgrade is only on the execution side of Ethereum. Capella is the simultaneous upgrade happening on the consensus side,” she writes. Also check out Nijkerk’s “What’s Next After Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade?” to get a sense of all the updates Ethereum developers still plan to make – including the Verge, the Purge, the Scourge and “danksharding.”  Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Looms; Bitcoin's $30K Breakthrough – CoinDesk TV  Hosts of flagship CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover"" discuss the basics of the Shanghai upgrade, expected to take place at 22:27 UTC (6:27 p.m. ET). Part of the conversation, as mentioned, is whether this is a moment to buy or sell the news. Later, Casa CEO Nick Neuman joins to discuss the importance of crypto self-custody. Incidentally, self-custody of ETH is at above average levels, suggesting that many holders are planning to sell their holdings for fiat on crypto exchanges.  Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade: Here’s Our Guide to Watch Parties, Blockchain Tools – Margaux Nijkerk, Sage D. Young  Given the momentous occasion, the Ethereum community plans to celebrate the Shanghai upgrade. CoinDesk tech reporters Margaux Nijkerk and Sage D. Young give a concise rundown of public watch parties as people gather around to see who will be first to unlock their staked ETH. The reporters also give an overview of the analytics tools you can use to watch the event in real time – from Etherscan to open-source Ethereum explorer beaconcha.in. “Look out for epoch 194,048, which is when Shanghai will be triggered,” they write.  Here is What Institutions Are Saying About Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade – Will Canny  “Analysts differ on the amount of ETH selling pressure that could result from the Ethereum blockchain’s Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for later today,” CoinDesk’s Will Canny writes. JPMorgan, for instance, said because some 1 million in ETH staking rewards will soon be available to sell – many will. Coinbase analysts think this “mass sell-off” is overstated. And Bank of America is a bit ambivalent, though looking towards historic price action following the Merge and predicts increased trading volatility, in part due to rising exchange inflows and derivatives trading that typically follows any big announcement.  Glassnode Estimates $300M Ether May be Sold After Shanghai Upgrade – Shaurya Malwa  On-chain analytics firm Glassnode estimates that something like 170K ETH are “intended to be sold after the Shanghai upgrade” though thinks only 100K ETH may ultimately be “withdrawn and sold.” This is based on a “50% withdrawal credential update, our segmentation of depositors, and assumptions regarding investor conviction, and profitability,” according to Glassnode.

Rowe Price, WisdomTree, Wellington Management and Cumberland have joined layer 1 blockchain Avalanche’s Evergreen subnet “Spruce” to make trade execution and settlements more efficient.  Avalanche launched Evergreen earlier this month with the goal of offering a line blockchain-deployment and tooling products for financial institutions. Evergreen subnets are Ethereum Virtual Machine-based chains with a permissioned validator set and a custom gas token to power transactions, according to a press release.  The traditional-finance firms plan to use Spruce as a test network for a variety of applications and assets to measure benefits of on-chain trade execution and settlement, the press release said. The testnet will use valueless tokens allowing institutions to experience full functionality of Avalanche’s Subnet architecture without putting capital at risk.  The move comes as TradFi firms have been pushing deeper into blockchain technology and crypto-related products for the last few years, indicating a promising step toward greater adoption among large financial institutions.  “Participating in the Avalanche Spruce testnet presents a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding and analysis of smart contract technology and the potential applications of public, permissioned blockchains in financial markets,” Blue Macellari, head of digital-assets strategy at T. Rowe Price Associates, said in the release.  Institutions will use decentralized-finance apps on Spruce to execute foreign-exchange and interest-rate swaps, according to the press release.  Avalanche has several EVM-based subnets, including the Intain Subnet, which is a tokenized asset-backed security application, and the Deloitte Subnet, which is a platform for efficient Foreign Exchange Management Act fund disbursements.

11684157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526645,1681317045,"Over 3,000 Validators To Withdraw After Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade","Ethereum (ETH) has been making headlines lately with its upcoming Shanghai upgrade, which promises to bring significant improvements to the network. One of the most anticipated changes is the ability to withdraw staked ETH, which has been a long-standing concern for many users and validators. Now that the upgrade which will allow for the withdrawal of staked ETH is set to happen later today (April 12), a report from the market intelligence platform IntotheBlock shows only 0.6% of validators are interested in withdrawing their staked ETH. According to the report, out of the 562,717 Ethereum validators, only a total of 3,614 opted for withdrawal as of April 10. While this figure is significantly lower than the total validators on the Ethereum network, the chart shows it could still impact the Ethereum price. Run Down On Shanghai Upgrade The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, is a result of the network’s staking system which involves validators locking up a certain amount of ETH in order to participate in the consensus process and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Deposit Plummets As Shanghai Upgrade Draws Near, Here’s Why In return for their efforts, validators are rewarded with additional ETH. However, until now, staked ETH has been locked up and unable to be withdrawn from the network, meaning that users who wanted to participate in staking had to make a long-term commitment to their investment. The ability to withdraw staked ETH has been a much-requested feature for some time, and the upcoming Shanghai upgrade is set to finally make it a reality. With the Shanghai upgrade set to take place later today, users will now be able to withdraw their staked ETH, which is a significant development for the Ethereum 2.0 project. Shanghai Launch Impact On Ethereum Price? So far, there is no accurate answer to how the Ethereum price could react following the Shanghai launch as there are many factors at play in the cryptocurrency market. However, from a technical perspective, ETH could record a notable movement. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum (ETH) Still Trading Below $2,000? In the 1-day time frame, ETH price recently tapped into one of its major highs which indicates the asset might see a retracement. This means Ethereum could see a dip as the Shanghai upgrade commences showing the sell-off of validators that have since been eager to withdraw and take profit. It is worth noting that the retracement or plummet from ETH might not last long as only a small amount of validators are looking to withdraw. In addition, on the price chart, ETH still has an external high just above the $2,000 region. Before Ethereum could see a notable fall after the Shanghai launch, the asset must have climbed above the external high above the $2,000 zone. This is because traders triggering ubiquitous take profit orders on asset charts cause a plummet after external liquidity has been taken. Overall, assuming a large number of users suddenly decide to withdraw their staked ETH at the same time, it could lead to a temporary oversupply of ETH on the market, which could put downward pressure on the price. On the positive side, it is reasonable to assume that the ability to withdraw staked ETH could result in more users wanting to participate in staking to earn rewards for their efforts. This could increase the demand for ETH to stake in the first place and reduce the overall supply of ETH over time.

42411181,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLR7O,1681315420,Could Bitcoin Be the Greatest ESG Investment of All Time?,"If you have any traditional finance (TradFi) background, you know about ESG investing. ESG – which stands for environmental, social and governance – refers to a set of standards used by socially conscious investors to screen potential investments. Typically, people who invest in ESGs are as concerned about gains as they are about their investments having a positive impact on the world.  When you consider all these factors it stands to reason that bitcoin (BTC) could be one of the greatest ESG investments of all time. Not only has it generated outsized returns for investors (at the time of writing this, BTC is up 71% in 2023, 342% over the past three years and a whopping 44,404% over the past 10 years), it is having enormous positive impacts globally.

More bitcoin, less fossil fuels  Bitcoin appears to be one of the few sectors, both in the U.S. and globally, that does not have coal as its primary energy source. A recent report found that because much of BTC mining relies so heavily on off-grid power sources, 52.2% of the Bitcoin network is powered by zero-emission energy. There are at least 29 mining companies that use 90%-100% zero-emission energy and another 12 that use emission-negative sources.  Compare that to the main electrical grid in the U.S., in which only 36.7% comes from zero-emission sources. That means that nearly every other major industry within the U.S. relies on a grid that’s nearly two-thirds powered by fossil fuels.  Bitcoin is also good for our energy grid. As a persistent buyer of electricity, bitcoin mining stabilizes the electrical grid by absorbing any excess energy created, thus improving the operational efficiency of power plants and lowering energy prices for consumers.  More bitcoin, less fossil fuels  Bitcoin appears to be one of the few sectors, both in the U.S. and globally, that does not have coal as its primary energy source.

Source: https://batcoinz.com/bitcoin-by-energy-source/  Increased energy efficiency  In addition to relying mostly on clean energy, the Bitcoin network is far more energy efficient than legacy financial systems. Bitcoin mining accounts for less than 0.2% of global energy usage and only 0.09% of the world’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Bitcoin, often compared to gold as a store of value, uses less energy than gold to mine and has none of the heavy metal pollutants caused by gold mining. Simply replacing gold or the legacy financial system with a bitcoin standard would be a huge net positive for the environment.  Bitcoin is also good for our energy grid. As a persistent buyer of electricity, bitcoin mining stabilizes the electrical grid by absorbing any excess energy created, thus improving the operational efficiency of power plants and lowering energy prices for consumers.  Source: https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1500492844758351875  Incentivizing innovation  Bitcoin’s biggest environmental impact is potentially that it incentivizes innovation and adoption of clean energy sources. Methane gas is about 25 times worse for the environment than carbon dioxide (CO2) and, according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, “cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years.” It turns out that two of the largest methane producers are oil fields and landfills – which bitcoin mining helps address.  Bitcoin mining company Vespene has developed a method for converting the methane emitted from landfills into electricity to power bitcoin mining rigs in an environmentally friendly way, thus eliminating those methane emissions. Also, bitcoin mining using methane-vented power is far more effective at reducing carbon emissions than any other renewable energy source we have.

42411177,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQqr,1681315200,A Technical Analyst’s Take on Crypto,"To some, technical analysis (TA) represents a substantive technique rooted in an asset’s price. To others, it warrants no attention at all because it’s just lines on a screen and self-fulfilling prophecies.  During my stint in traditional finance (TradFi), oftentimes the response was the latter. Fundamental analysis took precedence given all the publicly available data on revenue, debt, managerial statements, etc. The underlying assumption was that if it was good enough for Warren Buffett, then it's good enough for you.  I’m admittedly biased in the opposite direction. I completed the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation in 2018, while still covering traditional equities, no less. I find it useful every day. I don’t subscribe to the “random walk” theory of prices, which states that changes in an asset’s price are completely unpredictable; data, and the charts representing it, can have predictive power.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  TA helps me answer this key question: What if I’m completely wrong? It lets you emotionlessly (well, mostly) decide whether it’s time to exit a position, for instance. If you buy something at $10 and it sinks to $5, you might do the contrarian move and buy more. “If you like it at $10, you love it at $5.” TA can act as a reality check. “I thought the price would rise to $15. I was wrong. Time to get out.”  What is TA? I view it as a graphical representation of investor behavior, with certain patterns and indicators providing a clue about what’s coming next. It has an important place in the three-legged stool of fundamental, technical and quantitative analysis.  While fundamental data is prevalent in TradFi, it doesn’t exist to the same extent in crypto. In fact, the allure of cryptocurrencies to many is the decentralized nature of many of the assets. There is no CEO of bitcoin (BTC), nor is there a balance sheet or statement of cash flows for it. So that’s one leg of the analysis stool that’s missing; it makes sense to pay attention to the other two.  TA encompasses a wide range of topics that goes well beyond looking at lines on a chart and subjective judgments. During my time preparing for the CMT, the emphasis on using hard numbers when making a decision stood out.  For every head-and-shoulders pattern you’ll find a chart showing the historic correlations between one asset and another.  For every falling-wedge pattern there’s a calculation of an asset’s proximity to its 200-day moving average.  For every benchmark within TA there are ways to look back historically to see how well or poorly they’ve performed historically.  For instance, I know very quickly that BTC has breached the upper range of its Bollinger Band three times over the past 25 days. When that happened in January, 30 days later BTC was up 11%. I also know that it’s been 24 days since BTC’s volume was at least twice as high as its 20-day moving average but, despite that, volume on that day doesn’t rank within BTC’s top 50 days since 2015.  From a risk-management perspective. I often use the Average True Range (ATR) metric, to measure an asset’s volatility.  Taking things a step further, I like to look at an asset’s returns, as well as its standard deviation of returns, in comparing one asset to another – essentially distilling what’s seen on a chart into a different format.  Doing so in the following chart shows the risk versus return relationship since January for BTC, ether (ETH), Avalanche’s AVAX, and Binance’s BNB. The S&P 500 (GSPC), Nasdaq (IXIC), Google (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) were added as well just out of curiosity.  This chart highlights BTC’s outperformance while having a slightly lower standard deviation (risk) than ETH. Also displayed is AVAX’s high level of performance, but with significantly more risk.  This should be kept in mind when looking at other technical indicators, specifically momentum and volume. I would also be inclined to perform the same exercise over different time frames.  All told, TA represents an analysis of data, which starts with what you see specific to price. In many ways, it allows you to ignore the noise or the verbal sales pitch that may come along with an asset. That’s possibly even more important as key crypto figures run into trouble this year.  Whether you believe in technical analysis or not, it’s difficult to ignore price. And it's even more difficult to ignore the market’s overall reaction to it. In crypto markets, that will always be worth looking at.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  ETHEREUM UPGRADE: Yet another big, potentially market-moving Ethereum software upgrade is going live Wednesday. CoinDesk has a nice guide to what’s changing and what’s ahead for development of the blockchain.  WALL OF WORRY: TradFi’s collection of colorful aphorisms includes the phrase that markets “climb a wall of worry.” In other words, the thinking goes, prices often rise in the face of bad news. Cryptocurrencies – especially the biggest one, bitcoin – are exemplifying that at the moment. Bitcoin has largely gone straight up this year, nearly doubling in price since New Year’s Eve, amid wave after wave of challenges: key industry figures being accused of wrongdoing, a clear intensification of crypto regulation, etc. This week was a perfect example of that. The New York Times published an exposé arguing that miners cause a huge amount of pollution (a story critiqued by CoinDesk’s David Z. Morris). Not long after, the price of BTC spiked and surpassed $30,000 for the first time since June. So it goes.  THE TWINS: Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss recently loaned Gemini, their crypto platform, $100 million, Bloomberg reported this week. Part of what stands out is that’s also how much Gemini pledged to give their Earn customers whose investments were frozen when Genesis stopped withdrawals late last year. It’s not clear, however, if that pledge is what led the brothers to make the loan.  APPLE’S BITCOIN SECRET: A weird thing about Apple’s computer operating system was a hot topic in recent days: Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 Bitcoin white paper is being distributed with every Mac sold, and that’s been true for several years. Is this an Apple endorsement of the crypto revolution? Is it just a conveniently small PDF file useful for testing? It’s totally unclear.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Glenn Williams Jr., Nick Baker",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/12/a-technical-analysts-take-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f0f80e21f34de6fc183e5f2084242116934bfe9-2121x1193.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The federal court is attempting to unwind the affairs of the FTX after it filed for bankruptcy protection in November, complicated by an apparent lack of reliable records kept by the crypto exchange.  Deltec, a Cayman Islands company whose banking arm serves stablecoin company Tether, “shall and is hereby authorized and directed to pay to Alameda an amount equal to USD 52,859,644,” plus $10,538 in interest per day, bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey said in an order.  The original payment of 50 million in USDT, Tether’s stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, was made from Alameda to Deltec in 2021. The contract was approved by FTX Digital Markets' co-Chief Executive Officer Ryan Salame, purporting to act as director of a further company called Norton Hall, though, according to earlier court filings by FTX, he never held such a position and wasn’t authorized to act as such.  John J. Ray III, a restructuring expert who took over as FTX CEO in November, has repeatedly bemoaned poor governance prior to his tenure. In a Sunday filing, Ray said that Alameda had fabricated portfolio reports, and that records of loans and other financial transactions made by the company were “inaccurate, contradictory or missing entirely.”  A spokesperson for Deltec told CoinDesk it had been attempting to settle the loan since December, but had needed guidance on exactly which entity to repay given uncertainties in the paperwork.  ""With the judge’s ruling, we will now move forward with repayment of the full amount, and are pleased to be able to finally conclude this matter,"" the spokersperson said.

The demand for the collection was intense enough to bring down Reddit’s shop for the avatars for a period following the drop, with some users complaining that the team didn’t implement anti-bot measures such as CAPTCHA.  The Gen3 collection, which is “future realities” themed, according to a post by Reddit, features “Snoo” collectible avatars, the character behind the platform’s logo. The NFTs are Polygon-based and are available for purchase with fiat currency. According to Reddit, the avatars come with a degree of interoperability and allow artists to earn royalties on their work.  “Having collectible Avatars on the blockchain gives you, the purchaser, ownership over your Avatar, no matter where you want to take it, on or off Reddit,” said Reddit. “It also provides artists a way to have their work live beyond the virtual walls of Reddit, and collect royalties on future sales.”  One artist featured in the collection was “Nyan Cat” meme creator Chris Torres who celebrated seeing their Reddit Gen3 NFTs trend on OpenSea.  According to data from blockchain analytics platform Dune Analytics, the Gen3 collection has about $585,000 in sales volume. A chart shows that there are over 7.4 million unique holders across all Reddit-based collections.  Reddit rolled out its NFT marketplace on digital wallet Vault in July, opening up sales of its collectible “Snoo” avatars. By October, over 2.5 million users had opened wallets on the platform, and the collections pumped to volumes close to NFT giant Yuga Labs’ flagship Bored Ape Yacht Club collection.

We’re ending this live blog here. Thanks for tuning in!  7:18 p.m. (BK): Checking back in on that Metrika dashboard. You can see the withdrawals in this screenshot here in the bar on the right:  7:05 p.m. (SDY): The Ethereum Cat Herders watch party just ended. Here's what that looked like:  7:03 p.m. (BK): We just moved a story on what the market's doing. (Not too much tbh but ... it's not down.)  Ethereum Immediately Up 1% After Shanghai Upgrade  7:01 p.m. (MN): Our main story on the upgrade is live here on the CoinDesk website:  Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Is Complete, Starting New Era of Staking Withdrawals  6:59 p.m. (SDY): Roughly a half-hour after the Shanghai upgrade was activated, some 285 withdrawals in epoch 194,408 had been processed, for about 5,413 ETH ($10 million worth), according to beaconcha.in.  6:46 p.m. (MN): Epoch 194,048 has finalized, completing the Shanghai upgrade.  6:37 p.m. (MN): The ether (ETH) price is trading slightly higher after Shanghai, up about 1.4% in past 24 hours, though basically unchanged from where it was right before the upgrade happened.  6:32 p.m. (MN): Got the historic screenshot from beaconcha.in at Epoch 194,048:  6:30 p.m. (BK): Epoch 194,048 reached. Shanghai upgrade has started.  6:25 p.m. (BK): Less than two minutes to go. Last epoch before upgrade. Happens at 194,048. Monitoring here.  6:16 p.m. (BK): Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is speaking at the Ethereum Cat Herders watch party. ""We're in a stage where like the hardest and kind of fastest parts of the Ethereum protocols transition are basically over and like very significant things still need to be done, but those very significant things can be safely done at a at a slower pace."" Currently 2,651 viewers are tuned into this:  6:01 p.m. (MN): The EthStaker x Ethereum Cat Herders livestream has started. Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead for the Ethereum Foundation, is zooming in from Montenegro at an in-person gathering, and running us through what EIPs are included in the Shapella Upgrade. Watch the livestream here.  5:48 p.m. (BK): On the Nethermind YouTube live stream chat, Gorchu posted another data dashboard, this one on Parsec. One chart shows ""ETH Staking Flows,"" with deposits in blue and withdrawals in magenta. Currently only blue bars, no pink:  5:42 p.m. (BK): Just benchmarking a bit. The ETH price is currently around $1,933, up 1.2% over the past 24 hours. Ether hasn't crossed $2,000 since August 2022, for what it's worth.  5:31 p.m. (BK): Basat Gorchu, a decentralized finance (DeFi) research analyst at Nethermind, just said on their watch party that he's monitoring this metrics dashboard on Metrika. It shows that 43% of validators have set their addresses to a 0x01 credential, which is needed to enable withdrawals.  5:27 p.m. (MN): Barnabus Busa and Parithosh Jayanthi, DevOps engineers at the Ethereum Foundation, are among those on the Nethermind watch party. Ahmet Ramazan, a Cryptography Researcher at Nethermind, is talking about “signature aggregation.” It is all quite sedate at the moment.  5:04 p.m. (MN): After some streaming difficulties, Nethermind's YouTube Shapella watch party has started, and Ethereum developers are reflecting on the testing and tooling that has gone into tonight's upgrade. If you're curious about what other watch parties are happening later, check out our watch parties guide here.  3:42 p.m. (MN): It’s getting silly out there. Hudson Jameson, an Ethereum ecosystem veteran who now works on governance at Polygon, just posted this.  3:33 p.m. (MN): Robert Ellison, chief growth officer at Allnodes, a cryptocurrency hosting and staking platform, just emailed with this:  “There is simply no reason or sentiment to rush and withdrawal ETH as most stakers are positive about the long-term viability of Ethereum and view it as a long term commitment. After all, they locked their ETH into place without even knowing when Shanghai was going to be released… Currently the amount of validators waiting to be activated outpaces the exit queue. Any short-term volatility will be very short and mainly due to commitments by institutions like Kraken who have to unwind their Staking services due to regulatory concerns. Even in cases like Kraken, those stakers will simply move to other services like Allnodes or Rocketpool.”     3:06 p.m. (BK): Nicola White, CEO of the crypto liquidity provider B2C2, just told me during a Zoom interview that she expects Ethereum transactions to slow down for a while as the Shanghai upgrade goes live, because many traders and users will be waiting to make sure everything goes smoothly. ""Most people will pause settlements,"" she said. ""You'll see the blockchain slow down quite a bit as people make sure everything's working.""  2:50 p.m. (BK): On CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program Wednesday, RockX CEO Zhuling Chen said he thinks Shanghai will prove to be a ""game changer"" as staking becomes more prevalent, providing a boost to blockchain-based money markets. ""If you think about it, this is the first time that Ethereum has a long-term, market-risk-free yield curve that can actually go for a long run,"" Zhuling said. CoinDesk's Fran Velasquez has the story, and the full video of the interview is below.  2:44 p.m. (SDY): Just out with this story based on data from the blockchain-analysis firm Nansen: Only a Tiny Amount of ETH Is Poised to Be Withdrawn After Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, Nansen Says. In the run-up to the significant event, very little ETH appears ready to be withdrawn. Nansen data shows that nearly 4,000 validators have already unstaked 141,499 ETH (worth about $270 million) that's waiting to be withdrawn. This represents less than 1% of Ethereum's total validators and staked ETH each.  1:59 p.m. (BK): The website wenmerge.com has this countdown widget. Queue the Prince.  1:24 p.m. (BK): ZkSync Era, the zero-knowledge rollup on Ethereum that went live a couple weeks ago with a big splash (h/t to Margaux for that scoop), released an update on its operational plans for later in the day when Shanghai goes live. Probably a lot of teams are doing stuff like this.  1:13 p.m. (BK): CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn just published this: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum's Big Upgrade. He highlighted a piece out earlier in the day by our Shaurya Malwa citing the blockchain-analysis firm Glassnode with the estimate that some $300 million of ether might be sold after the Shanghai upgrade. It might sound like a lot, but according to the Glassnode report, that amount of selling pressure could be absorbed quickly: “Even in the extreme case where the maximum amount of rewards and stake are withdrawn and sold, the sell-side volume still falls within the range of the average weekly exchange inflow volume. Therefore, we conclude that even the most extreme case will have an acceptable impact on the price of ETH.”  1:10 p.m. (BK): Bank of America analysts noted in a report last week that Shapella ""acts as a precursor for future upgrades, providing a small step forward,” as reported earlier Wednesday by CoinDesk contributor Will Canny. ""Ethereum’s 'long-term viability' is dependent on the execution of its development roadmap, the report said. This includes the implementation of a sharding approach called Danksharding, which aims to reduce the costs of transactions originating on scaling solutions and cut the processing and storage requirements for validators,"" Canny wrote. Note that the dank-sounding ""danksharding"" and the perhaps even danker-sounding ""proto-danksharding"" were featured in Margaux's piece out Tuesday on what comes next after Shanghai.  1:04 p.m. (BK): QCP Capital not sounding so bullish in its Telegram broadcast just out:  We fail to see what the bullish case can be for this event as those at the front of the queue are likely to sell spot, while those further back will be hedging via perps/futures if they have not already done so. The market has already seen bearish price action in anticipation of this event, with ETH underperforming BTC in recent weeks. ETH/BTC has broken through the key support level of 0.658, and can potentially head back to 0.0553 (See chart), as continued and sustained spot selling pressure in thin markets for days after Shapella leads to further bearish price action on ETH. This can also potentially drag down the broader market.  12:37 p.m. (MN): Ethereum developers' comments continue to roll in showcasing their faith in tonight's Shapella upgrade. ""I’m feeling confident that our rigorous testing will be fruitful this evening, and looking forward to a smooth Shapella activation. I’m curious to see how the withdrawal/deposit queues will play out in a few months of time,” said Barnabas Busa, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to me via DM on Discord.  12:20 p.m. (MN): RockX CEO Zhuling Chen told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" this morning that the Shapella upgrade will be a game changer. ""From the dapps or application layer, we're expecting a lot of innovative financial products, and also, different types of new products.""  12:10 p.m. (MN): Nansen, a leading blockchain data provider, has released its Shanghai Upgrade dashboard so eager folks can track ETH deposits and withdrawals once Shapella is live. The Withdrawal Queue list is already starting to pick up!  12:01 p.m. (MN): CoinDesk caught up with Ethereum DevOps engineer Parithosh Jayanthi, who was in charge of much of the testing for Shapella. ""I'm feeling quite good about Shapella, it somehow feels very different than the adrenaline fuelled rush before the Merge,"" Jayanthi told CoinDesk via DM on Discord. ""We made some last minute checks that we've updated all of our nodes and now I'm looking forward to the watch parties to start!""  11:30 a.m. (BK): ICYMI here's a link to our roundup of all the Shanghai watch parties planned for Wednesday night, and a bunch of other great web tools that people can use to monitor the action on the blockchain – compiled by Ethereum beat reporter extraordinaire Margaux Nijkerk and blockchain-data-master Sage D. Young: Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade: Here’s Our Guide to Watch Parties, Blockchain Tools.  11:26 a.m. (BK): Galaxy Digital's Christine Kim put together a cool primer on what to watch for. She tweeted this out April 6 but we were just having a look and she does a really good job of breaking down some of the technical stuff. A teaser: ""The major code change in Shapella is EIP 4895, which adds a new system-level operation to support validator withdrawals. The addition of withdrawal functionality to the Ethereum codebase represents the final step in completing the network’s multi-year transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol.""  11:17 a.m. (BK): One of the biggest unknowns about the Shanghai upgrade is how the price of ether (ETH) will trade through it all. CoinDesk reporter Lyllah Ledesma has a story out showing just how spilt crypto market analysts are in their predictions. ""Some observers expect an ether price swoon after the upgrade as users liquidate their holdings, while others believe the expected uptick in the selling pressure is already baked in and the market will bounce after the event in a classic 'buy the news' move,"" Ledesma wrote.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Margaux Nijkerk, Sage D.

According to a Bloomberg report, Bank of America strategists, Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss, believe the rally will continue in 2023. They stated that the recent flow of funds between exchanges and personal crypto wallets backed up their Bitcoin price forecasts. The analysts attributed the movement of tokens from exchanges to concerns over regulatory pressure on digital platforms. Before April 4, $368 million in BTC tokens were transferred to personal wallets. This transfer is the second-largest net bitcoin outflow for crypto exchanges in 2023. The strategists believe that the current trend reflects a decrease in sell pressure. They noted that investors move tokens from exchanges to personal wallets when they plan on holding them. What Lies Ahead For Bitcoin? Bitcoin shows a red candle on the daily chart as the bears seek to drive its price down.

Bitcoin price surges on the chart l BTCUSDT on Tradingview.comBitcoin has turned its resistance levels into support, indicating that it will likely form higher highs on the daily chart. Expect Bitcoin to trade above $30,000 in the coming days after a brief retracement. Other Analysts Share Thoughts On BTC On Twitter earlier this week, Peter Brandt predicted a breakout for Bitcoin. From his chart structure, the analyst predicted that BTC would sustain its uptrend. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, also shared similar sentiments, which he revealed in a recent CNBC interview. He believes the rally is fueled by the crypto community, not institutional investors. Related Reading: South Korea Plans A Key Arrest Relating To Terra (LUNA) Crisis Novogratz explained further that the adoption cycle always accelerates when the price increases. He dismissed allegations of market manipulation, stating that it is difficult to manipulate large-cap assets like Bitcoin and Ether. According to Novogratz, it is almost impossible to sway a $1 trillion market, but common with smaller crypto projects. He believes the market has shown resilience despite regulatory hiccups such as the Wells notices handed to Coinbase and Paxos. Also, he stated that BTC’s previous decline from $60,000 stemmed from the aggressive interest rate policy adopted by Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman.

Users are able to redeem their share of recovered funds, which stand at 95,556 ether (ETH) and $43 million of the DAI stablecoin, collectively worth about $223 million based on current prices. The price of EUL, the native governance token of the Euler Protocol, has increased 2.5% in the past 24 hours, but has slid 9.4% in the past week, per CoinGecko  Euler Finance suffered a $200 million exploit in March, and by April the protocol had successfully recovered most of the capital it lost. Reopening redemptions represents a positive ending for the saga, a fairly rare occurrence when protocols get exploited; for instance, the $625 million taken from Axie Infinity’s Ronin network, orchestrated by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, has not been returned, although Sky Mavis, the firm developing Axie, raised $150 million to reimburse users.  Several users in Euler's Discord have expressed gratitude and disbelief that they were able to retrieve their funds. A community member who goes by Fredda said, “I cannot believe I actually got my money back.” Another user called Holden wrote, “Thanks for getting this done so quickly and professionally.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) slipped under the $30,000 level in early European hours on Wednesday, with overall market capitalization falling 1.2% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) traded just over $1,860, down 3%, leading the drop among major tokens. Ether dipped ahead of the Ethereum network's major upgradetaking place later today at 22:27 UTC (6:27 p.m. ET). Exchanges liquidated just over $30 million worth of leveraged futures bets during Wednesday's price drop, of which, more than 90% were longs or bullish bets. In addition to the Ethereum network upgrade, traders were likely also taking profits ahead of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report for March, which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.  A report by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode estimates at least $300 million worth of selling pressure after the Shanghai upgrade today. “We estimate a total of 170K ETH intended to be sold after the upgrade,” Glassnode said in a report. “We project that only 100K ETH ($190M) of the total accumulated rewards will be withdrawn and sold.” Glassnode said the estimate was made based on a “50% withdrawal credential update, our segmentation of depositors, and assumptions regarding investor conviction, and profitability” by using wallet behavior, period of staking and presence of liquid staking derivative products, such as Lido.  Tron’s TRX token has been delisted by Binance.US. This comes weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Tron's Justin Sun over allegations of selling and airdropping unregistered securities, fraud and market manipulation involving the TRX token. TRX dropped 6.4% on the news, according to CoinDesk market data. Binance.US says trading for TRX will end on April 18.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows weekly changes in the total crypto market valuation since 2018.  On Tuesday, market valuation surpassed the $1.2 trillion mark, ending weeks of consolidation and hitting the highest since June.  The move higher is reminiscent of the bull revival seen four years ago.  ""The April-May 2019 framework is playing right on cue with the crypto finally breaking the $1.15T on the global MCAP index after 26 days of battle,"" Decentral Park Capital's portfolio manager Lewis Harland said.  ""This break could echo the April-May 2019 period when crypto tried to break above the $180B mark for 35 days before gaining 100% 49 days afterward (red),"" Harland added.

42412337,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4bje,1681311797,"Stablecoins Need to Be Regulated Like Commercial Bank Money, Bank of England's Andrew Bailey Says","Stablecoins would need to be regulated like commercial bank money, said Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey in a Wednesday speech at the Institute of International Finance.  Bailey said that stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to the value of other assets like fiat currencies, ""purport"" to be money but do not have an assured value.  ""At the Bank of England we have concluded that the public should expect assured value in digital money, and confidence in this is needed to underpin financial stability,"" Bailey said.  ""For stablecoins to function as money they will need to have the characteristics of, and be regulated as, inside money,"" he added, referring to money issued by private entities like commercial banks.  The collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) last year wiped out billions of dollars from the crypto market and prompted regulators to question the stability of stablecoins.  Shortly after the collapse last May, the BoE announced plans for a regime to monitor stablecoins that can influence the broader financial system. The U.K. government is also consulting on new rules for crypto broadly. Separately, the country is looking to regulate stablecoins as payment under the new Financial Services and Markets Bill being debated in Parliament.  Read more: What the Bank of England’s Stablecoins Regime Could Look Like  When it comes to digital money, regulators cannot rule out a central bank digital currency, said Bailey who has previously been critical of stablecoins.  The U.K. is now exploring the issuance of a digital pound that could ""anchor the value of all forms of money, including new digital ones and to ensure the maximum opportunity for innovation in payments services,"" according to the central banker.  Bailey also urged investors to be cautious of crypto.  ""Unbacked crypto ... could be a bet, a highly speculative investment or a collectible, but note that it has no intrinsic value, so buyer be very aware,"" Bailey said.  Speaking later in the day at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual Spring Meeting, Bailey gave a warning about the problems that can come from the nonbank world, including crypto.  ""Some of these problems can blow up in fairly small pockets of that world, but they have the ability to spread in ways that we didn't necessarily initially predict,"" Bailey said.

Most coins are trading in the red zone, with some surrendering past week’s gains. But a few coins showed resilience, trading in green with most of their past week’s gains intact. Among these is Injective (INJ), holding over 23% on the weekly chart when top coins turned bearish. INJ is among the coins trading with gains today, with a 7.85% price increase in the last 24 hours. But that’s not all; the token registered a more than 74% price increase over the past 30 days. INJ Price Could Derive Support From Ecosystem Developments Investor sentiment on most coins has turned bearish as the market expects the release of the March CPI data today, April 12. It manifested in the ongoing market-wide downturn, which pressed down cryptocurrency prices across the crypto market. Why is INJ soaring when other crypto prices slumped? Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slowdown At $30,000 Only Temporary, Here’s Why The answer could be in the various ongoing ecosystem developmental projects. The injective community recently voted for a governance proposal 219 that will allow Pyth Network to migrate to the Injective mainnet. According to the report, the migration will make Injective the only IBC-enabled L1 protocol to have Pyth on-chain. It would allow users seamless access to crypto and real-world asset data. On April 11, the Pyth network successfully launched on the Injective mainnet. To celebrate the integration, Injective announced a $5,000 hackathon prize for developers building on the blockchain. This and other ecosystem developments must have contributed to INJ’s price performance. INJ Bucks Bearish Trends With Impressive Rallies, Will it Continue? INJ launched via a public offering in 2020 and became the first Binance Labs-supported project to debut on the Binance Launchpad. The token has performed incredibly well since its launch with an over 1,536% price increase. The token’s current price is 898.36% higher than its all-time low price of $0.6557, recorded on November 3, 2020. Nevertheless, INJ is yet to fully recover from the impact of the 2022 bear market that pulled it down from its all-time high of $25.01 recorded on April 30, 2021. Although its current price is 73.53% lower than the all-time high, INJ has registered notable gains this year. The token price increased by more than 416% since January 1, when it opened the day at $1.2714. At press time, INJ is trading at $6.80, with a 24-hour price increase of 7.85%, a 5% rally yesterday, and a 23.91% 7-day price gain. Related Reading: Fantom Transaction Fees Hit 6-Month High – Exploring Price Impact Of The Surge Following technical indicators, INJ is trading above the 200-day exponential moving average.

42412329,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4bhm,1681309670,Warren Buffett Calls Bitcoin a 'Gambling Token',"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett described bitcoin (BTC) as a ""gambling token"" in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday.  Echoing the dour opinion of the cryptocurrency that he has aired in the past, the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) chairman and CEO said bitcoin ""doesn't have any intrinsic value ... but that doesn't stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel.""  Commenting on gambling in general, Buffett said: ""The urge to participate in something that looks like easy money is a human instinct which was always there.""  Buffett is well known to be no fan of bitcoin, having referred to it as ""probably rat poison squared"" in 2018.  His top deputy, Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, has been even more outspoken over his disdain for cryptocurrency over the years, earlier this year calling for the U.S. to copy China and ban it.  ""It's a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house, entered into in a country where gambling contracts are traditionally regulated only by states that compete in laxity,"" Munger wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. ""The U.S. should now enact a new federal law that prevents this from happening.""

The committee – a group of people from traditional finance, academia and consumer advocacy groups – sent Gensler a letter dated last week that included a sliver of agreement with the years of requests from cryptocurrency businesses that the SEC give them some official word on how to meet the regulator’s expectations.  “The SEC should consider issuing a request for comment regarding areas where additional guidance is needed related to the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets,” according to the letter. “The SEC can then use this input to craft additional guidance or propose rules to address issues identified.”  Gensler has repeatedly stated that there’s no need to treat crypto firms any differently than other financial businesses, and longstanding securities laws are ample for regulating the fledgling industry. He’s revealed no outward interest in issuing guidance or working on tailored rules for digital assets.  However, the advisory group – led by Chair Christopher Mirabile of Launchpad Venture Group and Vice Chair Leslie Van Buskirk, the administrator of the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions’ securities division – backed him on almost everything else, including that “virtually all, if not all, crypto tokens are securities and that they, as well as the platforms and custodians dealing with them, are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws.” Industry representatives have argued that most cryptocurrencies are not securities as defined under U.S. law.  The letter also argued against legislation that would establish any separate treatment of crypto.  “We think it is very unfortunate and disturbing that there are legislative proposals to carve crypto assets out of the federal securities laws and undermine investor protection,” it said, suggesting the SEC should oppose such congressional efforts.  The committee also advised the agency to “aggressively continue to assert authority over crypto assets” and keep making enforcement a “top priority.”  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/12/sec-advisory-group-backs-genslers-crypto-efforts-but-asks-for-industry-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bff2ad8ee6ed56b8f423ecee2f8ff84567888550-5430x3055.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio Has Sharply Surged Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, market participants have responded to the price surge by opening high-leverage positions. The “estimated leverage ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin open interest and derivative exchange reserve. Here, the former is a metric that measures the total amount of positions that investors have opened on the futures market, while the latter tells us about the supply sitting in the wallets of all derivative exchanges. When the leverage ratio has a high value, it means the average futures contract holder is taking on a high amount of leverage, implying that users are willing to take on high risk right now. Generally, such market conditions lead to the price of the cryptocurrency turning more volatile. On the other hand, low values of the metric suggest the holders aren’t willing to take on much leverage currently. Naturally, the BTC value can become more stable while this kind of trend lasts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Soars to 10-Month Highs – Where is the Resistance Toward $40K? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin estimated leverage ratio over the last few weeks: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin estimated leverage ratio has rapidly risen in the last couple of days as the price of the cryptocurrency has broken above the $30,000 mark for the first time in about 10 months. This means that investors have started to open positions on the futures market with a high amount of average leverage. When leverage is high in the market, a large number of liquidations can take place at once if a sharp enough swing in the price takes place. Such mass liquidations generally only end up fueling the price move that caused them further, thus leading to even more liquidations in the process. When liquidations cascade together in this fashion, the event is termed a “liquidation squeeze.” This type of occurrence is the reason why markets with high leverage can turn quite volatile. Since the leverage ratio has shot up recently, a squeeze may now be more probable to take place in the near future. Any volatility that may result from this, however, can go either way. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Shows Signs Of Euphoria, Will $30,000 Be Lost? But considering that the indicator’s value has risen with the price, it’s possible that a lot of long positions have amassed in the market, implying that a long squeeze may be more likely. If such a squeeze does take place, the price would take a bearish hit. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,000, up 5% in the last week.

42411165,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQDB,1681303500,The AI 'Pause' Proposal Is Deceptive and Alarmingly Hazardous,"Last month, several tech giants signed a letter calling for a six-month pause on training artificial intelligence (AI) models more powerful than GPT-4.  This letter is dangerous and should provoke thoughtful citizens. In it, the signatories claim that a pause will allow humanity more time to understand and respond to the potential risks of AI. The letter itself serves to rally public support for OpenAI and its allies as they consolidate their dominance, build an extended innovation lead and secure their advantage over a technology of fundamental importance to the future. If this occurs, it will irreparably harm Americans – our economy and our people.  Peter Vessenes is a technologist and investor with deep roots in digital currency, tokenization and blockchain. An early adopter of Bitcoin, he co-founded the Bitcoin Foundation in 2012 and was the first crypto industry person to advise the U.S. Senate GAO, the U.S. Treasury Department and other agencies about Bitcoin.  GPT-4 and similar foundation models promise to increase human capacity by 1,000 times, driving social change in many arenas of life. The industry as currently structured is likely to solidify a cabal deciding who benefits from this technology.  Imagine if, in 1997, Microsoft and Dell had issued a similar “Pause” letter, urging a halt to browser innovation and a ban on new e-commerce sites for six months, citing their own research that the internet would destroy brick-and-mortar stores and aid terrorist finance. Today we'd recognize this as self-serving alarmism and a regulatory capture attempt.  The “Pause” letter is no different. A few outspoken, charming leaders are making a power grab in the guise of protecting us from AI dangers. They have positioned themselves as the sole arbiters of what tech the world gets to see and use, and deciders of what makes an AI “accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy and loyal.”  It's wrong for a handful of billionaires to decide what's good and safe for the world. Even well-intentioned AI leaders should not hold such power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The world is in a race toward next-generation foundation models. Nobody racing will halt or even slow research and development. Independent AI labs and foreign rivals, eager to integrate advanced AI into their systems, won't pause; they will continue relentlessly.  How can we ensure all humans benefit from the 1,000x improvement AI offers us? The only way is through free and open development, including sharing capabilities, methodologies and network checkpoints. For example, for years, EleutherAI has been leading the way, resisting scam warnings that GPT-2 and GPT-3 were “too dangerous” for the public, fearlessly releasing research and models. We need 100 to 1,000x the scale of EleutherAI, globally. (Note: This author is not affiliated with EleutherAI.)  We should not pause. Right now we all must prioritize, invest in, contribute to and broadly publish genuinely open AI models. We must remain on guard against those who seek to control humanity's destiny.  Eleven years ago, early pioneers in the blockchain space pulled together and formed the Bitcoin Foundation, a model for crypto-industry organization balancing out the needs and goals of private individuals with those of the companies that would make crypto thrive. The Foundation encompassed many kinds of people and many goals, but we were united in wanting Bitcoin to thrive outside the control of any single group or cabal. I believe something similar is needed for AI technology, taking the best lessons from the last decade and more of decentralized technology and matching it with a fierce commitment to independence, humanity and openness.  The proposed pause would consolidate control of AI development among the wealthy and powerful. Instead, let us race forward together and in the open. I invite the like-minded, the skeptical and the curious to discuss how we can achieve a better future.

In a tweet, the team shared that a hacker siphoned liquidity from Terraport Finance. Nearly 9.5 million TERRA, 15 billion LUNC and 5.5 million USTC were stolen by the hacker. Subsequently, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao shared that his team reviewed the transactions and found that no funds were deposited on Binance – unlike MEXC and KuCoin, where deposits were detected. Was The Terraport Finance “Hack” An Inside Job? A Terra Classic developer and prominent community member, @CosmoSreXx, popularly known as reXx, has raised serious allegations against the Terraport Finance developers yesterday. He claims that the Terraport hack was actually a rugpull. The developer investigated the incident and found that three wallets hard-coded into the Terraport source code were responsible for the exploit. For him, this is clear evidence of a rugpull, as long as the developers of Terra Classic’s DeFi application do not make the full source code public. I do understand that this code is closed source to ""protect"" it's value, but as it sits right now. There is no value and people have been rugged. Closing out communications and being no responsive/addressing the issue does not make this situation any better. — reXx™ (@CosmoSreXx) April 11, 2023 “Without the full transparency of the other parties involved (@TerracVita and _Terraport_) we can only go based of what we (me and 2 other individuals) have uncovered from the encryption. To have a concrete answer, we need to see the source code (though I know it was changed),” reXx elaborated. Related Reading: LUNC: Unveiling Terra Classic NFTs That Could Spark A Price Resurgence The developer expressed understanding that the source code is closed to protect its value. However, the situation makes it necessary, moreover, closing the communication and not reacting to the problem is a bad sign. “I’ve come to the conclusion that this is an inside job. I am not saying all team members of Terraport knew/were apart of this, but this leads back to who coded this DEX,” concluded reXx, who also referred to an audit he requested that was never conducted. Related Reading: South Korea Plans A Key Arrest Relating To Terra (LUNA) Crisis On April 2, reXx pointed out several security vulnerabilities in the Terraport platform code. According to the developer, a CertiK audit would have cost up to $50,000. He also noted that the code was implemented back in January and the team should have identified it since then. If anyone is going to publicly swear up and down that Terraport was “hacked” and not RUGPULLED (it’s obvious with blockchain data) then prove it. Should be a simple task to do to back up your claim. Terra Classic (LUNC) Price Stuck In Downtrend At press time, the LUNC price stood at $0.00012235, down 4% in the last 24 hours. A look at the 1-day chart of LUNC shows that the price has been in a downtrend since it emerged after the Terra Luna collapse. The price has formed a falling triangle pattern. Any attempts to break above the resistance line have failed so far. The support line at $0.000116 is the mark that is currently preventing a plunge to a new all-time low.

""We fail to see what the bullish case can be for this event as those at the front of the queue [in withdrawals] are likely to sell spot, while those further back will be hedging via perps/futures if they have not already done so,"" QCP noted.  Users cannot withdraw the entire stack of over 18 million staked ether immediately after the upgrade. However, just over 1 million ETH earned in staking rewards can be pulled out immediately.

11677750,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526593,1681299037,"Bitcoin’s Slowdown At $30,000 Only Temporary, Here’s Why","After seeing an explosive start to the week and breaking above $30,000 for the first time in over nine months, Bitcoin has begun to cool out price-wise. However, this cooldown that has dragged its price below $30,000 once more could only end up being a short stop as indicators point to more bullish movements to come. Bitcoin Investors Are Still Accumulating Despite the drawdown in price, it has not deterred Bitcoin investors from filling up their bags. A notable example of this was a large BTC transaction that was recorded on Tuesday. The transaction carried a total of 23,500 BTC worth over $710 million to a single receiver, making it the fourth-largest transaction of the year. Interestingly, this transaction was not made to an exchange, but rather to a large BTC holder, pointing to accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Touches 11-Month High Ahead Of Shapella Upgrade Centralized exchange net flows are also pointing to accumulation among investors. Glassnode reports that there was a total of $1.2 billion in BTC flowing out of exchanges in the last 24 hours. Such trends where investors are moving their coins out of exchanges always point to a long-term hold mentality which is usually bullish for the price of the digital asset. BTC sending addresses drop to 11-month low | Source: Glassnode Investors are also moving their coins around at a much lower rate the number of sending BTC addresses on a 7-day moving average dropped to a new 11-month low. All of these indicate that investors are choosing to hold their coins to wait for better price headwinds. Crypto Market Gripped By Greed In addition to the accumulation trend, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index also shows that investors are still very bullish in the market. The index is currently sitting at a score of 65 which indicates high levels of greed in the market. While greed can sometimes be a precursor of a downward correction, the index has maintained this level for the last week, and it is yet to reach the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory that usually marks the peak of a rally. BTC recovers above $30,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com With such positive sentiment, investors are more likely to purchase the digital asset as euphoria sets in and more people expect the digital asset’s price to continue to climb. As long as this bullish sentiment continues to hold, then support will mount at $30,000, giving BTC the boost it needs to take on $35,000. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum (ETH) Still Trading Below $2,000? At the time of writing, BTC is trending at $30,030 after falling to the $29,000 level briefly.

42410806,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrhXq,1681297904,Crypto Analysts Split on Ether Market Trends After Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade,"The Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai upgrade (or “Shapella”) is almost here. The backward-incompatible hard fork will allow users to access some $30 billion worth of ether locked in the network since the tail end of 2020.  Some observers expect an ether price swoon after the upgrade as users liquidate their holdings while others believe the expected uptick in the selling pressure is already baked in and the market will bounce after the event in a classic “buy the news” move.  Henry Elder, head of decentralized finance at Wave Digital Assets, sees the upgrade as a clear “sell the news” event for ether and for governance tokens of liquid staking solutions like Lido, which have been rallying since early January in anticipation of the hard fork.  “We should expect the withdrawal queue to fill up immediately, and stay full for several weeks,” Elder said. “This will look like fulfillment of the ‘supply deluge’ narrative and markets will likely sell off.”  Elder added: “Most withdrawals will probably come from early individual stakers who now want to rotate into liquid staking solutions, and early users of now dominant staking solutions who want to rotate into minority staking solutions to increase decentralization.”  While the entire stack of over 18 million coins cannot be withdrawn immediately, partial withdrawals of just over one million coins earned as rewards for staking, can be processed immediately. That one million ETH represents a potential post-upgrade selling pressure.  According to Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, ether has rallied ahead of the event and could come under pressure upon successful implementation of the upgrade.  “Traders have bought the news in advance of the Shanghai event, and if the event is successful they will dump their ETH on the market,” said Kssis. He predicts traders selling their ether following the upgrade in the view that they’ve made money for their locked up time and this will result in a strong supply of ether flooding the market.  Kssis said he sees ether possibly dropping below $1,700 for the first time in two weeks as investors take profits through.  At press time, ether traded near $1,875, representing a 56% year-to-date gain, per CoinDesk data. The LDO governance token of Lido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol with some $8.4 billion of staked ether on the platform has gained 26% since the start of the year, while Competitor Rocket Pool’s RPL has gained 70% since January.  Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, suggested otherwise, saying the market is overly pessimistic about the supply-side effects of upcoming staking withdrawals.  “Factors such as existing liquidity access for most stakers, withdrawal queue limitations, and a market that has de-risked prior to the Shapella upgrade reduce the risk of a sudden supply overhang,” Farrell said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “With that in mind, it's reasonable to expect an ether-bitcoin [ETH/BTC] rally in the weeks following the completion of the event,” Farrel added.  While ether has charted double-digit gains this year, the cryptocurrency has underperformed market leader bitcoin by a considerable margin. Bitcoin has rallied over 70% this year. The ether-bitcoin ratio has declined 13.6%. That’s contrary to the rise of around 58% in the month before Ethereum implemented a software upgrade called Merge in September last year.  The decline in ether-bitcoin suggests fears of a post-upgrade supply boost have been priced in to some extent. Besides, several industry experts, including Galaxy Digital, have recently said that the selling pressure from partial withdrawals will be distributed over several days.  “We expect 553,650 ETH will be sold. Amortized over 7 days, this amounts to approximately 1% of daily ETH volume (including spot and perpetual futures volume) of selling per day for a week,” analysts at Galaxy Digital said in a note published early this month. “Depending on the risk environment broadly and overall liquidity in ether during the Shanghai upgrade, expected on Wednesday, April 12, we view this amount as ranging from inconsequential to slightly bearish ETH/USD.”",NEUTRAL,ETH | RPL,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RPL | FORKS,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/12/crypto-analysts-split-on-ether-market-trends-after-ethereums-shanghai-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e157200149010a7c3257a04d4787b3e840080d9f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412354,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dUA,1681297566,Glassnode Estimates $300M Ether May Be Sold After Shanghai Upgrade,"While analysts from traditional banks remained mixed on the market impact of ether (ETH) after the much-awaited Shanghai upgrade later Wednesday, an on-chain report from Glassnode estimates at least $300 million worth of selling pressure.  “We estimate a total of 170K ETH intended to be sold after the Shanghai upgrade,” Glassnode said in a Tuesday report, citing on-chain data. “We project that only 100K ETH ($190M) of the total accumulated rewards will be withdrawn and sold.”  Glassnode said the estimate was made based on a “50% withdrawal credential update, our segmentation of depositors, and assumptions regarding investor conviction, and profitability” by using wallet behavior, period of staking and presence of liquid staking derivative products, such as Lido.  But bulls may have little reason to fear because the selling pressure is likely to be absorbed quickly and have a smaller overall impact on ether prices.  “Even in the extreme case where the maximum amount of rewards and stake are withdrawn and sold, the sell-side volume still falls within the range of the average weekly exchange inflow volume. Therefore, we conclude that even the most extreme case will have an acceptable impact on the price of ETH,” Glassnode wrote.  Shappella – a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that are expected to occur simultaneously on April 12 – will allow investors to withdraw their ether staked on the Ethereum blockchain. Staked ether cannot be withdrawn or freely traded currently.  Banks such as JPMorgan (JPM) say ether will likely face some selling pressure from the upgrade as more than one million ether staking rewards become instantly available this week.  If you add potential additional selling from staked ether balances that belong to “troubled entities,” then the selling pressure may be larger in the coming weeks, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote, as CoinDesk reported. The bank says it expects ether to underperform bitcoin (BTC) over the next few weeks.  Meanwhile, Glassnode noted as many as 1,229 validators have already signed a voluntary exit message to signal their wish to unstake tokens after the Shapella upgrade.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/12/glassnode-estimates-300m-ether-may-be-sold-after-shanghai-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2e01789e11efd1ac4465f5d2a6c03af1ee92ddf-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A rise in open interest, which is a metric that assesses the value of all unsettled derivatives positions, alongside an increase in price is often used to confirm the legitimacy of a move. At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at around $30,000 after it surged to a 10-month high of $30,540 on Tuesday.  Zahreddine Touag, head of trading at Woorton, a crypto trading firm and liquidity provider, said that bitcoin broke out in a ""global risk-on environment,"" with the Nasdaq also rising by 10% in the last 30 days.  ""We think this move is driven by technicals, BTC broke a major resistance at $28.5k and rebounded on its 2023 bullish trendline,"" Touag said.  ""We noticed futures open interest has been moving up vertically which shows more participation from crypto traders and a bullish market sentiment,"" he added.  ""For now, we do not see signs of extreme exuberance; indeed, the fear and greed index is at 61, funding rates are still negative on many exchanges for BTC while short-sellers did not capitulate yet. We will monitor these metrics to predict a potential trend reversal.""  It's worth noting that an increase in open interest means that whilst short-sellers have added to their shorts in this region, traders betting on long trades are doing so with leverage that may unwind if price begins to reverse.  A total of $98 million in crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours as bitcoin momentarily slipped below $30,000, according to CoinGlass.

42410808,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrhb9,1681297200,"Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade on Deck; Developers, Traders Aflutter With Anticipation","Ethereum blockchain enthusiasts are turning their attention to the blockchain’s big Shanghai upgrade, enabling the first-ever withdrawals of staked ether (ETH) and completing the network’s historic transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network.  The upgrade (also known as Shapella) is expected to take place around 6:30 p.m. ET (22:30 UTC).  If you’re eager to follow what the experts are expecting from tonight's upgrade, we have you covered. (We’ll be covering the event live on CoinDesk, with key updates on Twitter (@CoinDesk), and there’s also this mainnet watch party hosted by the Ethereum Cat Herders starting at 5:45 p.m. ET.)  Read More: Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade: Here’s Our Guide to Watch Parties, Blockchain Tools  When the Shanghai hard fork goes live  Shanghai will go live at the epoch 194048, around 22:27 UTC (6:27 p.m. ET), allowing stakers to finally put their requests in for ether withdrawals immediately thereafter.  Ethereum developers say they’re feeling confident the upgrade will go smoothly. Developers have run through three different testnet upgrades and all worked smoothly, though the last testnet upgrade did not finalize when it was originally supposed to because not enough nodes upgraded in time.  Although there were some minor hiccups in the last trial run, developers assured CoinDesk there wouldn’t be similar issues on the day of the upgrade.  The Ethereum Foundation doubled its “bug bounty” program awards to $500,000 ahead of Shanghai to encourage individuals to report any vulnerabilities they could find.  “There’s always a chance that there could be unfound bugs, but we feel that we tested the upgrade extensively and weren't able to find any issues that prevent us from scheduling the upgrade,” said Parithosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation.  To ensure that stakers can access withdrawals, developers have urged node operators to make sure they are running the latest version of their software clients.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  How might the market react?  Crypto market analysts have weighed in on how ether might trade as Shanghai goes live.  According to a report from Coinbase, the performance of ETH will more likely have to do with the risk environment than any idiosyncrasies associated with the upgrade. The Coinbase report says that “if the trading environment sees risk assets selling off, people may decide to unstake and sell ETH just to de-risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively on the buy side.”  However, there are some technicalities that can limit the amount of ETH that can be unstaked at once.  The first factor is that only 44% of nodes have changed their withdrawal credentials to 0x01 address, which is needed to unstake partial or full withdrawals. Another factor that will be an effect on the price of ether is that only 16 partial withdrawal requests can be put into a single slot (which happens every 12 seconds).  And the final factor that will limit the price of unstaked ether is due to staking services’ timelines. Lido, which holds about 23% of all staked ether, will release withdrawals after the protocol goes through an upgrade in May.  So in other words, selling pressure will be distributed over several days, given these technical mechanisms that prevent a price drop from happening immediately.  Other crypto analysts suggest the Shanghai upgrade will have limited if any impact on the market for ether.  “My suspicion is that this is going to be a non-event in terms of price,” Brian Mosoff, CEO of technology company Ether Capital, told CoinDesk TV this week. He says that in the longer term the successful implementation of a full, two-way staking system could attract big institutional investors, even if some early stakers move to cash out.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/12/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-on-deck-developers-traders-aflutter-with-anticipation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f72ff53b2b055331e29748b07656128ba4f1146-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The surge in fees has fueled a notable increase in the price of FTM, leaving many wondering if this growth can be sustained. At the time of writing, FTM is on the rise with a 0.9% rally in the last 24 hours, currently trading at a price of $0.479712, according to Coingecko. This positive momentum has carried over the past seven days with an impressive 8% rally, indicating a growing interest and confidence in the blockchain platform’s potential. With exciting developments on the horizon, the future looks promising for the innovative blockchain platform. Fantom DeFi Ecosystem Drives Growth In Transactions, Price Surge Fantom’s cumulative value of fees collected in the last week surpassed $180,000, marking the highest since November and indicating a significant surge in trading activity on the platform. This growth has also been reflected in the price of FTM, which rose by over 6% in the last week. $FTM just experienced the largest spike in generated fees in over six months. Few people understand how much Fantom has going for it. pic.twitter.com/KZ0gQ4fKn1 — Emperor Osmo🧪 (@Flowslikeosmo) April 10, 2023 A key factor behind this growth in transactions could be attributed to Fantom’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Data from DeFiLlama reveals that SpookySwap, the largest DEX on the chain, experienced a total value locked (TVL) growth of more than 8% in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, Equalizer Exchange, which contributed over 8% to Fantom’s TVL, also saw remarkable success, with its growth rate standing at 32.44% at press time and a solid 18% growth in the last week alone. The success of these DEXs is a testament to the thriving DeFi ecosystem on Fantom’s blockchain, which could further drive the platform’s growth and popularity. FTM’s Price Action, DeFi Growth Impress Investors But Dev Activity Drops Despite the optimistic sentiment surrounding Fantom’s FTM due to its strong price action and growing DeFi landscape, there are some concerns about the network’s growth. Recent data shows that development activity has dropped considerably, which could potentially delay important upgrades in the near future.

On a positive note, the 30-day MVRV Ratio indicates that FTM holders could realize profits if they sell their tokens. While there are some challenges ahead, the positive momentum of FTM’s price action and DeFi growth continues to impress investors. As the platform continues to develop and improve, it will be interesting to see how these factors impact FTM’s performance in the long run. -Featured image from Analytics Insight",POSITIVE,FTM,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FTM | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom-transaction-fees-hit-6-month-high/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/11676498.jpeg

42412347,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dOY,1681293528,Here Is What Institutions Are Saying About Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade,"Analysts differ on the amount of ether (ETH) selling pressure that could result from the Ethereum blockchain’s Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for later Wednesday. The Shanghai upgrade (aka Shapella), will enable validators to withdraw staked ether and rewards that have been locked up.  JPMorgan (JPM) says ether will likely face some selling pressure from the upgrade as more than one million ether staking rewards become instantly available this week.  If you add potential additional selling from staked ether balances that belong to “troubled entities,” then the selling pressure may be larger in the coming weeks, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The bank says it expects ether to underperform bitcoin (BTC) over the next few weeks.  Bank of America (BAC), meanwhile, doesn’t expect the Shanghai liquidity event to directly drive ether selling pressure, but it does expect increased volatility around the event due to lower liquidity, exchange inflows, derivatives activity and price action related to the previous upgrade, the Merge.  Coinbase (COIN) says that a sell-off in ether on the back of this event should be relatively limited.  Selling directly from this source may amount to only about 1% to 2% of total average daily ether trading volumes, and Coinbase says its biased towards the lower end of that range.  ETH performance around the Shanghai Fork will be less dependent on technicals and more contingent on what “risk” is doing at the time. If the market sees risk assets selling off, investors may decide to unstake and sell ether just to de-risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively on the buy side, analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.  At the time of publication ether was trading 2.5% lower at around $1870.

11675117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526558,1681291520,"Yield Curve Reaches Historic Low, What It Means For Bitcoin","Analysts from both traditional financial markets and the Bitcoin space are currently looking at the yield curve with concern and are ringing the alarm bells. The 10-year and 3-month yield curve hit another historic low in the United States yesterday. Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning, drew attention to the historic data via Twitter and shared the chart below. He stated: The 3-Month Treasury yield of 5.08% is now 1.67% higher than the 10-Year Treasury yield (3.41%). This is the most inverted yield curve in history. What Does An Inverted Yield Curve Mean? Every inversion of the yield curve in history so far has predicted a recession. But why is this the case? Simply put, when shorter-maturity bond yields are higher than longer-maturity bonds, it means the market is anticipating an economic slowdown or recession with lower interest rates. The inversion of the US 10-year and 3-month treasury bill yield curve has occurred only four times in the last 100 years. The last three times occurred in 1980, 1973 and 1929. Each time there was a recession that brought the US economy to its knees and inflicted severe crashes on the stock market. Related Reading: Check One, Two: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Mic Drop Rally? In recent weeks, the 10-year 2-year yield curve has already shown a historic negative divergence from the 10-year 3-month yield curve. However, as renowned analyst Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, recently explained, the 10-3 curve actually has a slightly better track record to predict recessions and is the original academic study. In late March, Alden remarked: In plain English, the 10-3 curve is saying ‘no recession in clear sight’ while the 10-2 curve is saying, ‘we’re probably getting close to a possible recession, but not confirmed, and probably many months away, but asset prices start to top around here.’ According to Alden, it was therefore not clear whether there would be an actual hard landing. But the data has now changed fundamentally in just two weeks. The 10-3 yield curve now also screams recession. So when will a recession hit? In the past, the de-inversion of the curve signaled that an economic recession was a few months away. In recent weeks, the 10-year 2-year yield curve has already begun to show a rise, prompting some macro experts to warn of an imminent recession. However, the curve is still well away from de-inversion. Predicting when is therefore still like looking into a crystal ball. How hard will it hit the financial markets? In late March, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity, wrote that traditional financial markets held up for a while in most cases before experiencing drawdowns of -11% to -51% in the months that followed. “Be careful what you wish for when it comes to Fed pivots,” Timmer warned. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? Hence, despite Bitcoin’s current rising price, driven by hopes of an imminent pivot, a recession is lurking around the corner. For Bitcoin, this would be the first time it has found itself in a recessionary environment. How the BTC price will react is uncertain – will it decouple or follow the stock market? Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin Ahead Of Tomorrow’s CPI Release? Analysts Weigh In Lyn Alden believes that the financial market is overfunded, so at the end of the day it comes down to whether or not assets produce cash flow at reasonable valuations, and when. [I]f it’s a monetary commodity like gold or Bitcoin, it depends on how it structurally compares to its competitors like cash deposits and government bonds. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of Eight Global, believes a recession could push Bitcoin into another sharp downturn. Before that, however, the technical analyst predicts a rally in the direction of $45,000 per Bitcoin: Roughly speaking my thesis for Bitcoin. Still a vacuum in which we continue the upwards rally through Q2 as Powell comes to an end with the hikes. Comparable to Q2 2019, which also rallied significantly. Correction to $25K in second half, as recession slams in. At press time, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $30,000. With today’s release of the CPI for March and the FOMC minutes, the market is in for a volatile Wednesday.

42412358,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dTE,1681290538,China's 'Credit Impulse' Is Picking Up. Here's Why It Matters to Bitcoin,"While the U.S. Federal Reserve maintains its anti-liquidity stance, China no longer seems hesitant to expand credit in a positive sign for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Per data source MacroMicro, China's credit impulse index, which measures the change in new credit or bank lending as a percentage of the gross domestic product, has bounced from 24% to 26% this year, indicating a renewed credit expansion relative to the growth rate.  A continued rise in China's credit impulse could contribute to the global financial cycle and support global risk sentiment, expanding global asset prices and global credit, according to a paper published by the Federal Reserve in November said. Bitcoin, being a risk asset, tends to move more or less in line with stocks.  Historically, there has been a strong correlation between China's credit impulse and Asian equity markets, per Credit Suisse.  Besides, previous instances of renewed credit expansion in China have coincided with major bearish-to-bullish trend changes in bitcoin. So, a continued rise in the credit impulse index may bode well for bitcoin.  China's new bank lending hit a record high of 10.6 trillion yuan ($1.54 trillion), up 27% from the first quarter of 2022, data released on Tuesday showed.  ""This tidal wave of liquidity will continue to propel risk assets and crypto,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, said in a newsletter early this month, noting China's recent liquidity injections.  China's credit impulse surged after the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020. Bitcoin chalked up a sixfold rally to over $60,000 in the subsequent 12 months.  Bitcoin has rallied over 70% this year, recovering from a year-long bear market amid a renewed uptick in the credit impulse. The cryptocurrency saw similar bull revivals after the credit impulse bottomed out in May 2015 and December 2018.  Analysts see further credit expansion in China in the coming months.  ""China's credit cycle has bottomed out. It looks set to continue to recover as shadow bank credit and equity financing – two components of aggregate financing that account for more than one-third of the total – are increasing,"" Chi Lo, senior market strategist APAC at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said in a note published on March 29.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/12/chinas-credit-impulse-is-picking-up-heres-why-it-matters-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66e9c907109e571cd8d9bab1d8bde313798cf6c5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank notes that bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, gained at the same time as gold because both are viewed as hedges to a “catastrophic scenario.”  Recent problems in the banking sector also “exposed the weaknesses of the traditional financial system given bank’s maturity mismatch is susceptible to bank runs,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  “The U.S. banking crisis and the intense shift in U.S. bank deposits to U.S. money market funds is viewed by crypto supporters as a vindication of the crypto ecosystem,” the report said.  Bitcoin has also benefited from the launch two months ago of Bitcoin Ordinals, which some argue will drive up transaction fees and increase miners’s revenues, the note said.  JPMorgan says the most important support for bitcoin has come from rising investor focus about next year’s halving event, scheduled for April 2024, when mining rewards are cut in half.  This would mechanically double bitcoin’s production cost to around $40,000, creating a positive psychological effect,” because historically, BTC’s production cost has acted as an effective lower boundary to its price, the report added.

42412348,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dPU,1681289297,"EU-Funded Report Calls for Crypto ID Checks, Police Training to Combat Darknet Markets","A European Commission-funded report has called for tougher identity checks on crypto exchange users as regulators seeks to combat the rising use of darknet marketplaces to buy illegal substances.  The report, commissioned by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, an agency of the European Union, comes as lawmakers in the bloc push for tougher anti-money laundering checks on transactions made using cryptocurrency – and it cautions that better police training could prove more effective than outright bans.  “It is critical that countries around the world implement the recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force,” ensuring the users of exchanges, brokers and ATMs can be identified when they cash out illicit gains, it added.  The report, authored by Kim Grauer and Eric Jardine of Chainalysis, cites the use of darknet marketplaces as persistent and rising in spite of enforcement efforts. Chainalysis is a blockchain research platform that provides blockchain analytics solutions to regulators, and has millions of dollars of contracts with U.S. government agencies.  Forbidding the use of cryptocurrency entirely does little to curb darknet activity, and police-led closures such as that of Hydra in 2022 tend to have only short-lived impacts, as other alternatives spring up to replace it, the report said – but investigators can also improve their ability to respond.  Law enforcement “require training on the technologies that are being employed and the new investigative techniques necessary for conducting these sorts of investigations,” the report said, citing skills such as using encrypted platforms, and how to trace and seize crypto.  EU lawmakers are due to vote next week on landmark new licensing rules for the crypto sector, which would include identity checks on users transferring funds. The European Parliament has also pushed to impose upper limits on anonymous crypto transactions as part of a wider money-laundering overhaul.

But is this just a fleeting moment of glory, or is there more to Solana’s surge than meets the eye? Over the last few hours, the crypto has been on an unstoppable upward trajectory, outpacing other top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. With a 12% gain in the last 24 hours, Solana is making headlines and drawing attention from even the most skeptical investors. So, what’s behind Solana’s incredible performance, and is it here to stay? Solana Positive Sentiments Boost Its Market Position At the time of writing, the price of SOL stands at $23.71, according to Coingecko, representing a 5.2% rally in just 24 hours. But that’s not all – over the last seven days, the crypto has seen an equally impressive 12.4% rally, cementing its position as a rising star in the digital currency world. As investors eagerly watch and wait, the question on everyone’s mind is whether this star is destined for even greater heights, or whether it will come crashing back down to earth. Over the past 24 hours, SOL experienced a remarkable surge in volume, soaring by over 200%. This dramatic increase in trading activity coincided with a positive shift in investors’ outlook on SOL, as their sentiments turned bullish in response to the market’s upswing. Another indicator of SOL’s growing popularity was its Binance funding rate, which rose significantly. This rise in funding rate points to a heightened demand for SOL in the derivatives market. Furthermore, SOL’s price volatility has increased over the last few hours, specifically within the past week. This uptick in price movement further bolsters the potential for a continued upward trend for SOL. SOL Price: Market Indicators Favor Bulls Investors looking to capitalize on cryptocurrency trends should take note of SOL’s recent bullish market indicators. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating a sharp uptick and the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) crossing the neutral mark, the Bollinger Bands are also showing that SOL’s price is leaving a less volatile zone.

11673377,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526502,1681286451,The Best Bet: A Look Into Ethereum’s Future After Shapella With Ether Capital’s CEO Brian Mosoff,"In 2021, Ether Capital, a publicly traded company in Canada, became the first to stake $50 million in Ethereum’s Beacon Chain, the proof-of-stake blockchain that supports Ethereum. Since that time, the company has doubled down on its ETH bet. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Data Point To Clear Skies Ahead Of The Shanghai Upgrade With the upcoming Shapella upgrade, we sat down with Ether Capital’s CEO Brian Mosoff to discuss this event, the challenges, and the future of Ethereum as a global financial asset. This is what he told us. Q: We spoke over a year ago about Ethereum 2.0, its adoption, and the new challenges for the ETH ecosystem. What has changed since that time? Is Ether Capital still bullish on Ethereum? A: There were two big events in 2022 when I think back on the year. One is the decline in asset price across all blockchains, as well as the unfortunate blowups of some of the industry’s most thought-to-be respected players (BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, FTX) and perhaps the loss of confidence that came with that from institutional investors. These were investors that at one point were considering building a position in the asset class and were finally growing comfortable with the ecosystem. That’s one thing. And the second big thing was the Merge. The Merge, of course, was one of the biggest events in Ethereum’s history — the transition away from proof of work, hardware electricity mining, towards proof of stake, using the native token as a form of collateral to help secure the network. And that was an update that took years of research and collaboration across industry participants, researchers, developers, and academics. It was unclear when the Merge would take place and if it would even be successful. And for those who stayed up all night watching that event, of which there were many, it was a non-event, technically speaking, which of course was the best outcome that could have happened. Meaning no one noticed that the network switched. Anyone using the blockchain had no hiccups. Everything went as smoothly as planned, and that’s fantastic. The Merge also brought a new level of confidence to Ethereum that naysayers, who were bearish on Ethereum or unsure of Ethereum’s future and ability to upgrade it, put all those fears to bed. Those were the biggest things that happened in 2022. Is Ether Capital still bullish on Ethereum? One hundred percent. We’re more bullish now than ever before. The Merge — the transition from proof of work to proof of stake — proves that Ethereum is going to remain the dominant smart contract platform. It’s still outpacing all the Layer-1 competitors in terms of daily fees. And now what you have is Layer-2s that are becoming their own mature ecosystems that offer scalability solutions in the short-term for those who want to use Ethereum but are being priced out of their activities at the base layer. So, you’re seeing take up and things like Optimism and the future that’s being painted through things like the Superchain, which is really exciting. I’ve always personally and professionally believed that Ethereum is the smart contract platform. It is going to be the future of all this activity. And for the last number of years, we’ve seen headlines about Ethereum killers and how they’re going to be cheaper and faster. And that value proposition is eroding rapidly, especially in the latter half of 2022 as Layer-2s have really ramped up. We’ve seen outages or downtime with blockchains like Solana, and we’re just not seeing developers moving into those ecosystems. They’re staying on Ethereum or they’re building on the Layer-2s, and that just points more and more towards Ethereum as the best-in-class blockchain with a secure base layer vs. other activity taking place elsewhere. But you know, the future to us is going to be that you’re going to have ETH as collateral for all sorts of activity and nothing is really going to compete with that. So, execution can move on to Layer-2s, we’re going to start to see more rollups and ZK emerge — and this is all pointing towards Ethereum at the center of all this activity. There’s still millions-of-dollars in daily transaction fees being paid at the base layer. Nothing is even coming close in terms of a competitor blockchain or a Layer-2. Nothing’s coming close to the activity that’s taking place on Ethereum. Overall, we’re very bullish, excited for the future, and now that we’ll have liquidity on staked ETH, all things point towards an Ethereum future. Q: The upcoming Shapella upgrade was called the “first major tune-up since the Merge” by your team; why do you think this is such a significant event? Do you believe more investors will be drawn to it? And what are the ramifications for ETH as a financial asset? A: Retail investors and solo stakers have been able to participate in staking to date and perhaps some have wanted liquidity on their ETH, perhaps not. But generally, the participation has come from individuals rather than institutions. Ether Capital has been able to stake, we’re a public company and structured as a corporation, so we have a fair amount of flexibility over how we manage our treasury. I think that Shapella will mean that a new class of investors will be able to participate in Ethereum and staking, and that’s because the lack of liquidity was a missing puzzle piece for any type of structured product that would be offered to a different set of investors. For those investors who don’t want to hold the asset directly, instead, they want to buy some structured product through their traditional brokerage account. How have they been able to do that? That has been tricky, and this is the last piece of the puzzle I think, for them. The first was seeing the transition from proof of work to proof of stake and having certainty around that upgrade being successful and nothing going terribly wrong on the launch pad. And we’ve checked that box. Now what we need is liquidity where if you wanted to build a structured product, you could do so. And you know, closed funds, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), whether the liquidity is daily, monthly, quarterly, that’ll be up to who the structured product manufacturers will be. But this is an important piece of the puzzle from a regulatory standpoint. I don’t think there are questions around if the upgrade will be successful the same way those questions were asked when the transition from proof of work to proof of stake was about to take place. This is going to be more about checking off this last box to ensure that liquidity becomes available on staked ETH even though it might take some time to be worked out from custodians and staking providers. And there could be a bottleneck, if let’s say a large amount of staked ETH is attempting to be withdrawn. You know whether that can happen in a short time period like a few hours or within a 24-hour period. That’s not clear yet. We haven’t seen how much of the $35 billion that’s currently staked is going to be withdrawn. But that bottleneck, if there is one, that will clear up pretty quickly. The ecosystem will also put in place whatever technology is needed for structured product manufacturers to monitor the staking activity and figure out how to move between staking an undertaking with as little friction as possible, so that is a big thing for the ecosystem. I do think that more investors will be drawn in once Shapella occurs. If you could hold Ethereum with a low time preference and generate this yield while helping secure the network, that’s a very strong value proposition. Historically, the only way institutions got exposure was through equity in picks and shovels, private companies like FTX or Celsius Network that operated in the space. Attention is starting to shift to token exposure because investors realize there’s less counterparty risk and they can generate a return through activities like staking. I’m constantly reminding investors that the assets at the base layer (i.e., ether and bitcoin), are there to remove as much agency as possible in rent extraction. And despite centralized businesses failing, it’s unlikely that the protocols themselves are going to fail. Investors may shift their strategy a bit and recognize again, the ecosystem is here to stay. The asset class is not going away. But maybe the way to play it isn’t in private investment. It’s actually just finding an exposure point; an access point to the assets themselves. And if you can make that productive along the way, that’s even better. Q: There is much uncertainty about the short term as some ETH stakers could dump their assets into the market. What’s your view on this scenario and the long-term scenario? Are people holding their ETH? What is Ether Capital doing on both timeframes? A: Of course, no one has a crystal ball on how many ETH stakers are planning to sell the moment that they get liquidity. I don’t think it matters that much. I think that this is just noise that will go away, even if there is some short-term selling. I think very quickly the price would rebound because people are seeing the opportunity around a best-in-class smart contract platform and the ability to generate yield. That’s a very strong value proposition, especially against the current macro environment. I also think that most of the stakers who have chosen to lock up their ETH are aware that there was a lack of liquidity and they’re long-term believers in the ecosystem. They weren’t participants who were looking to trade in-and-out of the asset. Anyone who wants to trade in-and-out of the asset is probably doing so and looking for returns higher than 4% to 6%, which is roughly what you get on staked ETH. There are people who have, in my view, no plans to sell their ETH position any time soon. Also, I’d ask those people what they plan to do with the funds if they choose to sell. Are they going to go buy U.S. dollars or are they going to go convert it into Bitcoin or another token? That seems unlikely to me. The best bet here is still low time preference, long-time horizon on ETH. Stake it and be patient and ride out the volatility, ride out the FUD. That’s where Ether Capital stands. We’re currently staking 36,000 ETH out of our treasury and we’d like to do more and to do more would require confidence that we would have liquidity should we ever need it. And that to us is really exciting. I believe that long-term more ETH is going to get staked, not that there’s a big sell off here. Q: We already had The Merge, now Shapella; what’s next for ETH? More importantly, what’s next for this cryptocurrency as it evolves into a financial asset? With high-interest rates, banks collapsing, and high inflation, will investors flock to the Ethereum ecosystem to generate yield? What are you most excited about ETH and the ecosystem on financial terms? A: One thing I want to draw attention to are questions that we are asked a fair amount of the time by investors. If the yield is lower on ETH than what you can get through some traditional money market fund, why would investors pay attention to it? Why stake ETH instead of just going and buying something else that pays out a 5% to 6% dividend? And to me, it’s kind of an obvious answer. Those who buy ETH and stake the asset believe in the value proposition of ETH as a settlement layer for various assets and activities. Then on top of that exposure, they’re going to generate a yield. For anyone who’s ignoring the long-term potential of Ethereum, or the future of what a blockchain can be and is just looking at that 4% to 6% yield, I don’t think that they’re going to thread the needle on this opportunity. They’re going to say, that doesn’t make any sense for me, that people who have bought into a blockchain future, an Ethereum future, who can ride out the volatility, who are not momentum traders, will be ones who are excited by this. So, what’s next for ETH? Well, it’s going to be about more scalability. The base layer has been about that transition from proof of work to proof of stake. Now it’s closing the loop on the liquidity around how your staking position can be managed, but that doesn’t necessarily address scaling. To me, the most exciting thing is to see Layer-2s emerge with various pieces of technology to enable scalability, to enable privacy inside of transactions. That’s something I’m very personally passionate about. Unfortunately, I’m not a developer so I can’t contribute any code to it, but I do think that privacy tech is very important as well as scalability. I’m excited for that to emerge over the next few years. I’m also excited — this isn’t a ‘what’s next for ETH’ — it’s more the ecosystem, I think we’re entering a phase where the uncertainty around which blockchain is going to win is starting to dissipate and it’s becoming clearer that the number one and number two assets by market cap are bitcoin and ether. If you want to be cheeky, you can make an argument that they (Bitcoin and Ethereum) are some of the worst pieces of technology, or the slowest tech, out there. But they’re sticky assets. They have hit that inflection point where they’ve crossed the point of no return, where the developers in those ecosystems aren’t leaving. You know, Bitcoin is not getting supplanted by Litecoin or anything else. It has cornered the store of value, shoulder tap checks on central banking policy, escape valve for macro. Bitcoin cornered that and I think Ethereum has cornered the smart contract, DeFi, metaverse, NFT activity. And I’m excited to see a wider society who doesn’t eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff or live on Crypto Twitter finally come around to investing in assets that they can have certainty will be around in the next 5 to 10 years. On top of that, less speculation and feeling that they’ve missed out. The first 100 or 200 million people who have bought into the asset class, who already believe in bitcoin and ether, already know why those things exist. The question is when does the rest of the world wake up? And I think that that’s coming, and the next cycle is going to be less speculative. I hope it’s less speculative. I hope that there’s less froth, scams, and “flavor of the month” assets while these scalability and privacy pieces of technology begin to emerge around the ecosystem. My last comment is about U.S. banks collapsing and all this pointing back to why crypto exists. These are politically neutral, globally managed and developing technologies and the internet of money. Bitcoin was born January 3/09 with the headline in the Genesis block “Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks” written in the London Times, and that headline still holds true with where we’re at today. You’re watching central banks try and backstop the failure of regional banks and realize that the world is waking up to a system, a monetary system of fractional reserve banking, though it enables a lot of good, also comes with a lot of downsides. And we’re seeing that system fracture and so people will turn their attention back towards this space. Q: Growing concerns about tightening regulations could hurt the industry; why bet on ETH still in this environment? How does a public company betting on ETH prepare for a scenario where regulators come after crypto? There are many, but what do you believe is the biggest challenge facing the industry regarding regulation, and how is Ether Capital working to address it? A: I think clarity is going to be a good thing, whether it’s the exact framework that the industry wants, remains to be seen. Will ETH be overseen by the CFTC or the SEC? That’s for lawyers to battle it out in court. But that won’t really affect the Ethereum ecosystem too much. It’s going to be more about the access points and how you monitor the participation at the retail level of who can buy the asset, what type of disclosures are appropriate. But I think if we can put to bed this idea that governments are going to ban the asset class, that would be a good thing for the industry. I do think that some governments are going to start to feel very threatened by these assets and attempt to ban them. But you can’t ban things at the protocol level. So again, you can just ban or regulate the access points, but the protocols themselves will do fine. You know, if there’s short term downward price pressure because of statements by the SEC or action from the government in specific jurisdictions, that’ll be unfortunate. But I have a friend who once said betting against these open blockchains is like betting against the civil rights movement in the 60s, and I think that’s accurate. My frustration with the banking system is when people say, you know we can’t have these open systems, it’s not good for anyone, I turn to them and say, we have this very bifurcated financial system. It’s two-tiered, you have accredited investors and non-accredited investors, and everyone is frustrated by this. Retail investors are frustrated that the rich keep getting richer, that they have access to all the private deals and that they can only participate at some point down the line when those companies go public. The hedge funds and the venture capitalists have made their 10 to 1000 X returns. If we’re ever going to get away from that system into something better, what is that going to look like? And to me, crypto is that hope for humanity in the future to have a more equitable group of participants. Q: How does a public company betting on ETH prepare for a scenario where regulators come after crypto? A: Because we [Ether Capital] don’t face retail directly in the sense we don’t hold an individual’s ether on their behalf, we don’t stake it on their behalf, the regulatory conversation is a little bit removed from us other than we’re champions of the industry and want it to do well. It seems like this question is about ETH specifically, or smart contract platforms vs. bitcoin, and I think we’re heading into a point of time where there may be some questions from ether naysayers who say, “ether is going to be a security and that’s going to destroy it,” but I don’t think that’s true. I think the bigger question is going to be around governments and how they feel about these assets, digital bearer assets being outside of their control, and does it threaten their sovereignty. Bitcoin will get pulled into that conversation, very much so. Same with Ethereum. That is the thing for everyone to be paying attention to. That is the conversation. That’s the elephant in the room that in some ways the industry has always wanted — to challenge central banking policy. At the same time, we are 13 or 14 years into digital bearer assets existing, I don’t think we realize yet how bloody this fight may be or how intense and subversive it’s going to be. I think that is going to be what transpires across the entire ecosystem and will trickle into self-hosted wallets. Questions around how much people are allowed to transact on their own, are governments going to try and put maximum fiat amounts on what can be transferred into a self-hosted wallet? Again, it’s not going to matter if it’s Bitcoin, ETH or if it’s going to be the entire industry. Do people have the right to transact outside of state control? That conversation to me is the most important and fascinating one that will play out over the coming few years and throughout the decade. The irony is that as the price appreciation of bitcoin and ether continue, that conversation will boil to a head much sooner than people realize if governments and regulators feel their sovereignty being threatened. Then the question becomes how is the capital working to address it? I mean, we’re one of the founding members of the Canadian Web3 Council and I’m the president of the board. I spend a lot of time doing education outreach, advocacy work both in Canada and a little bit in the U.S. when I’m there. I think it’s important that industry veterans, ones who understand the nuances and complexities of the asset class, are in rooms during these types of conversations with politicians, regulators, and making sure that they’re being thoughtful about the ideas that they’re wanting to push on the industry. It’s easy to look at things like Tornado Cash and quickly say “no one should be using Tornado Cash unless they’re a criminal or trying to launder money.” It’s easy to come to that conclusion, but people in the industry will say, well, hold on. Let’s be a little bit more thoughtful about it. You know, when you send someone $5, do you attach your last three years of banking statements along with the transaction? Or when you walk into a store and pay for a coffee, do you attach to that recipient all your financial history? Do you expose yourself in that way? And of course, the answer is no. There’s a good reason to want to have privacy. The question will be, how do we build technology that enables appropriate use of that privacy while still achieving the objectives of some of these government agencies that want to make sure you know the wrong people aren’t using it to their own advantage? That’s what’s tricky. It’s not easy but being in the room to make sure that there’s balanced approaches being taken by these government agencies is very, very important. And I spend a fair amount of my time on that and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. I also enjoy it. Q: With the ongoing banking crisis in the U.S., how do you see Ethereum and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as potential solutions or alternatives to traditional banking systems? A: I think a lot of people who understand DeFi and the value proposition are quick to point out that the problem with the meltdown of FTX, Voyager and all the others in addition to the current banking system, are problems with centralized control where users don’t have purview into what’s happening inside that black box. If DeFi offers a solution to that, it has a different approach. It uses technology and transparency to mitigate a lot of that risk. Unfortunately, I think many regulators look at those alternatives and view the tech as being so far out of their grasp for them to see how it can be a solution to the ecosystems that they’re familiar with. As a result, they’re resistant to that world encroaching on their territory. Would that be nice if we could just tokenize securities and say, “You know, we don’t need clearinghouses anymore, we don’t need the DTCC to exist anymore, we can just use this as a settlement layer”? Maybe, but that feels very far away. And so DeFi, I think will be insular for now, self-referential between all these assets floating around, all the crypto digitally native assets. But I think you’re going to start to see banks figure out how to test private versions of Ethereum. On that note, how do you test private versions of Defi? I’ll be the first one to say that KYC in DeFi is called CeFi (laughs), but I think that it’s a good first step because if they learn how to use a wallet, if they learn how to fork the code and run a private version of Ethereum, over time they will move into the open, permissionless system. To sum it up, any participation on their part in the short term, even if it’s using the technology but in a way that makes them comfortable, is a good thing. Rome wasn’t built in a day. We can have the crypto natives on one side doing their self-referential activity in all these DeFi protocols. And long-term, if financial institutions that we’re familiar with want to participate on-chain and they maybe use some zero knowledge to preserve their activities, that’s great. The whole point of blockchains is that anyone can participate, and it doesn’t distinguish between who the users are. I also think it’s very important that people recognize blockchains are only going to work if they are credibly neutral. The second that you start creating a multi-tiered set of transactions (i.e., this one came from a regulated financial institution and that’s an end user) the value proposition will change because you’re going to break fungibility, and fungibility is critical to the global participation of these assets. That the protocol doesn’t distinguish between end users and only cares that a transaction is valid or invalid. Nothing more, nothing less. No more gating and no more bifurcation based on a set of criteria according to the political whims of a specific jurisdiction. That is very important to the success of any blockchain.

Ren allowed users to transfer tokens, such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and dogecoin (DOGE), among different blockchains and became one of the most popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in the 2021 bull run.

42412341,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dH4,1681282112,Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Only a Small Step Forward: Bank of America,"Ethereum first introduced the idea of blockchain operating systems compatible with smart contracts and decentralized applications, but the platform suffers from limited throughput despite benefiting from this first-mover advantage, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report from last week.  The Shanghai upgrade (aka Shapella), due to occur later Wednesday, will enable validators to withdraw staked ether (ETH) and rewards that have been locked up.  The Shappella upgrade does not address scalability, “but acts as a precursor for future upgrades, providing a small step forward,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Bank of America sees Ethereum upgrades as “significant technological accomplishments, but not necessarily more significant or advanced than those implemented by next-generation blockchains that have emerged as viable alternatives.”  The bank says Ethereum’s likely inability to increase throughput in the short term and increasing competition from alternative blockchains will constrain its adoption and usage.  Ethereum’s “long-term viability” is dependent on the execution of its development road map, the report said. This includes the implementation of a sharding approach called Danksharding, which aims to reduce the costs of transactions originating on scaling solutions and cut the processing and storage requirements for validators.  However, Danksharding is still years away, which increases the risk that developers will move to other blockchains to build applications, the note said.  The main concern around the Shanghai liquidity event is that validators could withdraw and sell staked ether (ETH), which makes up 16% of the total ETH supply, but the withdrawal process is designed to “prevent a short-term mass exodus of validators and the resulting security risks,” the note added.  The bank expects heightened volatility around the upgrade due to decreased liquidity, derivatives activity, and because of the ether price action seen around the previous upgrade, the Merge.

42412343,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dKo,1681280513,"Bitcoin Slips Under $30K, Ether Staking Tokens Take a Beating Ahead of Shapella Upgrade","Bitcoin (BTC) slipped under the crucial $30,000 level in early European hours on Wednesday, with overall market capitalization falling 1.2% in the past 24 hours.  Ether (ETH) traded just over $1,860, leading the drop among major tokens. Solana's SOL remained in the green, while BNB, Cardano's ADA and XRP gave up gains from Monday night.  The so-called Liquid Staking tokens slumped. Lido’s LDO governance tokens fell as much as 10%, while Rocket Pool’s RPL dropped 8%. Both protocols lock billions of dollars to provide yields on ether staking to users, who can stake any amount of ether to earn rewards without requiring to put up 32 ether to run a validator node.  Wednesday morning's drop caused over 96% in longs, or bets on rising prices, to be liquidated since early Asian hours, data shows.  Traders likely took profits ahead of two key developments scheduled for Wednesday: The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March, and the much-awaited Shapella upgrade for the Ethereum network.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is still concerned about sticky inflation, and softer inflation data may allow the Fed to go for a 25 basis points rate hike at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on May 2 – which could buoy traditional markets and riskier assets such as bitcoin.  On the other hand, Shappella – a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that are expected to occur simultaneously on April 12 – will allow investors to withdraw their ether staked on the Ethereum blockchain. Staked ether cannot be withdrawn or freely traded currently.  As such, some say the event could prove bullish for ether as staking and capturing yields directly from the blockchain becomes more accessible to users.  “Allowing withdrawals, boosted by the recent popularity of liquid staking platforms, will make ETH staking much more accessible to retail investors who were previously unwilling to stake ETH for an undetermined amount of time,” said Chen Zhuling, CEO at staking service RockX, in a note to CoinDesk earlier this week.

XRP price could dive toward $0.485 or even $0.465 before the bulls take a stand. Ripple started a fresh decline from the $0.5850 resistance against the US dollar. The price is now trading near $0.5065 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.5065 on the 4-hours chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might correct further lower toward the $0.485 support or even $0.465. Ripple Price Shows Signs of More Losses After struggling to clear the $0.585 resistance, Ripple’s XRP started a downside correction against the US Dollar. Recently, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw a decent increase, but XRP struggled to rise. Earlier, there was a decent upward move from the $0.482 zone. The bulls pushed the price above the $0.512 resistance. However, it failed to clear the $0.5200 resistance zone. The price stayed below the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5848 swing high to the $0.4820 low. It is now moving lower below $0.5120. XRP is trading near $0.5065 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The first major resistance is near the $0.5200 level. A successful break above the $0.520 resistance might send the price toward the $0.545 resistance or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5848 swing high to the $0.4820 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.585 level. More Losses in XRP? If ripple fails to clear the $0.520 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.500 zone. The next major support is near $0.485. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.484 level, XRP’s price could extend losses. In the stated case, the price could test the $0.465 support zone.

42412352,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dSI,1681278747,Hong Kong Regulator Says DeFi Projects Could Face Regulatory Requirements,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects could be subject to licensing requirements and regulation, a Hong Kong regulator said on Wednesday.  Keith Choy, interim head of intermediaries at Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said that as long as DeFi activity falls within the scope of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) it will be subject to the same regulatory requirements as traditional financial activity.  Choy made the comments during a speech at the Web3 Festival in Hong Kong. The U.S. and France also published reports on DeFi regulation recently. The SFC had previously highlighted DeFi as an area in need of regulation but had not laid out its stance.  ""Providing automated trading services is a regulated activity under the SFO,"" Choy said. ""If a decentralized platform allows trading in virtual assets, which constitutes securities or futures as defined under the SFO, the platform and operators are required to have a Type 7 license,"" he added.  Offering a collective investment scheme to the public in Hong Kong is subject to authorization requirements, Choy noted.  DeFi presents regulators with issues of financial stability and limited transparency due to lack of data and unregulated firms and activities, Choy said, while also highlighting market integrity issues such as price oracle manipulation, front-running transactions and investor protection concerns.  The SFC issued a statement in December 2022 warning investors of the risks associated with virtual asset platforms. Hong Kong's new licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms takes effect in June 2023, though there is a grandfathering period.

There is a key rising channel forming with support near $30,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a downside correction if there is a close below the $30,000 support. Bitcoin Price Struggles Bitcoin price remained strong above the $30,000 pivot level. BTC attempted another increase above the $30,200 and $30,250 levels. However, the bears were active near the $30,500 resistance zone. A high was formed near $30,577 and the price started a consolidation phase. There are clear signs of trend exhaustion above the $30,000 level.

The next key resistance is near the $32,000 level, above which the bulls might aim for a move toward the $33,500 level. Downside Break in BTC?

Bitcoin (BTC) is at $30,324, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours, while ether (ETH), on the eve of Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade, is fairly flat, down 1.2% to $1,892.  In an interview on CoinDesk TV, Bruno Ramos de Sousa, head of U.S. markets at Hashdex, said $30,000 isn’t that much of an important milestone for bitcoin.  ""We're finally in the stage in which people are back to discussing the importance of bitcoin and crypto more generally in finance and technology,"" Ramos de Sousa said on CoinDesk TV’s ""All About Bitcoin.""  Bruno emphasized that investors are becoming more informed in their approach to bitcoin as they acknowledge its potential for long-term growth, and are less obsessed with the price going up or down.  ""Most of the investors are very pragmatic in looking at the asset and understanding the possibility that bitcoin becomes something a lot larger than it is today,"" he said, emphasizing that the U.S. needs to treat crypto as a legitimate asset class.  ""It's a wasted opportunity that the U.S. has been taking the approach it has in the past few years. It's lost dominance and relevance in many interesting crypto sectors, from tokenization to security tokens, to ETFs and ETPs,"" he continued, referring to exchange-traded funds and products.  Meanwhile, CoinDesk crypto market analyst Glenn Williams points out in a recent report that there are both bullish and bearish narratives at play within bitcoin. It might sustain $30K for some time, then go down again before its next pricing surge.  All eyes will be on the next interest rate announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

42411959,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhk7b,1681262230,Award-Winning Wealth Advisor Confident  about Clients Investing in Crypto,"Lyons Wealth Management, a recognized top-ranking wealth advisor and portfolio manager* with a proven track record in launching award-winning portfolio strategies, today announced the launch of its first digital asset offering, self-directed accounts that seek to track the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index (DLCS).  CoinDesk Indices, the underlying index provider for this product launch, sat down with Lyons’ management team to find out why Lyons believes this offering is valuable to their clients and how they view opportunities in digital assets.  What follows is an interview with Sander Read, CEO of Lyon’s Wealth Management. The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  Q1: What are your clients saying when it comes to crypto?  Like all investing trends, we get the following question at the end of every client meeting: “Thanks for the portfolio review, but can I ask a question about crypto?” Investors are curious about investing in crypto and our professional advice on it. Many investment professionals agreed, and we believe they still do, that a portion of everyone’s portfolio should have a crypto allocation.  The complexity and “unknowns” of crypto investing have been an obstacle for investors to participate in the asset class. Unfamiliarity with the blockchain, crypto wallets and other new realms unique to crypto assets kept investors away. Advisors equally struggle with transparent and easy-to-use methods to gain exposure to the crypto asset class. The portfolio managers at Lyons have searched for ways to gain exposure.  Q2: What do digital assets mean to you and your business?  Corey Roun started with Lyons Wealth in 2009, and in 2012, he began an in-depth study of the crypto space. In 2015, he began mining cryptocurrency. As the space evolved and clients in general became more aware of crypto as an asset class, Corey enlisted Sander Read, CEO of Lyons Wealth, to find a secure, liquid and easy-to-use method to gain exposure to crypto.  In 2021, the firm launched a crypto basket of publicly traded stocks to give clients proxy exposure to the crypto space. In February 2022, at a chance meeting with a colleague at a conference in Chicago, executives from CoinDesk and Lyons met. In that meeting, the concept of an RIA-led digital asset offering was conceived.  Even with the downturn in the markets over the past 12 months, we’re still seeing continued investor demand for safe and diversified exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Rather than trying to pick and choose specific coins and tokens, financial advisors can now access a thoughtfully designed, diversified portfolio of assets via a singular framework.  With this launch, we think we finally have a way to get the investment vehicle we have been looking for.  Q3: Sander, how do you personally view digital assets from a portfolio implementation stance?  Let me start by saying that I have managed money through the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2001 dot-com crash, the 2007 real estate crash, the 2008 market crash and, there are always buying opportunities at the lows. I remember reading articles on how the internet “might not make it” in 2001. Those were your screaming buying signals. I think that’s where we are with crypto right now. It’s a currency portal that is not going away.  I believe in allocations to digital assets, and now is the right time and opportunity. Through this index-based exposure, we now offer clients access to a thoughtfully designed and diversified basket.  Q4: Tell us about the offering and the underlying index.  The underlying index is the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index (DLCS), which measures the market capitalization weighted performance of some of the largest and most liquid digital assets that meet pre-defined trading and custodian requirements. As of January 4, 2023, DLCS consisted of the following assets: Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL).  “DLCS offers a simple exposure into crypto beyond bitcoin with confidence that the altcoins meet our quality standards in tradability.” said Jodie Gunzberg, CFA, Managing Director at CoinDesk Indices. “In fact, the index rules we put in place were responsible for elimination of FTT from all our indices initially since it wasn't priced by at least two eligible exchanges.”  These digital assets will be managed through HeightZero, a technology solution that allows financial advisors to easily provide their clients direct exposure to crypto assets. HeightZero is integrated with BitGo, a leader in digital asset security, custody and liquidity. Assets held at BitGo Trust are kept in institutional-grade, offline storage accounts to ensure the safety and security of client funds.  Q5: Where can someone go to get more information about your firm, and the index?

42412350,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4dMg,1681261200,Metalpha Launches Grayscale-Based Digital Asset Fund,"Hong Kong’s Metalpha is launching a licensed fund in the territory that will give investors exposure to Grayscale’s digital asset products, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), as well as the ability to redeem shares.  Metalpha is calling this fund the ""Next Generation Fund"", and it is targeting a raise of $100 million with $20 million already committed since it began fundraising in March.  “We are very excited to partner with NextGen Digital Venture on launching the Fund, as we continue to strive for product innovation for our traditional finance clients. Grayscale is one of the largest digital asset fund managers in the world, and we are optimistic about the future growth of Grayscale powered by crypto adoption, said Adrian Wang, President of Metalpha Technology Holding, in a release.  Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  “The reason why our fund is attractive to investors is that it is very common and straightforward to participate and fully compliant with both Hong Kong and U.S. regulations. In addition, against the current bear market, investing in GBTC, for example, can offer more competitive returns to investors,” Wang said in a note to CoinDesk.  Grayscale’s crypto products have traded at a discount since March 2021 because of the widespread availability of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) and a lack of redemption options for the firm’s crypto trusts. While the GBTC discount hit a record 50% in December, it has currently narrowed to about 36%.  The ability to get exposure to Grayscale’s products – at a discount to market prices – and redeem them should catch the eye of bullish investors with a long time horizon and interest in arbitrage plays.  Investment documents seen by CoinDesk show shares in the fund have a 1.5-year lockup period, but after that time, can be redeemed on specified redemption days which occur monthly.  GBTC is currently trading at a 36% discount over NAV.

But are they celebrating too early? Or is the first ever cryptocurrency going to fist pump higher? Find out how Elliott Wave Principle and music might hold the secret to solving where Bitcoin might be in its market cycle. Falling Prices = Dropping Beats Imagine an EDM song at a club or festival. Even the most-energetic song tracks typically start off slower, building and building until the beat drops. After that, the song tempo picks up and the lyrics begin.

Is BTC in the same spot, ready for a small correction? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com This Is What It Sound Like, When Bulls Run If this sounds a lot what it’s like when Bitcoin or another asset begins to trend, that’s because music and markets both march to a similar beat. For example, Hurst Cycle Theory looks at the market’s cyclical rhythm and covers themes like harmonics and amplitude — themes also prevalent in music and sound. So what’s this all have to do with Bitcoin? The natural rhythmical behavior in markets, according to Elliott Wave Principle, are found all over the place — from art, to psychics, to music. Currently, after some surprising upside, bulls are euphoric because they know the beat is about to kick into high gear. But they could be forgetting that beat drop that comes before things intensify and need to “check” their “levels” with a “one-two,” mic check. The 1/2 1/2 setup in action | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Check One, Two: Is The Bitcoin Uptrend On? The most ideal positioning in an Elliott Wave impulse or motive wave is at the 1/2 sub-wave of wave III, which follows after waves I and II complete. This 1/2 behavior that arrives after a completed I/II wave count, is the point before the party really starts. Prices tend to pump toward the ceiling with very few pullbacks. If the count is accurate, the crypto market could see a small correction, followed by a several month-long bull trend. Crypto traders could learn a thing or two about what to do in this situation from musicians who noticed the important of the 1/2 1/2 setup.

If you’re worried about what Bitcoin might do next, check your levels, be present in the moment, and focus. Check for the 1/2 1/2 setup, and if the beat does drop, don’t be afraid to hit the dance floor, a mic drop rally could follow.
