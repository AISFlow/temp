42378591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifcP,1454103053,Bankers Weigh Blockchain Challenges at BNY Mellon Event,"BNY Mellon hosted a blockchain event at its Jersey City, New Jersey, campus on 28th January, an event that, while small in terms of the number of attendees, could have a potentially huge impact on how the bank does business in the months and years ahead.  Like many other financial institutions in the world, BNY Mellon is weighing how to apply the code that underlies bitcoin to new use cases. Last year, the bank revealed that it had used its own digital currency for an internal rewards pilot.  During remarks before the presentation, BNY Mellon chief information officer Suresh Kumar argued that rather than being replaced by the technology, blockchains can help institutions like BNY Mellon pursue new lines of doing business.  He told attendees:  ""When I think about the blockchain, and sometimes people treat it like its a disruption that's going to kill all the financial institutions, I have a different view. I think it’s a huge opportunity for companies like us.""  Kumar went on to say that there is a possibility the tech can ""remove friction in the financial industry” through the use of the technology, and encouraged attendees to weigh possible solutions during breakout sessions that followed the event.  Assessing implications  During his opening talk, Tim Swanson, director of research for New York-based blockchain startup R3CEV, provided an overview of the R3 blockchain consortium, which boasts 42 banking institutions from Asia, Europe and North America, including BNY Mellon, as members.  Swanson outlined how the firm is pushing ahead on development of what he called a ""financial-grade ledger"", as well as the creation of collaborative working spaces for financial institutions to test blockchain products and possible use cases.  As to what those use cases might be, Swanson was less clear. He told attendees that, based on the conversations he’s had with financial institutions, most appear to be looking in different directions in terms of how to actually apply the technology.  ""No one agrees on use cases,"" he said. ""Everyone has their own wheelhouse.""  Swanson went on to say that, across the landscape of financial institutions in the world, more than 500 employees have been dedicated to blockchain projects.  He argued that this number will grow as those firms move toward developing new proofs-of-concepts as ideas around use cases take further shape.  Regulatory questions  Next, Houman Shadab, professor and co-director of the Center for Business and Financial Law at the New York Law School, gave a broad overview of the regulatory landscape in the financial industry, establishing that environment as context for how distributed ledgers could be deployed within existing legal frameworks for banks.  He opened with a discussion of a recent paper produced by settlement giant DTCC, which recommended the industry experiment with the technology but cautioned against the mounting hype and its capabilities.  Shadab stressed that banks, when looking at possible development of a distributed ledger for a certain aspect of their business, need to weigh every angle of how such use would play out in the real world.  ""If we install a distributed ledger here, what do I need to do to effect a certain activity, a certain trade?"" he said.  Shadab also pointed out the challenges a financial institution would face in moving from an experimental phase to a real-world deployment of a blockchain. These risks include the need to integrate with systems in use today and data privacy concerns across geographic jurisdictions.  The last presentation focused largely on the legal risks involved with using distributed ledgers, particularly when it comes to the question of establishing ownership of a particular asset.  There, Barney Reynolds, chief of the Global Financial Institutions Advisory & Financial Regulatory Group for London-based legal firm Shearman & Sterling, called ownership a ""massive problem"" that could lead to issues that end up in a court, or in courts in multiple legal jurisdictions.  ""The question is, where is the asset?"" he asked. ""If it’s in the ether, there is insufficient clarity for the law to determine that question.""  Reynolds speculated that courts weighing cases involving blockchain-based assets may have a difficult time determining the outcome of such litigation. As it stands, no such cases have been brought before a court.  ""The problem with the blockchain is that no one bank, no one custodian is the owner of truth,"" said Reynolds. ""What happens if the records are contested?""  Reena Sahni, a partner with the Shearman and Sterling legal group, went on to say during a question-and-answer follow-up that a solution would lie in creating a clear legal framework for establishing how property ownership is managed within a blockchain system.  Further, she suggested that the situation could turn into a positive one for banks.  ""I think that, certainly, regulators and the law wouldn’t be agnostic toward it,"" said Sahni. ""I think there are massive opportunities, and likewise, there is some inherent skepticism with the regulators that actually provides an opportunity to overcome.""

42378581,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifR5,1454086203,Japan's SBI Holdings Teams With Ripple to Launch New Company,"SBI Holdings, the financial services business division of Japan’s SBI Group, has announced it is creating a new company in partnership with digital ledger technology (DLT) startup Ripple.  Called SBI Ripple Asia, the new company aims to focus on expanding the use of Ripple products and services through sales and engineering efforts focused on Asian markets including China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan.  The announcement comes amid a broader push by SBI Group to make its interest in the blockchain and distributed ledger technology known, and amid a shift in Ripple's strategy to emphasize the value of its solutions for cross-border payments.  In statements, SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao said that the bank’s choice of Ripple for the initiative was proof that its solutions had gained traction among global banks.  Kitao continued:  ""Distributed financial technology is undoubtedly transforming financial infrastructure and we’re excited to drive its adoption throughout Asia.""  In turn, Ripple CEO Chris Larsen said that SBI would allow the company to develop relationships in the Asian market as it focuses on use cases for its technology in banking, capital markets, cross-border payments and insurance.  Notably, the announcement also included details about potential actions by the new company that would be aimed at promoting XRP, the native token used to move value on the Ripple consensus system and that trades on public digital currency exchanges such as Kraken.  SBI and Ripple said they are now working to have XRP listed on SBI's online brokerage properties.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, he value of XRP has been on the decline for some time, with the market cap for the publicly traded token declining from $447m at the end of January 2015 to $203m today.

42378579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifNJ,1454065323,Why Russia's Draft 'Anti-Bitcoin' Law May Be Flawed,"A draft of a new Administrative Violations Code was submitted to the State Duma, the Russian Parliament, in December 2015. The bill is an extensive document covering a wide range of issues including tough regulation of 'money surrogates'. But what might it mean for bitcoin and other digital currencies?  Vladimir Pligin, head of the State Duma’s Constitutional Law and State Building Committee, has indicated the new bill will be considered by the Duma this February.  Still, it is uncertain how this comprehensive document will be considered by the Duma in such a short period of time.  The section on money surrogates in the bill is very specific and brief. In all likelihood, nobody in the Duma is going to pay particular attention to the section on money surrogates, and the bill could be enacted without any major amendment to this section.  The bill defines money surrogates as ""objects of property rights including electronic ones intended for use as a medium of payment and/or exchange that are issued in the Russian Federation and are not considered as an official medium of payment in Russia"".  Hence bitcoin should simultaneously meet all these criteria to be qualified as the money surrogate in Russia.  Fuzzy definition  However, this definition is quite vague and it is not clear whether bitcoin will fall under proposed regulation.  First of all, bitcoin is simply a record in a public ledger and not an 'object of property rights'. Besides an object of property rights is just a doctrinal concept in Russian civil law that implies assessment and transferability of the rights. Strictly speaking, it is impossible to define bitcoins in this way.  Moreover, the proposed definition mentions issuance in Russia as a criterion for money surrogates. The only way to determine the place of bitcoin ""issuance"" is to find out the IP address of the mining pool. It is unclear how the place of issuance would be determined in case of cloud mining.  Notably, the bill does not prohibit manufacturing and distribution of the mining hardware.  The definition considers money surrogates only as a medium of payment or exchange. Obviously, cryptocurrency is often not only a medium of payment, but also measure and store of value. It is unknown if and how the bill will regulate the mere storage of bitcoins.  In fact, the only criterion of money surrogates that unambiguously covers bitcoin is that the digital currency is not considered an official medium of payment in Russia.  Exemptions  The definition of the money surrogates is not only very vague, but it also has a broad list of exemptions.  For example, if a digital currency is considered as an official medium of payment in the CIS, the EU and in the UK, then it is not viewed as a money surrogate in Russia. There is always the probability of a precedent that will legalise bitcoin as a medium of payment in the UK.  Bearing in mind recent amendments to the Isle of Man legislation and the October 2105 ruling by the European Court of Justice on bitcoin VAT exemption, the likelihood of bitcoin legalisation in the UK or EU does not seem very futuristic.  What’s more, virtual currencies such as currencies in multiplayer online games and loyalty programs are exempt from classification as money surrogates. Exemption of loyalty programs differentiates this bill from a previous Russian Ministry of Finance bill in August 2014, which initially prohibited any kinds of rewards.  There are further differences from the Russian Ministry of Finance bill too:  The earlier bill proposed more complex regulation and amended several Russian laws, whereas the new Administrative Violation Code only suggests that more regulations are about to be introduced.  The Russian Ministry of Finance proposed the Bank of Russia as the enforcement agency, while the Russian police force is suggested as the enforcement authority in the new Administrative Violation Code.  The Ministry of Finance bill bans dissemination of information on the issuance of the money surrogates and the operation with them. The new bill prohibits only dissemination of information that is necessary and sufficient to the issuance of the money surrogates. There may turn out to be different perspectives on what kind of information will be eventually targeted, and perhaps wallet apps and mining clients will not be banned.  Regulation to come?  The Ministry of Finance bill was extensively discussed in Russia, and amended, yet it has not been submitted to the Duma. However, the clauses about money surrogate in the new Administrative Violation Code have stirred up very little local discussion.  There are, though, strong indicators in the bill that further regulation of money surrogates is on its way.  On the one hand, the clause “Malevolent issuance of money surrogates” penalises only the issuance of money surrogates that are not allowed by Russian laws or issuance in violation of the Russian law. Moreover, the bill allows the use of money surrogates when a person is identified in accordance with Russian law.  These clauses suggest that issuance of money surrogates is soon to be regulated.  On the other hand, the bill also implies criminal punishment for the issuance and the circulation of money surrogates.  In general, the proposed bill looks more like a 'legislation imitation' without a real intent to prohibit digital currencies in Russia. Not only is the definition of money surrogates extremely ill-defined, but the list of exemptions also gives an opportunity to argue that cryptocurrencies do not fall within its scope.  The bill could have specifically outlawed digital currencies in Russia without unnecessary looseness in the definition. And it is unclear how the proposed bill would be enforced. There is always the chance that the authorities will apply these clauses without proper legal analysis simply because bitcoins are not an official medium of payment.
