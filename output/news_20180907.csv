42381162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94E95,1536339091,Bets Against Ether's Price Hit All-Time High,"The number of short orders placed on ether (ETH) reached a new all-time high during Friday's trading session, according to data from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.  At approximately 10:00 UTC Friday, the number of shorts placed on ETH/USD, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassed the prior mark of 202,854 to ultimately reach a new high of 208,689.  The new figure represents an 81.96 percent increase week-to-week and a 162 percent jump from mid-August.  The development follows an unfavorable week for the broader cryptocurrency market and ETH in particular. From September 5-6, bitcoin (BTC) fell more than $1100, accounting for a nearly 15 percent drop. In that time, over $40 billion was shed from the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies tend to follow bitcoin's lead after a big move, and ETH was no exception. Three days ago, ETH was valued at $287 across exchanges but today is trading at $221, according to CoinDesk's Ether Price Index (EPI).  In all, the developments mark a more than 80 percent drop from ETH's all-time high north of $1200, so it's perhaps no surprise that investor confidence in ETH is at an all-time low.  When a short trade of this nature becomes overcrowded – as the new all-time high would suggest is the case – an astute investor has to consider the possibility of a ""short squeeze.""  When short positions are stacked so high, a small increase in price could cause those shorting to close positions in order to avoid a losing trade. Since the only way to close a short is to buy back the cryptocurrency, it's possible ETH could see a rapid price increase, also known as a ""squeeze.""  ETH/USD Shorts/Longs VS. Price  As seen in the above chart, an abundance of shorts failed to spark any type of short squeeze in June and July. At that time though, the longs were at a very low level, comparatively.  Looking at the data from a different angle, one could make the argument that short and long market conditions are more similar to that of last November and December, given the difference between the two is at very similar levels (depicted by the white line).  What's more, the relative strength index (RSI) is both diverging bullishly and printing low levels only seen in a few instances in years past. This suggests that the selling may be reaching an exhaustion point and that an upside rally remains a possibility.  While the idea of a short squeeze is comforting for bulls, it's never a guarantee – and the lack of technical support levels below ETH/USD has certainly provided merit for the overcrowded trade.

42381155,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94E2n,1536336024,Quoine Looks to Boost Crypto Liquidity With New Trading Platform,"Cryptocurrency exchange startup Quoine has launched a new trading platform that it says will bring much needed liquidity to the crypto markets.  Called Liquid, the new service is a cryptocurrency trading ""portal"" that provides users with access to what it claims in a press release is ""a worldwide network of cryptocurrency exchanges.""  With a lack of liquidity having ""hampered the development of the cryptocurrency markets,"" Liquid argued that its new product could help usher in greater stability.  From launch, Liquid will allow users to match trades across ""multiple transactions and cryptocurrencies"" – that is, make cross cryptocurrency conversions, as well as convert from the Singapore dollar (SGD). The firm says, as an example, orders of BTC/SGD, ETH/SGD and BTC/ETH could be matched together.  Later on, the firm plans to expand that offering with what it is calling a ""World Book"" technology. This aggregates orders and prices on different exchanges into a single order book and allows orders to be placed in the currency of choice, Quoine said.  According to an example of the system in the Liquid white paper, a German trader who wants to sell bitcoin can opt to view the World Book for bitcoin (BTC) in euros (EUR). When an order is placed, they will see their order enter the BTC/EUR market, with the order's price also being reflected in their orderbook in EUR.  If the trader's order to, say, sell BTC/EUR is matched with an order to buy BTC/SGD, ""an FX conversion happens behind the scenes."" After the trade, both parties receive their funds in their chosen order currencies.  Mike Kayamori, co-founder and CEO of Quoine, said in the release:  ""Cryptocurrency markets need stability. This year, the 30 day BTC/USD volatility [2] index has been above 3 percent for almost the entire year, with highs topping 8 percent at the start of the year. Liquid is paving the way to a less volatile future by improving liquidity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem,.""  Quoine operates cryptocurrency exchange businesses, and was licensed by Japan's financial watchdog, the Financial Service Authority, for its operations in the country back in September 2017.  Two months later, Quoine raised $105 million in a sale of its QASH token that it said would fund Liquid's development. The utility token will now be used to power the platform, allowing users to access to services.  In the press release, the firm further listed a number of features that it plans to add in the future including verification that allows withdrawals ""under certain limits"" to be made without having to undergo a know-your-customer process.

EOS New York, one of the network's 21 block producers (the entities elected to verify transactions on the network), announced Thursday that 15 block producers had approved a new protocol update which reduces cost of a new account from 4 kibibytes (KiB) to 3 KiB (roughly $1.84 as of September 6). KiB are used to measure amounts of data.  The change also grants new accounts 1,400 bytes of RAM for free, though existing accounts can buy, delegate or undelegate RAM to also receive 1,400 bytes for free.  Accounts on the EOS blockchain are necessary for transferring tokens or otherwise launching a transaction on the network.  The post further stressed the importance of making account creation easier to bring more decentralized app (dApp) developers on board in the early adoption phase, explaining:  ""EOS account creation cost is an extremely important aspect of the health of the platform. Many users of EOS decentralized applications are early adopters, people who are eager and willing to spend the time to understand the EOS blockchain. But in the future, users will not be as eager.""  Because dapp developers will therefore either have to create users' accounts or otherwise force users to pay to create accounts, lowering the cost ""dramatically reduces the barriers to development,"" the post said.

The Opera team said it believes the crypto collectibles trend is ""just getting started,"" and that, as the tech develops and becomes more user-friendly, online service such as games will increasingly move toward adoption.  Crypto collectibles like CryptoKitties are made possible by the ethereum ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens – one that allows for each to have specific attributes that may differ from other tokens.  In the post, Opera said it also sees a use case for non-fungible tokens in ""unlocking access to content or [verifying] eligibility for certain digital services.""  Also announced today, Opera is expanding its private beta of the wallet to more users via on online signup.  Further, the wallet will soon provide transaction notifications, with the firm saying it will monitor user's transactions and inform them of their status and when completed.

42381150,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94DwV,1536321653,"Are Big Crypto Token Sales Really Over? At Republic Event, Many Think So","The ICO is over.  At least that's what the market keeps hearing, and what was floated during the very first panel – called ""The Death of the Main Sale"" – at RepubliCon in Manhattan on Thursday. The event, hosted by crowd investing platform Republic, saw a number of crypto industry stakeholders discuss the cooling (by some measures) of the hype around the nascent fundraising mechanism called an initial coin offering.  Indeed, July was a slow month, with CoinDesk's ICO Tracker showing that project founders didn't manage to break even a billion dollars.  Although, there's still a lot of money trading hands. While everyone agrees that 2017 was the raucous year with ICOs garnering huge sums of money based on unrealistic expectations, 2018 topped the prior year's numbers by April.  ""By 'main sale,' I mean the public ICO in the fashion we saw late last year,"" Jed Halfon of Republic said as he introduced the panel participants.  According to Nelson Chu of Cadence, a company developing a security token, entrepreneurs and projects are finally seeing the weight of regulation.  ""It's died not because of any other reason other than companies are running afoul of regulators,"" he said.  Panelists and participants on the floor seemed to share the opinion that a certain era – the era of raising epic amounts of money with little more than a white paper –of ICO has come to an end.  ""I think what part quote-unquote ruined it is all the money people raised,"" Lee Schneider, an attorney now with Block.One, the company that built the EOS blockchain, said during the panel.  ""If I raised $50 million I'd have no idea what to do with it,"" he said, eliciting some laughs and chiding from his fellow panelists since his company raised $4 billion in a year long token sale. Schneider clarified he was only speaking for himself, saying, ""I think, as a company, we have a pretty good idea what to do with it.""  Yet, others weren't as pessimistic.  Caroline Hofmann, Republic's chief operating officer, doesn't think the main sale is over, per se, but instead thinks entrepreneurs and companies are being ""more cautious and thoughtful.""  And Ryan Alfred, co-founder of the blockchain oriented asset management firm Distributed Global, said the technology and mechanisms for utilizing the technology are just evolving naturally with the times.  On the panel, Alfred said:  ""Some of the earliest investments [in the crypto space] we made, ICOs weren't even a thing ... We just see this as a continuous evolution.""  Greater accountability  There did appear to be a consensus on the floor that crypto founders will be pressed more to deliver a real product going forward.  In fact, the very deals they make with investors could become more and more structured around delivering. Blockstack already did this with its ICO and there was also discussion on stage about ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's Decentralized Autonomous ICO (DAICO) model, which would allow investors more of a say in how the money raised is used.  ""In an industry building on governance, there's no governance for founders in the ICO process,"" Randy Mundy, the managing partner at a new firm looking into blockchain called Techlete Ventures, told CoinDesk.  Mundy liked the idea of tranches of payments to founders, whether it's with a DAICO or something simpler.  Pat Zailckas, of Clockwork, a due diligence company that works with Republic, among others, agreed.  He said the ""burden on the founders will become more intense,"" whether that means funds will only release when milestones are hit or founders commit to building a certain amount of technology based on how much money they raise.  Georgia Quinn of CoinList floated the idea that many companies that ICO'ed should have raised money in a more traditional way.  And Alfred echoed that sentiment, pointing to the bigger question as one of goals – ""You have to decide what you are. Are you a company or are you an open source project?""  Whatever may happen, nearly everyone at the event agreed that the entrepreneurs behind crypto projects, especially ones using the ICO method, need to be clearer about what they're about and what they plan on doing with any money raised.  Summarizing, Schneider said:  ""We need to educate investors how to make better investment decisions.""  Markets moving  No doubt, investors have already started wising up to the opportunity presented by long delays in launching products.  When companies release a token long before anyone can actually use it on the platform, the token price often drops at some point below even its ICO or private sale price.  Geoffrey Arone, a partner at Arrington XRP Capital, said on stage that he's taken meetings with very good companies, companies he believed could deliver, and still, he said, ""I've turned them away when, with fair certainty, I can get this cheaper after it ICOs.""  While the panel focused heavily on the atmosphere in the U.S., various participants on the floor pointed out that, in a different part of the world, the hype surrounding ICOs has yet to die down. For instance, in Asia, even though there have been various calls for crackdown on the industry, many people are still participating in crypto fundraising.  ""It's happening in Asia because there hasn't been much of a crackdown,"" Cadence's Chu said. ""I think the culture over there makes it more attractive for people to want to invest.""  Still, most people at the event agreed that entrepreneurs don't need to raise huge amounts of money to be successful.  ""The most interesting teams are raising less than $10 million,"" Alfred said, pointing to projects like FOAM and Livepeer, which have progressed quickly on relatively small ICO raises.  So the main sale isn't dead, but it is more modest.  ""I think companies blindly raising off the idea, without backing up the technology or justifying the capital, it's going to be harder to put that over investor heads,"" Clockwork's Zailckas told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""I think it's more related to: the hype phase is over.""

42381163,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94EBb,1536318039,$6K Ahead? Bitcoin Price Plunges After Brief Recovery,"For bitcoin, the path of least resistance is to the downside.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,340 on Bifinex – down 3 percent from the high of $6,550 hit earlier today. The bulk of that loss came amid a dramatic drop over almost $100 in an hour soon before press time.  The minor recovery from the previous day's low of $6,300 was likely a product of oversold conditions reported by the short duration relative strength index (RSI) yesterday.  More importantly, the fact that the gains were erased so quickly indicates that bearish sentiment is still quite strong and the minor pop has likely recharged engines for further sell-off.  After a period of strengthening bull indicators over the last three weeks, the technical charts have now shifted toward the bears. As a result, a drop to $6,000 (February low) cannot be ruled out  Hourly chart  As seen in the above chart, the last hourly candle confirmed a downside break of the rising wedge pattern, signaling an end of the technical recovery.  The major moving averages (MAs) – 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour – are trending south in favor of the bears. More importantly, the RSI is aligning with the bears, having dipped below 50.00.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, BTC suffered a rising wedge breakdown on Wednesday, indicating the rally from the Aug. 14 low of $5,859 has ended and the bears have regained control.  Further, the negative price action yesterday bolstered the bearish setup.  Investors should also keep an eye on the line chart, as a pennant breakdown would boost the odds of BTC ending the week below $6,000.  View  BTC could find acceptance below $6,300 (previous day's low) and may drop further towards the crucial support of $6,000 over the weekend.  A weekly close below $6,000 would signal a revival of the long-term bear market.  On the higher side, a technical recovery is seen above $6,550 (today's high), although with key intraday MAs trending south, gains may not be sustainable.

42381154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94E1X,1536310865,Australian Watchdog to Apply Market Rules to Crypto Exchanges,"A top Australian financial regulator has indicated it will take a new approach when regulating cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as tighten scrutiny of initial coin offerings (ICOs),.  In its a corporate plan for 2018–2022, released Friday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) outlined its areas of focus for the period. Top of that list is to continue ""monitoring threats of harm from emerging products"" such as ICOs and cryptocurrencies.  Further, for 2018 and 2019, ASIC said it is developing a new framework that will apply ""the principles for regulating market infrastructure providers to crypto exchanges"" and will intervene where ""there is poor behavior and potential harm to consumers and investors.""  According to the ASIC website, its current market infrastructure principals include a licensing scheme, via which it seeks to supervise financial market operators, settlement facilities, derivative trading and market participants.  The planned framework follows cross-department efforts the ASIC has been taking to implement supervisory approaches, such as dispatching staff onsite in financial institutions related to emerging tech including cryptocurrency, ASIC indicated.  Currently, cryptocurrency exchanges in Australia are required to comply with know-your-customer and anti-money laundering standards enforced by Austrac, the country's financial intelligence agency.  ASIC, however, has not issued any pertinent regulation for crypto exchanges, but did published guidelines last year for businesses wishing to conduct ICOs.  The plan appears a timely one, as the country has already seen one public firm seeking to raise capital via a token sale to fund the launch of a cryptocurrency exchange.  As CoinDesk reported this week, an IT firm called Byte Power Group has already started selling its proprietary tokens to private investors in Australia and Singapore in an effort to raise a total of $15 million.

Speaking at a TechCrunch event on Thursday, Robinhood CEO Baiju Bhatt revealed that the firm is ""actively looking for a CFO right now"" as he confirmed going public is ""definitely"" in the company's plan in the medium- to long-term.  He added:  ""Being a public company I think aligns very closely with our mission as well. And it's definitely on the horizon, not in the immediate term, but that's something we are thinking about.""  Further, Bhatt said as a financial service company, its security measures and financial performances are being audited by financial regulators in the U.S. such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The news follows Robinhood's announcement in May that it raised $363 million in a Series D round funding led by DST Global and Sequoia Capital, which valued the firm at $5.6 billion.  Bhatt said at the time that with the new capital, the firm aimed to ""become either the largest or one of the largest crypto platforms out there"" by end of 2018.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the zero-fee stock trading startup launched Robinhood Crypto in February aimed to allow users in the U.S. to buy and sell cryptocurrencies at lower costs.  Currently, it offers trading options for bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, litecoin, and dogecoin in 19 states in the U.S. and claims to have over 5 million users on the platform.

42381146,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94DrT,1536292835,The Creator of Proof-of-Stake Thinks He Finally Figured It Out,"Known for creating the first proof-of-stake-based cryptocurrency, pseudonymous developer Sunny King is back with an idea that's sure to surprise – adding hardware.  Proof-of-stake, or PoS, has been heralded as a more ecological way to come to consensus on blockchains since it doesn't rely on expensive hardware using vast amounts of electricity to compute mathematical puzzles (for instance, like bitcoin's proof-of-work).  As a result of this, and the algorithm's ability to handle more scale, various high-profile blockchain projects, including EOS, Tezos, NEO and Cardano, have adopted the system.  But according to King, by reworking the algorithm to allow for specialized hardware, PoS will be even better suited for high-speed transaction throughput.  The creator of peercoin, the first proof-of-stake cryptocurrency launched in 2012, and primecoin, a cryptocurrency that achieves its security by searching for prime numbers, King is known for finding innovative ways to re-architect the technology.  Primecoin even inspired ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who called King ""the single most original altcoin developer out there"" in 2013.  And now, he's hoping to inspire again with his new design called ""supernode proof-of-stake,"" or SPoS, which requires specialized hardware to operate.  While the project is still a bit light on the details, King said the concept of SPoS isn't far from delegated proof-of-stake, or DPoS, in that it allows for the concentration of staking pools. According to King, with this, the project intends to simplify the development and maintenance of the blockchains therein.  ""I try to envision an era that blockchain is used widely in technology,"" King told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Proof-of-stake consensus is especially designed for this purpose, to enable an era where millions or more blockchains can run independently with high level of security and basically no energy requirement.""  Built to popularize blockchain adoption by optimizing the technology for data-storage and making it more efficient to deploy, the project is being designed specifically for a Hong Kong-based project, Virtual Economy Era (VEE), of which King is chief architect.  It's set to go live on September 17, at which time an internal token, VEE coin, will also launch, and the project's code base will be made open source.  According to King, ""VEE takes a good look at the barriers of building blockchain applications and tries to streamline the process and expand the ecosystem, so at some point we can say using blockchain technology is as easy as using a database.""  Suspicions mount  Since the system will centralize more of the work of security, some might see this as anathema to the ethos of the cryptocurrency movement. Still, noting the arguments, King contended that SPoS is a ""reasonable compromise"" for a more highly performant system.  Yet, that's not the only reason some are suspicious of the project.  Announced on a peercoin forum in January, King's new venture hasn't been entirely well received by his former communities.  ""I don't think the project was presented that well to people in the community and the fact Sunny has barely communicated publicly on the forum for the last couple years does not help matters much,"" brand manager for peercoin, Randy Vittorini, told CoinDesk. ""I don't know much about why he chose to develop this other project.""  Sure enough, King, who was the main developing force behind peercoin and primecoin, stepped away from those, leaving them to flounder. Primecoin, for instance, is ""pretty much dead,"" Vittorini said.  Peercoin has had a rocky six years since King left, although currently, the developers behind peercoin are going to great lengths to ""modernize the codebase"" by making it Segwit and Lightning Network compatible.  As such, following King's announcement of the project, peercoin community members warned each other from investing in VEE, pointing to the fact that the information on the corresponding website is only partial.  Others warned that the company is simply using King's name as a marketing tactic — an assertion which peercoin's Vittorini, a long time associate of King's, pushed back hard against. ""He has always used the same email address for communication and his personality has stayed consistent over the years,"" Vittorini said.  Yet, that atmosphere of distrust is also present on VEE social media channels. According to a group chat on Telegram, the company is trying to raise 18,000 BTC – or $120 million – in a private sale, to be redeemed for VEE tokens on September 17. But further information has been sparse.  But according to Vittorini, such communication oversights are typical of King.  He told CoinDesk:  ""He only likes to deal with the tech side of things and not the marketing aspect or communication, which I have felt was always one of his greatest downfalls.""  And speaking to CoinDesk, King was adamant of the project's best intentions, describing it as a rational continuation, a ""natural evolution"" of his former research.  PoS continued  When it comes to VEE and the SPoS technology, King's focus has expanded into a different kind of sustainability — adoption.  By creating modular pieces of software that can make blockchain ""as easy as using a database,"" King said, should make the technology more accessible to more people.  And King explained, his departure from peercoin and primecoin was for this purpose.  Distinct from peercoin, SPoS is built with specialized hardware in mind, and while the exact details of this are ""still under evaluation,"" King told CoinDesk, ""Typically the memory and bandwidth requirement would be much higher than average PC's.""  King continued, saying the idea came to him due to a long-standing developer quandary in peercoin — the problem of so-called ""cold-minting.""  Also known as cold-staking, the question surrounds how to allow the participants in the network to stake their holdings while keeping those assets in a secure, offline location. Because it requires transferring a stake right to a third party, peercoin developers were concerned that it could lead to participants delegating their staking role to someone else, potentially leading to the formation of pools, which some see as a centralizing tendency.  ""The concern is that people will start offering services as nodes and people will trust their minting power to single collective points of failure,"" pseudonymous peercoin developer, Nagalim, told CoinDesk.  However, it's precisely this that King is exploiting in his new design.  The code makes it ideal to run the algorithm in optimized hardware environments, a bit like how ASICs perform for proof-of-work. Unlike proof-of-work, though, the electricity output is minimal, so King isn't worried that the energy consumption will be seen as wasteful, like some feel about bitcoin's mining process.  And while the system is more centralized by design, King has worked to ensure the security of the network, coding in an assurance that each supernode has an equal say — preventing a single entity from gaining too much power.  ""These two projects are maintained through community efforts during these several years, so it appears slower than some of their commercial competitions,"" King told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Meanwhile I was watching the blockchain industry as a whole and contemplating its potential future.""
