Seeking Alpha summed up the year in the timeline below featuring the collapses of formerly prominent crypto-related firms. A number of the companies suffered from a liquidity crunch triggered by the sudden drop in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other coins. July: Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, also called 3AC, filed for bankruptcy protection as the drop in digital asset prices, spurred in part by the abrupt downfall of the Terra blockchain ( LUNC-USD ) ( UST-USD ) a month before, led to a number of outsized margin calls from lenders that it failed to meet . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dropped 39.4% from the beginning of May to end-July, landing just shy of $23K. Shortly thereafter, Voyager Digital ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which allows a firm to restructure its debts while keeping operations active, a week after the crypto lender suspended customer deposits and withdrawals amid a broad liquidity crisis. The move notably came after 3AC defaulted on an over $660M loan from the company. Celsius Network, another crypto lender, followed suit when it filed for Chapter 11, listing between $1B-$10B in assets and more than 100,000 creditors. The company paused withdrawals, swaps and transfers from the network nearly a month before seeking relief amid turbulent market conditions. Singapore-based crypto exchange Zipmex rounded out the demise of crypto firms for the month. It filed applications under Section 64 of Singapore's Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act after blocking customer withdrawals . September: Compute North, formerly known as one of the largest data center hosting providers, filed for Chapter 11 towards the end of the month as the bear market continued to take its toll across the industry. Of note, the company was bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner Marathon Digital's ( MARA ) primary hosting provider. Between the end of July and the end of September, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) cratered 16.7% , ending up at around $19.3K. November: Just as some market participants started to call for a comeback in crypto, the industry suffered another major blow: The failure of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX ( FTT-USD ), which at one point was the second largest crypto exchange valued at $32B. The disgraced FTX founder, who faces criminal charges in the U.S., resigned from his CEO role as his empire filed for Chapter 11. The fallout from FTX rippled through the crypto ecosystem, causing crypto lender BlockFi to also file for Chapter 11 given its exposure to the centralized trading platform. BlockFi was forced to suspend customer withdrawals earlier in the month due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of FTX at the time. Bitcoin fell to $16.9K at the end of November, a slump of 11.7% from end-September. December: The latest in distress, Core Scientific ( CORZ ), one of the largest publicly traded producers of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), filed for Chapter 11 as the market downturn keeps stinging the industry. It, though is not a collapse, as the company expects to receive support from some of its existing holders of convertible notes in a restructuring deal. CORZ started trading at roughly $10 a share on April 8, only to plunge to $0.12 at Friday's close. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) changed hands at $16.8K as of Friday at 3:38 PM ET, down over 65% from a year ago. Seeking Alpha contributor Nathan Aisenstadt labeled bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) with a Sell rating, arguing the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance ""reduces the investment attractiveness"" of the token .",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3919547-crypto-space-didnt-catch-a-break-in-2022-seeing-one-implosion-after-another?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6316743.jpeg

6313919,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513577,1671904853,"A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin","2022 is coming to an end, and our staff at NewsBTC decided to launch this Crypto Holiday Special to provide some perspective on the crypto industry. We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Is Up 5% On This News In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. We kicked us this special with an institutional guest, asset management firm Blofin. In early December, they wrote an essay called “Catastrophe, Survival, and Evolution: Writing After November’s Crypto Markets” which inspired this series. Blofin: “One of the apparent signals is that in December 2022, monthly crypto spot volumes have returned to 2020 levels.” In their essay, the firm argues that the crypto industry has been heavily impacted by the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, FTX, Terra (LUNA), and others. These events forced crypto investors into inactivity as their confidence in the sector shattered. Blofin: “There is no doubt that crypto is the future direction of finance. Still, a series of previous events have shown that if investors’ money cannot be protected, they will eventually give up the crypto market (…).” But there is light at the end of the tunnel for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; albeit a long recovery is ahead, the nascent asset class will emerge from its ashes. For Blofin, the crypto industry is on the brink of a critical evolution. Once completed, the sector will rise again on the back of new institutional support. This is what they told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: The most significant difference comes from two aspects: liquidity and investor confidence. In 2021, the liquidity of the crypto market is still sufficient, and the impact of the liquidity contraction in the risk asset market has not yet fully manifested. In 2022, with the Fed’s (U.S. Federal Reserve) continuous interest rate hikes, Luna’s collapse, 3AC Capital’s (Three Arrow Capital) bankruptcy, and chapter 11 of the FTX exchange, the liquidity of the crypto market is basically squeezed dry. One of the apparent signals is that in December 2022, monthly crypto spot volumes have returned to 2020 levels. In addition, the blow to investor confidence from a series of events in 2022 will be huge. At Christmas 2021, institutions and retail investors feel they have a lot to do in the crypto market. At the end of 2022, even professional investment institutions have lost so much due to the collapse of exchanges. As a result, they no longer trust the crypto industry; they feel that there are Ponzi schemes and scammers everywhere. In the end, institutions choose to withdraw funds, followed by retail investors. However, the number of investors in the crypto asset market is still high. Many people are just not active in a bear market, but that doesn’t mean they have left the crypto market. They are watching and waiting for the best time to buy the dip. Non-Zero on-chain addresses are still increasing steadily, and the hash rate of miners has not been significantly affected by the bear market in 2022. The influence of fundamentals is still valid for the crypto market, but it is mainly concentrated on the macro perspective. During the bear market period, liquidity is concentrated in BTC and ETH, and it is difficult for altcoins to obtain more liquidity. Therefore, macro factors such as interest rate hikes and strong USD significantly impact BTC and ETH. At the same time, because of the bad liquidity status, improvements in the fundamentals of altcoins and project tokens are difficult to bring about sustained performance improvements. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: In our opinion, the changes in the market in 2022 depend on the position of the crypto market in the risk asset system. There is no doubt that crypto assets are at the tail end of the risk asset market due to the high volatility levels of the crypto market and the “Wild West” era it is in. Therefore, once there is any trouble, it is easier for investors to choose to sell and form a run, causing a more significant crisis. The crypto market in 2022 is somewhat like the Nasdaq in the late 1990s. Adventurers and warriors gained a lot of wealth before 2000 and in 2021, which stimulated more people to come and take risks. Most people ignore the risks and end up with nothing. Therefore, compliance and security should be an integral part of the future narrative of the crypto market. There is no doubt that crypto is the future direction of finance (faster speed, more programmatic, more global, more reasonable credit system, and more substantial innovation potential). Still, a series of previous events have shown that if investors’ money cannot be protected, they will eventually give up the crypto market and will not continue to pay for the potential of the market and new technologies, even if these technologies have potential and attractiveness. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: The collapse of FTX is the culmination of the 2022 bear market in the crypto market. The incident interrupted the slow recovery process of the crypto market and aroused widespread concern from regulators in major markets such as the US and the EU. In addition, many institutions have closed down due to the collapse of FTX or encountered operational difficulties and urgently need rescue. It can be expected that in 2023, the aftermath of the FTX incident may eventually cause some institutions to go bankrupt, and more regulatory policies will also be introduced. In addition, from a macro perspective, due to the continuation of high interest rates, it is difficult for the crypto market to usher in new liquidity, and it will take longer to recover. However, in the above questions, we have mentioned some characteristics of the crypto market that are difficult to be replaced by traditional markets (faster speed, more programmatic, more global, more decentralized, more reasonable credit system, and more substantial innovation potential). Therefore, as long as investors have trading needs, the crypto industry will continue to exist, but it will become more compliant and secure. Q: To summarize for our readers, what sectors have been the most resilient in this crisis? Which ones are the most likely to recover in 2023? And how do you see the evolution of the nascent industry playing out? A: Considering the degree of acceptance, mainstream currencies such as BTC and ETH are still the most resilient sectors in the crypto market. Public chains and crypto infrastructure are also one of the most resilient sectors in the crypto market in the future, for all applications in the crypto market need their support. In addition, the exchange sector is also quite resilient, for as the market stabilizes and gradually recovers, the trading needs of investors still exist and will start to grow again. Looking back at the history of the crypto market, many exchanges will go bankrupt in each bear period, but new exchanges will emerge in the bear market and shine in a new round of bull. However, it is difficult to determine who will be the first to recover in 2023. Since there is still a long time before the liquidity faucet reopens, the current liquidity shortage situation is still difficult to improve. The crypto market will likely continue to consolidate at a low level for a long time. Related Reading: MATIC Price Enters Recovery Mode But Can It Touch $0.90? The crypto market is now at the end of the “Wild West”. As the crypto market continues to develop and mature, after the events of 2022, lawmakers will gradually have examples to help, and the regulatory and compliance framework will also take shape. The above may limit the crypto market’s development in some directions, but it is also good for the long-term growth of the crypto market. Under the compliance framework, more funds from traditional markets and other sources can enter the crypto market, and the builders of the crypto market will have more opportunities to obtain investment.

In the last 24 hours, it barely registered any price movement. It just depreciated by 0.8%. It was an indication of sideways trading for the altcoin. The past week for LTC has been choppy owing to constant volatility amongst major market movers. Bitcoin has dropped in price over the last 48 hours, dragging most altcoins down with it. The technical outlook of the Litecoin price showed signs of struggle as the bears were still around. Demand for LTC slowed down, as did the accumulation. Buyers have continued to sell short as and when LTC lost its local support. From the technical outlook, the Litecoin price may present shorting opportunities for traders at some levels. For the coin to move on the upside, demand has to return in the market. Bitcoin has to move back above the $17,000 price level for most altcoins to gain momentum. The market capitalization of Litecoin declined in the last 24 hours, reflecting bearish pressure in the market at press time. Related Reading: Polkadot Price Can Fall To This Level Before Christmas Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LTC was exchanging hands at $65 at the time of writing. Even though the coin is consolidating at the moment, it can lose its local support. The immediate resistance for the coin stood at $68, and clearing that level will take the coin to $73. On the flip side, the inability to remain over $64 will bring the coin to $63 and then to $61. When the coin falls to $63 and then to $61, this would be a shorting opportunity for sellers as the coin will start correcting after that. The amount of Litecoin traded in the last session was in red, which indicated bearishness and more selling in the market. Technical Analysis The buyers were in control of the price of the asset for most of December. With increased market price volatility and Litecoin price consolidation, there was increased liquidation, causing buying strength to decline. The Relative Strength Index was near the 30-mark, which was a sign of overselling. In accordance with the selling pressure, the Litecoin price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, and that meant sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Sellers continue to have leverage in the market, but an indicator shows that buyers could step in now. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) reads the price trend and reversals within it. AO portrayed green histograms, which were buy signals for the coin. If buyers act on it, the price of the altcoin can momentarily go up before it descends. The Directional Movement Index indicates the price direction of the asset. DMI was negative as the -DI line (orange) was above the +DI line (blue). The Average Directional Index (red) was dipping near the 20-mark, meaning that the current price direction lacked strength. Related Reading: MATIC Price Enters Recovery Mode But Can It Touch $0.90?

6295723,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513627,1671882354,Polkadot Price Can Fall To This Level Before Christmas,"The Polkadot price has been on a downtrend ever since the beginning of August. The coin has pierced through several price floors in that duration. In the past 24 hours, the coin has lost 1.6%. In the last week, DOT sustained double-digit losses. At this moment, DOT has again resumed its lateral trading, but signs point towards the coin losing further momentum. The technical outlook depicts that the bears have taken over the market completely. The altcoin was undervalued as it was oversold on the chart. The demand for DOT had completely faded, which resulted in less accumulation. As DOT continued to lose value over the past several months, investor interest faded, which also resulted in the shorting of the altcoin. Presently, the Polkadot price is sandwiched between the $4.60 and $4.30 price levels, and going by the technicals, DOT is eyeing a fall below the $4.30 mark before it starts correcting itself. At press time, the Polkadot price was trading 91% below its all-time high secured in 2021. Related Reading: MATIC Rising: Why Investors Are Upbeat On This Crypto For 2023 Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $4.50 at the time of writing. The coin has recently lost a $5.06 support line, and since then, Polkadot price has been consolidating. Continued consolidation will see a further loss of value because sellers will lose interest in the asset again. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $5 and then at $5.71. If the altcoin moves above the $5.71 price level, the chances of Polkadot price revisiting the $6 zone increase. On the other hand, due to a lack of demand, the coin will inevitably fall below the $4.30 level and sit at $4.16. The amount of DOT traded in the last session remained low, signifying bearish strength. Technical Analysis The altcoin was mostly under considerable selling pressure for most of this month. Over the last week, it was hovering around the oversold territory. The Relative Strength Index was near the 20-mark which signifies heavily oversold tendencies and it means that the bears have completely taken over the market. The same idea reflects in the other indicator. DOT price was below the 20-mark which meant that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The coin confirmed that sellers had taken over the market momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates market momentum and trend reversals. MACD displayed red histograms, which were the sell signal for the altcoin. Parabolic SAR portrays the price direction; dotted lines were above the price, which signified bearishness and a lack of strength in the current price direction. If DOT has to overturn the bearish outlook, the coin has to move above the $5.06 resistance line.
