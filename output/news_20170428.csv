42399795,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymCt,1493409712,Arizona Bitcoin Trader in Custody Following Police Raid,"A bitcoin advocate and trader in Arizona remains in custody after his home was raided last week by federal officials.  Thomas Costanzo was arrested on 20th April during the raid after law enforcement discovered that he was in possession of ammunition – a reported violation of an agreement stemming from a prior conviction.  Costanzo, who also goes by the name ""Morpheus Titania"", operates a bitcoin website, through which he offers trading services, as well as ATM and mining products.  Court documents obtained by CoinDesk reveal that US Magistrate Michelle Burns has ordered Costanzo to stay in custody until trial following a hearing held today. According to the document, Costanzo has been deemed a ""serious flight risk"", with Burns citing his past criminal history and ""a record of prior failure to appear in court as ordered"", according to the document.  As previously reported, officials, led by the Department of Homeland Security, obtained a search warrant that granted them permission to seize assets including the cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ethereum and dash, as well as software related to digital currency. However, to date, Costanzo has only been charged for unlawful possession of ammunition.  Maria Weidner, a public defender representing Costanzo, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42427520,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnhh,1493405760,"$1,300 and Counting: What's Next For Bitcoin Prices?","The price of bitcoin is once again trading near an all-time high.  After about a month of uncertainty following the rejection of a major investment vehicle, bitcoin prices reached $1,343.59, a new all-time high on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index on Thursday, breaking the previous record of $1,325.81, set in March.  Yet, even after this modest pullback, analysts are predicting bitcoin prices will continue their steady, upward climb, pointing to factors such as technical progress in the wider cryptocurrency space as well as the growing use of bitcoin in emerging markets as factors pushing its price higher.  But with the price of bitcoin up 200% year-over-year, many are now asking where the digital asset will trade going forward. Analysts largely agreed it's up.  When identifying bitcoin's psychological price level, more than one pointed to $1,500, though there was far from an even consensus.  Tuur Demeester, economist and cryptocurrency trader, for example, emphasized the importance of bitcoin's yuan-denominated price.  ""¥8,000 seems [to be] an important psychological level,"" he said, adding:  ""Once we're past that, the sky is blue.""  At press time, bitcoin was trading at just ¥7,800 (roughly $1,130), a differential no doubt influenced by the current freeze on certain exchanges services in China.  Elsewhere, traders were even more bullish on prices.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged digital currency platform BitMEX, took perhaps the most bullish approach among analysts polled, asserting that $2,000 could be a reasonable target for the asset.  Likewise, cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Tim Enneking predicted that the cryptocurrency's price will ""march to $1,500"", but perhaps stop in that range.  Profit taking?  Still, Enneking told CoinDesk that bitcoin prices will pause at this level as traders take profits and adopt a ""wait-and-see"" approach.  Enneking asserted that without such a pause, ""it will be too much upward movement too fast to sustain"". Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool, was also hesitant.  He emphasized that once bitcoin reaches a fresh, all-time high, it is difficult to predict exactly when traders will begin taking profits.  Of course, given that many bitcoin traders identify as long-term bulls, some may simply balk it this question, raising up the digital currency's performance as another sign it's destined to become a viable, and valuable, alternative to fiat options.

42427501,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnHh,1493401824,New York Bitcoin Trader Pleads Guilty to Unlawful Money Transmission,"A New York-based bitcoin trader has plead guilty to unlawful money transmission and making false statements to federal officials.  Richard Petix of Rochester, NY was originally charged with making false statements in late 2015, according to court records, after he told probation officials in October of that year that he wasn’t using any computer device, as required following of a 2009 conviction on a charge of knowingly transporting child pornography in interstate commerce.  Yet Petix, the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York said this week, had been operating a bitcoin trading business, and on 3rd December 2015, sold 37 bitcoins (an amount worth roughly $13,000, according to then-current prices) to an undercover agent.  The office said in a statement:  ""Using his laptop computer and smartphone, the defendant transferred approximately $13,000 in the form of 37 bitcoins to an address specified by the agent. When confronted by federal probation officers at the scene, however, Petix claimed that the laptop and smartphone were not his and that he could not access them.""  Prosecutors further alleged that Petix sold more than $200,000 worth of bitcoin between August 2014 and December 2015. Yet court documents show that one point, the defense argued that the allegation of unlawful money transmission wasn’t valid, given that Petix didn’t charge a fee for those transactions.  Petix was initially set to go on trial on 1st May. According to court documents, he will attend a sentencing hearing on 14th August.

42427523,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnfh,1493388924,German Regulators Order OneCoin to 'Dismantle Trading System',"Germany is stepping up its ongoing crackdown on OneCoin, a digital currency investment scheme widely believed to be fraudulent.  The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has issued new cease-and-desist orders to two holding companies connected to OneCoin – Onecoin Ltd, Dubai and OneLife Network Ltd – ordering them to ""dismantle their internet based 'OneCoins' trading system"" and to ""end all sales promotion activities"" in Germany effective immediately.  OneCoin is an investment scheme centered around a purported digital currency, for which packages of ""tokens"" are sold that can later be exchanged. The operation has long been accused of operating a pyramid scheme, as participants are encouraged by advocates to find other buyers.  Notably, the regulator suggested that OneCoin promoters in Germany hadn't sought permission prior to conducting their activities, a determination that BaFin said spurred the latest cease-and-desist notices.  BaFin said it had issued a cease-and-desist notice to a third entity connected to OneCoin, One Network Services, for supporting the unauthorized sale of OneCoin in Germany.  The move indicates that Germany is accelerating its efforts to keep OneCoin out of the country. It comes just over a week after BaFin moved to halt the operations of a OneCoin-tied payment processor in Germany, freezing €29m in connected bank accounts.  But Germany isn’t the only country to crack down on OneCoin. Reports surfaced this week that authorities in India had arrested at least 18 individuals connected to the scheme.  A number of central banks have also issued warnings, including Thailand's, according to reports.

42427513,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnVh,1493385986,Zebpay Aids Indian Police After Bank Thieves Buy Bitcoin,"Indian bitcoin exchange Zebpay has had its bank account unfrozen following a state investigation into a bank theft, the startup said today.  Regional news service Pune Mirror reported earlier this week that criminals had exploited a bug that allowed them to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from the state-owned Bank of Maharashtra. Those behind the heist then exchanged some of those funds for bitcoins through Zebpay.  In investigating the crime, police froze three bank accounts tied to the outgoing funds, including one owned by the exchange. According to the report, four individuals were ultimately identified as the alleged culprits, all residents of the city of Buldhana.  When contacted by CoinDesk, Zebpay co-founder Sandeep Goenka said that the bug had allowed the hackers to spend more money than was actually held in the affected accounts, some of which was used to buy bitcoins with the exchange.  The startup had cooperated with the investigation into the theft, he explained, adding that ""operations were normal during this period and none of our users were affected"".  Goenka told CoinDesk:  ""Zebpay helped the Pune Cyber Crime department to get back the bitcoins purchased by the accused. This was possible because we follow KYC for all users. The Cyber Crime office then gave orders to sell the bitcoins to recover the money. These bitcoins were also sold on Zebpay.""  According to the co-founder, the court has already given orders to unfreeze the exchange's bank account and the ""matter is now closed"".  Zebpay, founded in 2012, raised $1m in a Series A funding round in early 2016.

42427514,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnXh,1493382928,ICO Debate Exposes Rift in Enterprise Ethereum Alliance,"The newly launched Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) might not be as aligned as its name suggests.  Launched in February  , the group of ethereum startups and enterprise institutions aims to leverage large corporate investment in the private ethereum blockchain in a way that also strengthens the public blockchain. To share more about the current state of EEA, as well as its direction going forward, several members of the group gathered at the the Rise fintech accelerator in New York.  At the event, hosted by New York research and education firm Blockmatics, a panel consisting of representatives from JP Morgan, BNY Mellon, ConsensSys, Monax and BlockApps provided insight into the complexities of forming consensus with so many disparate interests.  The most heated part of the evening involved discussion of funding via cryptographic token sales, also known as 'initial coin offerings' (ICOs).  In response to a question from the audience about how to conduct an ICO in a trustworthy way, Monax COO and general council Preston Byrne doubled-down on his well-known critical stance of the model, while another panelist defended it and one even did the blockchain equivalent of pleading the Fifth.  'Dumb money'  Though it seems possible to craft crypto tokens in a way that would prevent them from being categorized as securities (and hence coming under more stringent controls), the end result is similar in that they let firms raise money for projects through investors.  Byrne's issue with the ICO model is that it is frequently used by groups who have little more than a white paper to show the potential investors, and who rarely have proven market demand for their product.  Byrne said:  ""They take a startup's incentives as a model and turn it on its head. Which is, they're supposed to produce some product, they're supposed to build a business.""  Instead, he argued, those who use ICOs to raise money are ""exploitative, abusive"" in turning to what was called ""dumb money"" multiple times throughout the night – a reference to people who don't fully understand what they're investing in.  ""[T]hey have no redeeming characteristics whatsoever,"" Byrne said, describing the risks of participating in an ICO, warning:  ""May god have mercy on the souls of those who invest in them.""  Global movement?  On the other side of the debate, ConsenSys executive director of enterprise and social impact, Vanessa Grellet, heralded ICOs as a progressive departure from more traditional venture capital structures.  Though ConsenSys – a startup building decentralized applications on ethereum – itself isn’t directly funded by an ICO, it has benefited from ethereum's original token sale, which could be considered the success story and progenitor of the idea.  Grellet cited the controversial ICO of the ConsenSys 'spoke' Gnosis, in which a $12m raise gave the firm a valuation of about $300m based on unsold tokens, as an example of a ""very successful"" implementation of the investment vehicle.  Stating that she believes regulation around token sales will ""relax itself"" to take into account the new funding model, Grellet added:  ""It will grow. It’s a global movement, it's not going to stop and it’s a wonderful way to get your startup going.""  Nothing to see here  Perhaps indicative of the different strategies employed by the startups and the enterprises involved with the EEA, both panelists representing enterprise banks – Amber Baldet, JP Morgan's blockchain program lead, and Allison Paz, a fintech senior analyst at BNY Mellon – remained silent on the issue.  Similarly, Kieren James-Lubin, founder of BlockApps (another ConsenSys spoke), merely said: ""I'm not saying anything.""  While the mood in the room was occasionally heated, the group exited stage left in what seemed like good spirits.  Before leaving, Byrne jokingly called himself the ""problem child"" of the EEA, and further described a series of other internal debates surrounding the mechanism by which consensus should be achieved and more.  He further explained that the discussions were all part of the normal growing pains of such a group and would likely be resolved over time.  He concluded:  ""It’s a question of everyone getting to know each other.""

42427507,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnNh,1493379041,Florida's Money Laundering Statute Won't Affect Most Bitcoin Users,"Andrew 'Drew' Hinkes is counsel at Berger Singerman LLP, a business law firm in Florida. Hinkes represents companies and entrepreneurs in state and federal commercial litigation matters, representation of court-appointed fiduciaries and electronic discovery issues.  In this opinion piece, Hinkes looks at the potential impact of the recent court decision in Florida that centered in part on the definitions of both bitcoin and money transmission.  This proposed revision seems to be a direct reaction to the dismissal order in State vs Espinoza (which remains on appeal), and that would close a loophole in Florida's money transfer statute.  But, however ominous it may sound, this change would only impact a fraction of virtual currency activities, so the new definition is likely to have a minor impact on its use in Florida.  One of the key innovations of bitcoin and other virtual currencies is the ability to transact pseudonymously. Most virtual currency transactions do not require the transacting parties to know each other, meet face-to-face or directly interact to exchange value. Most often, virtual currency users transact across the internet, through QR codes, trade on exchanges or buy and sell their bitcoins via bitcoin ATMs.  For the purposes of this law, the lack of direct communication between parties is critical, and demonstrates the narrow impact of the proposed legislation.  Getting technical  Florida's Money Laundering Statute, based upon a similar federal statute (18 U.S.C. §1956 1998) covers nine different behaviors.  First, it punishes ""transactions"" wherein a person, ""knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,"" conducts or attempts to conduct such a ""financial transaction"" which in fact involves the proceeds of ""specified unlawful activity"" either:  With the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity  Knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to(a) conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or,(b) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under state law.  Florida's statute also covers ""transportation"" type of infractions including where any person transports or attempts to transport a monetary instrument or funds:  With the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity  Knowing that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation is designed in whole or in part:(a) To conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or(b) To avoid a transaction reporting requirement or money transmitters’ registration requirement under state law.  Florida’s statute also covers financial transactions which ""involve property or proceeds which an investigative or law enforcement officer, or someone acting under such officer’s direction, represents as being derived from, or as being used to conduct or facilitate, specified unlawful activity,"" when the person’s conduct or attempted conduct is undertaken with the intent:  To promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity  To conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds or property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity;  To avoid a transaction reporting requirement under state law.  Any charge brought under this statute requires that the party charged with its violation have intent and/or actual knowledge.  On Espinoza  Espinoza was charged with violating §896.101(3)(c), Fla. Stat., (relating to law enforcement officers), and (5)(a) and (b) (discussing the appropriate punishment for the violation based upon the amount of value at issue).  The court dismissed that charge against Espinoza based upon three separate defects:  A lack of clarity of whether virtual currency is ""monetary instrument""  A lack of clarity as to the meaning of the word ""promote""  A lack of clarity of which party to the transaction needs to have intent demonstrated by evidence.  Although the bill may clarify that virtual currency now qualifies as a monetary instrument, the other two issues identified by Judge Pooler in the Espinoza opinion remain unaddressed by this bill.  Because money laundering charges under ch. 896, require that at least one of the two parties to the transaction have knowledge and or intent, and a charge must be supported by evidence of that intent and or knowledge, most virtual currency transactions will still not factually qualify for prosecution under this law.  While there may be greater risk to users of virtual currency who actually interact personally with others, or have actual knowledge of the motives to exchange value, the proposed statutory change will probably not affect most virtual currency users.

42427526,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVnph,1493373608,Ethereum Stole the Show at Microsoft's New York City Demo Day,"The ethereum blockchain featured strongly at a Microsoft demo day in New York this week, as cutting-edge firms working with the computing giant on a range of technological solutions showcased their projects.  In total, three high-profile companies – Bank of America, tech firm Mojix and digital travel firm Webjet – demoed products built using ethereum to streamline various aspects of their industries and usher in new levels of transparency.  But it wasn't the solutions in their own right that most excited Marley Gray, Microsoft's principal architect in change of Azure blockchain engineering. Rather, it was the potential that each of these diverse industries might one day use blockchain to interoperate with one another.  Gray told CoinDesk:  ""Once you approach that tipping point, that blockchain that's using a smart contract, that's tracking the supply chain, we can have the financing tied to that and have the smart contracts interoperate to create benefits for early payment or early delivery, or whatever...""  In total, about 100 technologists, analysts and purchasers, as well as 30 reporters, attended the invitation-only Digital Difference event, designed to show how Microsoft's customers have partnered with the software provider to improve their products.  Of course, it wasn't all about blockchain, and other demos included a way to standardize sports data, a video game and a snake-like robot.  Upon entering the room, Ann McCormack, Bank of America's director of trade and supply chain finance, presented an updated version of the ethereum letter of credit first revealed last September at Sibos in Switzerland.  This app is being built to help further digitize the still-antiquated trade finance process, with Microsoft Treasury as one of its first testers.  Representing radio frequency identification hardware and data analytics firm Mojix, the firm's president and CEO, Dan Doles, presented the progress made on his firm's RFID scanner integrated with a private version of the ethereum blockchain.  First revealed to CoinDesk in January, Mojix's blockchain app for connecting Internet of Things devices is part of a larger effort Microsoft calls Project Manifest, which we were told has been contacted by as many as 13 firms interested in participating.  Finally, the managing director of Australian digital travel firm Webjet Limited, John Guscic, demoed his company's ethereum pilot – designed to cut down on the time it takes to reconcile hotel room availability around the world.  Webjet positioned the improvement to the wholesale B2B hotel-booking process as a way to reduce customer reservation errors.  An additional ethereum application in the advanced stages of development was also discussed in an off-the-record conversation with CoinDesk, with details of the project to be made public in the following weeks.  Wider picture  It should perhaps come as no surprise that the demos on display focused on ethereum applications, with Microsoft having launched a multi-platform blockchain-as-a-service sandbox within its cloud service Azure in 2015.  But the event featured broader buy-in, kicking off with a discussion between senior Microsoft executives and panelists including Ibrahim Goksen, chief digital officer of Maersk, a Danish global shipping company.  Maersk demoed non-blockchain applications at the event, but it also has a blockchain tool currently being developed on Hyperledger's open-source Fabric blockchain – not ethereum.  While on stage, Goksen spoke of an underlying principle that tied together the blockchain work on display and the data management issues likely experienced by every enterprise in the room.  Goksen said:  ""If you don't bring all that data together, if you don't have the container data, the port data, it's going to be tough for us to make the right decision.""

As reported in February, West Virginia House Bill 2585 constitutes an update to the state's anti-money laundering statutes, specifically creating a definition for cryptocurrency that is recognized as a 'monetary instrument' in the state.  The definition included in the bill reads:  ""'Cryptocurrency' means digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, and which operate independently of a central bank.""  The measure is on the cusp of becoming state law, public records show.  Lawmakers have finished drafting the bill following a conference period, according to LegiScan, a legislation data service provider. The state's lower chamber initially passed the bill by a 78–21 vote, with the senate approving the measure unanimously a month later in a 34–0 vote.  The bill, though subject to approval by the state’s governor, Democrat Jim Justice, forms part of a larger legislative trend happening in the US today.
