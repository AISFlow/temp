Benjamin James Cance, from Plainwell, is facing charges for shipping illegal arms, possession of an unregistered machine gun and money laundering.  Cance appeared before Magistrate Judge Phillip J Green yesterday and pleaded not guilty. He has since been released on bond and is awaiting trial, although no official date has been set.  International arms shipment is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, whereas the maximum penalty for money laundering and possession of a machine gun carries a 10-year prison sentence, statements from the Department of Justice indicated.  The investigation of the case is being carried out by the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service, the US Postal Inspection Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

42398580,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH2v,1439397995,Coinify Acquires Competing Bitcoin Payments Processor Coinzone,"Coinify has acquired competing Europe-based payments processor Coinzone as part of an undisclosed deal announced today.  With the move, the Denmark-based company has expanded its merchant base to an estimated 10,000 actively monthly customers, up from 8,000 before the acquisition. Further, it has grown its employee base to 17, with the addition of Coinzone's sales staff.  Coinify  CFO Christian Visti Larsen indicated that the purchase comes as his firm is seeking to shift its focus from acquiring individual merchants to payment service providers (PSPs). He explained Coinify is seeking to replicate a model invoked by its US peer Bitnet, in that it will seek to partner with larger entities that provide payments support to thousands of online merchants.  Visti Larsen told CoinDesk:  ""More merchants today do business with a PSP and would rather have multiple payment options through a PSP. Most of Coinzone's partners were asking for this service, so it seemed like a perfect match.""  Visti Larsen also commented on the success of this model in the US, where bitcoin payments are already supported by PSPs such as CardinalCommerce, PayPal and Stripe. He suggested it was time for the European market to ""step up"" its performance and said Coinify is working on as many as eight deals with European PSPs.  Outgoing Coinzone CEO Manuel Heilmann told CoinDesk his firm's existing management staff will remain at the company for a ""transition period"", though no executives will join Coinify in full-time roles. Heilmann said he is seeking to return to the e-commerce industry, but will continue to advocate for the technology.  Founded in 2014, Coinzone is an Amsterdam-based payment processor that had garnered most of its traction in eastern Europe.

According to a company statement, investors included VC firms Mitsubishi UFJ Capital Co – one of Japan's largest investors – Venture Labo Investment Co and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital Co.  Dentsu Digital Holdings Inc  – a business management company in the digital communications market – and financial information provider Quick Corp also participated in the round.  Japan-based bitFlyer said it would use the latest funds to heighten security for its customers plus establish and maintain a solid management system.  The statement continued:  ""In addition, bitFlyer will take advantage of synergies available with each investment organisation, and will continue to promote customer base expansion, strengthen revenues, and expand our global business development.""  The news follows the closure of a previous 130m JPY ($1.1m) funding round in January, led by Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group, and brings the exchange's total funding to date to approximately $6.9m.  BitFlyer was first launched after its CEO Yuzo Kano, a former derivatives and convertible bonds trader at Goldman Sachs, raised $1.6m last summer.  At the time, it was perceived that the new exchange set out to recapture the vacuum in Japan's bitcoin market market following the collapse of the exchange Mt Gox.

42398620,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH7q,1439377800,Fiat Wallets: The Key to Bitcoin Going Mainstream?,"Jack C. Liu is head of international at OKCoin and OKLink. He is based in Beijing and previously held roles at Barclays Capital and bitcoin exchange Kraken. In this article, he explores whether the crypto industry should be pushing fiat wallets, rather than bitcoin wallets, if it wants digital currency to go mainstream.  Since bitcoin was introduced in 2009, we have seen endless efforts to make it mainstream.  These efforts have spanned the launches of the world’s ‘easiest bitcoin web wallet’, ‘easiest bitcoin mobile wallet’, ‘consumer multi-sig wallets’ and ‘easiest way to buy bitcoins’.  The user interface has improved by leaps and bounds. We as a community even spent more than a year debating ‘bits’ vs ‘bitcoin’ in an effort to make new bitcoin owners feel wealthier. Startups who act as custodians of customers' bitcoins began advertising ""we are fully insured"", ""we have proof of reserves"", ""we have the world’s most secure vault"" and ""we are fully licensed"".  What has been achieved so far?  One could argue that instead of mainstreaming bitcoin as a payment network, we’ve instead encouraged the speculation on bitcoin prices.  In the past couple of years, as volatility became an issue in light of a more than 70% drop in bitcoin prices, merchant services offered retailers the ability to accept fiat over the bitcoin network.  The way it works is that consumer bitcoins would be sent to the merchant processor, who then settles with the merchant in the desired fiat currency. However, the benchmarks of success for these services have included statistics on the percentage of revenues merchants keep as bitcoin.  It begs the question: Why does that even matter?  This spring, on the consumer side, services such as OKLink, Coinbase, and Circle have solved the volatility issue for consumers by adding or pre-announcing fiat wallets linked to the bitcoin network. CNY (OKLink) and USD (Coinbase and Circle). This will let users pay and receive in their local currency, while the transfer is made using bitcoins in the background and without any currency exchange risk.  Thus far, this is being offered as somewhat of a side feature. These services are maintaining the dual mode of allowing users the choice to use bitcoin as the front end (bitcoin wallet over the bitcoin network) or the back end (fiat wallet over the bitcoin network).  This is akin to a gas station offering you a core service of buying and storing oil, while giving you the optional side service of filling your car.  In no way am I disparaging bitcoin’s long term value and the promise it holds as the best money the world has ever seen. A different approach towards mainstreaming adoption of the network won’t weaken this function, and could in fact strengthen it.  Bitcoin's three common user functions  1. Opting out of the system – be your own bank  Services range from Blockchain.info, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Ledger Nano, LocalBitcoins, etc.  2. Investing in bitcoin the asset  Services range from bitcoin exchanges such as OKCoin, to investment vehicles including Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), NASDAQ ETN, to paper wallets.  3. Using bitcoin as the open payment network  What’s magical about bitcoin is that it can be all three. It can even be a hundred more things. However, if we are to accelerate the process of bitcoin becoming mainstream, there is good reason to focus on strengthening the third function – the universal payment network.  The opting-out lifestyle is currently a choice made by a minority of people. Bitcoin as an investment is largely for those looking to diversity their portfolio or those with excess funds to spare. Bitcoin as an open payment network however, is something that the entire planet can use. That is mainstream by definition.  The store of value/unit of account conundrum  As long as the currency used for store of value (bitcoin) and the currency used for unit of account (fiat) are different, the short-term balance sheet risk is something the majority will not accept even if bitcoin generally appreciates in value.  To suggest otherwise, one would come across as being out of touch with the lives of most people who live paycheck to paycheck.  We can’t sit around waiting for a financial crises or a massive inflation in fiat currencies to help bitcoin take off. The mark of a superior technology is that it never relies on failures of its predecessor.  Bitcoin is not for the unbanked, just as email was not for those without access to the post office. Email did not wait for postage stamps to become more expensive or mail to be lost to gain adoption.  Sure, bitcoin may eventually have the greatest impact on the lives of the unbanked just as $25 Android phones have proven to. However, it should be noted that smartphones did not start in those markets.  Taking all this into consideration, it is my thought that perhaps companies should consider fiat wallets as the sole option for consumers and merchants, or at least the default option.  Imagine making micro-payments to anyone using any service instantly for free, in your preferred currency without any systemic counter-party risk. That’s something we could all use.  The more the bitcoin payment rails are accepted, the more those who live on bitcoin and those who invest in bitcoin the asset will benefit. It’s virtuous.

42398588,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH8p,1439349059,Visa Working on Blockchain Tech in Innovation Labs,"Leading global credit card processing firm Visa will soon begin researching bitcoin and blockchain technology, according to a new report.  Speaking to LiveMint, the online division of India's second-largest newspaper, Visa executive vice president of technology Rajat Taneja indicated that the research will take place in the company's innovation labs, which are focused on improving its Visa Checkout and mVisa products.  The announcement follows a period of indifference from the credit card giant, which has formerly stated it does not see the technology as a business threat, while acknowledging that it could perhaps support bitcoin as a payment method.  Taneja told the media outlet:  ""India will soon have teams that will jointly work with our two research labs in US and Singapore in studying the many aspects of blockchain.""  Visa's Bengaluru office, Taneja said, employs 400 engineers and will soon expand to 1,000, though not all are expected to work on bitcoin or blockchain-related initiatives.  The article went on to indicate that Visa is considering partnerships with companies including Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services that would also focus on blockchain projects.
