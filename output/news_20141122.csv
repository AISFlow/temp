42377836,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73izD,1416688912,Boost VC Goes 'Full Bitcoin' For Next Startup Mentor Round,"Boost VC, the startup accelerator and immersive mentorship program co-founded by Adam Draper, will accept only bitcoin companies for its next round, known as 'Tribe 5'.  Boost VC  will include 20-30 bitcoin companies for its next three-month entrepreneurship course starting early 2015. The startups enrolled live in shared housing while they work on growing their companies and meet regularly with key Silicon Valley figures and investors.  According to a message posted on Medium, Boost VC is looking for startups working in the fields of ""payments, exchanges, blockchain technology, sidechains, and companies that service bitcoin companies"".  The issue of trust  Boost VC has always been a 'bitcoin-friendly' accelerator, so the move will not come as a complete shock. Draper had previously vowed to use the program, which he founded in late 2012, to fund 100 bitcoin startups by 2017.  It has also mentored and funded bitcoin services companies like Gliph, Vaurum (now known as Mirror), snapCard and BitPagos. Following the tech industry standard, it invests and takes a small stake in every company it mentors.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Draper said Boost VC's criteria for inclusion were ""hard working entrepreneurs, scrappy (as in committed), and people who are enjoyable to be around"".  For bitcoin to penetrate the masses and find broad appeal, he added, trust is the issue.  ""I think that we need people to understand that it isn't only a toy, that bitcoin is a powerful tool that can help update the current financial system. And all the companies in the space are doing just that.""  No one thing will spark that breakthrough, Draper, said, instead it will be about continuing the momentum that has been started for the technology – which is something Boost seeks to do.  Boost VC's previous program, Tribe 4, wrapped up last month and featured mostly bitcoin-focused companies. The accelerator had received over 700 applications from startups, accepting fewer than 4% to participate.  Bitcoin is just the first step, the company said. Referring to the gap between the 'visionary' and 'pragmatic' stages of a market, it said Boost VC hopes to be able to breach other 'before-the-chasm' industries.  Aims in the space  Boost VC gave three reasons for its decision to focus solely on bitcoin for its next incubator round.  Firstly, 'hyperfocus' – wanting to become the leader of this industry, with the best network, and with the ability to add tremendous value to anyone in the space.  Secondly, 'playing to strengths' – a referral to the success of past participants. On average, a Boost company will have raised over $500,000 in investment, and participating investors were all early bitcoin movers.  Finally, Boost VC says it genuinely loves the bitcoin community and has received significant encouragement from members. Focusing on bitcoin is a way to return some of this respect.  Opportunity to grow  Tina Hui, CEO and founder of bitcoin video news service Follow the Coin, which was a selected participant in Tribe 4, said Boost VC's mentorship and investment motivated her company to focus and grow.  ""Starting any business is difficult, especially in bitcoin. FinTech is global and there are a lot of moving pieces to pay close attention to, from currency rates, the ever-changing competitive complexity of the space and emerging regulatory requirements.""  Joining a startup accelerator with dedicated supportive mentors and 'tribe mates' that become family, she said, makes a difference to how participants develop as teams and individuals.  She also noted that, including herself, Tribe 4 featured two female bitcoin company founders – the other being Catheryne Nicholson of BlockCypher, a cloud-optimized blockchain services platform for web developers.

42377843,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j6l,1416684553,Could Bitcoin Tipping Replace Traditional Online Advertising?,"Online advertising has exploded into a $40bn industry, and unfortunately for many Internet users, this increase has come with the cost of often-annoying user experiences.  To be fair, online advertising has been a boon for the Internet and for content creators. The idea of a digital canvas for advertisers to reach consumers on was enticing in the 1990s at the dawn of the web, and it has enabled many media outlets to weather the transition from print to digital.  Given the size of the industry and many consumers' distaste for invasive display ads, a number of entrepreneurs have started to look for ways to supplement or maybe even supersede revenues from traditional online advertising models using the power of bitcoin.  Still, they face a steep challenge. There is a compelling reason why most online media and content generators use display ads – they are arguably the best vehicle for monetization out there today.  This might not always be the only option going forward, though. Digital currencies have the potential to become a transaction method for the Internet due to their low fees and quick transaction times, and established bitcoin companies like Coinbase and Xapo are seeking to usher in this new future.  Exploring a new frontier  One of the earliest proponents of replacing traditional online advertising with bitcoin is William Waldon, the owner of astronomy-focused website Space Industry News.  Waldon removed all the display ads from his site in March, leaving his visitors with just one option for supporting the website: bitcoin donations.  The site has had a remarkably clean look as a result – and Waldon thinks his audience is the perfect group to experiment with for trying new things like bitcoin tipping to generate revenue.“My audience is smart and tech-savvy,” he said.  He hopes replacing his ads with bitcoin tipping could be viable in the long-term, by providing the right message to the consumers of his content. ""I believe that in the short term I'll be taking a hit, until the message is made clear.""  Waldon is fine with that, as long as he can influence others by setting a good example:  ""I mean, who wants to watch a 30-second video ad while they're trying to read an article? The first time I saw one of those on another website I promised myself that I would never be that kind of content provider.""  Waldon said he has generated around $100-worth of bitcoin each month since he started his effort back in March – enough to pay for site hosting.  It's an experiment for Waldon, a way to set an example for a future where tipping could become normal practice. ""If you really want to change the world, I mean really make people think, you have to get rid of the distractions and focus on the most important part, the content,"" he said.  The rise of a tipping economy  The practice of sending bitcoin tips to show support for content providers like Space Industry News has been gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency community, especially in the past few weeks.    One company, ChangeTip, works specifically with bitcoin in its strategy to bring online tipping to the mainstream as an alternative to traditional advertising models and revenue streams.  ChangeTip currently enables bitcoin tipping directly on social media sites like Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, Google+, Tumblr and StockTwits.  One interesting feature with ChangeTip is that the company has built 'monikers' into its platform. This means users can edit their settings and fix a keyword to specified amount of money.  For example, a 'coffee' could be set as $1.50 in bitcoin, and a 'beer' as $3.50. People can send any of these monikers to others in the form of a tip.  Nick Sullivan, CEO of ChangeTip, told CoinDesk this could open up a totally new field of online marketing with bitcoin tipping:  “We think that has some potential brand or advertising applications. For example, Starbucks buys the 'Starbucks' moniker from us, and then we create an advertising package around that to help them come together with a viral marketing campaign.”  ChangeTip launched earlier this year, and Sullivan said the company is already seeing growth.  A key draw for companies like ChangeTip and its dogecoin-focused counterpart Dogetipbot is that they have the potential to appeal to users outside of the cryptocurrency community.  Sullivan said that he and Dogetipbot founder Josh Mohland recognize this, and that they're working together to tackle one of the major issues plaguing digital currencies – mainstream acceptance.  Sullivan said:  “The ocean is so huge with what needs to be done –the common enemy we’re both fighting is the mass adoption of digital currencies.”  More trials needed  Though promising, this part of the bitcoin ecosystem is still growing, and questions remain that need to be addressed.  For example, businesses that embrace tipping may have an advantage over higher-volume sectors in the bitcoin industry because they're not as adversely affected by bitcoin's price volatility, Sullivan said.  “Price affects our business less than most, because people aren’t speculating and holding lots of money in their ChangeTip wallet. [Users are] using it to tip,” said Sullivan.  Despite this, perception about bitcoin's price volatility is still widespread and may ultimately prevent some from embracing bitcoin tipping.  Waldon, the Space Industry News proprietor, has a sense that digital currencies are something that other websites will end up embracing as a replacement for display ads, but he suggested that this habit needs to take hold on more social media outlets.  On this end, ChangeTip recently added a new feature to its Google Chrome extension embeds a tipping button directly into Twitter's web browser so that sending a tip is as easy as retweeting or favoriting someone's tweet.  For now, however, Space Industry News still serves as an early example of a publisher adopting a hybrid revenue model that may become more prevalent in the future, and Waldon is pleased with the position.  ""I'm feeling a paradigm shift coming and I want to be at the forefront of that,"" he added.

42377834,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73irf,1416675287,"For Bitcoin, It's the Tech – Not the Talk – That Really Matters","To some, the idea of money that's free of governments and banks is extremely appealing.  The money system causes the wealth gap, they say. It’s the reason both the state and the financial sectors have both grown to such disproportionate size.  Use a different money, and the government and banks’ monopoly is destroyed. Their power is reduced. They can’t perpetrate many of the abuses that go on – whether it’s inflation, forex- or libor-rigging, bailouts or even wars.  The same memes were behind the huge bull market in gold that went from 2001 to 2011. Goldbugs (and I’m one) were all saying the same thing. Buy gold, protect yourself from the debasement of currency, it’s nobody else’s liability – all that kind of stuff.  But that bull market ended. Gold is now down 40%, silver by almost 70% and we’re no closer politically to a hard money system than we were in 2001.  Anti-government or anti-banking rhetoric is seductive, but only if you’re of a libertarian or anarchic bent. Not everyone is.  I’m convinced that the great revolution so many are clamouring for can only happen through money reform. But the talk will not make that happen.  The tech could, however.  If Steve Jobs had said he was going to destroy the music business, would you have rushed out to buy an iPod?  If Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos had promoted their businesses on the basis of all the upheaval they were going to cause to music and publishing, many people might not have been quite so persuaded.  'I quite like vinyl, I like CDs, I like albums. I like my daily paper. I like the chap who writes that column. I like my local bookshop.' There would have been more resistance than we saw in reality.  Instead, Jobs, Bezos and the many others like them focused on the consumer. They gave the consumer better and better products. The consumer did not buy in for political reasons, but because it suited him. The tech was irresistible.  IPods were a new and better way to listen to music, iTunes a better place to store it. Amazon is a great place to buy stuff. The Kindle is a fantastic way to read books. Websites and blogs are better places to consume news. YouTube and Netflix are better ways to watch videos. And so on.  Bitcoin needs to do the same.  In the 80,000 words that Satoshi Nakamoto wrote online, he made about three vaguely political statements. His only focus was on getting the tech working, and the reason bitcoin has been so successful is that the tech actually does work. Now the bitcoin community needs to remember his example.  Focus on the tangible benefits  I may love the fact that bitcoin is apolitical and I loathe the fact that fiat money is a political tool. But there are lots of people – the vast majority in fact – who either don’t agree or don’t care. The reason they’ll start using bitcoin is because it suits them.  'Hey, this money isn’t losing value – it’s actually going up. I don’t get hit by forex charges. Remittances are cheaper and quicker. Lower fees means goods are priced lower in bitcoins. Sending or receiving money is so much less hassle' – all those kinds of reasons.  Earlier in the year, Goldman Sachs IT analyst Roman Leal made some rough calculations as to the savings that bitcoin could have made possible globally in electronic payment in 2013. His findings demonstrate what could make the tech go mainstream – more than any amount of political rhetoric.  There were $49bn of transaction fees globally in 2013 on about $550bn of remittances. Using bitcoin (at an estimated 1% annual fee – which could be a lot less) those fees would have fallen by over 90% to just $5.5bn.  As for electronic payments in retail, currently retailers pay about 2.5% to 3% in transaction fees. In 2013, global transaction fees at retail point of sale were $260bn on over $10tn of sales. Had bitcoin been used (again using a 1% estimated fee) the number would be $104bn – a saving of almost $150bn. Leal notes that all merchants would realize ""sizable savings"" by using bitcoin, but small merchants will benefit most: they have the potential to reduce their payment processing fees by at least half.  Then there is its potential to get the world’s poorest 3.5 billion, who are currently shut out by the financial system, into e-commerce just as the cell phone got them communicating in a way they couldn’t with landlines.  The potential is enormous. But at present the growth of the bitcoin network is stagnant, it might even have slipped into the negative. Transactions are growing, but not compellingly. This is what needs to change.  Why Bitcoin should think like a tech stock  At the weekend David Cameron declared that the warning lights are flashing on the global economy. Japan has slipped back into negative growth territory. Germany’s growth has stalled, Britain’s has slowed.  Growth rates in the developed world have been falling since the 1970s. There's a mixture of reasons for this. Aging populations and workforces, too many asset bubbles leading to busts, excess taxation and regulation costs, an ever-increasing cost of government, high house prices leaving little capital to spend elsewhere, the colossal burden of global debt load above the $100tn-mark and many more reasons you can think of.  One of the only sectors where there is real growth is tech. Take the Nasdaq. It’s a far cry from the bloated bubble of 2000. Names like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Gilead, Intel, Facebook and Amazon are all examples of companies that generate actual cash flow. Collective profits have trebled since 2008, according to newsletter Atlas Pulsehttp://www.atlaspulse.com/, while most countries and sectors remain below pre-crisis levels.  Meanwhile, Nasdaq analysts are much more cautious. Flows into the ETFs are negative. Retail investors are not there in the way they once were. The index is still below its 2000 bubble peak. This all leaves plenty of room for further rises. The potential for the small caps in the sector is enormous.  The boom in tech stocks is just getting going. Both Atlas Pulse and I predict it will be the one area of real growth in 2015. This is the wave – and it is a positive wave – bitcoin wants to ride. Forget the negative attacks on governments or banks. It’s a war that cannot be won and making such powerful enemies does bitcoin no favours.  The tech and the companies operating it need to focus on making the transition to bitcoin irresistible and inevitable, in the same ways that listening to iPods or buying on Amazon has become the status quo. Governments and banks’ money will then be superseded on the Internet – and they’ll have as much choice over the matter as the music and publishing industries did 15 years ago.  That’s the way to get the revolution you’ve dreamed of.  The talk might win the argument. But the tech will win a great deal more. Remember the mantra: ""Cypherpunks write code"".

42377825,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73int,1416666794,The Blockchain and the Rise of Networked Trust,"“We are free to plant our own seeds; we don’t buy the brand nor the patent from a multinational. In order to plant, we don’t need permission. Also, we don’t ask anyone’s permission for what to do with our money!”  Santiago Zaz is an organic farmer from Argentina. Back in 2013, Zaz’s business became the first of its kind to accept bitcoin payments in the country.  Like Zaz, many in his community don’t have the possibility of owning a credit card. Instead, it was the adoption of cryptocurrency and its decentralized ethos that made the expansion of his business possible.  A similar sentiment is echoed in Shannon County, South Dakota – the second poorest county in the US. Payu Harris, a resident of the Pine Ridge Indian reservation who traces his ancestry to the Northern Cheyene, recently told Forbes “I want the native people to embrace bitcoin.”  Furthermore, he spoke about his passion to free his people from the American government through cryptocurrency. Calling it “the nerd’s revenge”, the 38-year-old digital currency trader and activist said that “bitcoin is a way of getting involved in big finance without being a Harvard grad or part of the Wall Street elite” and that it “opens the door for the common man to get involved”.  From big cities to villages and Indian reservations – all around the world we are seeing a common current that weaves the diverse actions of ordinary people. They are finding an avenue in cryptocurrencies for economic self-determination.  However, it is the invention of blockchain technology that makes cryptocurrencies like bitcoin possible.  First introduced in 2008 in a white paper published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the core of this invention is 'distributed trust' that can achieve consensus amongst strangers on a large scale.  But just what is the decentralized trust that forms the foundation of this technology?  Decentralized trust  In the current centralized financial systems, trust is mediated by a hierarchical outer authority. This intermediary discourages the two parties (financial providers and consumers) from developing personal relations of trust as a fundamental element in their transaction.  Bitcoin offers a new trust model. Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and author Andreas Antonopoulos describes bitcoin’s security model as ""trust by computation"":  “Trust does not depend on excluding bad actors, as they cannot ‘fake’ trust. They cannot pretend to be the trusted party, as there is none. They cannot steal the central keys as there are none. They cannot pull the levers of control at the core of the system, as there is no core and no levers of control.”  Bitcoin's decentralized trust eliminates the need for any centralized authority and brings the source of legitimacy in the realm of finance back to individuals.  Anyone can download an application on their computer or smart phone and start their own money system or bank. Trust that is generated horizontally becomes an essential undercurrent of exchange.  By choosing to abide with algorithmic consensus, we participate in creating a society based on our trust in ourselves and our fellows.  Unmediated flow  This emerging 'networked trust' unleashes something that has been stagnated by hierarchical institutions. With bitcoin, currency regains its true meaning – flow.  Antonopoulos has described how currency comes from the word for ‘flow’ in Latin, adding that ""there never was a currency that had flow like bitcoin, which has no borders, no checkpoints, no intermediaries.""  Until now, economic activities have been geared to bend toward the rich, while bitcoin’s neutrality works to rebalance power toward economic justice. The blockchain-based approach to economic interaction works toward empowering the masses whenever the scales of power are out of balance.  The effect of this unmediated flow is especially powerful in the remittance market, which has become a massive global financial instrument for exploitation through currency exchange and international transfer.  A recent article highlighted the potential impact bitcoin could have in the remittance industry, through which monopolies have made profits somewhere between $400bn and $530bn in 2012 and which is expected to grow to over $680bn in the coming years according to a World Bank report.  Payment networks like PayPal are blocked in many developing countries. When bitcoin is used appropriately and responsibly it can help people avoid the usurious behavior of money transfer companies like Western Union. Author Richard Boase argued this innovation has the potential to “help spur growth and development in the world’s poorest economies”.  In addition to bitcoin’s potential for transforming the remittance industry, it could alter the bureaucratically-controlled avenues of foreign aid. Much of the money that is currently being captured by institutionalized hierarchies could instead be freed to improve the lives of the poorest people around the globe.  Currency of the oppressed  For many in the West, bitcoin may seem like just another speculative bubble.  While it may be more of an investment tool for some, it offers a fundamental avenue for liberation and survival for others. Bitcoin’s autonomous flow is quickly becoming the bank-less and government-less currency of the oppressed.  Adoption is happening in places where governments tightly control the currency and hyper-inflate hard-earned work and value through harsh austerity and money printing.  In March 2013, a crisis of forced austerity hit the small Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus, when the government closed the country’s second largest bank in return for an international bailout by Eurogroup, the European Commission and European Central Bank. People rushed to protect their savings.  While Cypriots took to the streets to protest, some turned to bitcoin as a safe haven from the government stealing their savings.  A similar trend is occurring in Argentina. Early this year the national currency, the Peso fell in its steepest loss since the country’s 2002 economic collapse. Many Argentinians are moving to bitcoin as a safe haven.  Tess Bennett reported on how the growing popularity of cryptocurrency-freedom in Argentina is creating the largest community of bitcoin users in Latin America. At the first Latin American Bitcoin Conference in Buenos Aires in 2012, Belgium investment advisor Tuur Demeester passionately expressed the true meaning of the ‘Bitcoin Revolution’, saying “bitcoin marks the end of monetary apartheid” and “the end of financial discrimination and segregation based on nationality and political privilege”.  The other six billion  These disruptive flows represent emerging power from the margins.  The blockchain distributed trust network is open to everyone and responds to all people indiscriminately, regardless of their economic status, nationality or credit history. It brings people who are generally excluded into the circle of consensus.  Antonopoulos speaks of how bitcoin is all about the other six billion and points out how they need this, not for speculation, but for liberation.  A new World Bank research paper indicates that under the current financial arrangement, 2.5 billion people across the planet are unbanked. Antonopoulos expands this number, portraying this essentially unbanked population as the six billion that includes those underbanked who have limited ability to interact with the rest of the world due to radical currency debasement as well as a lack of small business investment capital and high transfer fees.  The invention of blockchain distributed trust has the potential to empower those in the peripheries who have been exploited by the systems of Western financial hegemony and to generate bottom up consensus power.  This can collectively redirect the flow of currency that has until now been channeled toward the top to instead support grassroots economic activities and social interaction that benefit more people.  The rise of the blockchain network is poised to disrupt the world as we know it. The time has come for us to reclaim the power of self-determination and build our common future through this flow of networked trust.
