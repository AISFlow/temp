The SEC responded to a court order on how it was currently looking at the rulemaking petition in light of the agency's enforcement action against Coinbase, which the regulator sued last Tuesday on allegations it was operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearing agency.  Though Coinbase has argued that the SEC has decided to reject the petition, the SEC said Tuesday that it hadn't made a decision one way or another, though agency staff think they will make a recommendation within 120 days.  Until and unless the SEC decides to propose new rules, Coinbase still has to abide by current law, the regulator added in discussing its current enforcement action.  ""Regardless of whether the Commission determines to undertake the rulemaking sought by Coinbase, a decision the Commission has yet to make, Coinbase – like everyone else – is bound by existing law,"" the SEC filing said. ""And Coinbase is free to vigorously assert its position that it has not violated that law in the current enforcement action.""  In a tweet, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said the SEC ""ignore[d] the clear statements of the Chair that confirm they have no intent to issue new rules, and instead conflate the evidence of a decision those statements provide with an argument that the statements are themselves a decision,"" though the SEC argued that ""statements by the Chair do not – and could not – constitute Commission action denying Coinbase’s rulemaking petition.""  Any SEC decision would need a majority of a quorum vote as well, the regulator argued.

13780223,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537764,1686697218,"Ripple Victorious As Hinman Materials Unsealed, Why is XRP Down?","In a significant development in the legal dispute between Ripple, a blockchain company utilizing XRP in its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution for cross-border transfers, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Hinman materials have now been unsealed. Ripple’s legal representatives had been asserting the relevance of these documents in their defense against the regulator. Still, XRP prices are below the $0.58 resistance level and tracking lower when writing on June 13. Hinman Materials Unsealed While earlier ordering the SEC to unseal Hinman documents, United States District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the regulator had not clearly shown that the materials should be kept private. Related Reading: Crypto Frenzy: Whale Accumulates 1.5 Trillion SHIB, Sparking Surge In Price Furthermore, the Judge acknowledged the significant public interest generated by the lawsuit since its filing in late 2020. In light of this, she concluded that the release of these documents surpassed the individual interests of the involved parties. The Hinman materials comprise a compilation of documents from a speech delivered by former SEC Director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, in June 2018. In his speech, Hinman expressed his perspective that ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, should not be considered a security. However, the SEC had, before this ruling, chosen not to disclose the Hinman materials, asserting their confidential nature. The SEC argues that a verdict favoring their release could set a precedent for revealing internal government communications in legal cases. Meanwhile, Ripple lawyers initiated legal proceedings against the SEC, asserting that the regulator’s decision to file a lawsuit against the payment company was “discriminatory and infringed on their First Amendment rights.” Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Set Their Sights On Next Downside Target If $1,700 Support Breaks In its lawsuit, Ripple contends that the Hinman materials hold critical significance for its case. They also claimed that the SEC’s denial to disclose them represents a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Under this act, federal agencies, including the SEC, must adhere to specific procedures when engaging in adjudication or any other rulemaking. With the unsealing of these documents, Ripple lawyers now have a stronger case to build on their defense. Moreover, they could prove that the SEC’s lawsuit is pointless because XRP is a utility like Bitcoin. Is XRP A Utility Coin? But Why Are Prices Lower? Despite the decision by the Judge to unseal these contentious documents, XRP prices are volatile and lower. Notably, it is below $0.58, the resistance level, and 2023 highs. Even so, trading volumes are elevated, indicating increasing interest from the trading community. How XRP prices will react in the days ahead is yet to be seen. However, a break above $0.60 and April highs could push the coin to $0.80.

The news comes as Binance fights a civil lawsuit filed last week by the Wall Street regulator. The SEC charged Binance and Binance.US with deceiving investors about the sufficiency of its systems to detect and control manipulative trading, and taking insufficient steps to prohibit U.S. investors from accessing its unregulated exchange. The regulator also wants to freeze billions of dollars of Binance.US's assets, a move that Binance claimed would cripple the company as it wouldn't be able to pay employees, vendors and suppliers or to maintain the platform. According to the SEC, Binance.US oversees $2.2B in crypto holdings. Judge Jackson ordered the Binance, which is not allowed to operate in the U.S., and the SEC, which has scrutinized the trading platform since the summer of 2020, to keep negotiating and to submit an update by Thursday, the NYT reported . In the days following the SEC suit, Binance.US was forced to halt U.S. dollar trading as its banking partners prepared to stop offering vital payment channels.

42410428,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKgGg,1686691906,U.S. Judge Rebuffs SEC Request for Binance.US Asset Freeze for Now,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Binance and Binance.US declined to order a temporary restraining order freezing the U.S. trading platform's assets.  That would allow the U.S. arm of the company to continue doing business while hashing out restrictions with the regulator.  If the two sides can agree on limits, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, of the D.C. District Court, said “there’s absolutely no need” for a restraining order. In the meantime, the judge ordered Binance.US to provide a list of its business expenses to the court, and ordered the parties to continue negotiating. A status update is due by close of business Thursday.  In a packed Washington courtroom, the judge hammered SEC attorneys about their motion to freeze all of the company's assets until it could prove that no one from Binance's global platform, including Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, had access to its private keys.  At times, the judge seemed frustrated by the responses she was hearing when asking whether any Binance.US customer funds had actually left the U.S., after multiple SEC attorneys said they were mainly concerned about the fact that Binance's global platform controlled enough private key shards to move funds.  ""I want to know if it's happening or not,"" she said. ""It's stunning that I've asked each of you this.""  Sticking point  Earlier in the day, the judge hinted she may have been inclined to grant some sort of restriction on Binance's access to Binance.US assets but not a full restraining order, ordering the companies to reconcile their proposed restrictions and ordering the SEC to contrast what it wanted with what the companies proposed in lieu of the restraining order itself.  Jennifer Farer, an SEC lawyer, told the judge Tuesday, “We are open to the business continuing to operate.”  And representatives of Binance.US said they mainly wanted to be allowed normal operating expenses and that they were “not willing to accept the death penalty” represented by a total asset freeze.  Farer said Binance.US had constantly changed its story about how crypto assets and funds were held, from Binance.US telling the SEC that it had an agreement with Binance to saying the agreement was not operational to saying the non-operational agreement had been suspended.  Binance.US also told the SEC that it may cease doing business in the U.S., prompting the need for an emergency order, the attorney said.  “There’s a back-and-forth about whether they’re shutting down or not shutting down,” Farer said.  Still, at the end of the day the parties were not that far apart, Judge Jackson said. If they could find an agreement, that would give all parties time to properly sort through the case's details.  The SEC sued Binance and Binance.US, alongside Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, last week, alleging they were operating as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency.  The regulator also alleged massive commingling of funds allowing Zhao, a Canadian national living in the UAE, access to Binance.US customer assets.  The SEC followed the lawsuit up with a motion for the temporary restraining order.  The crypto exchanges pushed back against the claims in their response to the motion, arguing the SEC hadn't conclusively proven they listed any securities and saying the regulator hadn't shown any proof supporting an emergency motion.  Securities vs. commodities  Judge Jackson also dove into the foundational question at the heart of the suit: What makes a crypto asset a security, and is it a commodity if it isn't a security?  Though the judge asked some elementary questions about the issue, she was not satisfied with the answers.  Near the opening of the hearing, the judge asked SEC attorneys to distinguish between a ""crypto asset"" and a ""crypto asset security.""  SEC attorney Matthew Scarlato told the judge that the regulator had provided several examples of cryptos it believed were securities in the broader complaint, but was also reserving the right to assess the rest of the tokens on the exchanges later.  The judge asked the SEC (and later Binance) whether the other cryptocurrencies were commodities.  ""The ones they you're not calling securities, what are they?"" she asked, diving into the heart of an issue that's vexed the crypto industry for years.  She later asked Matthew Martens, an attorney representing Binance.US, if BNB is a commodity since the company had argued it was a security.  ""It is a crypto asset,"" Martens said.  ""What is that? No one wants to tell me,"" the judge noted.",NEUTRAL,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION | BNB,"Nikhilesh De, Jesse Hamilton",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/13/us-judge-rebuffs-sec-request-for-binanceus-asset-freeze-for-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b4fb6d42e912a59c711e2fdc1e552dcf931c2fe-3960x2040.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13778351,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537767,1686691810,Binance CEO Controversial Move: Selling Bitcoin To Save BNB?,"The ongoing crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the crypto industry has taken a toll on one of the largest exchanges in the market, Binance. The SEC recently filed a lawsuit against Binance.US, which has resulted in a significant decline in the value of Binance Coin (BNB). BNB has dropped more than 23% in the last week alone, currently trading at $238. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Set Their Sights On Next Downside Target If $1,700 Support Breaks Binance CEO’s Bitcoin Sell-Off As reported by NewsBTC, BNB is facing a potentially catastrophic situation after an exploit on the Binance Smart Chain’s Binance Bridge. The exploit could liquidate $200 million on Venus Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) if the BNB price drops to $220. Given these developments, reports now suggest that Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zao, sell spot Bitcoin (BTC) to prevent BNB from falling to $220. This move has been taken to defend against the liquidation of BNB at this key level, but it also capped the upside potential of Bitcoin. The practice of selling spot Bitcoin to purchase BNB is known as a “liquidation waterfall,” it is a common tactic used by exchanges to protect their users from significant losses. As spot Bitcoin is sold off, BNB is purchased, which helps to defend the $220 liquidation level. However, this also puts a cap on the upside potential of Bitcoin as the selling pressure on Bitcoin increases. According to the crypto trader “JW”, Binance and CZ have been selling spot Bitcoin at an alarming rate to support BNB, as seen in the chart above, which has resulted in the decline of Bitcoin’s value. While this move may help defend against the liquidation of BNB, it can potentially negatively impact the wider cryptocurrency market. In addition, despite positive economic news from the US, Bitcoin is struggling to break through its newly formed resistance at $26,400 and is currently trading at $25,800. The US Consumer Price Index indicates that the country’s inflation is slowing down, creating a more “relaxed” economic environment. However, concerns over regulatory crackdowns and alleged selling pressure from Binance and its CEO are mounting, resulting in selling pressure preventing the largest cryptocurrency from continuing its bullish trend. Bitcoin Analyst Anticipates Drop To $24,000 According to cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe, Bitcoin is currently facing a crucial resistance level at $26,400 and has been unable to break through it. As a result, Van de Poppe expects the markets to drop into the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is scheduled for tomorrow. Van de Poppe’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s price may experience some downward pressure in the short term. However, he also sees this as an opportunity for traders to buy into the market at a lower price point.

42410431,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKgQb,1686691371,"Bitcoin Seesaws Back Under $26K After CPI, as Investors Await Fed Rate Hike Decision","Bitcoin at least for a while liked the sound of waning inflation as reflected in Tuesday’s release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The largest cryptocurrency in market value was recently trading at $25,846, down 0.2% over the past 24 hours and off the higher perch over $26,000 it assumed in the hour after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the CPI had risen 4%, better than the projected 4.1% and then April’s 4.9%.  BTC has been stagnant below $26,000 for much of the past four days as investors set aside angst about Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase, and awaited the latest inflation reading and Wednesday’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision.  Read More: Bitcoin, Ether and Stablecoins Total 80% of $1T Crypto Market Cap as Investors Flee Altcoins  The Fed now seems likely to halt its year-long campaign of monetary hawkishness. Just a year ago, the CPI was raging at 8.6%, prompting the Federal Reserve to boost the Federal Funds rate by 75 basis points (bps) and sending risk-on assets spiraling.  “While today is good news for the U.S. economy and Bitcoin, any wobble that may come from tomorrow’s interest rate decision or the looming recession on the U.S.’s horizon is also likely to prove beneficial for crypto assets,” Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform, Yield App, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Even altcoins, some of which have lost up to 30% over the past week, will benefit.”  Frost suggested that the SEC suits had delivered “certainty” to markets by ending speculation about whether the agency would take legal action against two of the crypto industry’s most prominent businesses. The suits may also force the courts and regulators to settle on a designation for cryptos as securities, commodities or otherwise.  “With U.S. investors perhaps now largely shaken out of these assets, we could see the beginning of fresh investment in these tokens that is not at all linked to the US economy or US policies,” Frost wrote.  Ether, the second largest crypto by market value, followed BTC’s lead, rising initially before returning some of its gains. ETH was recently changing hands at about $1,735, roughly where it stood on Monday, same time. Among the 19 tokens mentioned in either the Binance or Coinbase suits, or both, ALG AND MATIC, the tokens of the Polygon and Algorand smart contracts blockchains, were recently up 0.3% and 0.8%, while AXIE, the native crypto of gaming platform Axie Infinity, fell slightly. Binance’s BNB token recently increased 3.3%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the market’s overall performance, was up 0.3%.  Meanwhile, major stock indexes were largely buoyed by the CPI report with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 rising 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively. The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys rose to a still robust 3.8%, while Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, ticked down slightly to trade at $73 per barrel, well off its soaring heights above $112 a year ago.  In an email to CoinDesk, Oliver Rust, head of product at independent inflation data aggregator Truflation, noted the decline in energy prices and overall inflation readings, and faintly encouraging signs that the hot jobs market was cooling. Unwelcome turns in those macroeconomic indicators have consistently unsettled crypto assets. But Rust also wrote warily that “the economy appears to be trending towards a quarter of negative growth at the very least.”  “The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth,” he wrote. “As such, if GDP growth continues declining in Q2, the U.S. will find itself on shaky ground. The Central Bank will be forced to divert its mission from reducing inflation to avoiding a recession, especially with the start of the 2024 US presidential election campaign just around the corner. With interest rates at current levels, we believe this is a realistic goal, but higher rates could end up being the last straw.”  Read More: SEC’s Binance, Coinbase Suits Create Uncertain Future for Listed Tokens: Legal Experts",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/13/bitcoin-seesaws-back-under-26k-after-cpi-as-investors-await-fed-rate-hike-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7d42a096232b845968160de3c58b09845f39d1a-1690x1078.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company acquired Israeli mining hardware manufacturer Spondoolies in 2021, and brought the manufacturer’s core team into Blockstream’s mining division, which is headed by Chris Cook with former Spondoolies CEO Assaf Gilboa serving as executive vice president.  In January 2023, Blockstream raised $125 million to expand mining operations, and says it plans to raise even more capital to fund its mining business. The new ASIC was originally slated for a 2022 launch but Back now anticipates having the miner available in the latter half of 2024.  “There's two rough approaches to manufacturing. One is to do a shuffle run first, which is kind of a test run,” Back told CoinDesk during the briefing. “So that would put the miner into sort of Q3 next year roughly.”  Besides delving into Blockstream’s mining business, Back and his executive team discussed the firm’s other projects such as Liquid, a federated sidechain or secondary blockchain that interacts with the primary Bitcoin blockchain and Jade, Blocksteam’s flagship hardware bitcoin (BTC) wallet.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/13/bitcoin-infrastructure-firm-blockstream-to-unveil-its-long-awaited-mining-rig-in-3q-of-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58bf75137619e567846455e0f2de42a2ccfb52f0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13776457,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537660,1686686402,Bitcoin Market At Decision Point: Will This On-Chain Retest Be Successful?,"On-chain data shows a Bitcoin metric is approaching a crucial retest that can make or break a rally. Will the bulls come out on top? Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Profit/Loss Ratio Is Nearing 1 Level According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, a successful retest here would be constructive for the price of the asset. The indicator of interest here is the “realized profit/loss ratio,” which measures the ratio between the profits and losses that Bitcoin investors throughout the network are realizing right now. The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it was last acquired at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the BTC value that it’s now being sold/moved at, then the coin’s sale is said to be realizing some amount of profit. Naturally, the opposite case would imply that loss realization is occurring with the coin’s movement. The metric takes the sum of all such profits and losses being harvested in the market and finds the ratio between them. When the value of this ratio is greater than 1, it means that the market as a whole is realizing some amount of profit currently. On the other hand, values under this threshold imply losses are more dominant in the sector right now. In the context of the current discussion, the realized profit/loss ratio for the entire market is actually not the metric of focus, but the version specifically for the “short-term holders” (STHs) is. The STHs are one of the two major groups in the Bitcoin market and include all the investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Historically Tight Range, Calm Before The Storm? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) BTC STH realized profit/loss ratio over the last couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day EMA Bitcoin STH realized profit/loss ratio has been above 1 during the past few months, suggesting that profit realization has been the dominant force. This naturally makes sense, as the rally occurred during this period, which would have made it so that these investors would be in plenty of profits. Recently, however, the metric has been going down as the price has observed a decline. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator is now closing in toward the 1 mark. The 1 line has historically held immense significance for the market, as it serves as the point where the STHs are just breaking even on their selling. During bearish periods, this line has usually provided resistance to the price of Bitcoin, while it has switched to being a support point during bullish regimes. The reason behind this interesting pattern lies in the fact that investors look at their break-even mark very differently between the two types of markets. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Whale Transfers Spike, Bearish Sign? In a bearish environment, investors see the break-even mark as an ideal exiting point, as that way, they can at least avoid getting into losses. Thus, a lot of selling takes place at the level, leading to the price feeling resistance. Similarly, the investors look at the level as a profitable buying opportunity during rallies, so they participate in some buying at it. Obviously, if the current rally has to have any chance at going, this retest of the 1 level would have to be successful. If a breakdown happens here, however, then a bearish regime might return for Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, up 1% in the last week.

42410427,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKgDN,1686685971,Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is 'Sufficiently Decentralized',"The long awaited “Hinman docs” have finally been unsealed, a move that some believe could play a crucial role in the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. Ripple is being sued by the securities regulator for an allegedly illicit sale of $1.3 billion worth of XRP, a cryptocurrency the SEC is treating as a security.  Ripple has fought hard to get these documents into the court record, which supposedly show the agency is unfairly targeting the company. CEO Brad Garlinghouse yesterday said the document dump was “well worth the wait.” While not everyone is convinced the newly-released files prove Ripple’s claims, the hundreds of internal messages from SEC higher ups do show that the SEC has never really been clear on whether and how to regulate the cryptocurrencies that were created after Bitcoin.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It all started in 2018, when then Director of the SEC’s Corporate Finance Division William Hinman gave a speech at a Yahoo! Summit, where he argued that ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, should not be classified as a security essentially because the network had become “sufficiently decentralized” from its time of creation.  Even if ETH was a security at launch – a very real possibility, the SEC notes, given how the token sale was conducted – blockchain networks can evolve and the circumstances can change. (A similar line of thinking supports live regulatory proposals like Hester Peirce’s “Safe Harbor” guidance.)  See also: XRP Prices Jump as Hinman Speech Released in Ripple Labs Filing  That public speech was based on Hinman’s understanding of the Ethereum network at the time, and, although Ripple is arguing that XRP is not a security, the company does not view Hinman’s thinking as particularly helpful. Instead of arguing on similar grounds that XRP has “decentralized” over time, Ripple is trying to argue that Hinman’s theory was not grounded in a proper understanding of securities law.  In short, Ripple fought to see these documents and then fought to release them to the public because they sowed discord. On Twitter, Garlinghouse said it's ""absolutely unconscionable"" that Hinman gave his speech despite the lack of consensus agreement within the SEC, adding that the speech “deliberately created confusion.”  This is apparently supportive of the company’s actual defense that the SEC sued Ripple and its executives without a clear legal basis. Further, Ripple is arguing on procedural grounds that the SEC violated its due process rights by failing to provide “fair notice” of potential securities regulation violations.  For months, the SEC, now run by Chairman Gary Gensler, has fought to keep the Hinman documents out of public view, because his statements were his and his alone, did not represent the agency’s understanding and are irrelevant to the lawsuit, it argued.  Indeed, while the internal communications at the SEC concerning Hinman’s presentation – including feedback he solicited from colleagues before the summit – show that many SEC officials were aligned, it’d be hard to say the resulting speech represented everyone’s views.  For instance, SEC Director Brett Redfearn, suggested Hinman use stronger language to make it clear that ETH circa 2018 was not a security while others noted that Hinman’s speech might trap the agency if it wanted to take a “different position on ether in the future.” It turns out that that last point wouldn’t be a problem for Gensler, who seems entirely unconcerned about contradicting earlier views he or his predecessors have held.  Perhaps that is par for the course at the SEC. During Ripple's protracted fight to get the speech drafts into the public, the judge overseeing the case said the agency was acting immorally by trying to keep the information out of court.  Moreover, one of Ripple’s key arguments is that Hinman’s speech showed a clear conflict of interest, considering he had a stake in a law firm that was a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance at the time (a law firm he rejoined after leaving the SEC), according to an email exchange between Hinman and the SEC’s ethics office.  For its part, Ripple argues a few things about XRP. First, the for-profit company has for years said that it did not create the network or the token, although it is a primary developer on the chain and perhaps the organization that stands to gain the most materially from XRP’s adoption. Further, perhaps confusingly, the company has argued that XRP is commodity money, a type of resource that has trade value for a diverse cast of investors, coders and companies – like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  There are a few things that point in favor of the idea that the XRP network has decentralized over time. Like any public blockchain, anyone can build using XRP or use the network to transfer assets. In late 2013, Ripple Labs released Ripple’s full code base, which was not always public, theoretically offering tools to the world necessary to maintain the network without the involvement of any specific party. Several companies, most notably MoneyGram, have used the network for some types of cross-border transactions.  But, for many people outside of the XRP Army, Ripple has been something like a canker on the blockchain industry. This perhaps started with Ripple Labs’ token distribution plan, the very thing being questioned by the SEC. Similar to some token treasuries today, Ripple decided it would control the disbursement of the 100 billion XRP units that will ever exist, distributing them to the community, early investors and the company’s founders. This is partially why Jed McCaleb, the founder of Ripple who left to found the competing payments-focused blockchain Stellar, has had so many tokens available to dump on the market over the years.  And while the company may argue against this point, Ripple the network really hasn’t decentralized much from its point of creation. For years, all of Ripple’s clients (the implementation of its code) were set to trust only Ripple’s validation nodes by default. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where “trustless transactions” are basically the whole SHA-bang (editor's note: sorry) and reason for existing, Ripple uses validators to help untrusting partners find trusted routes to trade: meaning if Ripple the company controls the validators, it basically controls the XRP ledger.  This is a point the SEC latched onto in its suit. “During the process to achieve consensus with respect to a new proposed state of the XRP Ledger, each server on the network evaluates proposed transactions from a subset of servers it trusts not to defraud it, also known as the server’s UNL,” the SEC wrote, referring to Unique Node Lists (UNLs), or the gateways that control who can participate in the blockchain consensus mechanism. While users can control their own UNLs, most use the XRP Foundation’s dUNL (“d” is short for default).  Rarely do discussions of Ripple’s suit discuss technical details like this. In fact, most of the conversation seems to be rooted in a total misunderstanding of the company’s strategy. Part of the reason the XRP Army has been dragging someone like Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, today is because he took a call with the agency as Hinman was drafting its speech – another example of bias.  See also: CoinDesk Turns 10: 2015 – Vitalik Buterin and Birth of Ethereum  Ripple’s case absolutely matters for the future of the blockchain industry. It was hugely significant when Coinbase and other U.S. exchanges delisted XRP in 2020, when the SEC first alleged the token was a security – a type of action it would be hard to imagine happening today (Cpinbase didn’t even delist all the so-called “securities” its former product manager turned insider trader Ishan Wahi was accused of frontrunning).  The case specifically involves a legal interpretation of cryptocurrencies as meeting the prongs of the SEC’s Howey Test, which asks whether an “investment contract” is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others. Ripple denies that XRP qualifies as a security, because there was no “investment contract” and that XRP has more in common with diamonds, gold, soybeans and cars (i.e. commodities).  In other words, Ripple cares whether the SEC is right or wrong.

According to CoinMarketCap data , bitcoin ( BTC-USD )'s dominance of the $1.05T crypto market stood at 47.6%. But Saylor contended that its dominance will surge to 80% over the long-term, as increased regulatory scrutiny of the space reduces the use of many alt coins and stablecoins. As for its price, Saylor predicted that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) will rise tenfold and then again tenfold from the current price of $25.8K as of shortly before 3:30 p.m. ET. The digital token traded slightly higher intraday as U.S. headline inflation rose at the slowest pace since April 2021, spurring traders to increase their bets that the Federal Reserve will skip a rate hike at its Wednesday meeting. Bitcoin's crypto market share has been trending in an upward spiral since a low of 38% last November, when Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX ( FTT-USD ) crypto exchange collapsed and roiled the crypto market.

42410443,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKguM,1686683094,"Bitcoin, Ether Remain Resilient After Binance, Coinbase Suits, and Amid Long-Running Crypto Industry Turmoil","SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase and other issues affecting multiple altcoins have had a lesser impact on bitcoin and ether.  Markets expect the Federal Open Market Committee to pause rate hikes.  It’s been one year since one of crypto's largest sell offs. What’s happened since then?  What a difference a year makes?  The current environment in crypto bears some remarkable similarities to the turmoil of a year ago when prices plunged. Yet there are also fundamental differences that suggest markets are in a better place than before.  A year ago  In the space of 24 hours, starting June 13, crypto lender Celsius network paused user withdrawals on its platform and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) signaled its own insolvency issues.  BTC’s 15.4% decline that day , still ranks as the second largest single-day drop since 2019.  Fears of contagion roiled markets, as ETH simultaneously sold off 16.7%, its sixth largest decline since 2020.  Inflation was at the top of everyone’s mind as it is now. On June 16, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target interest rate by 75 basis points, its largest increase in close to 30 years.  What’s still the same?  Similar to last year, the crypto world’s fortunes seem intertwined with the fortune of two entities. Last year, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius were in the limelight. Now crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase hold that position. Investors see the fate of many cryptos depending on the outcome of the suits and a determination about whether tokens are securities, commodities or otherwise. Prices of many of the 19 cryptos mentioned by the SEC plunged more than 20% last week before stabilizing.  Binance and Coinbase already appear to be suffering financially after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to sue them for violating securities law – outflows from both soared last week, even if neither seems to have solvency issues. Binance faces charges that it commingled funds, while Coinbase is accused of selling unregistered securities, even though the SEC approved Coinbase’s initial public offering.  Still, the legal actions seem likely to keep markets off balance.  What’s different?  For starters, prices of BTC and ETH are 19% and 44% higher, respectively since last June 13, .  Relationships have changed also. BTC and ETH have not mirrored the 20% decline in Coinbase shares since the SEC’s filings.  Bitcoin and ether have decoupled from crypto entities in ways that did not occur last year.  BTC and ETH have traded more on their own accord, as their correlations with Coinbase shares have fallen 30% and 17%, respectively, over the last 365 days.  The SEC’s exclusion of bitcoin and ether from their seemingly arbitrary list of securities has offered the latest evidence that they should fall outside of the SEC’s purview.  Macroeconomic factors have taken precedence over risks to centralized entities, with data points like Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) arguably drawing attention over the actions of the SEC.  Today’s CPI report showed annual headline inflation of 4%, slightly below expectations of 4.1%. The monthly CPI increase of 0.1% was also ahead of a projected 0.2% increase in prices.  The milder inflation data gives the FOMC room to pause its recent spate of rate hikes. Will crypto markets respond?  Last week’s dramatic events, those a year ago and the many others over the past months have occasionally affected bitcoin and ether but never broken them.  In the face of so much change, BTC and ETH have grown increasingly resilient.  Meanwhile, isn't it interesting that as we approach the anniversary of the 75 basis point hike, markets are now assigning a 97.6% probability that Wednesday's interest rate decision will result in no change, at all.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/13/bitcoin-ether-remain-resilient-after-binance-coinbase-suits-and-amid-long-running-crypto-industry-turmoil,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed02917aeb654f40a157e939143fa68354513d6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13775184,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537667,1686682833,"Ethereum Bears Set Their Sights On Next Downside Target If $1,700 Support Breaks","The price of Ethereum is currently on a downtrend and is approaching a significant support level. In the past 24 hours, there has been little movement on the chart, while on the weekly chart, ETH has experienced a depreciation of over 3%. This downtrend in Ethereum is consistent with the volatile behavior of Bitcoin, which has been moving back and forth around the $26,000 price mark. Other altcoins have also been exhibiting similar patterns and the technical analysis of Ethereum indicates a bearish influence. Both the demand and accumulation levels on the chart have remained low. So it is crucial for Ethereum to move away from the $1,700 support line to avoid further bearish pressure. If the price falls below this level, it may become challenging for Ethereum to recover. Related Reading: MATIC Price Displays Recovery But Can Bulls Sustain The $0.50 Support? Additionally, for Ethereum to initiate a recovery, Bitcoin needs to halt its sharp retracement on its own chart. The decline in the Ethereum market capitalization also suggests that sellers currently have the upper hand in the market. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,750. Following a rejection at the $1,840 price level, ETH has been experiencing a downtrend with unsuccessful attempts at recovery. The coin faces overhead resistance at $1,770. If Ethereum manages to surpass this resistance level, it may receive support from the bulls and potentially reach $1,800. Conversely, if sellers exert further pressure, Ethereum could drop below its nearest support level at $1,700. A decline below this level would likely lead to a price of around $1,660 for ETH. The volume of ETH traded in the last session was indicated as red, suggesting low buying strength in the market. Technical Analysis Since the beginning of June, ETH has experienced a notable decrease in demand, which has coincided with increased market volatility. As a result, buyer confidence has declined. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the market is oversold, as it is below both the half-line and the 40-mark. Additionally, the price of ETH has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average, suggesting low demand and indicating that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. However, if ETH can surpass the $1,770 level, there is potential for demand to make a comeback. Breaking above this resistance level could attract buyers and potentially lead to an increase in demand for Ethereum. In addition to the previously mentioned indicators, other technical indicators on the chart of the altcoin suggest sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which measures price momentum and potential reversals, has formed red signal bars and these bars are associated with sell signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: Cardano Price Falls Below Key Support Levels, Will It Continue To Fall? The Bollinger Bands, which represent price volatility and fluctuation, have started to diverge. This suggests that the price of the altcoin may experience increased fluctuations in the upcoming trading sessions. Given this, it is crucial that ETH holds the $1,700 support or risk rapid decline.

This news broke as Lookonchain, an on-chain analyst platform, reported a transaction involving a significant accumulation of Shiba Inu tokens by a major holder. This transaction took place on notable exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase and has made waves in the crypto community. According to Lookonchain’s data, a SHIB holder, identifiable by the address “0x40B3,” has recently added a colossal 1.5 trillion SHIB tokens to their portfolio. At current market rates, this acquisition equates to approximately $10 million. A History Of Accumulation Notably, this particular holder, “0x40B3,” has a history of substantial SHIB purchases. The holder had previously acquired 5.3 trillion Shiba Inu tokens, translating to around $35.5 million. On May 16, “0x40B3” made a transfer of 20 trillion SHIB tokens to another address, “0x73AF,” amounting to roughly $134.4 million. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price At The Most Crucial Point In Its History? Owing to these sizable transactions, “0x40B3” has garnered attention within the crypto ecosystem. The scale of their holdings, rendering them the largest nonexchange holder of Shiba Inu, emphasizes their influence on the SHIB market. Impact On The SHIB Market The acquisition of the recent 1.5 trillion SHIB tokens by “0x40B3” had an immediate effect on the SHIB price. In just 15 minutes following the acquisition, the price of Shiba Inu surged over 1.5%. This brief window of time encapsulated the influence wielded by “whales,” or large-scale investors, over the price volatility in the cryptocurrency markets. Moreover, the SHIB price appears to be on a recovery path, with an uptick of nearly 25% since its recent low of $0.00000591 last Saturday. This rebound illustrates the dynamism of the cryptocurrency market and the significant role large investors play in shaping it. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has shown a continuous uptick in the past 24 hours. SHIB which is one of the largest meme coins by market capitalization has recorded a brewing rally up by 3% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu currently trades at $0.00000678 after trading below $0.00000600 on Tuesday. Interestingly, despite the current uptick, SHIB’s trading volume has plunged a bit from $185 million this time last week to $104 million in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin’s market capitalization has seen a more than $700 million loss in the past 7 days. SHIB’s market cap has plunged from $4.7 billion last Tuesday to $3.9 billion as of today. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Soar To Major Highs Soon, Here’s Why In other news, the upcoming launch of Shibarium has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the Shiba Inu community due to some recent developments.

According to the Winklevoss twins, US President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party risk losing crucial voters if it continues its “war on crypto.” Cameron Winklevoss, who founded crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, recently tweeted to warn democrats that they will “alienate an entire generation” of youth voters should it continue with its anti-crypto attitude. The @SenWarren and @GaryGensler war against crypto is going to alienate an entire generation of would-be Democrats.Winning the youth vote w/ ""get out the vote"" is key part of Dem playbook. Dems believe the youth vote will carry the day. pic.twitter.com/F4FQowjCVn — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) June 10, 2023 Winklevoss called out SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and Senator Elizabeth Warren in his tweet. He added: “Crypto has already won the hearts and minds of Millennials and GenZ. They don’t debate the merits of crypto.” Tyler Winklevoss followed up the next day with a tweet saying: Roe cost Republicans the mid-terms. The @SenWarren and @GaryGensler war on crypto will cost Dems the 2024 election. The Winklevoss twins’ statements come amid aggressive action from the SEC, led by Gensler. The agency famously sued crypto exchange Binance and rival exchange Coinbase for alleged securities violations. Senator Warren also made headlines for cultivating an anti-crypto coalition under US politicians. The Gemini co-founder further offered two explanations for the recent enforcement: Two explanations: (1) blue establishment either doesn't understand what's going on w/ Warren and Gensler or (2) are grossly miscalculating impact of their actions on youth vote this upcoming election cycle.They may not care about crypto, but they will care about the lost votes. — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) June 10, 2023 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As part of this partnership, DWF Labs has become a liquidity provider for TRON, further enhancing the ecosystem support of the blockchain.

More recently, DWF Labs has formed additional strategic partnerships with leading crypto players worldwide. ""As a leading blockchain network focused on empowering decentralized commerce and community for every person on the planet, TRON has continually attracted new ideas and demonstrated exceptional growth within the space,” a TRON spokesperson explained. “We are delighted to partner with DWF Labs, as they bring their expertise and excellence to further strengthen the TRON ecosystem.

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of June 2023, it has over 166.5 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 5.85 billion total transactions, and over $11.52 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.

Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.

42410436,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKgkR,1686678355,Binance Goes to Court Against the SEC,"Binance, Binance.US and Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao published their first responses to the SEC’s lawsuit against them and, taken at face value, the stakes appear to be dire. But by the end of the day, we may get a better sense of how the case is proceeding and what a judge thinks about the arguments so far.  On a related note, I’m in D.C. today covering the SEC v. Binance hearing on a temporary restraining order. Unfortunately it’s only today but if anyone is around the D.C. District Court after the hearing ends, feel free to say hi.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.     Early arguments  The narrative  Binance.US and Binance filed their first responses to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Monday, arguing that the regulator's push for a temporary restraining order would prevent it from paying employees, vendors or anyone else. The filings also previewed their defense against the SEC's actual charges.  Why it matters  The SEC made some pretty serious allegations against Binance last week. Those allegations will get put to their first test in court today.  Breaking it down  Binance.US filed a dramatic response to the SEC's restraining order motion, saying it could end the business if granted.  ""The SEC seeks unnecessary and unjustified relief. Far from requesting relief that is 'carefully calibrated' to 'maintain[] the status quo' ... the SEC’s proposed remedies would effectively end BAM’s business,"" the filing said, calling the proposed temporary restraining order “draconian.”  District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, of the D.C. District Court, ordered Binance and Binance.US to describe any differences in their proposed stipulations by 1:00 p.m. ET (17:00 UTC), an hour before the hearing is set to begin.  She also ordered the SEC to describe what changes it wants from the Binance.US proposal that would make it acceptable to the agency “in lieu of the proposed” temporary restraining order.  “No additional argument or explication may be submitted by any party at this time,” the judge ordered.  At the risk of reading too much into the tea leaves, this minute order also suggests how the judge might approach at least the initial issues in the lawsuit. The order suggests that Judge Jackson may not want to sign off on a full temporary restraining order but is willing to enact some sort of restriction on who can access Binance.US’s funds.  There's no real differences between the Binance.US and Binance proposed stipulations – mostly things like capitalization, though the Binance filing also specifies root access to Amazon Web Services instances as part of the software that may be involved.  The SEC’s filing calls for any restrictions to also cover staking services and the AWS access.  Stories you may have missed  Mt.

Hinman’s emails  Ripple, which also faces an SEC lawsuit, published emails from officials deliberating the text of former SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman’s famous 2018 speech in which he said Ether was not a security, probably.  I wrote about the emails themselves here and my colleague Shaurya Malwa noted the immediate price reaction here.  Something that’s striking is just how much deliberation there actually was over the emails. We’re also granted a rare look into the deliberative process – SEC officials debated how clear the speech actually was and made suggestions about the Howey analysis.  Perhaps most interestingly, to me at least, an early version of the speech didn’t discuss ether (ETH) at all. The May 25, 2018 draft referenced bitcoin (BTC) but largely focused on how tokens might morph from securities to non-securities in the abstract.

Visit Mirax → Your Guide to Choosing the Best Crypto Crash Gambling Sites The number of Crash gambling sites is growing rapidly, and you want to locate the best games. So how can you find the best sites, and what are the criteria for selecting them? In this article, we will tackle all the important questions, so you can embrace the opportunity of safe and convenient Crash online gambling. Let’s take a look at the top things to consider when choosing the best crash gambling site for your needs. Convenient and Safe Gambling Sites In our opinion, the best crash gambling sites should ensure a convenient and safe experience for players. You should aim to stick with reputable and trusted brands with a proven track record of servicing gamblers with the best possible offers, while also providing top security measures. Before stepping into one of the Crash betting sites, you want to check its license, history, implemented encryption technology, and third-party certificates of trust. Diverse Payment Options A good site for Crash gambling should accept a wide range of payment methods. This includes all the top cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, LTC, ETH, DOGE, BCH, and others. Most crypto gamblers might also appreciate the inclusion of fiat currencies so that they can quickly convert their holdings into crypto and return them to fiat. Apart from the number of available payment options, you need to know the minimum deposit amount, required fee, and withdrawal terms, such as limits, payout time, and so on. Bonuses on Crypto Crash Gambling Sites The best crash gambling sites should offer you a decent selection of bonuses. If you can find anything from the welcome bonus, deposit bonuses, free spins, and no-deposit offer to reload offers, VIP bonuses, bookmakers’ offers, and similar deals, you have a win-win situation. You’ll probably also value the fact your Crash site appreciates your time spent on its platform and delivers regular perks to its loyal customers. But you should also pay attention to the promotion’s terms and conditions. This includes checking the wagering requirements, promo codes, and other details that could make a difference. Playthrough requirements serve to show the number of times someone has to wager the bonus amount plus crypto deposits before the withdrawal. Remember that some bonuses are only accessible if you insert a bonus code in the designated tab. Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals Many players feel unprepared to jump into the crypto-only gambling experience. They usually look for hybrid platforms that offer both crypto and fiat currencies. This makes them feel safer and more comfortable before making a full transition. However, finding an end-to-end (crypto-only) Crash gambling site comes with multiple benefits for users. This includes an anonymous gambling experience, faster deposits and withdrawals, higher withdrawal limits, and lower fees. Sites That Prioritize Customer Satisfaction While spending your time on crypto Crash gambling sites, you’ll probably have to contact customer support at some point. And if the site of your choice doesn’t respond within a reasonable timeframe, you’ll probably feel neglected. You want to deal with customer-centric support that handles all your requests in a timely way. That’s where our recommended best Crash gambling sites come into play, providing super fast and useful answers via chat, email, or phone. Pros of Crash Gambling Sites Choosing the best crash gambling sites is a good option for several reasons. Apart from providing a crypto-friendly experience, they are good places for customers looking to win big and receive their winnings in the blink of an eye. 24/7 Accessibility Cryptocurrency Crash sites are available 24/7, so you just choose your preferred time and join the action. In addition to regular access, you’ll be able to enjoy table games, slot games, live dealer action, sportsbook choices, football, and plenty of other interesting options. The brands keep improving their offers, so you will always have something in the gaming library. Instant Payouts on Crash Gambling Sites Your crypto arrives almost instantly, so you don’t have to wait hours or days to see your balance updated with your new earnings. Winnings appear in a matter of seconds, and you can open your favorite games immediately and start collecting points. Anonymous Gameplay Getting started with a crypto Crash game also means full anonymity for you. No one will breach your privacy and steal your data. This is as opposed to traditional brands, which will seek your name, date of birth, and other sensitive information that you don’t want to share elsewhere. Provably Fair Games Provably fair games are an important aspect of the cryptocurrency casino industry, ensuring transparency and fairness in online gambling. This concept was introduced to address concerns about the integrity of online casino games, particularly in the context of crypto transactions. The provably fair games offer players the ability to independently verify the fairness of each game round by examining the underlying algorithms, seeds, and random number generation processes. When it comes to crash gambling games, the provably fair mechanisms typically involve the use of cryptographic hashes and seeds. Before each game round, a server seed and a client seed are combined and hashed to determine the outcome of the crash multiplier. The server seed is provided by the casino and kept hidden until the game round ends, while the client seed can be chosen by the player or generated by their device. Once the round is over, the server seed is revealed, allowing players to verify that the outcome was determined fairly. By rehashing the seeds and comparing the result with the crash multiplier displayed during the game, players can ensure that the game was not rigged or manipulated in any way. This level of transparency and verifiability builds trust between players and crypto casinos. It assures players that the game results are truly random and eliminates concerns about the house having an unfair advantage. The provably fair games also encourage casino operators to maintain a trustworthy reputation, as any attempts to manipulate the outcomes would be easily detectable. Enhanced Features and Experiences In usual cases, the best crash gambling sites follow the trend and offer modern sleek designs, a convenient user-interface, great features, and overall thrilling gameplay experiences. This comes with impressive content from the top software providers, such as Microgaming and NetEnt, along with tournaments for competitive gameplay. Mobile Optimized Crash Games If you choose Crash blockchain casinos, you’ll be able to access the games from different devices, including Android and iOS. This is because crypto casinos and their games are perfectly optimized for a smaller screen, so they fit the needs of various readers. The gameplay is also available in the dedicated apps. Worldwide Crash Gambling Trend Crash gambling games continues to gain traction in different markets around the world. This has made it easier to find great options and just jump in and join the action. The game has become the first choice of people in different countries, including the US and the UK, where people look for additional ways to claim rewards and benefit from better RTP. If you also take into consideration better payouts and an enhanced player experience, there is no doubt that Crash gambling games are now the leading option.

After its official launch in 2014, Crypto Crash has become one of the most demanded products in the market. The idea behind the launch was to design a game suited for crypto enthusiasts. What’s interesting about this game is its resemblance to crypto market fluctuations. First, you will have the line going up just as crypto prices spike in value. After a while, it falls, resembling the potential collapse of your favorite coins. If you’re a complete beginner at crypto Crash gambling games, you won’t have a complicated time getting started. A crash game is simple to play, and your rounds are available in short-time sequences. How To Get Started with Ease The first step when you get started with a Crash Bitcoin game is setting the amount of your bet. Then you click Bet (next round), and the game can begin. You’ll start the game at a 1.00x multiplier, and it will move up from there. You’ll see the multiplier go up along with the line representing it. It is possible to cash out anytime and collect the multiplier shown. The most important thing is that you pick a multiplier according to your preferences while cashing out on time to prevent losing everything. Remember that multipliers can increase drastically, but your task is to be ready for a quick reaction. Furthermore, the best crash gambling sites constantly add more features to spice up your experience. For example, you’ll find options for both automatic and manual gameplay. Choosing a manual bet allows you to control the amount you bet in every round. Another option is to set automatic bets and enjoy as many rounds as possible. You can even set the maximum loss or profit figure, a feature that automatically ceases your gameplay when you reach a certain limit. Cashout is another option that provides you with automatic cashouts once you arrive at a specific multiplier. Once you learn the basics of Crash gambling, you’ll be able to sample casino games on different websites and adjust your preferences. Pro Tips for Maximizing the Experience The truth is that a Crash gambling are games of chance, although they are provably fair games, they are still based on pure luck. Crypto gambling sites always have an edge over players, and no strategy can guarantee profit and a 100% successful outcome.

In this regard, the best crash gambling strategy for players is to simply enjoy your time on the crash game. And who knows, maybe you can win more than you’ve ever imagined. Risk And Reward Do you want big wins or small and steady earnings? Choosing the former option means that you should prepare yourself for frequent losses. This crash gambling approach works best if you set the automatic cashouts at a certain multiplier. You can easily get a decent return on investment by sticking with this approach. Just make sure you play with the best Crash platforms, and you are good to go. Alternatively, if you look for big wins, you should be patient enough to watch the multipliers reach high levels. Sometimes, it could take you months or years to reach the desired amount. But once you hit a huge multiplier, you can become a millionaire.

With this rally, the altcoin has moved once more into bullish territory, which begs the question of whether SUI would be on its way back to $1 soon. SUI Crosses $0.7 After Rising Over 15% SUI returned to its bullish trend on Monday with a sharp recovery that saw its price rise quickly. The resulting surge in price saw the digital asset’s price rise above $0.7 after touching as low as $0.5 on Saturday. This over 15% rise also saw the altcoin dominate as one of the top gainers for the day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Inflows To Exchanges Reach 2021 Levels As Bear Trend Persists SUI now contends for the top gainer spot with the likes of Luna Classic (LUNC) which has seen some significant upside over the last week, as well as FTM and XRP, which are being propelled forward by the release of the Hinman documents. The rise in price comes at a time when most of the market is still nursing loss with Bitcoin barely holding on to the $26,000 level. As such, this suggests some level of deviation on the part of the altcoin from the general market trend, which could point toward more upside to come. Is The Race To $1 Back On? Following its much-anticipated launch back in May 2023, the price of SUI traded well above the $1 price mark even as presale participants were able to sell their coins at a huge markup. However, the digital asset quickly lost footing above this level and dropped back down rapidly. SUI struggles to hold $0.7 | Source: SUIUSD on TradingView.com The bear market brought on by regulatory headwinds affected the altcoin, sending it on an over 50% plunge over the course of two weeks. This saw its price fall to a new low of $0.5 last week before rallying back up above $0.7 on Monday. With this latest rally, it is possible that SUI could retest the $1 resistance but that depends on whether the bulls are able to keep momentum going. At the time of writing, the bears have already begun to take over the reins as SUI’s price has lost the $0.7 support.

He also confirmed the team received a request from police in Kazakhstan, as the Russian-language news outlet Forklog reported on Tuesday.  “We forwarded the request to the Estonian police and Chainalysis, to whom we provided all the information needed for investigation,” Gladych said. “We’re also providing data from the victims to [the blockchain analytics companies] Crystal Blockchain and Elliptic. Exchanges and OTCs use them to stop suspicious transactions,” he added.  Atomic Wallet users lost over $100 million worth of crypto in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT), dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), BNB and polygon (MATIC) in the first weekend of June, blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic said in a blog post with updated estimate on Tuesday. According to the firm, over 5,500 wallets had been compromised in the hack. Elliptic earlier said that North Korean hacker group Lazarus might have been responsible for the theft.  Atomic’s wallet in the Google Play has had over 1 million downloads, according to the app store’s data.  It’s unclear what made the breach possible, as Atomic hasn’t shared details of technical investigation yet. Atomic is a non-custodial mobile wallet that allows users to keep the private keys for their crypto on their own devices, without trusting a custodian. The wallet might have flaws in its technical design that allowed hackers to access users’ crypto, CEO of a blockchain security firm Hacken Dyma Budorin told CoinDesk earlier this month.  The wallet might have been sending copies of users’ private keys to the company’s server, Budorin said. Another possibility is that Atomic generated recovery (seed) phrases for its wallets that were not random enough, so the hackers could “brute-force” the wallets. There is also a chance the hackers derived private keys from Atomic users’ transaction data or breached the wallet manufacturer’s infrastructure, Budorin said.  Gladych did not comment on the possible cause of the hack.  Last year, the security firm Least Authority warned about security flaws in Atomic’s code in a now deleted blog post (archived copy available here). The firm said it found issues in Atomic’s use of cryptography, a lack of robust project documentation and incorrect use of Electron, a framework for building desktop applications. Atomic also did not adhere to the best practices for wallet design, Least Authority wrote.

He said the recent U.S. banking turmoil showed “the technology enabling the movement of deposits only getting faster,” which increases the hazard of high-speed, panic-driven movements of funds. A Treasury-led group examining the possibilities of a U.S. CBDC “is evaluating policy objectives related to global financial leadership, national security, and privacy, illicit finance and financial inclusion,” Steele said.  While Steele delivered those remarks, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified Tuesday in the House Financial Services Committee, telling lawmakers that she’s still wary of regulatory gaps in the oversight of the spot market in non-securities digital assets and in stablecoins. She said the crypto sector needs “a comprehensive federal prudential framework, and we'll be pleased to work with Congress to see if we can develop such a framework.”  Read More: Privacy Concerns Dominate CBDC Discussion at Consensus 2023",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/13/us-treasury-examining-how-using-digital-dollars-could-be-kept-private,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d006e545944d87378642bf8ee999884e50824c66-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410439,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKgr3,1686674620,‘The Industry Doesn’t Want the Answers.’ Josh Klayman on Coinbase and Binance,"Much of the crypto community believes the SEC recent lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase are arbitrary, unfair and based on shaky legal foundations.  Not Joshua Klayman.  The U.S. head of fintech and Head of Blockchain and Digital Asset at the law firm Linklaters long forecast last week’s bombshell announcements. So she’s not surprised by them. To Klayman, the SEC’s actions spring naturally and logically from statements that chair Gary Gensler has been making for years – namely that most cryptocurrencies are in fact securities and that exchanges like Coinbase were always likely to be targeted for selling their securities without an official license.  Read more: Binance and Coinbase: Experts Weigh What’s Coming Next  “I see this as a massive push, a very unsubtle move by the chairman Gensler and the SEC,” she tells CoinDesk. “They’ve been trying to nudge the industry for a long time to change its practices, and now it seems they moved from nudging to a pretty swift kick, or, you might say, a one-two punch.”  The SEC is telling the crypto industry: The runway has ended, and things need to change now, Klayman says.  “There is a saying by [the writer] Upton Sinclair: ‘It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.' And I think if I were a regulator I might take the position: it’s not a matter of us not expressing that this industry should be treated like traditional securities. It’s not the lack of clarity. It’s that the industry doesn’t want the answers,” Klayman said.  The timing of the lawsuits isn’t an accident, Klayman added. The lawsuits are coming as the U.S. Congress is discussing the “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act” draft bill introduced in 2021. The SEC wants to make its mark. The industry has asked regulators and lawmakers to provide “clarity” and now they’re, arguably, starting to provide clarity. The SEC wants to be seen as acting.  “People have long said: ‘SEC, you have rule-making ability, make rules.’ And we’ve seen the SEC now propose multiple rules that the industry is not really happy about,” Klayman says.  For example, earlier this year, the SEC proposed two rule changes, including a proposal to expand the definition of exchange and the one to expand the existing custody rule, both of which would inscribe crypto assets into the existing securities regulations. The first proposal received a lot of feedback from the public, so the SEC prolonged the comment period in April until June 13 ""and addressed many of the responses,"" Klayman said.  Way out of crisis  That’s not to say one can’t disagree with the SEC’s approach to regulation. In making these lawsuits, SEC has given its opinion. It’s now up to the courts to decide on the specifics.  “It’s a tough area because a lot of time people look for bright-line rules,” she said. “The whole reason we have something like the Howey test [defining what’s a security] and we say it’s about facts and circumstances is because there are no-bright lines.”  This cuts both ways, giving both the SEC and the companies targeted a chance to convince the court that facts and circumstances prove their point.  This likely means a years-long litigation battle for Coinbase and Binance, and continuing uncertainty for companies with similar exposure to the law.  Both of the sued exchanges “have very deep pockets and appetite to go through long and expensive fights, but it doesn’t mean that everyone else does,” Klayman said. Crypto companies will need to take a hard look at their risk tolerance and decide whether they have the stomach for grinding legal battles: “If you don’t want to be involved in a fight, then maybe you change your behaviors here.”  “If you need money to be able to fight a multi-year [legal] fight, and you’re making money a certain way, there are two questions,” Klayman says. “On one hand, maybe you continue doing what you’re doing to fund your defense. On the other hand, if you make any changes [to your business], will the SEC say that this was an admission that you did something wrong?”  The case of Bittrex, another U.S. exchange, might serve as a warning example here, Klayman said. When the exchange deleted statements from its website, the action was interpreted by the SEC as the admission that the company understood they could attract regulators’ attention.  Read more: David Z. Morris - The SEC Is Fighting the Last War  The situation is troubling not only for exchanges but for token projects, too: after the SEC mentioned Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL) in the two lawsuits, the trading platform Robinhood immediately announced it wouldn’t support trading them anymore.  “One of the big unanswered questions the SEC needs to answer is, if it believes that 50,000+ assets are securities, what happens to them, are they going to be forever banned from trading in the U.S., will they be grandfathered in? Is secondary registration the way to go?” Klayman said.  Ultimately, though, the lawsuits are not about tokens per se; they are directed at companies that sell tokens. “In my view, the SEC is trying to show that some of these [tokens] may be securities, but the big fish they are trying to hook here are the trading platforms, not necessarily the tokens,” Klayman said.  Regulation coming?  It might be that the Coinbase and Binance lawsuits might convince the U.S. Congress that it’s time to act, but, most likely, many important issues will still have to be resolved in court, Klayman believes.  Before the downfall of FTX last November, there were several legislative attempts in Congress to liberalize the regulatory regime for crypto, including the bill by Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis and the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act. But “there was no political will to pass those.” Now, post-FTX, Congress is pretty polarized on crypto, which makes reaching a consensus on the way forward harder.  “The likelihood that we get legislation that will be liberalizing is unlikely. It’s more likely to make things tighter,” Klayman said.  With Gensler’s public comments last week that the U.S. “doesn’t need more digital currency,” there is “an element of political theater and there is an element of convincing” the public that the SEC is doing the right thing, Klayman said.  She thinks that Gensler could have his own political reasons for such statements.  “There have been speculations that [Gensler] has designs to be the secretary of Treasury one day. And what does the Treasury have? It has dollars!” Klayman added.  She is generally optimistic about the future of the industry, especially where crypto can expand the realm of capital markets, for instance, in the tokenization of real world assets and tokenized securities.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/13/the-industry-doesnt-want-the-answers-josh-klayman-on-coinbase-and-binance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95425165e74c51776fb6ca8ef2b92297c2a93ffa-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These stories, where a fortunate individual invested a mere $100 and reaped a staggering $100,000 in a single day, never fail to captivate readers. They simultaneously allure and intimidate us because we are well aware of the timeless axiom: high returns always come hand in hand with high risks. Nevertheless, have you ever wondered how to learn crypto trading in the least risky manner? Cosmic FOMO, a product inside the MarsDAO ecosystem masterminded and launched by Vlad Utushkin, is an app that teaches cryptocurrency trading and is focused on beginners who make their first steps in the crypto world. Cosmic FOMO imparts crypto trading skills through an engaging gaming experience, allowing users to earn without risking their actual assets. With Cosmic FOMO, users can take their initial strides into the realm of secure cryptocurrency management, comprehending the intricacies of trading and mastering the mechanics of the cryptocurrency market, all in a delightful game format. The primary focus of Cosmic FOMO lies in empowering gamers to make informed choices and accurate predictions. It's like a cryptocurrency trading course but fun and engaging. The team behind this project released 20+ successful out-of-the-box products. This time their mission is proclaimed to be the simplification of the transition into the world of digital assets, drawing mass adoption ever closer. How to start a Cosmic FOMO journey Gameplay unfolds in the following manner: users must select a playable character known as a pilot, which exists as a non-fungible token (NFT) within the BNB Smart Chain. These pilots require backpacks to be filled with cryptocurrencies (currently offering 15 available assets) that players believe will appreciate in value within the next 60 minutes. Once prepared, the pilot embarks on a thrilling space race. It is crucial to note that the app provides a simulation of asset acquisition, eliminating the need for users to purchase any actual assets. Each flight lasts between 10 minutes to an hour, during which the quotes of the selected assets may fluctuate. Ultimately, the income received hinges upon these fluctuations. All asset quotes are streamed directly from Binance, ensuring real-time accuracy. If players wish to secure their profits mid-flight, they have the option to terminate the race prematurely. The greater the growth of the selected assets, the higher the profits received. Those players whose predictions prove right win COSMIC, in-game tokens that can be used to upgrade pilot's stats. This unique approach enables users to learn the art of trading, comprehend the workings of the cryptocurrency market, and safeguard their tangible assets. Energy replenishment occurs every six hours. For users with a single pilot, one flight per day is available, equating to 2 units of fuel. Owning a second pilot grants access to 3 units of fuel, with each subsequent pilot providing an additional unit. Accounts can accommodate a maximum of 50 pilots, but only a maximum of 17 fuels can be obtained. The main feature of Cosmic FOMO is that there are no losers in this game. Even if a gamer lacks in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies or is unfamiliar with fundamental indicators that indicate future growth or decline, and even if their predictions turn out to be incorrect, they still receive in-game tokens regardless of the outcome of their gaming session. The only difference is that their reward will be comparatively smaller compared to more experienced players. This unique feature serves as one of Cosmic FOMO's primary advantages. The game was primarily designed for individuals embarking on their cryptocurrency journey. The project team aimed to create gameplay that is not only non-intimidating but also an exciting exploration into the world of cryptocurrencies, allowing future crypto owners to familiarize themselves with digital assets in a playful manner. Cosmic FOMO caters to all individuals, irrespective of their knowledge or skill level. Pilot Minting Bonus The game mechanics also feature the ability to independently mint pilots. In order to mint a new pilot, users need to cross two pilots that have attained a specific level known as a mint point. Each pilot can partake in minting up to 3 times, achievable at levels #11, #21, and #25. It is noteworthy that minting can transpire between pilots of varying classes and rarity levels. However, the likelihood of acquiring a rare or legendary pilot is contingent on these particular characteristics. For instance, crossing two common pilots will solely yield a common or uncommon pilot, while crossing a common pilot with a rare pilot offers a 40% chance of obtaining a rare pilot. NFTs produced via this method can be sold on the secondary market. Depending on the level and class of the newly minted pilot, owners have the potential to earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars through a single transaction. To engage in minting, players must possess COSMIC and MDAO tokens. Thus, Cosmic FOMO offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to its popularity, including a balanced gameplay experience, a user-friendly interface that captivates the eye, and the incorporation of five deflationary tools that positively impact the game's equilibrium. Moreover, the game boasts straightforward mechanics that ensure accessibility for players of all backgrounds and skill levels. Embrace Cosmic FOMO today, embark on an exhilarating crypto trading journey, and unlock the gateway to vast financial opportunities. This immersive game experience presents an unmatched avenue to acquire knowledge, refine trading skills, and potentially prosper in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

42410441,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKgxf,1686672228,"Bitcoin, Ether and Stablecoins Total 80% of $1T Crypto Market Cap as Investors Flee Altcoins","The dominance of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and stablecoins in the crypto market surged to its highest level since February 2021 as investors fled from smaller tokens after last week’s U.S. regulatory clampdown.  The combined market capitalization of the two largest digital assets and stablecoins compose 80.5% of the total cryptocurrency market valued at some $1 trillion, digital asset research firm K33 Research noted in a report Tuesday.  Altcoins – an umbrella term for alternative cryptocurrencies – suffered a dramatic sell-off last week as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deemed multiple tokens securities in lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance, Binance.US and Coinbase. Top 10 crypto assets such as Binance’s BNB, Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL – all tagged as securities in the lawsuits – lost as much as 30% of their value over the week.  If the SEC’s allegation about a slew of tokens being securities are proven right, token issuers and exchanges would face a mounting burden to register with the SEC. Popular retail trading platforms Robinhood and eToro have decided to end U.S. trading for some tokens flagged by the SECs, while market makers have likely sold tokens in anticipation of lower trading demand.  Altcoins underperform  The legal battle could drag on for years, K33 wrote, impeding capital inflows to the assets under SEC scrutiny and propelling the investment case for BTC and ETH as safer bets from regulatory risks.  “Funds will likely retort to a hands-off approach due to excess compliance work and overall low trading volumes, disincentivizing market participants to engage. This could limit liquidity further onwards and lead to a prolonged slow market,” K33 wrote.  “Over the next year, we could thus see the BTC and ETH dominance strengthen further due to the cost and risk burden of allocating capital to altcoins from the 2017 era and beyond,” the report added.  The two leading cryptos have outperformed smaller tokens this year so far, preserving much of their gains from this year’s crypto market recovery. BTC and ETH are up 57.3% and 45.4% year-to-date, respectively, according to CoinDesk data.  Other cryptocurrencies, however, dropped to new yearly lows, with BNB and MATIC tumbling 2.7% and 15%, respectively, since the start of the year.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/13/bitcoin-ether-and-stablecoins-total-80-of-1t-crypto-market-cap-as-investors-flee-altcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3723842c05894586f4623f2aeb84d3be3113afc-1192x680.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crackdown on top trading platforms Coinbase and Binance has further made things worse as the crypto winter has persisted. However, while the massacre caught up with most coins, Terra Classic (LUNC) remained in the uptrend, emerging as the number 1 gaining cryptocurrency over the past 24 hours. Terra Classic (LUNC) Making Bold Rebound Moves LUNC surprised market participants over the past week as it continued pulling weight amid bearish trends in the crypto market. Before the disaster enveloped the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, Terra Classic (LUNC) traded at an all-time high of $116. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC: Hinman Docs Are Out, XRP Is Up 8% LUNC’s value plummeted following the crash of Terra blockchain’s stablecoin UST, wiping over $40 billion valuation for the token’s market cap. Several investors lost hope of recovering their loss until several rebuilding initiatives emerged. However, LUNC’s recent price movements have shone a ray of light in the dark tunnel for the Terra Classic community. At press time, LUNC is still on the upward trajectory and has been so for over one week. Terra Classic (LUNC) price has increased by 10.04% over the past 24 hours, with an 11.59% price surge in the last seven days. Also, the token price has rallied 8.60% over the past 30 days. Terra Classic now trades at $0.00009638. Ecosystem Improvements Are Pushing LUNC Price LUNC’s price has been reacting to community buzz around notable upcoming ecosystem developments. For instance, the proposed Terra Classic v2.1.0 upgrade is only 24 hours away from commencement, while the LUNC Burn Army shared several tweet threads on June 8, reminding the community about the upgrade. The team highlighted the expected key improvements on the blockchain after the upgrade. According to the LUNCBurnArmy, the upgrade will bring Terra Classic to parity with other blockchains, allowing developers and projects to start building on the chain again. The LUNC community is now counting down to the upgrade scheduled to go live on June 14 at 14:11 UTC. This upgrade will also allow validators to earn a 5% commission for running nodes on the mainnet. The increased excitement as the community anticipates the upcoming v2.1.0 upgrade to parity must have rubbed off on Terra Classic (LUNC). Related Reading: Solana Price Plunges Below March Low – Could It Drop Further? As one of the most anticipated events on the Terra ecosystem since the May 2022 disaster, v2.1.0 generated enough buzz to boost investor interest in LUNC. LUNC’s community and social sentiment has improved lately and is evident in the increased trading volume and LUNC staking. Data from Mr. Diamondhandz1 shows that the number of staked LUNC hit 1 Trillion on June 10. This milestone achievement could be among the factors pushing LUNC’s price. Also, CoinMarketCap data shows that LUNC trading volume has risen by 106% over the past 24 hours while its market cap is up by 10.74%.

42410435,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKgNI,1686671918,Crypto Lender Genesis Amends Reorganization Plan as Mediated Talks Continue,"Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis has filed an updated wind-up plan as mediated talks continue on the funds its owed by parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), according to a Tuesday court filing.  The document updates a plan first proposed on Jan. 20, the day that three Genesis group companies filed for bankruptcy in a New York court. DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  The updated reorganization plan “reflects substantial agreement on certain key issues,” the filing said, but added that Genesis, its creditors and other stakeholders reserve their position in negotiations that are still ongoing. In April, for a 30-day period that was subsequently extended, the court appointed a mediator to resolve differences, including the DCG issue.  The plan indicates that claims by DCG and by bankrupt hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) are disputed and “impaired,” suggesting that the creditors won’t get back the full value of their claims.  DCG claimants will be treated like other unsecured creditors, but won’t benefit from any proceeds from arising from loans still owed by the parent company, the plan said. In January, DCG said it owed Genesis Capital $526 million, due in May 2023, plus $1.1 billion under a promissory note due in June 2032.  Claims relating to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading arm Alameda Research shouldn’t be allowed to benefit from any clawbacks of fraudulent transfers, the filing said. FTX alleges Genesis owes it $3.9 billion which Genesis has denied. In a parallel filing also made Tuesday, FTX argued its claims against Genesis should be adjudicated as part of its own court proceedings in Delaware.  Earlier this month, Judge Sean Lane gave Genesis until August 2 to finalize its bankruptcy plan, but appeared to take a dim view of 3AC and FTX's attempts to take part in the mediation.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/13/crypto-lender-genesis-amends-reorganization-plan-as-mediated-talks-continue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63a0947999671c07e933b8c6911a2371c43c4a59-761x393.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Antminer S19j Pro accounts for 34.3% of the network hashrate and the S19 for 28.1%, and they have been the most used machines on the network since March 2021, Coinmetrics found. The Antminer S19 XP accounts for another 13.7% of the network hashrate, said the report. Meanwhile, MicroBT's M50 is below the threshold of detectability, the researchers said.

We estimated this expansion will come at the cost of 24% shareholder dilution. The 24% shareholder dilution is sufficiently compensated with a 200% and 470% upside when Bitcoin returns to near all-time high and $100k respectively. CLSK's shares outstanding have tripled over the past 2 years hence upside potential could be limited. Introduction This season, we're going to thoroughly review and update our previous theses for Bitcoin miners in our watchlist in anticipation of a potential 2024 Bitcoin bull market . So far we've updated our thesis on Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). We found that both RIOT and MARA are expanding and are on track toward their respective 2023 year-end guidance. However, both RIOT and MARA failed to offer us sufficient upside to give a buy recommendation due to their current market caps. Our analysis on CleanSpark ( CLSK ) has sparked our interest and we think it should spark yours too. Here's why. On track to Becoming One of the Sector's Largest Although CLSK revised its 2023 guidance from 22.4 EH/s to 16 EH/s, CLSK remains on track to becoming one of the sector's largest in 2023. CLSK is realizing its 2023 guidance to increase mining capacity to 16 EH/s. This puts CLSK in between the 2 Bitcoin mining giants, RIOT (12.5 EH/s) and MARA (23 EH/s). More importantly, CLSK (market cap - $428mil) is priced at only a quarter of RIOT's ($1.84bn) and MARA's ($1.57bn). This suggests that CLSK has a lot of upside potential (market cap). Table 1 illustrates CLSK's expansion progress from 2021Q1 to 2023Q1. Table 1. CLSK's Expansion Progress QR Built-up Hash Rate (EH/s) 2023Q1 6.7 (or 8.7 if in-transit/installed included) 2022Q4 6.2 2022Q3 4.16 2022Q2 4 2022Q1 2.4 2021Q4 1.9 2021Q3 1.3 2021Q2 0.82 2021Q1 0.33 Source: Author Dilution May Not Be An Issue In the Near Term As of 2023Q1, CLSK has 6.7 EH/s of mining capacity or 8.7 EH/s if machines being shipped are included. This implies CLSK needs to expand another 7.3 EH/s to get to the guided 16 EH/s. However, CLSK lacks the balance sheet to support this growth. As of 2023Q1 , CLSK has $10.35mil cash and only $42.7mil prepaid to Bitcoin mining machine vendors. With reference to MARA's and RIOT's balance sheets, this amount of capital is expected to be insufficient to expand 7.3 EH/s. Table 2 illustrates the amount of capital required to get to 15 EH/s. Table 2. Relationship between MARA's Capital Level and Mining Capacity Growth QR Built-up hash rate Cash ($mil) Prepaid ($mil) 2023Q1 11.5 EH/s (15.4 EH/s installed) $124 $69.5 2022Q4 7.0 EH/s (9.1 EH/s installed $103.75 $528.8 2022Q3 5.7 EH/s $55.34 $735.5 2022Q2 3.9 EH/s $86.4 $830.2 2022Q1 3.9 EH/s $118.5 $635 2021Q4 3.5 EH/s $268.5 $500.5 2021Q3 2.7 EH/s $32.9 $203.3 2021Q2 2.09 EH/s $170.6 $121.6 2021Q1 1.46 EH/s $204.4 $129 According to CryptoPotato , MARA spent close to $900mil to acquire 78,000 of Antminer S-19 XP in 2021. Assuming each S-19 XP costs $3,259 and has 0.00014 EH/s of mining capacity, $169mil is required to increase capacity by 7.3 EH/s. Although the prices of different mining machines may differ, CLSK still has to raise about $100mil (estimate). Given CLSK's current market cap, we estimate that CLSK is going to increase its outstanding shares by at least another 24% (= $100mil cash / $428 market cap) or to 120mil shares (which exceeded its 2022Q4 100mil shares authorized). Hence, CLSK has already laid the foundation in 2023Q1 to raise this level of capital to fund its 7.3 EH/s capacity. CLSK has tripled its authorized shares from 100mil to 300mil: In the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in March 2023, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance from 100,000,000 to 300,000,000. This event occurred shortly after CLSK tripled its outstanding shares from 33.88mil to 97mil in 2 years, bringing outstanding close to the previous 100mil authorized shares. Referring to Table 3, it is observable that CLSK had also doubled its authorized shares from 50mil to 100mil in 2021. Considering this, CLSK has increased its authorized shares 6 folds . Table 3 illustrates CLSK's historical outstanding shares and authorized shares over the past 2 years. Table 3.

Payments on miners (including deposits) are funded by proceeds from equity offerings. (On a side note, CLSK is operating cash flow positive , which is a good thing). In CLSK's defense, CLSK wasn't the ""only culprit for pulling off this stunt"". RIOT has also recently doubled its authorized shares from 170m to 340m citing "" greater flexibility to pursue value-creative opportunities"" just when its outstanding shares also got near its authorized shares (Table 4). All-in-all, authorized shares used to mean the ceiling of maximum shareholder dilution. But in this capital-intensive business of mining Bitcoin, it seems that the practice of increasing authorized shares and constant shareholder dilution is a common practice. Author, CLSK Author, CLSK Table 4. RIOT's Historical Shares Outstanding QR Shares Outstanding (mil) 2023Q1 167 2022Q4 167.75 2022Q3 167.3 2022Q2 148 2022Q1 117.3 2021Q4 116.75 2021Q3 97.2 2021Q2 95.95 2021Q1 84.12 Source: Author Why 24% Dilution Might Not Be A Major Issue? Firstly, CLSK's mining efficiency is consistently efficient. CLSK's all-in mining cost per BTC is consistently in the $30,000's (Table 5). CLSK's 2023Q1 all-in mining cost is $33,276 (= [$21.35mil Depreciation + $22.1mil Cost of Rev + $4.3mil General Admin + $3.75mil Professional Fees + $9.75 Payroll + $1mil Interest] / 1,871 Bitcoins mined). This is rather impressive because CLSk is yet to enjoy the MARA and RIOT's level of economic of scale. Table 5. The Historical All-in Mining Cost Per Bitcoin of CLSK, MARA, and RIOT Q ((CY)) CLSK MARA RIOT 2023Q1 $33,276 $32,100 $46,200 2022Q4 $30,500 $44,400 $53,000 2022Q3 $35,627 $91,200 $55,000 2022Q2 $37,600 $81.683 $35,300 2022Q1 $42,800 $31,700 $30,800 Source: Author Secondly, CLSK (market cap - $428mil) is trading below its adjusted net asset value ($441mil, Table 6). Therefore, we can say that CLSK is currently undervalued. Theoretically, if we're buying CLSk at its current valuation, we can liquidate CLSK at a profit. Comparatively, Bitcoin has to trade above $67,915 and $50,737 to justify RIOT's and MARA's current valuation respectively. At $50,737, our model value CLSK at $650mil, suggesting a 52% potential upside from the current market cap. At $67,915 per Bitcoin, our model value CLSK at $1.27bn, suggesting a potential 200% upside from the current market cap. At $100,000 Bitcoin, our model suggests a potential 470% upside. Table 6.

However, CLSK's potential 200% upside (if and when Bitcoin returns to near all-time high) can compensate for the 24% shareholder dilution. Since we expect Bitcoin to return to its all-time high by April 2024 and $100k before April 2025, this is a massive opportunity Bitcoin optimists wouldn't want to miss. On the flip side, CLSK's upside potential could be negated by dilution. Note that an increase in market cap does not equate higher share price. Historically, CLSK's shares outstanding tripled over the 2 years, which could nullify most of CLSK's upside potential suggested by our model. Although we expect only about 24% dilution to fund CLSK's expansion, dilution could be far worse if Bitcoin does not recover back to its all-time high as we expected and persistently trade below CLSK's total mining cost per Bitcoin.

Uniswap v3 was a watershed moment for on-chain liquidity and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), processing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume since its release two years ago. However, as technology and markets evolve, so must the Uniswap Protocol, according to the announcement released today. Uniswap Labs Unveils V4 Uniswap Labs has revealed the draft code for Uniswap v4, which promises to bring a world of possibilities to on-chain liquidity and decentralized finance. Uniswap v4 introduces a new architecture that reduces costs and increases efficiency, making it a more powerful and flexible platform for liquidity provision and on-chain trading. Related Reading: Solana Price Plunges Below March Low – Could It Drop Further? One of the most significant changes in Uniswap v4 is the introduction of hooks, which are contracts that run at various points of a pool’s lifecycle. These hooks allow developers to customize how pools, swaps, fees, and liquidity provider (LP) positions interact. With hooks, developers can create customized automated market maker (AMM) pools that integrate with v4’s smart contracts. The sky’s the limit, with potential experiments including time-weighted average market makers, dynamic fees based on volatility or other inputs, on-chain limit orders, and more. Another major change in Uniswap v4 is the introduction of a new singleton contract that holds all pools, providing important gas savings. This eliminates the need to deploy a new contract for every pool, making creating pools and performing multi-pool swaps more efficient. Early estimates suggest that v4 reduces pool creation gas costs by 99%, making it cheaper to create minimalistic pools that are more affordable to use. This new feature also brings back support for native ETH, which offers additional gas savings. Furthermore, the new flash accounting system in v4 transfers assets on net balances, providing even more gas savings. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Whale Transfers Spike, Bearish Sign? Uniswap Labs strongly believes that core financial infrastructure should be open and transparent and that the community should govern v4 of the Protocol. The code will be released under a Business Source License 1.1, which limits the use of the v4 source code in a commercial or production setting for up to four years. The Protocol fee mechanism will also be modeled after v3, with governance able to vote to add a Protocol fee to any pool, up to a capped amount.

42410442,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKh4H,1686666674,Bitcoin Miners Transfer $174M Worth of Coins to Exchanges in Two Weeks,"Transfer of bitcoin (BTC) from miners to centralized exchanges has picked up the pace since May 31, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  Data from Glassnode shows miners or entities minting coins by verifying transactions on the blockchain have moved 6671.99 BTC ($174 million) to exchanges since May 31. On June 3 alone, miners moved 2,606 BTC to exchanges, the largest single-day tally in over four years.  The 14-day average of miner transfers to exchanges has increased sharply to 489.26 BTC, the highest since March 2021. Meanwhile, the balance in wallets associated with miners has decreased by nearly 2,000 BTC in two weeks.  The movement of coins from miner or investor wallets to exchanges is often equated with an intention to sell or liquidate coins. As such, increased movement of coins from miners to exchanges is widely perceived as bearish.  However, the recent transfers amount to just 1.3% of bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume of $13 billion and do not appear big enough to have a sizable impact on bitcoin's price.  Further, increased miner transfers are often taken to represent confidence in bitcoin's price prospects. The logic here is that miners' profitability is closely tied to bitcoin's price and so they step up their sales when they feel the market is strong enough to absorb extra supply. This is akin to a central bank of a current account deficit nation buying U.S. dollars in the open market when the greenback is on the offer across the board. That way it is able to build reserves without risking local currency depreciation.

The digital token advanced 0.7% to $26.0K at 10:29 a.m. ET, after reaching as high as $26.3K just seconds after the CPI release. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), though, hovered around breakeven levels at $1.73K. Overall, the global crypto market cap gained 1% to $1.06T, according to CoinMarketCap data . The modest relief in crypto prices coincided with continued strength in the stock market. Headline consumer prices rose 4.0% Y/Y in May, slightly trailing the 4.1% consensus, slowing from the 4.9% increase logged in the prior month. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, core CPI increased 5.3%, matching expectations, down from +5.5% in April. That prompted traders to boost their bets that the Fed will skip a rate hike at its meeting on Wednesday.

42410448,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKh7a,1686666282,Why the XRP Army Keeps Fighting,"Brad Kimes is a professional drummer. For 30 years he played in various bands -- rock, funk, blues, R&B, you name it. Between gigs, he worked as an aspiring entrepreneur, and he invented a baby playpen that you could use on the beach. He found suppliers in China. Kimes soon became a global importer, and to make cross-border payments, he was forced to use the clunky international banking system called “SWIFT.”  SWIFT was not swift. It was slow and costly. “There’s no tracking ID,” says Kimes. “And when the payment gets there six days later, you find out there’s a currency manipulation that had taken place. And you have to pay the difference.”  Was there a better solution?  Enter crypto.  This is a common “origin story” in the crypto space. I’ve heard many like it. Someone tries to do something simple with traditional finance, it’s a headache, they get frustrated, and then the lightbulb goes on and they say, “Then I discovered bitcoin.”  But Kimes had already discovered bitcoin. That didn’t strike him as the right solution. Instead he found something else, something newer, something he believed to be cheaper and faster and more efficient.  XRP.  Created largely by the team that co-founded Ripple, and originally envisioned by Jed McCaleb as ""bitcoin without mining,"" XRP has banks and corporations and the financial system in mind. I If bitcoin’s unofficial motto is “be your own bank,” XRP’s is the less inspirational “let’s improve the banks.” Ripple is at odds with much of crypto’s prevailing ideology. For years, it has been dismissed, overlooked, or outright scorned by much of the space.  “The technology works. It does what it says it can do,” says Kimes. After doing more research, he believed that XRP could be the hot knife that cuts through all the buttery layers of banking red tape. And it doesn’t require energy-guzzling Proof-of-Work mining. “Bitcoin can solve that problem for a lot more money,” says Kimes, who clarifies that he has no ill-will towards bitcoin, as it “showed us all what’s possible,” and considers it to be an important stepping-stone technology, like the pager or the early flip phones. But the way Kimes sees it, “None of us are using the first cell phone anymore.”  Kimes is sympathetic to the ideals of bitcoin. “Bitcoin in its white paper is anti-bank, anti-establishment,” says Kimes. “The libertarian in me loves it. The libertarian in me absolutely goes f#$king nuts for it. I’m like, ‘Hell yeah, down with the man!’”  Read More: Hinman Emails Reveal 2018 Speech on Ether Drew Input From Multiple SEC Officials  Then he pauses. And he adds a crucial disclaimer. “I’m also an adult,” says Kimes, who’s 52 years old. “As an adult, I understand that the legacy firms, and systems, and governments, and central banks of the world aren’t going for any of that shit.”  Kimes might not love the world of banks and governments, but he thinks it’s absurd to imagine that a decentralized currency, like bitcoin, will actually topple the system. Or, as he puts it, the government will “bring in the tanks and the fucking guns before they let anybody come in with no fucking name [Satoshi Nakamoto] to run the fucking show. It’s not going to happen.”  That’s the message that Kimes now preaches on “Digital Perspective,” his daily show about XRP. The drummer is now beating the drum for why XRP -- and its embrace of the banking system -- is more likely to flourish than the anti-establishment ethos of bitcoin. “They can’t stop the technology,” says Kimes of bitcoin, “but they can tax it and regulate it out of existence.”  Kimes is a central player in the XRP community, aka the “XRP Army.” This is an Army that much of crypto loves to hate. XRP has long been mocked for not being a “real” cryptocurrency project, because (claim the critics) it’s not truly decentralized, and that Ripple Labs owns a large chunk of the 100 billion XRP in circulation, which it continues to sell on a set schedule on secondary markets. (XRP supporters counter that the “too centralized” charge might have once been true, but it’s not anymore and that Ripple controls only a tiny fraction of the XRP Ledger.)  The XRP Army, to outsiders, is known mostly for its flaying of Ripple critics, for protestation about FUD, and celebration of price pumps. The Army sometimes makes menacing and vaguely threatening tweets like “Ignore Ripple and XRP at your own risk.”  This has been the case for years. XRP Army is such a force that in 2018, CoinDesk included it on the annual list of crypto’s Most Influential. “The XRP Army distinguishes itself mainly through scale and organization,” David Floyd wrote for the site in 2018. “Question another coin’s merits, and a handful of trolls might come out of the woodwork. But measured by volume, intensity, duration and consistency, the attack will pale in comparison to an XRP Army operation.”  Floyd should know. Even before he wrote the piece, members of the XRP Army mobilized to attack him, calling him a “paid assassin,” a desperate “hater,” and someone suffering from a “delusional disorder.” More recently, when Fortune editor Jeff Roberts wrote a largely positive piece about XRP titled “Ripple and XRP may finally be for real,” some in the XRP Army still needled him on Twitter. (For what it’s worth, this didn’t happen to me. I was ignored by some of the people in XRP Army I reached out to, but I faced no hostility.)  If it’s true that the XRP Army has vocal extremists who can be toxic on Twitter -- there’s a lot of that in crypto -- it’s also true that the community is packed with pragmatists like Kimes. They focus on utility and see themselves as the “adults in the room.” (It’s a phrase I heard numerous times in my reporting.) Consider the recent XRP convention, organized by Kimes, that took place in Las Vegas. Whereas some came to Bitcoin Miami dressed as wizards, many of the XRP faithful in Vegas were older guys in suits. Businessmen. One attendee told me, “I’m 37, and I was one of the babies in the room.”  One of the XRP influencers in Vegas was “Digital Asset Investor,” or DAI, who hosts a daily show about XRP. He was drawn to the project years earlier when he scrolled through Coinmarketcap.com, studied the top 30 cryptocurrencies, and did research on their leadership teams. “The only one that I could find that had a group of entrepreneurs with MIT and Harvard degrees was Ripple,” says DAI. “They were all major Silicon Valley people with pedigrees. I was like, ‘Something’s different about this one. Something’s special.’”  DAI likes that these “adults in the room” are quite literally the adults in rooms with other powerful figures. If Bitcoin is for outsiders, XRP is for the insiders. “[Ripple CEO] Brad Garlinghouse, he was in a room in Switzerland, and I know he had the Hong Kong Central Bank in the room. He had the Russian Central Bank,” says DAI. “You’ve got to understand, this is what we’ve been studying and obsessing about for five years.” DAI estimates that Ripple has been “working with as many as 50 central banks from around the world.”  The magic of XRP, says Kimes, is that it can provide an instant tool for settlement without entities (like central banks) needing to have large liquidity pools. That frees up resources and saves money. This is why Kimes and DAI are bullish that it could someday be designated as a global stablecoin. XRP wouldn’t replace the dollar or the yuan or the euro; it would instead be a bridge for all these things.  This is all preamble to say that the XRP Army is genuinely bullish on the real-world utility of XRP. They expect it to improve the current system, they expect it to get widely adopted, and they think the price will eventually “moon.”  But they also have a bone to pick.  The problem is that XRP hasn’t gone to the moon. It hasn’t come close. For perspective, in January of 2018, around when bitcoin claimed its then-all-time-high of nearly $20,000, XRP was worth over $3. Then the prices collapsed during the bear market. When the price of bitcoin roared back in 2021, the XRP Army assumed their holdings would do the same.  Bitcoin surged to more than $60,000, or three times its all-time high from the last cycle. So by that logic, XRP should hit $9 or maybe even $10, right?  It failed to crack $2.  The price has slumped to around 50 cents, leaving much of XRP Army -- especially the ones who bought at over $1 -- frustrated and bitter.  The obvious reason for the price stagnation is the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, which was filed in December of 2020 and now, finally, looks to be nearing a resolution. That’s part of the story.  But Kimes, DAI, and the XRP Army have another theory for why XRP has lagged Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s an explosive theory that animates the community. It’s a theory rarely talked about outside of the XRP Army. It’s a theory so spicy they assumed CoinDesk would never allow it to be published.  The theory is called “ETHGate.”  'Decentralized justice'  John Deaton is a former Marine. Bald and muscular with an intimidating goatee, he’s also a plaintiff’s attorney who represents victims of mesothelioma and asbestos cancer. He’s not a crypto lawyer. But he had invested in XRP, Ethereum, and Bitcoin (XRP was his smallest holding), and in December of 2020, he began to obsess over an issue he never imagined he would care much about: SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple.  Read More: XRP Prices Jump as Hinman Speech Released in Ripple Labs Filing  He didn’t think it was a big deal, at first. “Companies get sued,” says Deaton. “I figured it would be a traditional securities case.” Then Deaton read the complaint more closely. “It basically said that all XRP are securities, no matter the circumstances surrounding the sale,” says Deaton. “This is the most over-broad, far-reaching, outrageous case I’ve ever read. It made no sense.” The charge was so sweeping that Deaton wondered if it was a “weapon,” and “meant to do damage.”  At first this was just speculation. Then Deaton began to connect a few dots. First, then-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton filed the lawsuit on December 22, 2020, on his very last day in office. This seemed like odd timing. The lawsuit targeted only Ripple, not Bitcoin or Ethereum. Then he came across a letter from Joseph Grundfest, a law professor who had worked as a liaison between the Ethereum founders and the SEC years earlier. Grundfest sent the letter only days before the lawsuit was filed.  Grundfest’s letter cautioned the SEC against a lawsuit, in part because the action would “impose substantial harm on innocent holders of XRP, regardless of the ultimate resolution,” and that “if the Commission is to maintain its tradition of fairness, ether and XRP should be treated similarly; if ether is to be allowed to trade freely in the market, so too must XRP, and if XRP is to be subject to restrictions, so too should ether.”  But ether and XRP weren’t treated the same way. Grundfest’s advice was ignored. (Deaton obtained the letter through the Freedom of Information Act and uploaded it to his website; you can read it here.) On January 1, 2021, nine days after the lawsuit against Ripple, Deaton filed his own action against the SEC. “I simply asked for the SEC to amend the complaint to only go after Ripple,” says Deaton, meaning the scope should just be Ripple Labs the company, not XRP the tokens. If the SEC targets XRP, says Deaton, then all they’re doing is “hurting innocent people who have no connection to Ripple.”  And those people were hurt. In the wake of the SEC’s lawsuit, the price of XRP tumbled to below 20 cents. Coinbase and other U.S. exchanges booted XRP from their listings. One analysis estimated a $15 billion loss of market value.  “It was devastating,” says a member of XRP Army who goes by the alias “James Rule XRP.” James is 56 years old, he has a friendly Texas accent, he used to work on an oil refinery, and he believes in the project so much that he converted his entire 401(k) into XRP. He hosts a daily YouTube show that’s mostly about XRP.  James was once -- briefly -- a crypto millionaire. In 2017, he bought the vanity license plate “XRP RICH.” He still believes in the project and he still expects to be XRP-rich, but as he says now, “I’m cash poor.” He now works at a Lowe’s hardware shop. (James is both humble and good-humored about his pivot to manual labor, saying he enjoys setting an example for his younger coworkers, even when “I’m sweating my ass off.”)  When Deaton filed his lawsuit against the SEC, he asked other XRP holders to join it. James hopped aboard. Then tweets about Deaton’s action ricocheted throughout XRP Army. Soon 2,000 XRP holders joined him. Then 5,000. There are now over 75,000 XRP holders part of Deaton’s claim, and he has been granted the official status of “amicus curiae” in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, loosely meaning that his perspective can be taken into consideration by the court.  Meanwhile, something kept bugging Deaton. If the lawsuit is indeed a weapon against Ripple, what’s the motivation? He did some sleuthing. He pulled the records on another key player in this saga, Bill Hinman, the SEC’s former Director of Corporate Finance. On June 14, 2018, Hinman gave a speech saying that bitcoin and ether -- the only two cryptocurrencies he mentioned -- were not securities. The speech, effectively, gave Bitcoin and Ethereum a “free pass.” For the next five years, many in the crypto space would dissect and parse that speech.  Why did Hinman single out Ethereum? “Jay Clayton would never talk about specific tokens. [Gary] Gensler, to this day, would never speak about specific tokens. Hester Pierce will never speak about specific tokens,” says Deaton. So why Hinman? “The cynic in me said, ‘I wonder if Hinman has any ties to Ethereum or Bitcoin.’”  So Deaton did more digging. And thanks to Twitter influencers like DAI and Kimes, the soldiers of XRP Army began to hunt for more evidence. Deaton called it “decentralized justice.” They found old videos from crypto conferences. They unearthed obscure footage from meet-ups. And they dragged up evidence that many in the Ethereum community, almost certainly, would prefer to leave under the carpet.  After pulling the disclosures that must be made by federal employees, Deaton found that “In less than four years at the SEC, [Bill Hinman] collected $15 million from Simpson Thacher.” Simpson Thacher is a law firm. This is relevant for two reasons: Hinman worked for Simpson Thacher before and after his tenure at the SEC; and Simpson Thacher was part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), a “member-led industry organization whose objective is to drive the use of Enterprise Ethereum.” And this is no longer just Deaton and the XRP Army making allegations. Empower Oversight, a non-profit watchdog devoted to government transparency, noted “clear conflicts of interest” and sued the SEC, demanding that any documents related to Simpson Thacher be revealed.  Perhaps the $15 million was just a juicy pension package. And perhaps this was just a coincidence. It’s also quite possible that the money was deferred compensation for work prior to his time at the SEC. But the XRP Army wonders, could $15 million help nudge Hinman’s decision-making to explicitly give Ethereum a free pass, but not XRP? (Hinman has subsequently denied being aware that Simpson Thacher was involved with the EEA when he was at the SEC, and a “person close to Hinman” told Fox Business that the $15 million was indeed just a generous pension package.)  XRP Army found more bits of evidence. There’s the video from early 2014, before the launch of Ethereum, where a young Vitalik Buterin answers questions about the “Ethereum IPO.” The XRP faithful see this as a smoking gun. How could XRP be a security and not Ethereum, when its most high-profile co-founder literally called the ICO a “fundraiser”? One bit of nuance here is that Hinman tacitly acknowledged the Ethereum ICO in his speech, saying “putting aside the fundraising,” ether is not a security; the XRP Army thinks that’s like saying “the Titanic was a lovely trip, putting aside the iceberg.”  On his website, Deaton has a meticulous timeline that makes the case for hypocrisy, double standards and conflicts of interest. This is the heartbeat of ETHGate. Deaton makes connections between early Ethereum boosters and companies like JP Morgan and Andreessen Horowitz, he suggests a pattern of coziness between Ethereum allies and the SEC, and he makes cold-eyed observations such as “ConsenSys was advised in its Quorum acquisition by Sullivan & Cromwell, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton’s former law firm. This was four months before the Ripple lawsuit was filed by the SEC.”  Then there’s the “whales video.” DAI points to another old video that XRP Army somehow discovered, which reveals a 2014 Silicon Valley meet-up with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. This was shortly before Ethereum’s ICO. Someone asks Lubin, “Will there be a limit on the amount a person can invest in Ethereum?”  Lubin’s response, which is audio-only in the video: “A person can buy from any number of different identities. We may limit the… unit size…But if you are a whale, and if you’re planning on investing several million U.S. dollars’ worth, then you can do that from multiple identities.”  The XRP Army finds this appalling. “These disguised whales bought boatloads of ether behind the scenes,” says DAI. “This is what they don’t want to talk about.” He says that the Ethereum founders love to tout their “decentralization,” but there were disguised whales buying large chunks of Ethereum from multiple anonymous identities, so “it was bullshit from the word go.” (CoinDesk reached out to Lubin to request a comment; he did not respond.)  There are different levels of beliefs in ETHGate. Some believe the SEC simply had a conflict of interest -- a bad look, but nothing sinister. Others think it’s the biggest financial story of the century; one soldier in XRP Army believes that “ETHGate is bigger than Enron.” Some suggest foul play. “I do believe it was used as a weapon,” says Kimes. “How the f*$k did they [the SEC] know to sue Ripple? Why wasn’t it one of those other f%$king companies?” His theory is that the Ethereum boosters feared XRP would be a real threat -- (what if there’s an XRP partnership with the Federal Reserve?) -- so they hobbled Ripple as a form of regulatory capture.  Deaton, Kimes, DAI, and the XRP Army believe they’ve already collected all the evidence they need to show a clear conflict of interest. But they think they’re on the verge of discovering a bombshell, something that could make their case undeniable: the “Hinman emails.”  When Hinman gave his fateful speech in 2018, the one that effectively gave bitcoin and ether a free pass, he likely had internal deliberations with his staff about how the SEC should approach Ethereum, XRP, and the rest of the cryptocurrencies. His emails and documents would shed light on that thinking. Deaton and the XRP Army has demanded that the SEC disclose those documents, almost as if they were crucial evidence in the JFK assassination; the SEC had refused. “We don’t know what’s in them until we see them,” says Kimes, but he suspects they will “range from shameful to criminal.”  Finally, in a victory for XRP and Ripple, the judge in the case, Analisa Torres, ordered that the Hinman documents be unsealed. They’re expected to be made public on June 13.  The larger crypto community, including crypto media, has mostly ignored or avoided this beef between the XRP community and Ethereum. Fox Business was one of the few outlets to cover it. “I do think there are glaring conflicts of interests,” says reporter Eleanor Terrett, who did her own extensive research and co-wrote the 9,000-word Fox Business story. “Whether there was corruption, I’m not the one to say.”  Terrett suspects the unseemly conflicts have more to do with the “revolving door” nature of government and the private sector, as it’s common (if problematic) for government officials to later collect fat paychecks from the very entities they once regulated. This is unfortunate but not criminal. Terrett later followed up via Twitter DM to say that on the other hand, it did strike her as notable that the SEC was so reluctant to reveal the documents, which means “you have to imagine there’s something the SEC doesn’t want the public to see in there.”  Team Ripple  So why does all of this matter?  On the most obvious level, as Grundfest once argued in his letter to the SEC, those who purchased XRP have seen their investments languish. That’s real money for real people – just ask a certain 56-year-old worker at a Texas Lowe’s hardware store. The SEC’s job is to protect investors; their lawsuit hurt investors. This is not trivial, as 4.5 million wallets contain XRP. And the lawsuit has cost Ripple Labs $200 million, according to Garlinghouse.  Going a bit deeper, the lawsuit has almost certainly hampered growth in the XRP Ledger ecosystem. “It affects us,” says Adam Kagy, the CEO of XRP Cafe, which is working to build an NFT platform on the XRP Ledger. “We just started looking for pre-seed funding, and a lot of the VCs are hesitant to dip their toes into the XRP ecosystem, because of that.” DAI argues that without the handcuffs of the SEC lawsuit, it might have been XRP -- not Ethereum -- that served as the hub for dapps and NFTs and innovation.  Your mileage will vary on how much you think Ripple was targeted for some malicious purpose. Not even all XRP enthusiasts are onboard. “I don’t believe that there’s some big conspiracy to keep down Ripple,” says XRP advocate and crypto social media influencer “Your Bro Quincy,” who spoke at the XRP Convention in Vegas.  But regardless of the motives, it seems fair to say that at the very least, at a bare minimum, the XRP Army has reasonable grounds to complain of a double standard by the SEC, which created an uneven playing field.  “I think the XRP Army is right to be annoyed that their scheme has been singled out,” says Preston Byrne, a crypto-focused lawyer at Brown Rudnick (Byrne, who writes regularly for CoinDesk, is known for his outspoken views). He believes the Ethereum Foundation, which oversees development of the second-blockchain, “fundamentally engaged in the same activity” as Ripple, which was to sell crypto tokens for profit in the U.S., so “there should have been similar consequences for those two schemes, and there just wasn’t.”  Giving further credence to XRP Army, Byrne adds that the SEC was targeted by a “huge marketing campaign from Ethereum promoters, and people with large quantities of Ethereum” so that the SEC would “leave it alone in the name of technology.” But there’s yet more nuance. Byrne adds that there are other reasons the SEC could have chosen to prosecute Ripple and not Ethereum, including that Ripple continues to sell XRP on secondary markets. “If you sell tokens in the market on January 1, and you’re not supposed to do that, bang, that’s a violation,” says Byrne. “If you do it again on March 10, bang, that’s another violation.” Because of these repeat offenses, says Byrne, “I think it was easier to pin the tail on Ripple.”  As for the grander conspiracy of ETHGate? Byrne, deadpan, says that “The part about ConsenSys being made up of lizard people is entirely true.” (ConsenSys is the Ethereum developer that Joe Lubin founded after co-creating Ethereum.)  The final plot twist is that the wider crypto community, which has for so long held its nose at XRP, is now beginning to root for Ripple. If Judge Torres rules that XRP is not a security, that could provide the clarity that the space has long coveted. Suddenly much of crypto is now Team Ripple.  “I've been critical of Ripple in the past…but more aligned with them than ever before,” Ryan Selkis, the CEO of Messari, said in March. “Ripple should win the overreaching XRP-SEC case, and the XRP Ledger should be afforded the opportunity to compete fairly on digital payments [infrastructure] globally. Demand is there!” Or as Forbes contributor Sam Lyman tweeted, “Right now, the XRPArmy is carrying all of crypto on its back.”  But there’s another way this could play out. Byrne suspects that the XRP Army might get what it’s been seeking all this time -- equal treatment as Ethereum -- but not quite in the way they expect. Be careful what you wish for. “Now it’s clear that Gensler is on the warpath and no one will be exempt,” says Byrne. “It’s pretty obvious that equal treatment will be applied across the board.” (I spoke to Byrne before the SEC slapped a lawsuit on Binance and then Coinbase; his “warpath” theory looks prescient.)  Instead of XRP being treated as a non-security like Ethereum, Byrne has a hunch that Ethereum (and virtually all other cryptocurrencies) will be treated as a security like XRP. He thinks there’s a 95% chance that Ripple loses the case. (He explained his logic more fully in a CoinDesk op-ed.) Byrne thinks that ultimately, the SEC has no choice but to follow the laws as they’re written by Congress. So the XRP Army should “save their fire not for Ethereum, but for Congress,” he says. “At the moment, that’s the framework we’ve got, and the SEC doesn’t have a choice.” Not every lawyer agrees with this interpretation, of course. John Deaton gives a counter-argument -- why XRP is not a security -- in an essay for Bloomberg Law.  Brad Kimes, the drummer, believes that Ripple will win. So does DAI and much of XRP Army. That certainly includes James, the Texan who literally bet his entire financial future on the fate of XRP. He predicts “double digits” for XRP’s price -- as in $10, or 20X where it is today -- if and when Ripple wins the case.  “I’m just a guy sitting at my kitchen table in Southeast Texas, looking out my window at cows and horses and chickens,” says James. “And I’m sitting here living so frugally, knowing that I’m going to have anything I want in the foreseeable future.”  UPDATE 6/14; 10:27 ET: Clarification added on the creation of XRP: ""Created largely by the team that co-founded Ripple, and originally envisioned by Jed McCaleb as ""bitcoin without mining,"" XRP has banks and corporations and the financial system in mind.""",POSITIVE,ETH | XRP | DAI,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | XRP | DAI,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/13/why-the-xrp-army-keeps-fighting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bb6f960197066a43f46e0817eafa571f6bcca28-2870x1554.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410425,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKg6l,1686666056,House Bill Shows Challenge of Regulating Crypto Without Giving TradFi a Free Pass,"A draft bill by House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) and Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn ""GT"" Thompson (R-PA) shows just how impossible it is to write crypto legislation that exempts tokens from securities laws while keeping traditional securities issuers regulated.  Many in the crypto industry cheered this discussion draft, including former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair and current crypto adviser Christopher Giancarlo, who called it a “landmark bill,” and Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, who said it was “a strong step forward” to legislating on financial regulators’ jurisdiction over crypto.  However, thanks to an appreciated effort to address potential regulatory arbitrage, the bill only creates new regulatory uncertainty.  Todd Phillips is the principal of Phillips Policy Consulting.  The debate over crypto assets is about whether a given token is an investment contract, and therefore a security, under the securities laws. Indeed, this is the basis for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.  The so-called Howey Test, which became a standard way of determining what assets are securities after the 1946 Supreme Court case SEC v. Howey Co., provides that an investment contract is a security if it is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others.  Importantly, because the Howey Test is the way that investment contracts are identified as securities, the SEC effectively cannot issue regulations that dictate whether or not a token is an investment contract. The courts would apply the Howey Test regardless.  Howie, who?  McHenry and Thompson attempt to sidestep the Howey Test entirely. Their bill would create a new asset class called “digital assets.” Digital assets can come in many forms, but two particularly important ones are “digital commodities” and “restricted digital assets.” In short, the legislation provides that crypto tokens will either be issued as digital commodities in the first instance, or as restricted digital assets that then “mature” into digital commodities after they become sufficiently decentralized.  Restricted digital assets are still securities under the Howey Test but would be exempted from significant parts of the securities laws. If a token issuance meets six qualifications defined under the bill, a more lenient set of disclosure requirements would apply. Once they mature into digital commodities, they would be exempted from the securities laws entirely.  This is where McHenry and Thompson falter. One of those six qualifications is that the sale of the digital asset cannot “involve the offer or sale of equity securities, debt securities, or debt securities convertible or exchangeable to equity interests.” In other words, cryptocurrencies cannot represent an ownership stake in a venture or be used like bonds to raise capital.  The purpose of this provision appears to be to prevent regulatory arbitrage. It would stop those entities that would normally issue stocks or bonds from avoiding the securities laws’ traditional requirements by offering crypto tokens instead.  Punting the question  But the bill does not define these terms. While equities are generally thought of as simply stock in corporations, the term “equity security” is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as “any stock or similar security … or any other security which the Commission shall deem to be of similar nature” (emphasis added).  In attempting to prevent regulatory arbitrage, the McHenry-Thompson bill would not at all solve the problems it attempts to address. Not only would the bill not affect the definition of “investment contract,” but it would have the SEC decide which of those tokens are equity or debt securities.  Given that the code governing many dapps [decentralized apps] and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) give token holders the same kinds of rights as stockholders in corporations, the SEC would deem most if not all crypto tokens that meet the Howey Test to be equities subject to traditional securities law disclosures.  Read more: A House Bill Would Make It Harder for the SEC to Argue Crypto Tokens Are Securities  Problems, plural  Other options to remove SEC discretion while preventing regulatory arbitrage would similarly fail. A bill that carves crypto out of the Howey Test would turn the securities laws from being technologically neutral to one that benefits blockchains over everything else.  A bill that defines equity securities as just “stocks” leaves it up to the courts to figure out what is a stock, resulting in a new judge-made test that – like the Howey Test – requires litigation before legal certainty. Or if equity securities are defined as being only issued by state-chartered legal entities, every company may decide to convert to a DAO that retains the same governance structure as before.  There are a number of other problems with the bill, not the least of which is that it would grant significant new jurisdiction to the CFTC without also providing it with new funding. The bill also appears to exempt DeFi exchanges from complying with the same investor protection provisions as CeFi exchanges. And the CFTC would also be permitted to retroactively or prospectively exempt large swaths of the digital commodity markets from McHenry and Thompson’s customer protection provisions, making the bill’s regulation of exchanges and brokers optional.  The biggest problem, however, is with regulatory arbitrage. While Chairs McHenry and Thompson have endeavored to craft a bill that gives crypto assets a way out of the securities laws, their legislation – like others before it – shows just how impossible it is to do without giving issues of traditional securities a new way to opt-out of those laws as well.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | GT,Todd Phillips,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/13/house-bill-shows-challenge-of-regulating-crypto-without-giving-tradfi-a-free-pass,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac67869cdb63df405867fc280640567b4e0d6a5d-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance.US criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) motion for a temporary restraining order, describing it as draconian and unduly burdensome. The exchange also voiced opposition, arguing that the proposed measures would place excessive restrictions and “effectively end” its business.

Closure Of BAM Trading Services Inc. Would Harm Customers And Inhibit The Defense, Binance.US In a recent opposing motion, Binance.US expressed that implementing the restraining order would result in the closure of BAM Trading Services Inc., the entity responsible for providing crypto trading and exchange services for Binance.US. “The requested relief would primarily harm BAM’s customers, effectively put BAM out of business, and prevent BAM from defending itself in this litigation,” said the company. Binance believes operations would ‘quickly grind to a halt’ without the ability to pay its employees and professionals in the ordinary course of business, and BAM would be unable to even fund its ‘defense’ to this action. Binance.US notably criticized the regulator’s approach in pursuing legal action, asserting that the US SEC failed to identify any security trading on BAM’s platform, causing all of the SEC’s claims to fail. In addition, Binance.US stated that it had actively engaged in cooperation with an ongoing SEC investigation that commenced on December 20, 2020. The filing reveals that as a result of this investigation, Binance.US has provided over 700,000 individual communications and specific data related to its day-to-day operations. This statement suggests that the company has shown efforts to be transparent and responsive to the SEC’s inquiries. It also indicates a willingness to comply and provide the necessary information during the investigative process. SEC Accuses CZ Of Moving $12 Billion In Funds And Seeks Asset Freeze On June 5, the US SEC made a significant move by filing 13 charges against Binance entities and its founder, Changpeng Zhao. The charges were related to the operation of unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies, among others. The regulator also alleged that the crypto exchange allowed US customers to engage in such trading, further violating securities laws. In addition to the charges, the SEC claimed that Binance CEO had access to the exchange’s customer funds, alleging he orchestrated the movement of $12 Billion through a privately-controlled entity, Merit Peak. The following day, on June 6, the SEC filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order against Binance, further intensifying its efforts. The motion was intended to stop any transactions or movements of money on Binance.US. This legal action marked a pivotal moment in the popular cryptocurrency exchange’s regulatory scrutiny.

A number of emails tied to the one-time Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman’s 2018 speech saying Ether did not look like a security were published Tuesday by Ripple in its ongoing defense against an SEC lawsuit alleging the company illegally sold XRP tokens as an unregistered security for over seven years. The emails were published alongside an updated motion for summary judgment.  XRP’s price spiked after the emails were initially released.  The emails show SEC officials deliberating about how clear the speech actually was in expressing a view that ether (ETH) was not a security.  Read More: Why the XRP Army Keeps Fighting  “As written, the language remains vague as to whether ETH is a security. If you want to make an affirmative statement that it is not a security, the language could be stronger (i.e., just say it). If you don't want to take an affirmative stance, we suggest using language similar to what you used for Bitcoin re. the disclosure regime to make it more consistent,” wrote former SEC Director of Trading and Markets Brett Redfearn on June 12, 2018.  Redfearn left comments in a proposed draft of the speech further emphasizing that point, saying parts of it “appear likely to create more confusion about the status of ETH.”  Valerie Szczepanik, the current head of the SEC’s FinHub group, wrote in an earlier email dated May 25, 2018 that she believed “the less detail the better,” referring to what appears to be one of the earliest drafts of the speech.  “This is introducing a concept, that will probably generate much discussion, and so leaving room for that discussion is good I think,” she wrote.  This earlier version of the speech did not mention ether at all, though it did reference bitcoin.  A June 12 email from Laura Jarsulic, an attorney with the SEC’s Office of General Counsel, referenced the landmark Supreme Court case commonly used as a test for determining whether something is a security even today – SEC v. W. J. Howey Co. In that case, the SEC sued Howey on allegations that his selling trees in orange groves promising a future return violated securities law.  Jarsulic suggested an edit clarifying that the Supreme Court ruled that purchasers who bought trees but did not buy investment contracts did not purchase securities.  “The Court found that only the purchase of land and service contract was the purchase of a security (those who bought land only had not purchased a security),” another suggestion read.  Further down, Jarsulic wrote in a suggestion that there could be situations where a token is indeed a security – for example, if a company issues tokens instead of shares.  Several of the officials’ emails suggested tying the speech closer to the Howey Test. The emails also indicated that SEC officials met with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, apparently to discuss the Ethereum Foundation's role.

In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple on allegations that the firm sold unregistered securities. Ripple has historically maintained a distance from XRP, the token that powers some of its products and the XRP Ledger network. But any progress in the case has an impact on XRP prices.  On Tuesday, after publishing the emails, Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty tweeted that “We now can all see Hinman ignored multiple warnings that his speech contained made-up analysis with no basis in law, was divorced from the Howey factors, exposed regulatory gaps, and would create not just confusion, but ‘greater confusion’ in the market.”  The SEC declined to comment on the matter.

42393315,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOkHD,1686663008,"U.S. SEC Out-of-Bounds in Dragging DeFi Into Proposed Exchange Rule, Industry Says","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to stretch how it identifies exchanges it needs to regulate, and the agency’s inbox is jammed with crypto industry letters accusing it of reaching well beyond its legal powers and potentially forcing rules on services the platforms need, such as electric companies.  The most recent re-write of the agency’s exchange proposal in April would explicitly absorb decentralized finance (DeFi) into the world of exchanges subject to SEC rules and oversight, arguing that an updated rule would help modernize the securities regulator’s approach to the changing markets. The SEC set a Tuesday deadline for public input.  But crypto industry advocates and lobbyists argue that the new rule – if finalized – would violate the First Amendment rights of coders and would double down on what they see as the SEC’s ongoing error of failing to treat this sector as something new.  “The proposal would operate as a blanket de facto banishment of DeFi from the United States,” the DeFi Education Fund, a lobbying group, wrote in its comment letter. “The actions and words of the commission and agency personnel have created great confusion.”  The agency’s proposal suggests that protocols designed to bring together buyers and sellers of securities – so-called communication protocol systems – now perform a similar enough role to exchanges that they should be regulated as such.  “Investors in the crypto markets must receive the same time-tested protections that the securities laws provide in all other markets,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler, when the SEC voted to release the latest version of the proposed rule in April.  However, DeFi protocols “intuitively possess none of the defining hallmarks of stock exchanges,” according to the DeFi Education Fund’s letter. “Beyond DeFi, the commission’s proposal has no logical limit and would sweep third-party and utility service providers who contract with exchange providers into the exchange regulatory regime.”  That could pull key outside services into the SEC’s web, such as messaging services and the utility companies that provide electricity to platforms, the group argued.  Crypto investment firm Paradigm weighed in to defend decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that don’t have the centralized management the securities rules are accustomed to dealing with.  “It thus appears that after suing Coinbase for failing to do the impossible – registering as a securities exchange when it was incapable of doing so – the commission now intends to force DEXs into the same Hobson’s choice,” the company argued, invoking the recent SEC enforcement action that accused Coinbase (COIN) of running an illegal exchange. “The newfound definition of ‘exchange’ is so far-reaching that it would facially encompass entities that are plainly nothing like exchanges.”  And Coin Center, a research group that supports the cryptocurrency movement, warned of the proposal’s danger to those who write and publish software – including the potential that the government could go after coders who advocate for political positions.  “The vagueness and breadth of the proposed standard affords the SEC near unlimited discretion to pick and choose targets for enforcement,” the Coin Center letter contended. “The SEC could easily use the proposed vague standard to target certain publishers of open source software who advocate for the use of that software for certain political ends.”  Read More: SEC Lays Its Cards on the Table With Assertion That DeFi Falls Under Securities Rules",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/13/us-sec-out-of-bounds-in-dragging-defi-into-proposed-exchange-rule-industry-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4ef8a0eb80ee896e23472e49b72e2142bf13031-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13767745,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537631,1686661257,"Chainlink (LINK) Whale Transfers Spike, Bearish Sign?","On-chain data shows that Chainlink (LINK) whales have become quite active in recent days, a sign that may be bearish for the asset’s price. Chainlink Whale Transactions Have Shot Up In Number Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whale transactions hit a 2023 high just as the price dipped toward the $5 mark. The “whale transaction count” is an indicator that keeps track of the number of Chainlink transfers taking place on the blockchain that involve the movement of tokens worth at least $1 million in value. When the value of this metric is high, it means that there are a large number of sizeable LINK transactions occurring on the network right now. Generally, transfers worth more than $1 million are thought to be coming from the whales, so this kind of trend can be a sign that the whales are active currently. On the other hand, the low values of the indicator imply the whales aren’t making that many moves at the moment. As whale transactions are quite large in scale, a lot of them happening at once can cause fluctuations in the market. Thus, a lack of them happening (that is, low values) can result in a more stable market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink whale transaction counts over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink whale transaction count saw a couple of spikes during the last week or so. This would hint that whales of the cryptocurrency may have been actively trading in this period. These high values of the indicator took place simultaneously with the asset’s price sliding down and hitting a three-year low of around $5, implying that at least some of the transactions may have been made for selling-related purposes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Historically Tight Range, Calm Before The Storm? Interestingly, the whale activity continued to remain elevated even after the coin hit its $5 local bottom and saw a rebound. In fact, the largest of the metric’s spikes, which set a new high for the year 2023, came just as Chainlink bottomed out. The timing of this extreme elevation in the whale transactions may be a sign that some of these humongous investors saw the dip as a profitable buying opportunity and participated in some accumulation, leading to the price being able to rebound. In the chart, Santiment has also displayed the trend in the supplies of the investor groups holding between 1,000-10,000 LINK and 10,000-100,000 LINK. Both these cohorts seem to have done some buying recently as their supplies have shot up, implying that market-wide buying may have taken place at the lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Sell At 3rd Largest Scale Ever Since the bottom, however, Chainlink has only seen a minute increase as it’s still trading quite near the low itself. Whale transactions are also still at higher-than-average levels for the year, and it’s hard to say what behavior these investors may be showing this time. Naturally, if the whales are still selling, then LINK might see further bearish price action in the near future.

13767830,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/polygon-introduces-version-2-0-calls-it-the-value-layer-of-the-internet,1686661200,Polygon Introduces Version 2.0,"Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution Polygon (MATIC) has unveiled its Version 2.0, the blueprint for which will be revealed over the next few weeks. The layer-2 scaling solution is calling its latest iteration the “value layer of the internet.” The Blueprint For Polygon 2.0 According to a blog post published by Polygon, it will be revealing the blueprint over the next few weeks. It would also address several topics, including the future of the Polygon Proof-of-Stake chain, the utility and evolution of Polygon’s token, and the transition to greater community governance and involvement when it comes to the protocol and treasury. The blog post stated, “Over the coming weeks, we will detail each component of Polygon 2.0, addressing topics like the future of the Polygon PoS chain, the utility and evolution of the Polygon token, and the transition to greater community governance of the protocol and treasury. We will lay out a roadmap for how Polygon will become the Value Layer of the Internet, offering unlimited scalability and unified liquidity via ZK technology.” The Value Layer Of The Internet Polygon added that its vision behind creating the “value layer of the internet,” as it calls Polygon 2.0, is to enable digital ownership, decentralized finance (DeFi), and new means for coordination. Polygon 2.0 will consist of a network of zero-knowledge (ZK) layer 2 chains. These chains will be able to communicate seamlessly among themselves, giving users the feeling that they are using a single chain. The blog post highlighted the limitations of individual blockchains when it comes to throughput. “Individual blockchains aren’t infinitely scalable; they have strict throughput limits. We can add capacity by creating new chains, but not without fragmenting liquidity and reducing security and capital efficiency.” According to the blog post, Polygon 2.0 could support an unlimited number of chains, enabling cross-chain interactions to occur seamlessly, securely, and instantly. “Polygon 2.0 is a network of ZK-powered L2 chains, unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol. For a user, the entire network will feel like using a single chain. The network can support a practically unlimited number of chains, and cross-chain interactions can happen safely and instantly, without additional security or trust assumptions. Unlimited scalability and unified liquidity.” Version 2.0 Rollout Polygon 2.0 has been created after collaboration between Polygon Labs, researchers, developers, node operators, validators, applications, and the larger Ethereum and Polygon communities. Polygon plans to detail all the components of Version 2.0 over the next few weeks through a series of podcasts, community meets, blog posts, and AMAs. The protocol also highlighted a series of important dates for the community to follow over the next four weeks, on which it will make a series of announcements related to the blockchain’s architecture, token, and governance. The only chain from Polygon that incorporates ZK technology is the Polygon zkEVM Beta, which was released to the public in March. ZK technology is a type of scaling solution that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to reduce transaction fees and help blockchains scale. While Polygon’s primary Proof-of-Stake chain is not ZK-compatible, the protocol is exploring the possibility of incorporating ZK technology into its primary chain.

42393301,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOjRv,1686660860,"Uniswap Labs Releases Its Plan for Uniswap v4, Invites Community Feedback","Uniswap Labs, the team behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) juggernaut Uniswap, announced its vision for the next iteration of its crypto exchange platform: Uniswap v4.  For the first time ever, Uniswap Labs is inviting community feedback on Uniswap v4 before its public launch. This strategy, focused on community input, is meant to underscore Uniswap's dedication to decentralization. It is a key difference meant to separate the decentralized exchange (DEX) from centralized exchanges (CEX), such as Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, which are currently facing lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Uniswap is generally credited for popularizing automated market makers (AMM), a type of blockchain-based computer program, or ""smart contract,"" that facilitates trades between cryptocurrencies without the use of intermediaries.  Uniswap v3, the platform's latest version, debuted in 2021 on the Ethereum blockchain and has since expanded to multiple additional networks. As of now, Uniswap v3 is the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume, having processed over $1 trillion in transactions since its inception, according to DefiLlama.  With the v4 upgrade, the developer plans to expand on the DEX's coin-swapping capabilities with the introduction of “hooks” and custom liquidity pools. In a blog post published on Tuesday, Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams described hooks as “plugins to customize how pools, swaps, fees, and LP positions interact.”  According to Adams, the new functionality could pave the way for things like on-chain limit orders and dynamic fees – features that might be available on more traditional exchange platforms but are harder to implement in a blockchain setting, where there are no intermediaries or centralized order books.  Adams also indicated that the draft code for Uniswap v4 will introduce performance improvements and fee reductions. Uniswap is permissionless, meaning anyone can create ""pools"" to facilitate the buying and selling of compatible crypto tokens. Under the v4 proposal, Adams says the network gas fees required to list new pools will be sliced by 99%.  The proposed licensing model for Uniswap v4 is the Business Source License 1.1, the same license used by Uniswap v3. This license delays competitors from using Uniswap’s codebase to create their own applications as several popular DEX use slightly modified versions of Uniswap’s codebase to power their systems.  Uniswap Labs, which secured a $165 million Series B last year, is releasing its proposed Uniswap v4 plans to garner public feedback. According to Adams, it could be several months before Uniswap v4 launches to the public.

The SEC recently filed lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, two of the leading centralized crypto exchanges. These platforms offer many of the same features as Uniswap, but process trades on traditional computer servers rather than decentralized blockchains.

However, the SEC previously signaled its intention to increase oversight of the DeFi ecosystem. Notably, assets deemed securities by the SEC in its recent CEX lawsuits can currently be traded on Uniswap, and the platform was the subject of a 2021 SEC probe according to a Wall Street Journal report.

A capitulation event cannot be ruled out, especially if unemployment rises rapidly and the Yield Curve un-inverts. As expected, Altcoins underperformed Bitcoin during the first half of the year, and I continue to anticipate the Bitcoin dominance to keep rising. Macroeconomic stage setting The first half of 2023 is over, and who would have thought: the economy seems to be resilient despite much higher interest rates. Even housing appears less affected than most market participants expected. Inflation is slowly declining, and the market is steadily climbing the wall of worry as no disruptions continue to impact the economy. Interestingly, mainstream media is starting to declare the beginning of a new bull market, with AI as a new narrative to feed the masses. Investor sentiment has shifted from overly bearish to neutral, and significant short-covering began last week. Despite all that, virtually every yield curve is still inverted, pointing towards turmoil in the not-so-distant future – the point where they steepen into positive territory. Beneath the surface, market breadth suggests that the recent rally is short-lived, as most investors flock to only the largest and safest companies. Credit conditions remain unfavorable, as banks have tightened loan standards, limiting future investment opportunities and impeding growth. We are entering a phase of flatlining Fed funds at restrictive levels, which will only reverse if the unemployment rate increases significantly. Historically, this is not a positive sign in the grand scheme of things. Fed Funds (blue) / Unemployment Rate (orange) (Author using Excel) This month, I will release another article focusing on these macroeconomic and cyclical factors in much more detail. I wanted to include a short summary in this article as they have a significant impact on crypto assets too. A Review of My Expectations for Crypto in 2023 With the recent allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Coinbase ( COIN ) and Binance (BNB-USD), I believe it is important to provide an update on my outlook for crypto and Bitcoin (BTC-USD). In my previous article on January 17 titled "" Bitcoin: Boredom Is Bullish in 2023 ,"" I strongly argued in favor of positioning for a prolonged accumulation phase throughout 2023. Personally, I sold all of my crypto assets in April 2022, except for some Bitcoin. The idea behind this decision was that a period of boredom and disinterest would present a good opportunity to Dollar-Cost Average and gradually build up a position again, aiming to profit from the next liquidity cycle, which I believe to start in 2024 - 2025. I have adhered to this plan for now, solely accumulating Bitcoin. Entries & Exits by the Author (Author using Tradingview.com) The risk of further contagion in the crypto industry has not yet manifested itself in terms of additional bankruptcies. However, with the recent SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, it can be argued that the shoe is starting to drop: The contagion risks for the Crypto Industry still pose a threat after the Luna-Terra failure initiated a collateral crash, and several Crypto Lenders, Miners, and Exchanges went bankrupt. Only a few people know about the liquidity levels of the currently operating businesses. Most of the time, it’s a black hole (e.g. Binance). Time will tell if there is another shoe to drop. - Jan 17. 2023, Nikolai Galozi The silent rise in Bitcoin dominance continues At the start of the year I also suggested that Bitcoin should outperform the Altcoin market. Usually, during a downturn of the crypto market, the safest assets outperform on a relative basis. The Bitcoin dominance (market cap of Bitcoin / market cap of all crypto assets) increases during a bear market due to the heightened downside risks associated with smaller, riskier, and more centralized projects. As anticipated, the Bitcoin dominance, excluding stablecoins, saw a significant increase from around 46% at the start of 2023 to approximately 54% as of last week. Bitcoin Dominance ex Stablecoins (Author using Tradingview.com) The significance of this move should not be underestimated because Bitcoin managed to outperform while moving higher in Dollar terms. As of now, Bitcoin is up 55 % YTD vs. the US-Dollar. The crypto market can be thought of as Bitcoin on leverage, most of the time. As a result, Altcoins tend to outperform on the way up but underperform on the way down. However, the significant underperformance of Altcoins in the first half of 2023 occurred alongside Bitcoin's sharp rise, indicating a high level of uncertainty priced into the markets. This is akin to the negative market breadth dynamics observed in stocks and bonds. The flight to safety is evident in the outperformance of the largest capitalized assets. The Bitcoin dominance reached its peak at approximately 72% in September 2019, following the bursting of the Initial Coin Offering ((ICO)) bubble in 2018. Historical trends suggest that the dominance gradually recedes over time as new projects unlock different use cases (although this is debatable). In this cycle, I believe a reasonable target for the peak of Bitcoin dominance remains within the range of 60-65%. Altcoins are expected to continue underperforming from this point forward, especially considering the new regulatory risks stemming from the SEC. The SEC charges solidify the Altcoin underperformance Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Coinbase, alleging that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The forthcoming lawsuit will determine whether the majority of Altcoins listed on Coinbase are considered securities or commodities. In my opinion, the SEC has compelling arguments to classify many Altcoins as securities and subject them to regulation. Applying the Howey Test from 1946, which defines a security as a transaction involving a) an investment of money, b) in a common enterprise, c) with an expectation of profit, and d) derived from the efforts of others, it appears that points a), c), and d) are applicable to almost every crypto asset. Point b) can be ruled out if sufficient decentralization exists, which is why the SEC has clarified that Bitcoin is not considered a security. However, I believe that most Altcoins are centralized enough to be defined as securities in the United States, with some grey areas such as Ethereum (ETH-USD). On the other hand, it is very questionable whether a test from 1946 is suitable for evaluating blockchain technology, and ideally, a completely new regulatory framework should be established. Similar allegations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency have been made against Binance. However, Binance also faces more serious charges, including commingling customer funds, diverting customer assets, and market manipulation. While Binance remains a black hole, I find it unlikely that the SEC would make such charges without substantial evidence. I believe the significance of Binance as a crypto exchange and platform will diminish going forward, and it remains to be seen if Binance has sufficient liquidity to accommodate all investor withdrawals. In the long run, a default cannot be ruled out. As an investor, I do not hold a personal opinion on the charges. However, they represent an additional risk factor, particularly for Altcoins. Regulatory scrutiny from the United States was predictable following the downfall of FTX (FTT-USD) in 2022. The underperformance of Altcoins in a bear market, irrespective of news flow, should not come as a surprise. The risks associated with holding crypto assets directly on unregulated exchanges are well-known. By overweighting Bitcoin and implementing proper risk management during the current crypto winter, the majority of the drawdown in crypto assets during the last week could have been avoided. Returns of various Coins during the last month (Author using Tradingview.com) Green: Ethereum and Bitcoin. Bitcoin is classified as a commodity and Ethereum remains in a grey area. Red: Some of the biggest Altcoins mentioned in SEC charges against Binance and Coinbase and labeled as securities. Avalanche (AVAX-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), Binance Coin (BNB-USD), Polygon (MATIC-USD), Cosmos (ATOM-USD), COTI (COTI-USD), Dash (DASH-USD), Internet Computer (ICP-USD). The significant underperformance is self-explanatory. I’d be cautious about the major Ether outperformance, as the relative risk in comparison to Bitcoin given the price performance is much higher, in my opinion. Therefore I will continue to simply accumulate Bitcoin for the remainder of 2023, as long as the Bitcoin dominance continues to rise. The Alleged “Halving Cycle” Traditionally, the recurring four-year cycles observed in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market were attributed to the halving of the mining reward. Initially, miners were rewarded with 50 BTC per block. The rate at which new Bitcoin is mined is halved approximately every four years or every 210,000 blocks, until the total supply of 21 million Bitcoins is reached. It's important to note that the difficulty adjustment ensures that, regardless of the amount of computing power connected to mining, an average block will be mined every 10 minutes, which is why the timing of the cycle remains predictable. It is a common misconception that increased computing power results in more BTC being mined. The amount of Bitcoin mined is programmed and cannot be influenced by computing power in the long run. The previous halving events occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Each time, the mining reward was halved from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in 2012, then to 12.5 BTC in 2016, and further reduced to 6.25 BTC in 2020. The next halving is expected to take place in 2024, reducing the mining reward to 3,125 BTC per block. Bitcoin Halvings (Author using Tradingview.com) The impact of halvings is a reduction in the supply of Bitcoin, which, according to the common narrative, increases its rarity and acts as a catalyst for the rise in Bitcoin's price. Increasing prices stimulate speculation, and during the bubble phase of the cycle, the Altcoin market tends to outperform. Eventually, the bubble bursts, crypto is deemed as dead, and Altcoins underperform. Rinse and repeat. Each halving gets less relevant each time, as more Bitcoin come into existence with each block and the gap between already mined Bitcoin and the cap of 21 million BTC closes. That is one way of explaining the diminishing returns. However, the halving theory only considers the supply side. In my opinion, the demand for Bitcoin is far more important as halvings become progressively less significant. While halvings may act as a catalyst, they do not significantly alter the fundamental supply and demand dynamics going forward. The depreciation of the denominator, or the decline in the value of traditional fiat currencies, is much more important as it drives the demand for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is not a currency. Bitcoin is not scalable. Bitcoin is not the Crypto Industry with all its useless financial schemes and stupid leverage. Bitcoin is a decentralized monetary debasement hedge. An opportunity to leave the vicious cycle that is the long-term debasement of the currency without the possibility of government interventions (e.g. Gold in 1933 under Roosevelt). It is no coincidence that Bitcoin appeared just after the global financial crisis, when the monetary debasement circus started getting out of hand.- Jan 17. 2023, Nikolai Galozi If central banks buy government debt en masse to fund the deficit and keep real rates in negative territory, the denominator gets devalued and asset price inflation elevates not only bonds, but stocks, house prices, et al. Bitcoin was designed to act as a hedge in this scenario. When plotting the Year-over-Year returns of Bitcoin against the Global growth of M2, the correlation is strikingly accurate. Bitcoin & Global M2 (refinitiv.com) Bitcoin was created in January 2009, but it wasn't until 2012 that a liquid market for BTC emerged. Given its limited price history of only eleven years, it is challenging to attribute Bitcoin's price performance solely to the halvings. Additionally, monetary expansion coincided with the halvings. To my belief it was the monetary expansion and the debasement of the currency which fueled demand for risk assets, i.e. increased asset price inflation. With the programmed scarcity of Bitcoin and the purpose of hedging asset price inflation it profited the most from the debasement. In my opinion, the halvings are an increasingly unimportant catalyst for price discovery. However, it is worth noting that the next major upswing in global M2 money supply could potentially align with the halving in April 2024 again, as the leading macroeconomic data suggests a slowing of the economy and therefore consumer price inflation. Key Takeaways My base case for 2023 remains unchanged. I expect a dull year with neutral returns for Bitcoin. Therefore I expect a deeply red H2/2023. I continue to stack Sats and avoid any Altcoins during this bear market. I don’t believe we have reached a major inflection point for monetary debasement as global central banks should be hindered by receding (but still ‘too elevated’) consumer price inflation. A capitulation event seems likely if unemployment rapidly picks up. The last crypto tourists are surely gone now, after the major drawdown of Bitcoin and the devasting returns of Altcoins (more like destruction). They will likely be back in a few years from now, when liquidity has improved, and asset price inflation is ramping up again. In the meantime, I will continue to accumulate my positions.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611174-bitcoin-the-appeal-of-enduring-boredom?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13766876.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Social investing platform eToro will delist a selection of crypto tokens for its U.S. customers in a month's time in response to recent legal action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). From July 12, U.S. customers will no longer be able to open new positions in the tokens of Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Dash (DASH) and Polygon (MATIC), eToro announced on Monday. However, customers will still be able to hold and sell existing positions in these tokens. The crypto platform cited ""recent developments"" as the reason for the move, referring to the SEC's legal action against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, in which the regulator claimed certain cryptocurrencies were securities.  Market makers and traders are fleeing Binance.US en masse following last week’s SEC lawsuit against it alleging multiple securities violations.Liquidity, which is measured by aggregated market depth for 17 tokens on Binance.US, has dropped 76% since, according to a report by Kaiko. The day before the June 5 lawsuit, market depth was at $34 million, whereas on Monday, it had plunged to $7 million, said the report. The exchange also saw its U.S. market share drop to 4.8% from 20% in April. Binance global also witnessed a drop in market depth, dipping 7% since the start of June, said Kaiko.  Members of the U.K. digital asset space seem to largely support a proposal by the country’s financial watchdog to move companies away from promoting crypto as an inflation hedge. The popular argument that limited-supply cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) can hold firm against rising price levels may be theoretically sound, but due to a lack of data combined with the volatility of crypto assets, it can also mislead investors, industry observers told CoinDesk. Issued last Thursday, the FCA’s tough rules to govern crypto promotional material in the U.K. include a ban on free non-fungible tokens (NFT) giveaways and airdrops. In guidance accompanying the rules, the regulator issued guidance for stablecoin issuers, saying firms should be able to “demonstrate claims of stability or links to a fiat currency.”  Chart of The Day  The chart shows monthly trading volume in crypto market since early 2020.  Activity cooled in May with total volume across 18 centralized exchanges falling to lowest since 2020.

Although the Solana blockchain witnessed numerous shutdowns in 2022, the network has bounced back with several new developments in 2023 which could push SOL, its native token towards the $25 price level. Meanwhile, Tradecurve, a promising DeFi project, is poised for another huge price surge of about 50% as investors show huge interest in its token presale. Solana (SOL) Price To Reach $25 Solana has been on an upward trajectory, surpassing the $20 mark as it shows strong momentum. Factors contributing to its recent price gains include increased user engagement, notable upgrades such as the ChatGPT plugin integration, and positive remarks from the project's co-founder. Presently, Solana faces a resistance level of $21.40, which, if breached, could potentially propel the cryptocurrency toward a significant price rally, targeting the $25 price level. Trading expert Jimie (@Your_NLP_Coach) identifies the next resistance level at $26, emphasizing the need for Solana's price to close above $21.3 to confirm further upward movement. Other market analysts have predicted that if Solana (SOL) breaks out of this resistance, the token could experience a 28% rally. If this happens, the price of Solana (SOL) could be priced as high as $28 in the next few weeks. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Solana is trading at $20.20, a 1.20% increase in the last 24 hours. Tradecurve (TCRV) Price Could Increase Another 50% As the bullish sentiment surrounding Solana increases, traders are preparing to test the resistance level at $21.50. Tradecurve is already in the midst of a bull market. In May, which was a bearish month for the crypto market, Tradecurve's governance token, TCRV, experienced a remarkable 50% surge amidst a spike in interest from both retail and institutional investors. Expert analysts even project that June could bring another rally for Tradecurve. Multiple factors could help TCRV record another 50% price hike. One of them is its utility. Also, Tradecurve is building a decentralized platform that will offer users access to different trading markets like cryptocurrencies, forex, CFDs, commodities, and stocks. These markets have huge potential and high trading volume. According to IMARC impactful insights, the global foreign exchange (FX) market was valued at $ 753.2 Billion in 2022. As the utility token that offers Tradecurve holders benefits like governance rights, staking rewards, and discounts on fees, TCRV has been primed to benefit from the growth of the platform. In addition to the 50% rally, experts foresee the price of the token increasing by as much as 100x when the platform hits the global market. Currently, TCRV is valued at $0.015 per token, presenting a promising investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their market portfolio and grow their assets.

Tradecurve is unaffected by the move, and the price is set to rise soon. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Bitcoin price action Although the entire crypto market is down, including Bitcoin, BTC is the only coin that SEC chair Gary Gensler does not think is a security, based on the way the coins were mined and the level of decentralization. Nevertheless, Bitcoin still reacted to the news of the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits, on the 6th of June. Bitcoin’s price fell as low as $25,600, before rebounding to $27,216, correcting again, and is now going back up, and is currently trading at $26,666. Based on the ongoing price action, Bitcoin exhibits a robust support level around $25,000, which closely aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level derived from the rally spanning $10,000 to $65,000. Upholding its current level may catalyze a rebound, prompting Bitcoin to test resistance levels positioned at $30,000, $35,000, and $40,000. However, breaching this threshold could instigate a further sell-off, potentially pushing Bitcoin down to $20,000 or below. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Ethereum - shaken but not stirred (too much) Ethereum was notably absent from the list of crypto currencies declared a security, and similarly saw a price reaction, falling to $1806 after the news, rebounding to $1895, and is, at time of writing, sitting at $1844. Therefore, just as we have seen support for Bitcoin, Ethereum demonstrates a comparable support level around $1,800 where the bulls jumped in, in proximity to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level obtained from the surge in its history from $300 to $4,400. If Ethereum upholds this level, it could trigger a recovery, propelling Ethereum towards resistance levels situated at $2,000, $2,500, and $3,000. Conversely, if this threshold is breached, Ethereum may experience a decline towards $1,500 or lower. Tradecurve presents a solution needed now more than ever In the wake of the SEC’s targeting of two of the biggest centralized exchanges, a new solution is needed. DEXes like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Curve have experienced huge inflows of money as people look to store and trade their crypto on-chain. However, although some of those exchanges offer things like leverage, none of them offer a professional trading terminal. Furthermore trades can be slow and slippage and spreads are sometimes quite high. Tradecurve is the answer here as it offers everything that these DEXes lack, and more, using its hybrid exchange model, and built on the Ethereum blockchain. Leverage of 500:1 is available by using crypto as collateral. Those who are worried about the recent attacks on centralized exchanges will be happy to know that as Tradecurve is built on the blockchain, it means your crypto is kept in your decentralized wallet, so no governmental agency can take it from you. As they are based outside of the US, they are not subject to the rules and regulations stipulated by the SEC, and as such, KYC free trading is possible. This gives freedom and anonymity to traders, in a world that the SEC is increasingly trying to control. TCRV is currently in presale at $0.015, having increased by 50% since stage 1. 50% is the magic number right now, or so it seems, as stage 3 is currently halfway sold out. The next stage of the presale will see it increase to $0.018. Crypto experts are predicting a rise of 80-100% after it leaves stage 8 of the presale.

SEC: Hinman Docs Are Out, XRP Is Up 8%","The eagerly awaited “Hinman documents” in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been published today! After the XRP price initially reacted moderately, the altcoin experienced a rise of about 6% at the time of writing. Just yesterday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that the Hinman docs will be worth the wait. He was alluding to their potential importance of the documents for the ongoing legal battle. And XRP investors seem to agree with him, although not all community members are euphoric. Ripple Vs. SEC: This Is What The Hinman Docs Reveal Bill Morgan, a popular lawyer in the XRP community, declared that Stuart Alderoty (Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, CLO) and Brad Garlinghouse “were not exaggerating”. According to him, “#Ethgate is alive and kicking after all.” The documents reveal that Bill Hinman, the former director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC, involved Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin before his notorious speech in which he classified ETH as a non-security. Related Reading: XRP Could Be Set For A Breakout As Investment Inflows Continue In the run-up to his speech, Hinman called Buterin to confirm how Ethereum operates. The SEC’s internal documents also reveal that on May 31, 2018, opposition grew within the SEC to the recommendation to classify Ether with Bitcoin as a non-security. On June 4, Hinman shared a draft of his speech with the commission’s division directors. The document reveals that Hinman was planning his call with Buterin later that week. Nevertheless, the SEC’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) suggested deleting the mention of ETH in the draft. The OGC was concerned about the difficulties it would face if it took a different position on Ether in the future. As is well known, Hinman disobeyed this directive and made ETH a focal point of his speech. This is one reason why respected XRP community member Mr Huber is rather disappointed. According to him, the emails are a “nothing burger.” They only prove that Hinman was persistently warned to avoid any references to Ethereum to avoid market confusion. “Despite these warnings, Hinman not only neglected this advice and even doubled down, focusing his entire speech on giving ETH a regulatory monopoly. Such a clumsy director,” writes Mr Huber, who is one of Bill Hinman’s biggest critics and accuses him of conflicts of interest.

For example, the lawyer discovered several passages in the Rule 56.1 statement that speak particularly in favor of Ripple’s fair notice defense. Several SEC communications indicate that SEC officials were well aware that the speech would lead to “greater confusion” and that they intentionally wanted to give industry participants “fewer details,” presumably to give the agency more leeway. In addition, the documents show that the regulator revised its own internal views on factors that the SEC staff had previously deemed “not relevant” or that even proved that an asset was not a security. Words that were not previously relevant were redacted, Morgan says. For example, in 2018, the SEC held that lockups were not relevant and were indicative of a non-security. After that, the agency changed its opinion. At press time, investors seemed to view the publications as positive for XRP. The price rose by 8% to $0.5609 since the Hinman docs were published.

The valuation has deteriorated significantly, but revenue estimates are looking up. I'm sticking with neutral, with the caveat that the stock could be a good long or short depending on what happens. Bitcoin stocks started the year unbelievably hot. As we all know, risk-on behavior has dominated 2023 just as strongly as risk-off behavior dominated last year. However, after some really big runs in growth-oriented stocks, some are way overextended. I've covered Bitcoin miner Riot ( RIOT ) a few times, most recently in September , when I cut it from buy to neutral. A lot has happened since then, and it's worth revisiting given Bitcoin's strong performance this year, as well as Riot itself. Critical test ahead We'll begin with the chart, as always, and the most critical thing here is the support level I've drawn in. We'll do a review of the technical situation, but just know that all bets are off if the stock fails the ~$10 level. StockCharts The zone of support is roughly $10.00 to $10.50, and so far, it's been tested a bunch of times in the past couple of months. We're right there again with a Monday close of $10.24, and so long as it holds, there's upside potential. If it fails $10, cut your losses and get out. On the side of the bears, we have the 20-day exponential moving average making a bearish cross of the 50-day simple moving average. That doesn't mean the stock cannot overtake it again and turn the 20-day EMA higher, but this has the look of the beginning of a larger bear move. The PPO is right at the centerline, which is fine during a consolidation, but we need to see it turn higher quickly. We have the 14-day RSI at just above 40, which is again okay so long as it turns higher soon. All in all, the chart on this one is simple. Either we get a bounce off the support zone, or it breaks down. Either way, I think a big move is coming; which direction is yet to be determined. Now, something I always do with Bitcoin-related stocks is compare their performance with Bitcoin itself. As we can see, Riot has obliterated Bitcoin this year, beating the coin by a staggering 94%. StockCharts That's awesome if you've owned Riot during this time, but it also means Riot's value relative to Bitcoin has suffered immensely; more on that in a bit. Speaking of Bitcoin, we see the coin in a very similar situation to Riot from a technical perspective. StockCharts We see the coin hitting a critical zone of support (just like Riot), and it must hold. If it doesn't, there could be significantly more selling. I'm in the same boat with Bitcoin as I was with Riot; if support holds, there's meaningful upside potential. If not, well, you know. One more point on Riot before we move off the technicals, is that the stock is far less shorted today than it has been in the recent past. YCharts Short interest is still decent at 13.5%, which is about half of the peak from last year. Even earlier this year, the stock was ~20% shorted, so there are a lot fewer bearish bets. That will reduce potential volatility on any move up or down, and this is certainly not a short squeeze play. Things are looking up... maybe Let's turn our attention to the fundamentals, which are actually starting to look better after some really rough months last year. We'll kick things off with the top line, which was basically cut in half between the start of 2022 and the early part of this year. Seeking Alpha However, both this year and next year have seen estimates move off the bottom, and if the company has seen the worst of Bitcoin bear market, the stock could have huge upside over time. A lot has to go right for that to occur - not least of which is Bitcoin itself trading higher - but the estimates look like they've bottomed. The problem with miners - and why their shares have been absolutely destroyed in the past year or so - is that margins have deteriorated rapidly, and in huge magnitudes. This is a chart Riot provided in an investor presentation, and it actually does a great job of helping us understand what drives margins for a Bitcoin miner. Investor presentation You can read the slide but the point here is that in recent quarters, profitability has fallen off a cliff for Bitcoin miners. Many are operating (and mining) at a loss, and there hasn't been a lot of optimism that would change. TIKR You can see the damage for Riot above, as its gross margins fell from 2021 levels in the 60s to just 5.2% in the December 2022 quarter. No miner can operate with that kind of gross margin profile, and Riot is no different. The March quarter was a lot better, but nowhere near good enough. This is the number to watch going forward, and much of it depends upon Bitcoin's price action. That's why it pays so well to watch the Bitcoin chart for clues as to how Riot and others' margins will likely perform in the coming quarters. Right now, margins are a huge concern. Let's value this thing I'm leaning ever so slightly to the bullish side on the charts. I mentioned Riot and Bitcoin are facing critical price support tests, so until those fail, I'll lean bullish. It's a lean, though; I'm not exactly pounding the table. However, when we throw in the margin situation, and the valuation that we'll look at below, Riot's outlook is pretty murky. Below we have the stock's price-to-sales ratio since the beginning of 2022. Right now, shares are 4.3X forward sales, which is ahead of the average of 3.3X. TIKR Now, it could be that investors have bid up the stock in anticipation of higher revenue, or it could be that the stock is just overvalued. We won't know the answer to that until Bitcoin and/or Riot either start a new rally, or break down below critical price support. But is the P/S ratio making me more bullish? Absolutely not. Remember this chart from above? StockCharts Riot's relative performance against Bitcoin is great if you've owned it, but this cannot persist. A 94% outperformance in a five-month period is unsustainable, and given the weight of all the evidence we've looked at here, I'm sticking with my neutral rating. Riot's fate is tied to whether or not Bitcoin can bounce off the ~$25k level, and right now, I'm not so sure. If it does, that's great, but if Bitcoin breaks down, Riot will follow, particularly given the valuation. So here's the gameplan; I'm going to sit tight on Riot and see if it either starts to rally, or breaks down. If it breaks down, you can short it under $10. If it rallies on a strong up move in Bitcoin, there's a lot of upside so long as it breaks out from its current consolidation range. This is one where patience could potentially save you a lot of money, and that's the route I'm taking.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611159-riot-platforms-be-patient-and-take-bitcoins-cues?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13765520.jpeg

The message asks that the attacker return the stolen funds to an address owned by Sturdy Finance, emphasising that the team will refrain from pursuing legal action if the funds are returned promptly.

Sturdy Finance's decision to offer a bounty to the attacker raises eyebrows in the crypto community.

By choosing not to pursue criminal charges and instead incentivising the return of the funds, Sturdy Finance seeks to resolve the situation amicably while sending a strong message about its dedication to the principles of decentralisation and forgiveness. The way forward As the crypto world awaits the outcome of this unexpected offer, the incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by decentralised platforms. Sturdy Finance's swift response and commitment to securing its users' funds demonstrate its determination to uphold the highest standards of safety and integrity.

However, the view that all tokens other than bitcoin (BTC) are securities does not leave any room for “blockchain networks to attain decentralization over time, and for tokens to have functional utility within the network,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  The question of whether crypto tokens are securities or commodities is at the heart of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase (COIN), Bernstein said in a report last week.  The regulator said last Monday that it was suing Binance, its founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the operating company for Binance.US on allegations of violating federal securities laws. A day later it sued rival exchange Coinbase on similar charges.  The core issue is whether countries should use securities laws framed decades ago, “without realizing blockchain networks’ very aim is to transform the decades-old financial and securities market systems, with more transparency, instant settlement times, disintermediation of middlemen, automation and reduced costs, global liquidity and interoperability,” the report said.  Bernstein says this is splitting the world into jurisdictions, which see this as an opportunity to attract talent and capital.  Progressive steps by the U.K., Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Middle East are attempts to gain an advantage and build crypto hubs, while the U.S. deals with regulatory uncertainty, the note said.

42393321,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOkbj,1686651792,"Bitcoin's MACD Indicator Flips Bearish, Scares Crypto Twitter","A widely-tracked bitcoin (BTC) technical analysis indicator has flipped bearish, spurring some crypto followers on Twitter to express concerns an extended price slide is in the offing.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, used to gauge trend strength and changes, has crossed below zero on the bitcoin price weekly chart, according to technical analysis platform TradingView. That represents a bullish-to-bearish shift and is widely considered a sell signal. (Crossovers above zero suggest the opposite).  Some technical analysts, however, say the signal is undermined by other factors, and macroeconomic events such as the U.S. inflation figure due today and Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision will also influence bitcoin price performance. Still, the signal comes after BTC's 16% decline from highs around $31,000 registered two months ago, raising questions about the sustainability of the bull revival witnessed early this year.  ""Moonboys in disbelief,"" pseudonymous crypto trader @CryptoBullet1 tweeted Monday, referring to people who'd expected a meteoric rally.  According to @CryptoBullet1, the MACD bear cross looks similar to one observed roughly four years ago. At the time, the market was coming off an impressive rally, much as it has over the past two months, and nosedived following the indicator's bearish turn.  Bearish crossovers of April 2022, November 2021 and April 2021 also brought pain to the market.  ""That's why I believe the most probable outcome is we go to $19K-$20K,"" one Twitter user said, noting the MACD's record of predicting extended market swoons.  Key support intact  Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of technical analysis research provider Fairlead Strategies, disagrees.  ""A new weekly MACD 'sell' signal is a potential setback, but short-term oversold conditions are in place and intermediate-term oversold conditions are in reach, which gives bitcoin a better chance of holding up near support [at $25,200],"" Stockton said in a note to clients on Monday.  Bitcoin continues to hold the resistance-turned-support of $25,200 amid regulatory uncertainty and panic selling in alternative cryptocurrencies. Prices blew past the said level in March, confirming a bull revival.  The weekly chart shows bitcoin holding support at $25,200, marked by the horizontal line and stochastic indicator just short of flashing an oversold signal with a below-20 reading.  Oversold signals are unreliable as standalone indicators, but when accompanied by prices trading at crucial support, as in BTC's case, they often portend renewed buying interest.  Focus on macro data  Moreover, Tuesday's U.S. consumer price index (CPI) release and Wednesday's Fed rate decision could make or break price charts.  According to Bloomberg estimates, May's CPI is expected to show the cost of living in the world's largest economy rose 0.2% from the previous month and 4.1% over the prior year, a slowdown from April's 4.9% annual gain. Core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is expected to have climbed 0.4% month-on-month and 5.2% year-on-year.  The bias for bitcoin is to the topside, according to David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm,.  ""We've digested a lot of bad news in the past couple of weeks, including a reprice of higher rates and the U.S. dollar since April. Risk/reward for a move back to top of the range [is attractive],"" Brickell tweeted. ""I also think likely CPI [might] undershoot and markets [are] behind on how quickly inflation falls from here.""

13764362,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537617,1686650728,New Bull Narrative For Bitcoin And Crypto? China Mulls Stimulus Package,"The Bitcoin and crypto market may have received yet another bullish narrative from China. As reported by Bloomberg, the country is mulling a major stimulus package to kick-start an economic recovery following the rebooting of the economy after the restrictive Corona measures. In light of Hong Kong’s recent opening to cryptocurrency trading by retail investors, a new bullish narrative is therefore emerging, as renowned expert Lex Moskovski explained via Twitter. According to him, the Chinese stimmies could go directly into “unregistered securities” (allusion to the classification of altcoins by SEC chairman Gary Gensler). Chinese stimmies going into your unregistered securities. Here’s your bullish narrative. https://t.co/HjaB3fliC3 — Lex Moskovski (@mskvsk) June 13, 2023 China Mulls Stimulus Package According to the report, China is considering a comprehensive package of stimulus measures as pressure mounts on Xi Jinping’s government to revive the second-largest economy. Anonymous sources claim the proposals include at least a dozen measures to support areas such as real estate and domestic demand. A particular focus is reportedly on China’s beleaguered real estate market, which is to be a key part of the package. Chinese regulators reportedly want to lower the cost of outstanding residential mortgages and boost lending by the country’s policy banks to ensure that homes are delivered. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Throwback” Could Trigger Flawless Technical Bottom Formation In addition, interest rate cuts by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) are also said to be under consideration. Speculation on this already arose recently after the central bank unexpectedly cut its seven-day reverse repo rate. However, it is important to stress that the stimulus plan has yet to be finalized and could therefore be subject to change. Nevertheless, China’s State Council could discuss the measures as early as this Friday. Still, it is unclear when they will be announced or implemented, the report states. What Impact Could The Package Have On Bitcoin And Crypto? While investors in the broader financial market are likely to welcome the Chinese authorities’ plans, much will depend on the final scope and composition of the stimulus measures to assess the extent to which Bitcoin and crypto may also benefit from the stimulus package. Nevertheless, the package and Hong Kong’s recent opening on June 1st are an interesting development with regard to cryptocurrencies. The liberal Hong Kong is considered a gateway for wealthy Chinese to invest in foreign assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s (BTC) Key Indicator Points Bullish Continuation Despite Recent Dip Meanwhile, the hoped-for “China effect” on the Bitcoin and crypto market has not yet materialized, in part because the registration of exchanges is rather slow. For example, Coinbase only received an invitation from Hong Kong lawmakers to apply in the region yesterday, as Bitcoinist reported. In the US, the $1,200 stimulus checks had a measurable impact on Bitcoin. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, there was a “significant increase” in Bitcoin purchases of $1,200 in April 2020. Furthermore, the central bank noted that overall Bitcoin trading volumes increased by about 3.8% in response to the distribution of the first stimulus checks. While the environment in China is not comparable to that in the US, a similar effect could still be possible.

The SEC has recently taken legal action against Coinbase, Binance and others - signaling an increasingly negative stance on crypto. The outcome of GBTC's case depends on the legal system rather than the SEC's activism, and investors could see upside from the verdict. I previously made the case that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has a greater chance of winning its legal case than the market price might imply, creating potential upside. I briefly summarize that argument below, but here I want to focus on recent events and other angles to the trade as the SEC makes its position on crypto somewhat clearer. Ultimately, I still view GBTC as an attractive opportunity based on the potential for a win in court. That's because the decision is in the hands of the legal system, not the SEC, though the SEC's more stridently anti-crypto position may still impact Grayscale. Recap Here's my previous summary triangulating how Grayscale Bitcoin Trust may win its legal case against the SEC and therefore perhaps close the discount to NAV on its large Bitcoin fund by converting it to an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). I estimated roughly a 44% chance of a legal victory for GBTC that could come over the next few months. Here's roughly how the numbers play out offering perhaps a +24% expected return at the time of writing, though it's also worth pointing out that the most likely outcome is that you lose money, and of course you are exposed to Bitcoin price volatility: Outcome Estimated probability Discount to NAV Return for GBTC investors Win legal case 44% 0% +72% Don't win legal case 56% 50% -14% Weighted expected return +24% The Actions Of The SEC However, since then, the SEC has been unusually active in bringing legal cases against both Coinbase and Binance that could potentially cause both to cease operating or be severely impaired. My favorite quote here is from the French philosopher Voltaire, ""It is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong."" It doesn't really matter what is correct here, but the SEC is powerful and may get its way. In the case of Coinbase, it appears that they tried to work with the SEC, but now the SEC have decided to turn against Coinbase, despite the business operating for 11 years. Of course, from the SEC's perspective there has been a lot of crypto frauds that have hurt investors and they feel the need to take action. As an aside, it is also worth remembering, that 90 years ago, in 1933 the government banned U.S. citizens from holding gold for investment purposes . That was a wartime measure, but it remained in force for over 30 years. So, arguably, things could get even worse for crypto in the U.S. There are hints in Gary Gensler's statements and interviews that he would just prefer to get rid of crypto entirely, perhaps because of the implicit threat it poses to the primacy of the U.S. dollar, though, of course, that isn't the SEC's mandate and regulation should not be entirely capricious. Still it is worth recognizing just how hostile to crypto the SEC currently appears. A Hardline SEC However, regardless of the preferences of the SEC, the legal case does largely hinge on the apparent inconsistency between the SEC allowing a Bitcoin futures ETF and blocking a spot Bitcoin ETF. Given the relatively draconian actions of the SEC in recent months, it does now seem possible that if the SEC lost the case, then they might chose to ban the previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs and achieve consistency that way by 'burning all the ships'. This would maybe create a path to block spot Bitcoin ETFs, even if they lost the legal case. Previously that seemed extreme, now it's more consistent with the SEC's recent actions. Also the SEC appears committed to the idea that Bitcoin is a commodity. This makes it somewhat unique in the eyes of the SEC, and may mean that despite the aggressive approach the SEC is currently taking against crypto, Bitcoin may be spared to some degree as compared to other coins/tokens. Lastly, with everything else going on at the SEC in terms of a host of legal cases, spot Bitcoin ETFs may no longer be the primary focus. Given limited resources, if the SEC lost the case in the current environment, they may choose to not devote additional resources to this topic relative to other major legal battles that they perceive as more important. Other Paths Then if GBTC did lose the case and the SEC's ban on spot Bitcoin ETFs stands, what other paths are open to it? The challenge here is winning the legal case is one outcome that almost completely aligns Grayscale and its investors. With an ETF structure the discount is closed and Grayscale gets to likely retain the very significant assets under management of its Bitcoin fund and perhaps grow them further. Other scenarios are more adversarial, or problematic in other ways. In the case of closed-end funds sometimes mergers between funds can close NAV discounts, but these typically occur when a fund in sub-scale, that's not the case with GBTC with a $16B fund. Canada, and other exchanges, do permit spot Bitcoin ETFs today, but it's not clear that GBTC could migrate to a non-US exchange without losing significant assets in the process. GBTC could of course liquidate, that would be great for investors, but requires Grayscale to voluntarily walk away from hundreds of millions of dollars of annual revenue and a leading position in the crypto fund space more generally, which feels unlikely. It's also unclear what grounds investors could use to force a GBTC liquidation, many funds trade below NAV. Of course, given the high-powered lawyers Grayscale is working with in the first instance the most likely outcome is perhaps an appeal of the court's decision if Grayscale loses. Other Grayscale Funds It is also worth noting that Grayscale operates various other crypto-related funds and it is interesting to look at how they trade in relation to NAV. Here are some of the more notable ones. It is interesting that some of Grayscale's funds (for example those holding Solana and Filecoin) still trade at large NAV premiums, though these are relatively small and illiquid funds. It also makes clear that GBTC's current 42% discount is not a floor. In some ways this suggests there may be opportunity in ETHE if GBTC won its case, though it's not clear that the SEC would treat all crypto assets the same way, and Bitcoin's ""commodity"" status may offer an advantage. Fund NAV premium/discount GBTC (Bitcoin) -42% ETHE (Ethereum) -54% GSOL (Solana) +146% LTCN (Litecoin) -46% FILG (Filecoin) +250% source: Grayscale disclosures, author's analysis as of June 7, 2023 Risks Underlying Bitcoin is volatile, that could cause GBTC to decline in value even if they win the court case. Crypto investing carries significant risks given past frauds and/or the potential regulatory actions of the SEC hurting investment values. If GBTC lost the legal case then the discount to NAV would likely increase. GBTC is a high-cost fund so fees will erode your return while you wait for any legal outcome. Some brokers apparently only allow sell rather and not buy trades in GBTC and if this trend broadens it may further widen the NAV discount. GBTC could potentially lose custody of its Bitcoin assets due to a hack or other event which would cause large loses. It is also difficult to independently verify GBTC's asset holdings. Legal processes are often slow and any final verdict could be delayed by many factors. What's Next? Ultimately despite a more aggressive SEC, the decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF is currently in the hands of the legal system. Plus the idea that Bitcoin is a commodity may help the progression of a spot Bitcoin ETF relative to other regulatory actions that the SEC may want to focus on. As such there appears to still be a reasonable opportunity in GBTC though one that is increasingly complex as the SEC becomes more aggressively anti-crypto.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611146-gbtc-sec-more-aggressively-anti-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13764327.jpeg

One of the key provisions in the bill is the dismissal of currency SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The SEC Stabilization Act The new bill filed by Davidson calls for the immediate dismissal of current Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler and the restructuring of the SEC to better protect the markets. Rep Davidson, in a statement, added, “U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That’s why I’m introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come. It’s time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as Chair of the SEC.” The representative used the hashtag “FireGaryGensler,” adding that the United States markets must be protected from the SEC Chair. He was joined by the Republican Party’s majority whip, Tom Emmer, who Davidson quoted as stating, “American investors and industry deserve clear and consistent oversight, not political gamesmanship. The SEC Stabilization Act will make common-sense changes to ensure that the SEC’s priorities are with the investors they are charged to protect and not the whims of its reckless Chair.” Tom Emmer co-authored the bill. Structural Changes According to Davidson, apart from the removal of Gensler, the bill will also look to restructure the Securities and Exchange Commission, redistributing power between the SEC and its commissioners. It will also add a sixth commissioner to the agency so that no single party can have a majority over the commission and create an executive director position that would handle all day-to-day operations. While Davidson and Emmer did not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies or the crypto ecosystem in their statements, both are known to be extremely pro-crypto. Furthermore, both are also highly critical of Gensler’s leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Emmer has previously called Genser a “bad faith regulator,” while Davidson is the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee’s new Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion. Crypto Community Pushes Back Against Gensler The Securities and Exchange Commission’s latest action against Coinbase and Binance has not been met warmly by the crypto community. Many brought up old videos of Gensler and his views on crypto. One such video shows the SEC Chair teaching blockchain technology at MIT. Another video that has garnered significant controversy is that of Gensler telling hedge funds that Ethereum and Litecoin are not securities. These videos and many more have left the crypto community seething at what they perceive as blatant hypocrisy. Gensler has also previously showered praise on Algorand, but later called ALGO a security. The crypto community has also pointed to the fact that the SEC Chair has close ties with Senator Elizabeth Warren. Senator Warren is notoriously anti-crypto, with the crypto community wondering if she has a role to play in Gensler’s recent outbursts against crypto. Many in the crypto space believe that Gensler is out to kill the crypto industry, with the regulatory action against Coinbase and Binance the latest salvo against the industry. The SEC made its position against crypto clear when it launched regulatory action against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.

Despite the challenges and uncertainties that have plagued the crypto market, XRP has managed to stand out, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. But what exactly is fueling this impressive growth? Why is XRP able to maintain its momentum while others struggle?

This price surge showcases XRP’s resilience amidst the challenging landscape of the cryptocurrency market.

Exclusion From Recent Court Filings By SEC Meanwhile, the recent court filings by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have noticeably omitted XRP, as well as ETH and BTC, which highlights the SEC’s deliberate decision to treat XRP differently from other cryptocurrencies. This exclusion signifies a clear acknowledgment and distinction by the SEC regarding the unique nature of XRP within the cryptocurrency landscape.

42393304,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOjhJ,1686646800,Crypto Investing Platform Finblox Starts Offering Tokenized Treasury Yield With OpenEden,"Crypto investment platform Finblox has joined the ranks of companies letting investors earn a return from tokenized U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) on their stablecoin holdings as it looks to become a “crypto superapp,” providing a wide range of financial services.  Investors on the platform can now invest Circle’s USDC stablecoin in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol OpenEden’s yield-generating TBILL token rights, which are backed by short-term U.S. government bonds, the company said Tuesday.  Tokenized T-bills have grown to a $500 million asset class at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance products, also known as tokenized real-world assets (RWA). They work like a blockchain-based version of a high-yield savings account, where investors can park their excess stablecoins in short-term U.S. government bonds, generally deemed as one of the safest investments, and earn a return.  As central banks jacked up interest rates to combat inflation, rising T-bill yields have captivated digital investors dismayed by lending-based yield offerings after last year’s dramatic blowups of Terra, Celsius and BlockFi.  Read more: Demand for Tokenized Treasury Bonds Soars as Crypto Investors Chase TradFi Yield  Finblox sparked controversy in June last year, when it limited user withdrawals as crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, a borrower and yield provider to the platform, imploded. Crypto news site DL News reported last month that dozens of users complained about having their deposits converted to the platform's FBX tokens to cover losses. CEO Peter told CoinDesk in an email that the risks of lending were clearly stated to users, and the platform stopped offering yield from lending. ""We have learned the lessons and believe the new product will offer users a much safer way to obtain yield with crypto assets,"" he wrote.  Investment management giant Franklin Templeton and DeFi platforms such as Ondo Finance, Maple Finance and OpenEden have stepped up to cater to the demand for sustainable yield by tokenizing money market funds and T-bills.  So far, however, OpenEden's product has been available for professional investors. Finblox plans offer a way for retail users to invest, too.  The firm acts as an intermediary and invests in OpenEden's TBILL tokens, which are accessible only to accredited investors and institutions because of regulations. It will pass on the yield to users through Finblox's own ""T-Bill Token,"" Hoang, who co-founded the firm, said in an interview. Finblox will take a cut of as much as 1 percentage point from OpenEden’s estimated annual yield, now at around 5.2%.  The platform opened access first for professional investors to collect feedback, and will soon expand to users who have performed know-your-customer (KYC) checks and provided proof of address for compliance reasons, Hoang said.  “This collaboration unlocks unprecedented access to a trillion-dollar market, offering users transparency and trust,” said Qin En, principal at Saison Capital, a venture capital firm that invested in both Finblox and OpenEden. “Beyond portfolio diversification, it offers the potential for more reliable and safer yields.”  UPDATE (June 13, 13:30 UTC): Adds details about past withdrawal limitations, reports about user complaints and comment from Finblox CEO in fifth paragraph.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ONDO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/13/crypto-investing-platform-finblox-starts-offering-tokenized-treasury-yield-with-openeden,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5a253acfede39012d282e82fa00a50cf8cf434-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
13763070,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/fraud-proceedings-against-sbf-could-be-delayed-by-months-or-years,1686646680,Fraud Proceedings Against SBF Could Be Delayed By Months Or Years,"Lawyers for FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried have stated that litigation proceedings against him could be significantly delayed if further charges are added against the founder. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have argued that a new Supreme Court judgment shows that the FTX founder has not committed fraud. A Significant Delay Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued about the delay in legal filings that were made on Monday. The disgraced FTX founder remains on bail after being arrested in the Bahamas in December. US authorities filed several criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, following which he was extradited following the collapse of FTX and its associated entities, including Alameda Research. FTX and Alameda Research had filed for bankruptcy in November, with SBF pleading not guilty to charges brought against him, including those of money laundering and wire fraud. Lawyers representing Bankman-Fried argued in a pretrial motion to dismiss a majority of the charges against him that charges added by the United States Department of Justice after Bankman-Fried’s extradition could breach the treaty between the United States and the Bahamas. They further added that he held the right to contest any attempt to add charges in overseas courts. “Mr. Bankman-Fried is currently challenging the Government’s new application for consent in The Bahamas, as is his right, and such proceedings may well take many months, even years, to be litigated.” The US Supreme Court Boosts Defense Case Sam Bankman-Fried’s case has been significantly emboldened by the United States Supreme Court, which recently narrowed the scope of federal laws during a case involving the bidding of state contracts. The narrowing of the scope of federal laws, along with other case laws, significantly weakens the prosecution’s arguments that Sam Bankman-Fried defrauded banks and users/clients that lend money to the crypto hedge fund Alameda Research. The banks and users in question still stand a chance of receiving their money back as the firm is wound up. Lawyers arguing for SBF stated, “The Alameda lenders were not deprived of their contractual rights to collect the existing loans” by Bankman-Fried’s actions. We understand that Alameda’s lenders are vigorously asserting their rights in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings.” According to the document filed, “Bank-1’s right to control access to its bank accounts is no longer a valid property right” after the Supreme Court’s observation in May. According to SBF’s lawyers, this invalidates charges against him, stating that he misrepresented the purpose of a bank account set up for the company North Dimension. SBF’s Growing Problems Sam Bankman-Fried has constantly denied any wrongdoing after pleading not guilty to federal charges. In January, he posted an astonishing blog post stating that he did not steal funds or stash away billions. Instead, he blamed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, saying that he had orchestrated the liquidity crisis that led to the fall of FTX and its associated entities. Despite his protests, federal prosecutors added further charges to a growing list of indictments, alleging that he paid $40 million to Chinese officials to unfreeze specific accounts. Sam Bankman-Fried was also sued by FTX and its sister entity Alameda Research, as it looks to recover $240 million related to the Embed acquisition. Other executives sued by the companies include Nishad Singh and Gary Wang. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Elliptic investigators believe Atomic Wallet was hacked by the infamous North Korean hacking group Lazarus, as previously reported.  Last year, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Garentex, stating the exchange had lax anti-money laundering measures and that it allowed “illicit players” to freely move money using the service. However, Garantex continues to operate.  Elliptic security researchers said in a tweet on Tuesday that several crypto exchanges have already frozen addresses related to the Atomic Wallet hack, but some funds have found their way to Garantex.  These funds were previously exchanged via the on-chain trading tool 1inch, transferred to Garantex, and then traded for bitcoin (BTC). The bitcoin was then laundered through Sinbad, a bitcoin mixer service allegedly used by North Korean hacking groups.  Nearly $35 million worth of various tokens were stolen from Atomic Wallet, a centralized storage and wallet service, on June 3. These tokens include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT), dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), BNB coin (BNB) and Polygon's MATIC.  Atomic Wallet said at the time that the impacted users represented “less than 1% of its monthly active users.” Investigations were ongoing as of June 8.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE | LTC | BNB,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | LTC | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/13/atomic-wallet-hackers-move-stolen-funds-via-ofac-sanctioned-exchange-garantex-elliptic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5844591d4fc53908b4ecc1fda0511af88a269620-6024x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Shibarium network’s native test network, Puppynet, has crossed more than 20 million transactions from 16 million wallets as it crawls closer to a mainnet release in the coming months.  Testnets, such as Puppynet, are blockchain networks designed for testing purposes. They mimic activity on the mainnet and allow developers to debug any issues and monitor network activity ahead of a wider release.  The average transaction time was five seconds, Puppeynet blockchain scanners show.  Such participation suggests demand for the network, which could ultimately boost the value of SHIB and BONE, two Shibarium ecosystem tokens.  On-chain data shows that one of the biggest SHIB investors added another $10 million worth of the tokens to holdings on Monday, bringing their total holdings to 5.3 trillion SHIB – worth $35 million at current prices.  Shibarium is touted as a major development for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which launched as a meme coin fashioned after the popular Shiba Inu dog breed and has become a serious blockchain project.

However, two indicators say otherwise. SEC pulls crypto market down Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is doing everything in its power to crush the crypto sector. A sector that is potentially seen as a rival to the hegemony of the US dollar is having the life sucked out of it as the SEC attacks on/off ramps and major exchanges. The retail investors who are just there for the money are leaving in droves and it is likely that many cryptocurrencies will die because of being labelled by the SEC as securities, while others will have their growth stunted as the threat of a potential SEC action hangs over them. Bitcoin still in upward trend Meanwhile, as the crypto industry continues its suffering, Bitcoin is still technically in its upward trend; one that it has been following since the beginning of the year. Granted it has seen an 18% correction since topping at around $31,000 in early April, but this is entirely normal. Weekly Stochastic RSI One huge indicator for Bitcoin, which is potentially only 2 or 3 weeks away from triggering, is a cross up on the high time frame weekly Stochastic RSI. This indicator is very near bottoming out, and in fact, it is showing bullish divergence, which on the weekly time frame can be very powerful. Gaussian Channel Another indicator, which not so many look at, is the Gaussian Channel. This indicator is incredibly powerful in interpreting price movements and is able to predict price trends. When looking at the Gaussian Channel on the higher time frame of 5 days, the data has no false signals, at least for Bitcoin’s short history. The Gaussian Channel flipped from red to green on the 5 day in early May and is now trending upward. Importantly, the bitcoin price has come back to test the top of the channel and a bounce could be seen from this area. Bitcoin will outstrip the dollar This still does not mean that Bitcoin is automatically confirmed as having entered its bull market, but it is certainly a positive sign. To boot, given the decentralised nature of the Bitcoin network, and its scarcity and predictability of supply, it is highly likely to outstrip the dollar as that fiat currency continues to suffer extreme debasement.

42393319,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOkRT,1686640486,"FCA Right to Propose Stop to Marketing Crypto as ‘Inflation Resistant,’ UK Industry Members Say","Members of the U.K. digital asset space seem to largely support a proposal by the country’s financial watchdog to move companies away from promoting crypto as an inflation hedge.  The popular argument that limited-supply cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) can hold firm against rising price levels may be theoretically sound – but due to a lack of data combined with the volatility of crypto assets, it can also mislead investors, industry observers told CoinDesk.  The FCA’s tough rules to govern crypto promotional material in the U.K., issued on Thursday, include a ban on free non-fungible tokens (NFT) giveaways and airdrops. In guidance accompanying the rules, the regulator took aim at stablecoin issuers, saying firms should be able to “demonstrate claims of stability or links to a fiat currency” are legitimate.  “We also expect firms to consider the potential harm to consumers and be confident that any claims made by the issuer are genuine,” the guidance said. “Firms should not use terms that could mislead consumers such as ‘inflation resistant.’”  “To the extent that people bought into crypto during the bull run on the back of rising inflation and then lost money in the subsequent crypto winter, then one could say that the inflation narrative has been harmful,” Shea said, adding that cryptocurrencies are not designed to move one-to-one against inflation. “The inflation narrative is more medium-to-long term and is driven by the expectation [of] the large increase in fiat money supply witnessed over the past several years.”  “In a strict sense, the FCA is correct,” said Ryan Shea, economist at U.K.-based crypto index trading Trakx. “Cryptocurrencies are not inflation-protected in the same way as an index-linked Gilt or an inflation-protected Treasury bond, whose value mechanically increases in line with the specified inflation index.”  But for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, that are in fixed or limited supply, there is a strong similarity between their supply metrics and that of gold, for which supply is naturally constrained, Shea said.  Despite its popularity, bitcoin is relatively new, and available price data on the cryptocurrency is still limited, said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.  “Due to bitcoin's relatively short existence, we have to rely on the fundamental concepts of what it represents as an asset, so theoretically, it being of limited supply while being priced in U.S. dollars, it should act as an inflation hedge,” Butterfill told CoinDesk.  Although crypto could “theoretically be a hedge against inflation,” the lack of data supporting that theory hurts that argument, ratings agency S&P Global said in a statement from May.  As far as investors are concerned, promotions around how bitcoin or other coins could be used to hedge against inflation “are imprecise marketing slogans rather than adequate investment advice,” said Diego Ballon Ossio, partner at Clifford Chance law firm.  “To the extent that people bought into crypto during the bull run on the back of rising inflation and then lost money in the subsequent crypto winter, then one could say that the inflation narrative has been harmful,” Shea said, adding that cryptocurrencies are not designed to move one-to-one against inflation. “The inflation narrative is more medium-to-long term and is driven by the expectation [of] the large increase in fiat money supply witnessed over the past several years.”  Ballon Ossio added that it’s “understandable that the FCA” wants to ban this type of promotion.  “I think the specific reference to ‘inflation resistant’ in this context is simply an example, the general point is that firms must think about their statements and make sure that they do not mislead,” he said.  The FCA’s new rules on crypto marketing will come into effect on Oct. 8.

The firm’s Linkedin Page has been deleted, but its Twitter profile is still functioning.  Upbit, a South Korea-based exchange, said it would be limiting Haru Invest’s ability to withdraw assets on its platform, according to CoinDesk Korea.

13760817,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/highly-anticipated-chancer-crypto-presale-officially-launches-today,1686639886,Highly Anticipated Chancer Crypto Presale Officially Launches Today,"London, United Kingdom, June 13th, 2023, Chainwire Chancer, one of the most exciting new Web3 projects of 2023 has officially launched its crypto presale today, 13th June. The project aims to disrupt the betting industry by removing the ‘house’ from the picture and putting the markets firmly back in the hands of the bettors, allowing users to create their own betting markets, set their own odds, and create their own rules. Chancer is the world’s first decentralized predictive markets app — something co-founders and brothers Adam and Paul Kelbie believe will dramatically change how people bet, and ultimately, put the fun back into betting. Chancer positions itself as a betting facilitator, not a betting house, allowing users to create peer-to-peer (P2P) bets. These can be small, friendly bets amongst a small group of people, or huge, viral bets such as predicting the Champions League final result or who will win Best Director at the Oscars, in which masses of people can participate. Chancer doesn’t limit people to sport betting; bets can be made on any prediction or event, a stark contrast from most bookmakers. Its inherent appeal lies in the fact that users are in complete control of their bets and won’t lose to a traditional bookmaker who stacks the odds against them. “We’re confident that we can change the way betting and gambling works,” said Adam Kelbie, CEO of Chancer. “The next few months are going to be very exciting, and we’re thrilled that we can offer a new cryptocurrency in such a competitive market. We’re doing something no one else has done, disrupting an industry that has had the odds stacked against consumers since it began. It won’t be easy, but we’re ready for the fight.” How CHANCER works All bets and pay-outs are made in Chancer’s native token, ‘CHANCER’, which can then be traded with stablecoins like USDT. The online betting and gambling industry is huge, standing at approximately $64 billion (as of 2022), and Chancer aims to take advantage of that and claim a dominant position within the space. The CHANCER token will be launched on the BSC Blockchain, and is now available during its presale, which comprises of 12 stages in total. The token is now available at a price of $0.010 during stage one of the presale and will eventually rise to $0.021 by stage 12, an increase of 70% from the initial price in the first tranche of the presale. Revolutionizing the betting industry with future-forward capabilities As outlined in the whitepaper, the project has a well-planned roadmap outlining a variety of product use cases to draw different types of investor interest. Chancer also aims to achieve and maintain true decentralization. To do this, Chancer will have a proof of stake consensus mechanism so that no single party can take control of the network. Quadratic governance will hand decision-making over to the platform’s users. For full transparency, Chancer’s source code will remain open. This also means that anyone is welcome to review, contribute, and propose changes in how the platform works with the assurance that they will be listened to. Uniquely, Chancer will be channelled by the real-time communication capability of Google’s WebRTC to live stream events to its community. Chancer believes in rewarding its users and will therefore offer CHANCER tokens simply for using the platform, as well as providing a Share2Earn scheme, staking, and discounted fees for those who create and participate in the market, making it cost-effective for those who use the platform frequently. Another way to earn a passive income via Chancer is to become a node validator. About Chancer Chancer is set to develop the world’s first decentralized social predictive markets platform. This will allow Chancer token holders to create, participate in and profit from their very own predictive markets based on their interests, expertise and social opportunities. The project intends to disrupt the global gambling and betting market by ‘removing the house’ and taking a slice of the market share as it garners attention by challenging the traditional bookmaking and betting business model.

Bankman-Fried is currently on bail after being arrested in December and extradited from the Bahamas after the collapse of his crypto empire, which had filed for bankruptcy in November. He has pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud and money laundering.  His lawyers argue that charges added by the U.S. Department of Justice after his extradition may breach the treaty the U.S. has with the Bahamas – and that he has the right to contest any attempt to add them in overseas courts.  “Mr. Bankman-Fried is currently challenging the Government’s new application for consent in The Bahamas, as is his right, and such proceedings may well take many months, even years to be litigated,” the filing said.  The defense case has been emboldened by the U.S. Supreme Court, which narrowed the scope of federal fraud laws in a May case involving bidding for state contracts.  This and other case-law weakens arguments that Bankman-Fried defrauded a bank and those lending money to his hedge fund Alameda Research, who could in principle still get their money back as the firm is wound up, his lawyers argue.  “The Alameda lenders were not deprived of their contractual rights to collect the existing loans” by Bankman-Fried’s actions, the document said. “We understand that Alameda’s lenders are vigorously asserting their rights in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings.”  “Bank-1’s right to control access to its bank accounts is no longer a valid property right” after the Supreme Court’s May opinion, invalidating charges that Bankman-Fried misrepresented the purpose of a bank account set up for his company North Dimension, the document said.  In May filings, the U.S. government argued it could simply ask the Bahamas for permission to add extra charges, and that it had jurisdiction as the impact of his actions were felt in U.S. crypto markets.

As QCP Capital wrote in a recent note, this week will be “action-packed” with the U.S. CPI and June FOMC coming down the pipe.  “This promises volatility on the horizon, and we might finally get the break in BTC/ETH that we've started positioning for this month,” QCP wrote.  It just, however, needs to kick off – and that hasn’t happened quite yet.  Meanwhile, the market might be thinking that the Securities and Exchange’s (SEC) case against Binance might be more bark than bite.  Data from Nansen.ai shows that flow across all the chains it tracks went back into the green for Binance. Nansen shows that during the last 24 hours, Binance had a net flow of $470 million. This is certainly a pittance to the nearly $4 billion in value that has departed the exchange during the last week, but it is still a material amount that should be noted.  Binance’s BNB token is still well within the red, but its price has begun to stabilize. CoinGecko data shows that other exchange tokens like OKB and Crypto.com’s CRO are deeper in the red than BNB, while decentralized exchange tokens like Uniswap are up.

What's Next?  The co-founder of crypto security firm De.Fi called the relative calm in altcoins flagged by U.S. Securities and Exchange lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase last week ""mean regression.  ""People say, 'here's a buying opportunity, and let's come in and pick it up,"" Michael Rosmer told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" Program on Monday in a conversation that initially focused on his company's report that crypto investors had lost $54 million in rug pulls.  Read More: Crypto Investors Lost $54M to Rugpulls, Scams in May: Blockchain Security Firm De.Fi  All but a couple of the 19 tokens mentioned in the suit, which accuses the exchange giants of violating securities laws, have sunk by double-digits over the past seven days with CHZ and SAND, the tokens of the Chiliz network and The Sandbox metaverse game, falling more than 28% and 27%, respectively and ADA, the native crypto of the Cardana blockchain, dropping over 21% as investors looked fretfully at an an increasingly uncertain U.S. regulatory environment in which cryptos have yet to receive a designation as security, commodity or otherwise.  Still, those tokens were recently in the green over the past 24 hours. ""Any time you get a very rapid sell-off, people are going to buy it and push it up on the other side,"" Rosmer said.  But he also struck an upbeat note, saying that people have probably realized that U.S. agencies do not want to drive projects out of the country. ""It's noteworthy that they went after Coinbase and Binance,"" he said. They haven't gone and sued any of these projects directly. That's kind of telling.""  He added: ""Part of the reason is the government in the U.S. operates largely based on lobbying influences from the financial industry, and the financial industry would like to eventually be the player who plays as Coinbase or Binance themselves, as they want to kock those guys out but then still be able to have U.S.-based projects that get traded.""

13753905,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537546,1686618030,"Apple’s Vision Pro Launch Impacts Metaverse, Why This Token Recorded 160% In Profits","The crypto market has been flowing in a sea of red as major assets experienced a correction over the weekend, but tech giant Apple could offer relief. Every cryptocurrency, except for Bitcoin, trended to the downside, but some sectors have bloomed amidst the panic and selling pressure. Related Reading: Cardano Price Falls Below Key Support Levels, Will It Continue To Fall? In particular, some tokens in the Metaverse sector have seen important profits. The assets’ positive price action, defying the overall trend in the crypto market, seems related to Apple’s launch of its new product the Vision Pro. Metaverse Tokens Bloom As Hype For The Apple Vision Pro Growths Apple’s Vision Pro is the company’s first “spatial computer,” the headset will allow users to blend the physical with the digital world. In that sense, people will have the capacity to interact with applications, content, media across different formats, and more. The Metaverse and the projects using blockchain technology to support their platforms want to achieve the same objectives. Thus, there has been a growing correlation between Metaverse tokens and announcements from big tech companies related to the sector. According to a study from CoinGecko, the Apple Vision Pro highlighted the positive performance of Metaverse and Augmented Reality tokens. At its publication, the study showed that Ovr and its native Metaverse token (OVR) saw a 168.6% increase on the back of the announcement. By late May and early June, the token climbed from a low of around $0.28 to $0.74. Other small-cap tokens in the sector experienced similar gains. VFOX recorded a 62% profit between May 15 and June 7, and virtual reality token CUBE from the Metaverse project Somnium rose by around 40% over the same period. Metaverse tokens with larger market caps appreciated pre and after the Apple announcement, although they registered fewer profits. The Sandbox (SAND) saw an 18% increase between mid-May and June 5, and Decentraland (MANA) saw fewer gains, with an 11% profit mostly registered during the announcement. As seen in the chart below, SAND, OVR, and VFOX were just some of the tokens that benefited from the launch of the Vision Pro.

13752742,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537587,1686614457,Bitcoin’s (BTC) Key Indicator Points Bullish Continuation Despite Recent Dip,"Despite the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market, there are positive signs for Bitcoin’s (BTC) future. One key indicator is the Puell Multiple, which suggests a bullish continuation for Bitcoin despite the recent dip. Crypto Con, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has closely monitored the Puell Multiple and identified two key factors that point to a positive outlook. Related Reading: Cardano Price Falls Below Key Support Levels, Will It Continue To Fall? Bitcoin’s Bullish Potential According to Crypto Con’s analysis, the trend for Bitcoin remains intact, indicating that the market is still bullish on the cryptocurrency. Additionally, Bitcoin has not yet reached the mid-top line that every mid-top has reached without diminishing, as seen in the chart below, suggesting that there is still room for growth. The Puell Multiple is a cryptocurrency market indicator that measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s daily issuance value and its 365-day moving average (MA) The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of Bitcoin (in USD) by its 365-day moving average. A high reading on the Puell Multiple suggests that BTC is overvalued and may be due for a correction. In contrast, a low reading suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued and may be a good buying opportunity. The Puell Multiple is considered a long-term indicator, providing insights into the macro trends of the Bitcoin market. It has been used to predict major market movements, including the bull run in 2011 and the subsequent bear market. These factors have been evident for Crypto Con since December 2022, when Bitcoin broke the downtrend macro bearish outlook and reached $21,000. At the time, Crypto Con made his first bullish calls on the Puell Multiple when Bitcoin traded at $16,500. Is BTC Facing A Bear Market? Doctor Crypto, a prominent analyst in the cryptocurrency space, has provided insights into what could be next for BTC. In a recent report, Doctor Crypto discussed the significance of key “price manipulations” that took place, which resulted in Bitcoin breaking above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and subsequently nuking afterward. According to Doctor Crypto, losing the 200-week MA indicator can suggest that Bitcoin is entering a bear market. Furthermore, the recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uncertainty in the market played a role in breaking down this important indicator, suggesting a clear manipulation by market makers. However, the report notes that market makers may be awaiting the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision this week before deciding on the next move. Related Reading: SBI CEO Predicts Massive XRP Price Surge, Expects Ripple Verdict In Few Weeks The report suggests that a worse-than-expected FOMC decision could lead to a massive drop toward the $24,000 region and potentially even lower. The fear of recession combined with SEC fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) could lead to BTC’s “total collapse”, hunting down the liquidity pool at $24,000 and potentially even lower. At the time of writing, the primary cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin, is trading at $25,800.
