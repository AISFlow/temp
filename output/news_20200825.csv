42384535,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYTw5,1598396820,FTX Exchange's $150M Deal for Mobile-First Blockfolio Is a Retail Trading Play,"Cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX has acquired Blockfolio, the market's leading mobile news and portfolio tracking app, for $150 million. The price was paid in cash, crypto and equity, the companies told CoinDesk.      Formally announced Wednesday morning in Asia, the deal is a strategic play for FTX, whose clientele consists largely of quants and professional traders, to attract more retail customers.    FTX isn’t “just acquiring the intellectual property,” FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk. “It’s an ‘acquire for the synergy and scale up’ sort of deal.”  The combined company aims to “build a new standard for quality in retail trading experiences,” said Blockfolio CEO Ed Moncada.  Thanks to the resources and expertise coming from FTX, the deal positions both teams to ""open the door for more of a mainstream, mobile audience"" in the cryptocurrency industry, said Paul Veradittakit, Blockfolio board member and co-investment officer at Pantera Capital. His firm was a co-lead on Blockfolio's Series A round.    Nine months ago, the companies began discussing plans to build a retail-focused cryptocurrency product together. Those discussions eventually morphed into merger talks.    “FTX checked every box we were looking for in a partner,” Moncada told CoinDesk. “They understood the vision of what we wanted to build.”  The acquisition was primarily negotiated by Moncada and Bankman-Fried, who also runs quant trading firm Alameda Research.  Santa Monica, Calif.-based Blockfolio was advised throughout the process by Spartan Group, a boutique advisory firm specializing in blockchain and related industries, and Mike Novogratz's merchant bank Galaxy Digital, Moncada told CoinDesk.    Even as one of the newest exchanges, FTX has grown at warp speed since its founding last year.    The exchange, based in the Caribbean state of Antigua and Barbuda, ranks first by order-book liquidity and seventh by 24-hour volume, according to CryptoWatch.  Founded in 2014, Blockfolio boasts more than 6 million cumulative downloads. Its news and portfolio tools average more than 150 million impressions each month.    The deal appears to be the sixth-largest acquisition in crypto sector history.    It ranks ahead of the Tron Foundation's acquisition of BitTorrent ($125 million) and behind Lightyear.io's merger with Chain, the deal that formed Interstellar ($350 million).  Binance reportedly paid $400 million for CoinMarketCap, which, if true, would put it in a three-way tie for first place with Circle's 2018 takeover of Poloniex and NHMX's purchase of an 80% stake in Bitstamp.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/25/ftx-exchanges-150m-deal-for-mobile-first-blockfolio-is-a-retail-trading-play,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00e1a555eb18fb1485b9a225560d79e36a771d46-1200x839.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYTnH,1598393818,"IRS, Ignoring Its Own Watchdog, Sends Letters About Crypto Taxes Once Again","Undeterred by its own watchdog's warnings, the Internal Revenue Service has once again begun sending crypto ""soft letters"" of disputed legality to American taxpayers.    The letters, which broadly inquire about unpaid or incorrectly filed crypto taxes, appear to have been sent out en masse to an unknown number of taxpayers on Aug. 14, according to multiple copies of the letter reviewed by CoinDesk.  They're part of what the IRS calls a ""soft letter"" campaign, a call-to-action meant to spur taxpayers to fix alleged discrepancies in their tax filings before the IRS escalates the situation to a full inquiry - an audit.  Crypto holders in particular face reams of sometimes still developing tax guidance over how to treat hard forks, report capital gains, account for crypto transactions and other more commonplace issues, like neglecting to file.  But when the IRS first rolled out crypto soft letters last September, it may have gone too hard, too fast, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service.  The internal watchdog recently alleged that one particular letter variant (6173) ""undermines"" taxpayer rights by demanding a statement of facts and a detailed trading history accounting for years outside the statute of limitations. Letter 6173's ""disturbing"" tone also elicited criticism from the Advocate.  Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins alleged in a report to Congress that letter 6173 violated laws governing IRS conduct and called upon the agency to make changes. The IRS refused.  It now appears that 6173 is back in nearly identical fashion. A copy of the letter shared with CoinDesk parrots its predecessor's tone and demands. The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The taxpayer who shared his letter with CoinDesk indicated he received the letter because he had not yet filed his 2019 returns.

The amount of gas, or the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain, is at an all-time high, meaning the resources used per block are increasing.

42384528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAYToX,1598387158,Forthcoming Yield Farming Project Dispenses With Governance,"Everyone may be talking about governance on Ethereum, but the yet-to-launch stablecoin startup Liquity is taking a contrarian view: zero governance.      That doesn't mean it won't offer a yield farming option, though, because there's no good reason not to deploy the popular growth hack when it's working so well elsewhere.      Liquity has started running ideas for farming schemes by its early supporters, including organizing a public Zoom session on the topic on Aug. 19.      The startup is making a stablecoin mint that works much like MakerDAO, lending against collateral with a low-volatility token. It has many major differences from the original decentralized finance (DeFi) project, however. Most notably, Liquity's smart contract will adjust as needed (a governance committee of token-holding people will not be needed).      Read more: One Billion, Two Billion, Three Billion, Four? DeFi’s Knocking on TradFi’s Door      ""All of the system parameters are automatically controlled by the algorithms,"" Robert Lauko, CEO of Liquity, told CoinDesk in a phone call. This takes it a little further than Reflexer Labs, which is also a twist on MakerDAO that takes a governance-minimized stance.      It all means Liquity won't have a governance token but is still planning on using liquidity mining to stimulate early adoption: It is offering a ""growth token"" (GT) that will continuously earn holders small amounts of revenue from Liquity fees.      Just which behaviors Liquity will reward with its GT remains a bit of an open question discussed on the recent call. The founders don't plan to actually release their system until early next year. In the meantime, they are gathering feedback on just which behaviors to incentivize.      Liquidity mining is a very specific category of yield farming, the one that has generated most of the excitement here in 2020 for DeFi. The idea is that people who entrust their crypto to some protocol will get some new token in return as an incentive. So far, that has generally been a governance token, one that gives holders the right to make decisions about a protocol. Governance tokens also carry a price, of course, so the allure of ""free money"" also serves as an effective incentive.      Read more: ETH Lite: Reflexer Labs Raises $1.7M to Build a Somewhat-Stable Coin for DeFi      The danger of eschewing governance is that mistakes can only be fixed with a fork, but allowing a broad user base to change a project carries its own risks. ""Auditors are somewhat very wary of upgrade patterns,"" Richard Pardoe, the core developer of Liquity and a co-founder, told CoinDesk.      Right now Liquity's founders are looking at models for how to reward users for getting in early      On a conference call to discuss the pros and cons of different incentives, Nicola Santoni of Lemniscap, a blockchain fund, said rewards can be ""like a drug in the DeFi space, very addictive.""    How it works    Liquity allows users to stake ether (ETH) and borrow a stablecoin against it, currently called LQTY. It's like MakerDAO in that way. Users stake ETH into what's called a ""trove"" and then they can borrow against the value of that ETH (much like MakerDAO's ""vaults"").      The advantage of Liquity to users is it allows for a collateralization ratio for lending of 110%, most of the time. In other words, it generally won't liquidate a loan unless collateralization falls below that ratio. That said, it also enforces an overall ratio across the protocol of 150%; if the average collateralization falls below that figure, it could start incentivizing users to top up their ETH deposits.      Liquity is able to offer lower collateralization because it has brought liquidations right into the smart contract. Users have an incentive to stake LQTY to its stability pool. Liquity will use this pool of tokens to retire troves that have fallen below the minimum collateralization. In exchange, everyone in the pool will share the ETH taken from the retired trove.      As a backup, if the stability pool runs out of LQTY, Liquity actually redistributes the ETH and the debt to everyone else in the system. Generally speaking, CEO Lauko explained, this should mean that most users end up with more in new ETH than they do in new debt.    Liquity's liquidity mining    Last week, about 20 or so supporters showed up on a Zoom call to discuss different incentive schemes for earning GT.      ""Early adopters will get more than latecomers. I think that's fully in line with how most projects are doing yield farming,"" Lauko said in the intro to the conference call.      Founders, advisers and investors will all get an allocation of GT, too, but the precise proportions are still undecided.      Liquity is also awarding some amount of GT to companies that set up frontends for Liquity, because it's not going to make one. Many crypto companies have encouraged others to build atop them (such as Dharma and Compound or Veil and Augur), but it's unusual for one not to make a frontend at all.      Read more: Crypto Lender Dharma Pivots to Stablecoin Savings Accounts      Other behaviors that Liquity might want to incentivize include: depositing into the stability pool, borrowing LQTY and contributing it to decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap. Then, of course, it can do some combo of all these things.      ""We don't want to create incentives that are forcing people into a behavior that isn't continuously helping the system,"" Ashleigh Schap, a member of the Uniswap team who's helping Liquity with business development, said on the call. For example, she pointed out, if there is too much reward for the stability pool, no one will actually use LQTY in the world.      ""The system only needs to be protected so much,"" she said.      Nicola Santoni of Lemniscap encouraged Liquity to try to find a way to make incentives shift with time. Early on, the team might need to attract one set of participants, whereas later the needs could change.      ""When you find your market, you might need to incentivize something else,"" he cautioned.      However, he noted this is challenging with a no-governance model.      Nothing was settled on during the call so interested parties with strong opinions about how to structure liquidity mining can still weigh in on Discord, where they can also find out about future community calls.

Senator Soraya Thronicke, a member of Brazil's Social Liberal Party, outlined on Monday rules for ""virtual asset"" businesses, custodians and issuers, consumer protections, crypto taxation, criminal enforcement and industry oversight in Brazil.  Brazil's central bank, securities watchdog, tax agency and financial oversight board would all take on concrete supervisory roles for the nascent industry. Until now, their respective crypto actions have been scattershot at best.  Pyramid schemers and crypto fraudsters would face new heat, too. Thronicke's draft law outlines stricter punishments and proposes amending Brazil's existing financial crimes laws to apply to crypto as well.  Thronicke told Agencia Senado that her rules would effectively ""extend the protection model already in force"" for electronic currency services to cryptocurrencies.  Brazilian cryptocurrency businesses have suffered from a lack of comprehensive crypto regulation, perhaps most notably through the banking sector's refusal to work with them.

Digital asset trust company BitGo is in the process of “reaching out” to community partners to build an Ethereum sidechain due to heightened fees, according to CTO Ben Chan in an email exchange.      BitGo’s premiere product wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) is an ERC-20 token with a 1-1 peg to bitcoin. It currently secures some 46,000 BTC worth just north of $500 million through a custodial patchwork.      “During the time the white paper was written, we wanted to consider potential solutions to rising fees. What we’ve seen this year is that WBTC traction has been largely thanks to the highly composable DeFi industry,” Chan said. “We will reach out to the community partners to see if they are interested in embarking upon a sidechain together.”      Read more: Decentralized Finance Frenzy Drives Ethereum Transaction Fees to All-Time Highs      Ethereum fee pressures have continued to escalate over the last six months, reaching all-time highs on Aug. 13. A general technical fix remains months to years away.      As for timing, Chan said BitGo is not “committed to anything in 2020.” He said the most difficult part of the undertaking is not technical but organizing community developers. (It’s worth noting that the definition of a general-purpose sidechain remains a hotly contested question in developer circles.)      “Community building and operational overhead is what we predict will take up more of this time, and this is difficult to estimate,” Chan said.    DeFi going to other blockchains?    DeFi, Ethereum’s latest runaway hustle, has led many competing blockchains to play catch-up. For example, the Tezos community launched a wrapped bitcoin project of its own last April.

For NEAR Protocol, Polkadot and Cosmos, composability with Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM) could allow established billion-dollar DeFi projects such as Compound or Aave to jump ship.      NEAR describes itself as a more developer-friendly, EVM-compatible alternative to Ethereum, while Polkadot continues to market itself as a “protocol for protocols” and has at least one Ethereum/Polkadot bridge in the works.      Cosmos, on the other hand, now has one project running. On Monday, developer houses Chainsafe and Tendermint released Ethermint, an EVM-compatible project built on a variant of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm called Tendermint.

You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Rich list The “Bitcoin Rich List,” or the number of wallets with at least 1,000 BTC (~$11.5 million), is at a record high. There are approximately 2,190 rich list addresses, surpassing the previous record of 2,184 set Sept. 28, 2019. This could reflect increased interest in bitcoin from institutions and high-net-worth investors, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports. The total amount of bitcoin held in accounts of 1,000 or more was 7,868,823 as of press time. That amounts to $92.2 billion.      Inflation watch U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to signal tolerance for higher inflation during his keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium on Thursday. According to analysts speaking to CoinDesk, that could ultimately lead to further drops in the dollar and greater buying power for bitcoin traders and investors, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The central bank has mostly missed its 2% inflation target since 2012. “The major impact for crypto out of this symposium would be a change in monetary policy and further depreciation of the U.S. dollar, which could propel bitcoin higher,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack.      Company breach A hacker has stolen data on more than 1,000 users from CryptoTrader.Tax, an online service used to calculate and file taxes on cryptocurrency trades. Breaking into a customer service employee’s account, on April 7, the hacker downloaded a file containing 13,000 rows of information, including 1,082 unique email addresses as well as names, payment processor profiles and messages sometimes containing cryptocurrency incomes. Screenshots of this information were later posted to a dark web forum.      BTC over banks Ottawa-based software startup, Snappa, said it will move 40% of its cash reserves into bitcoin, citing concerns of inflation, global economic uncertainty and the inferiority of traditional bank accounts. The initial 40% allocation is only the beginning for the seven-person startup, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports. ""We're still accumulating coins, and we don't plan on selling anytime soon,"" said co-founder Christopher Gimmer. ""If we're right about where bitcoin is heading then our allocation could get very high.""      Blockchain. Governments? Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei has set up a blockchain-based platform for the Beijing government to better track and manage its citizens’ data in everything from medical records and property registration to real-time vehicle parking status. This is part of China's larger “New Infrastructure Initiative” to transform digital governance with blockchain by making data immutable and transmissible. The Beijing government’s project aims to leverage the blockchain platform to make data shareable among more than 50 agencies within the municipality, CoinDesk’s David Pan reports.    Quick bites  Bitstamp to Move Clients’ Accounts From London to Luxembourg (Muyao Shen/CoinDesk)  Blockchain Project Qtum Moves to Boost Network Participation With Offline Staking (Sebastian Sinclair/CoinDesk)  DeFi teams accused of hoarding tokens and voting power (The Defiant/Decrypt)  Ethereum’s Fees Mean Choosing Between a World Computer and a Financial Network (Nic Carter/CoinDesk)  BitGo Applies to Be Regulated Custodian in New York State (Daniel Palmer/CoinDesk)  At stake    Layer1, the U.S. bitcoin mining startup backed by high-profile investors including Peter Thiel, has misdescribed the role of a supposed core team member in a recent pitch deck, according to that team member.      The U.S. startup boasts a mission of not just building top-notch bitcoin mining facilities but also launching the U.S’s first proprietary mining chips to compete with Chinese miner makers.      Its deck – which was shared with CoinDesk by an investor who received it from Layer1 around June – shows a management team slide in which Layer1 told potential investors that Liu Xiangfu, co-founder and a former director of Chinese bitcoin miner maker Canaan, is its Head of Supply Chain.      However, when reached for comment, Liu said he is not involved in Layer1’s business. “I introduced some of my friends to them. … That did help them when they [came] to China. But I’m not a shareholder [and do] not work for them,” Liu said via WeChat messages.      The discrepancy came to light as Layer1 has been working to raise $50 million in senior secured debts since June, according to a separate term sheet seen by CoinDesk and confirmed by Layer1.      It appears only a relatively small part of the raised fund came from external investors at the time, as the recent pitch deck shows that “Layer1 founders have contributed over $23 million of [their] own capital so far to this Series A financing.”    Market intel    Volatile assets Investors are expecting more volatility in ether (ETH) compared with bitcoin (BTC), according to a key metric, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The three-month spread between ether's volatility and bitcoin's has risen to 29%, the highest level since Feb. 23, according to data source Skew. “Investors are focused on DeFi and mindful of a potential big move in ETH,"" said Skew's CEO Emmanuel Goh. Implied volatility does not tell us anything about the direction of the next big move.      'Negative connotation' CoinDesk’s First Mover further dives into the volatility conundrum. The three-month spread between ether’s implied volatility and bitcoin’s has increased to 29%, the highest in six months, they write. As recently as June 28, the spread was as low as -2.8%, meaning bitcoin had the higher implied volatility at that point. Volatility often carries a negative connotation because traders often consider it a barometer of risk. In this case the rising spread appears to indicate a wide range of expectations in how DeFi might ultimately affect usage of the Ethereum network and demand for the ether. Get the full story by subscribing here.    Tech pod    Aave overtakes DeFi credit market Aave has pulled ahead of stablecoin mint MakerDAO for the title of most collateral staked on Ethereum, according to DeFi Pulse. Aave now has $1.47 billion worth of different crypto assets staked for credit lines, while MakerDAO has $1.45 billion in total value locked (TVL). This is only the second time that a project has had more “total value locked” (TVL) than MakerDAO, as measured by DeFi Pulse. In the recent surge of interest in DeFi, four projects have now broken $1 billion in assets as measured by DeFi Pulse at different times: MakerDAO, Compound, Aave and Curve, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports.    Op-ed    DeFi’s demise? Donna Redel, a board member of New York Angels and Adjunct Professor of Law at Fordham Law School, and Olta Andoni, Adjunct Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law and Of Counsel at Zlatkin Wong, think DeFi is playing a dangerous game. Drawing illusions to the initial coin offering boom, these prominent crypto lawyers see the industry’s “hottest” sector is flirting with regulatory violations. “We believe that, at a minimum, the industry needs self-regulation. Without it, it is on a trajectory to serious regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk… Calling a project an “experimental game” or an ‘innovation’ is not sufficient to take it out of the regulatory ambit,” they write.

The report said F-Secure’s investigators found operational similarities between this attack and other efforts that have been associated with the Lazarus group.   Carried out as a phishing attack, the hackers used a LinkedIn message to send over a fake job offer document to a systems administrator at the crypto firm that when downloaded allowed the attackers to get in through the back door.   Once in, the hackers used backdoor network implants and malware to extract information from the infected computers. According to the report, the attackers also employed Mimikatz, a tailored form of malware used to extract crypto wallet information or bank account details.   “The evidence also suggests this is part of an ongoing campaign targeting organizations in over a dozen countries,” Matt Lawrence, the Helsinki-based F-secure’s director of detection and response, said in a blog post on the firm’s website.

42404987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe97wb,1598370345,Ethereum Tokens Worth $1B Vulnerable to 'Fake Deposit Attack',"Over $1 billion worth of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain are missing a software standard released in 2017, setting them up to be hijacked and drained from trading exchanges, according to new research.      The software vulnerability, called a fake deposit exploit, was pinpointed in 7,772 issuers of ERC-20 tokens, according to research from Peking University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Zhejiang University and the University of Queensland.      The research states that by manipulating code in the smart contracts, or programming scripts, of ERC-20 tokens listed on cryptocurrency exchanges with deficient transaction verification methods, a hacker can fraudulently siphon exorbitant amounts of funds at nearly no cost. The fake deposit attack could then crash the exchange, causing holders of the ERC-20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies to lose their funds.      Read more: How Do Ethereum Smart Contracts Work?      Some holders could also have trouble accessing utilities purchased with the ERC-20 tokens, which are increasingly tied to goods and necessities such as energy, real estate and insurance.      “If the fake deposit attack is carried out, it is for sure a great disaster for the token,” said one of the researchers, Haoyu Wang, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications associate professor of computer science. “Worst case, the token has to be reissued.”    Possible fixes    Because smart contracts are permanent on the Ethereum blockchain and cannot be reversed, the onus falls on cryptocurrency exchanges to fix ERC-20 token procedures already prone to the fake deposit attack. Fabian Vogelsteller, the Ethereum developer who created ERC-20 coins, said cryptocurrency exchanges can blacklist malicious token contracts.      Read more: Token Sales Are Back in 2020      Zhejiang University cyber-science associate professor Lei Wu, a second member of the research team, also suggested releasing so-called proxy smart contracts to keep open the option of replacing old Ethereum smart contracts. However, some Ethereum developers have avoided writing proxy smart contracts because they carry their own security risks.      For ERC-20 tokens in the works, the Ethereum Foundation recommends Ethereum blockchain developers implement the protective smart contract software standard as a failsafe against inattentive cryptocurrency exchanges, Wang and Wu said.    How it works: Transaction duping    An ERC-20 smart contract without the Ethereum blockchain software standard EIP-20, introduced in 2017, relies on what is known in computer science as a conditional programming statement to check for insufficient token balances. The conditional statement outputs a “return false” statement that blocks a token transaction from being terminated. This “return false” statement becomes the basis for the fake deposit attack on cryptocurrency exchanges that do not perform security checks after the programming functions “transfer” and “transferFrom” are called.      The attack first works by issuing an ERC-20 smart contract to a cryptocurrency exchange and transferring one ERC-20 token to an exchange account. On a decentralized exchange, the programming function “depositToken” can then tell the “transferFrom” function to deposit however many tokens into the attacker’s account. On a centralized exchange, the “transfer” function is instead called, with the smart contract’s “_to” and “_value” fields set to the attacker’s account address and desired token amount.    Which ERC-20 tokens are at risk?    The vulnerable tokens with the most trading volumes on decentralized exchanges, CloudBric, MovieCredits, BullandBear, LOVE and EtherDOGE, have had little, if any activity, according to the research. These ERC-20 tokens are circulating on three decentralized exchanges, IDEX, DDEX and Ether Delta, which patched the vulnerability this month, according to the study’s researchers.      Read more: Decentralized Exchange Volumes Rose 174% in July, Topping $4.3B and Setting Second Straight Record      In contrast, 7,716 of the ERC-20 tokens vulnerable to the fake deposit attack – 99.2% of those identified – are listed on centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, OkEx and Kraken. Affected tokens on centralized exchanges, where the bulk of the standard-missing ERC-20 tokens are trading, were valued at more than $1.1 billion in April.      Baer Chain’s BRC token, the Brave privacy web browser’s Basic Attention Token (BAT), the Huobi Chinese cryptocurrency exchange’s HPT token, the Rocket Pool Ethereum app service’s RPL token and the Power Ledger electrical grid blockchain’s PWR token had the highest recorded market capitalizations of the vulnerable tokens held on centralized exchanges. Approximately $391,000 in 87,000 BRC, $388,000 in 305,000 BAT, $63,000 in 1,000 HRT, $39,000 in 3,000 RPL and $28,000 in 50,000 PWR were affected, the research said.    Limited identification    When asked, the computer scientists declined to identify the affected Ethereum coins besides those with the top five volumes on decentralized exchanges and the top 5 market capitalizations on centralized exchanges. The researchers also did not determine which centralized exchanges have not undertaken recommended Ethereum token security procedures.      “For the vulnerabilities and attacks we identified, some of them have been confirmed,” Wang said. Neither the researchers nor PeckShield, a blockchain security company that collaborated with the research team, are choosing to publicly identify vulnerable tokens other than the 10 that are known, Wang said.      Yan Zhu, Brave Software chief information security officer, said the vulnerability is not linked to the Brave browser wallet, and that the affected Basic Attention Tokens were deployed without proxy smart contracts before Ethereum blockchain standard EIP-20 was modified in 2017 to integrate the software implementation that prevents the fake deposit attack.      Read more: Gemini Crypto Exchange Integrates With Privacy-Focused Brave Browser      Power Ledger, on the other hand, deployed its affected ERC-20 tokens even after the Ethereum Foundation released the updated EIP-20 software implementation. For now, John Bulich, Power Ledger technical director, advises Power Ledger customers to “hold their own crypto assets in their own secure wallets” and “not trust centralized exchanges with anything more than their current trading stock.”      The five known issuers of the tokens affected on centralized exchanges did not respond to queries as to whether they have checked with cryptocurrency exchanges about the vulnerability.

Ultimately, LastBit wants to allow bitcoin users to walk into any shop and make a purchase with bitcoin, regardless of whether or not the merchant accepts it.      ""We simply want to see the masses using bitcoin on a day-to-day basis. To do this, we have engineered arguably the most seamless interoperability between bitcoin and fiat, on top of the Lightning Network, that caters to the needs of both new and experienced users alike,"" Balasubramanian told CoinDesk.    European and US expansion    Toward that goal, they're working in both Europe and the U.S. to open up the possibility of sending bitcoin payments to vendors.      Funded by Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, crypto exchange Binance and database creator MongoDB, among others, the startup cut its teeth in the University of California, Berkeley's accelerator program.      Now, as a ""small company without millions in the bank,"" LastBit has found Visa's Fast Track program to be a good fit, said Balasubramanian.      Read more: This Visa Card Gives Bitcoin Rewards on Dollars Spent      ""The Visa FastTrack program appeared to solve these problems for us to get to market faster and this was why we applied to their program despite being below their ‘minimum funding requirement’ of $1 million,"" Balasubramanian said.      While LastBit is working with Visa for U.S. payments, it already has approval to get going in the European Union from MasterCard. That's the focus for now, with the hopes of proving the product works.      ""With a solid product, partnerships and notable investors [...] behind us, we're going to roll out our Bitcoin, Lightning and EUR interoperable payments layer in the EU to prove that this actually works and that a small company without millions can pull off a complex payments product to push for Bitcoin adoption,"" Balasubramanian said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/25/another-bitcoin-lightning-startup-is-working-with-visa-to-fast-track-card-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6737df691b9c8c8c260f10c67559340d4534fa84-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

From Aug. 26, Binance customers will be able to trade PAX Gold (PAXG) against the exchange's own stablecoin BUSD and exchange token Binance coin (BNB), as well as bitcoin (BTC).  PAX Gold ""will offer [its] users an easy and safe opportunity to gain exposure to real, regulated gold,” said Rich Teo, Paxos co-founder and CEO Asia.  A New York-based crypto exchange and stablecoin issuer, Paxos launched the gold-backed stablecoin last September.  Each Ethereum-based token has the legal title to an ounce of physical gold stored in the Brink’s London vault, though traders can own as little as $1 worth.  Binance’s decision to add support for PAXG comes nearly three weeks after gold’s price reached a record high of $2,075 per ounce.  The historical inflation hedge has rallied by 27% this year and analysts at Goldman Sachs expect prices to rise further to $2,300 in the next 12 months.  ""Gold is an asset that has had enduring value from generation to generation. With PAX Gold now on Binance, investors can easily get and trade gold with the click of a button,"" said Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of Binance.  Pax Gold has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services.  Also announced Tuesday, CF Benchmarks has launched a benchmark price index for Pax Gold against the U.S. dollar.  The index will provide a daily settlement and spot rate, refreshed every second, according to an announcement.

42404989,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe980X,1598362275,First Mover: Ether Price Swings Make Bitcoin Look Tame as DeFi Speculation Spreads,"Market moves    The explosive growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, on the Ethereum blockchain has brought unwanted attention to the recent surge in congestion on the network, with a resulting jump in transaction fees.      There's another consequence for crypto traders: Rising volatility in prices for ether, the blockchain's native cryptocurrency. That's especially true when ether's volatility is compared with that of bitcoin.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team and edited by Bradley Keoun, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The three-month spread between ether's implied volatility and bitcoin's has increased to 29%, the highest in six months, according to data source Skew. As recently as June 28, the spread was as low of -2.8%, meaning bitcoin had the higher implied volatility at that point.      Volatility often carries a negative connotation because traders often consider it a barometer of risk. In this case the rising spread appears to indicate a wide range of expectations in how DeFi might ultimately affect usage of the Ethereum network and demand for the ether.      “Ether's rising volatility is a byproduct of its own success,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, a London-based cryptocurrency exchange and institutional brokerage, said in a Telegram chat. ""Success comes with risks, the need to hedge.”      Implied volatility represents the market's expectations of how volatile or risky an asset would be over a specific period. It's not necessarily bullish or bearish: Heightened implied volatility simply means that future price swings might lie ahead.      “Investors are focused on DeFi and mindful of a potential big move in ETH,"" Emmanuel Goh, CEO of the crypto-derivatives data firm Skew, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      DeFi tokens have been among the hottest performers in cryptocurrency markets this year, with steep rallies in Chainlink’s LINK and the Kyber Network’s KNC. The open-source lending protocol Aave's LEND token has risen more than 30-fold.      The Ethereum network's recent spell of congestion has pushed the average transaction fee to record highs above $6.      The heightened volatility expectations might also be an indication of how volatile prices have been this year for ether itself. The second-largest cryptocurrency has tripled, gaining on bitcoin, which is up a respectable 64%.      Demand for options, or the need to hedge, tends to pick up with price rallies and major fundamental developments, and implied volatilities are primarily driven by the net buying pressure for options contracts like price calls and puts.      This is what success looks like right now for Ethereum.      - Omkar Godbole, Markets Reporter    Bitcoin watch    Despite the recent pullback in bitcoin prices, analysts are still bullish in the long term, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expected to bolster inflation expectations in a highly anticipated speech Thursday.    “Powell has previously stated that he doesn't think inflation is a significant risk and is prepared to see it overshoot to meet his objectives,” Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  “The major impact for crypto out of this symposium would be a change in monetary policy and further depreciation of the dollar, which could propel bitcoin higher,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack.  Multiple rejections above $12,000 seen over the past three weeks have put brakes on the rally from July lows below $9,000.  A deeper pullback may be seen if the immediate support at $11,000 is breached, according to analysts at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index futures.  The 10-year breakeven rate, which measures the inflation expectations, has risen to pre-Covid levels above 1.6% from the low of 0.5% observed during the March crash.  Bitcoin has pretty much tracked inflation expectations higher over the past five months, while the dollar index has declined by nearly 10%.  The cryptocurrency has witnessed bigger year-to-date gains in the U.S. dollar terms, compared to the rally seen in terms of other currencies like the euro and the Japanese yen.  The data suggests bitcoin's recent rally has been primarily fueled by the broad-based sell-off in the dollar.    - Omkar Godbole, Markets Reporter    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    S&P 500 forward P/E multiple now at 25.98, highest since dot-com era (WSJ)      Gold ETFs now hold more gold than every central bank except Federal Reserve (BNN Bloomberg)      Nouriel Roubini sees ""no clear alternative currency"" to replace USD as reserve currency (MarketWatch)      Money-market yields so close to negative that BlackRock, Fidelity cut fees (WSJ)      HSBC, ABN, Credit Suisse, UBS cutting back as margins shrink, loan losses swell (WSJ)    Tweet of the Day  What's Hot    Central banks in countries with large populations of off-the-books workers are moving faster on digital currencies (Bank for International Settlements) A recent paper by the Bank for International Settlements looks at the economic reasoning behind central bank digital currencies and how they may be shaped for future implementation via mainstream adoption.

42404986,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe97xa,1598362202,ConsenSys Acquires JPMorgan's Quorum Blockchain,"Quorum, the enterprise blockchain platform developed by mega-bank JPMorgan Chase, is being acquired by ConsenSys, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Ethereum venture studio.      Additionally, JPMorgan has made an undisclosed strategic investment in ConsenSys, the companies said in a statement. Neither ConsenSys nor JPMorgan would confirm the size of the investment made by the bank.      ConsenSys did confirm it was in the process of raising funds and has a range of additional investors joining JPMorgan.      In terms of how the acquisition will be integrated into the Ethereum conglomerate, from now on, JPMorgan will be a customer of ConsenSys, which is offering software support and services to projects deployed on Quorum.      All enterprise work being done at ConsenSys will now fall under the new “ConsenSys Quorum” brand, and ConsenSys plans to merge its existing protocol engineering roadmap with Quorum, leveraging the best of both codebases.      “One of the parts of taking over this technology is that we'll be supporting JPMorgan in [its] blockchain efforts,” ConsenSys engineering manager Daniel Heyman said in an interview. “Then we’ll be able to leverage a lot of the work that JPMorgan has done that's been internal for a long time, and support the ecosystem as other people want to use that technology.”    Victim of success    As more projects began building on Quorum, a privacy-centric fork of Ethereum, it became obvious to many in the blockchain world that a bank isn’t the right place to maintain a large scale open-source software project. It was first rumored that Quorum could be heading to Brooklyn in February of this year.      JPMorgan and CEO Jamie Dimon received a lot of press for the “JPM Coin” project, which is tokenized cash on the Quorum ledger. Other high-profile initiatives within the bank include the Interbank Information Network, which has over 200 other banks as members, and Dromaius, a debt issuance platform on Quorum.      “As of today, JPM Coin will be built on top of ConsenSys Quorum,” said Heyman. “So while JPM Coin is 100% JPMorgan’s, we're very excited that we’ll be supporting it as a software vendor and helping make them successful, as well as other projects like the Interbank Information Network.”      Other projects on Quorum – such as tokenized loans being done by IHS Markit or AURA, the track-and-trace system being built by LVMH – will not receive any funding from ConsenSys, Heyman said, but they will be in line for other benefits.      “Anyone building on Quorum will get a proper software vendor behind their technology,” said Heyman. “They’ll get a roadmap that’s very explicit publicly maintained that they can build against and move towards, and a suite of features and functionality they can now purchase to accelerate their time to market.”    Interoperability play    Another important factor for ConsenSys is locking down interoperability between Quorum and Hyperlegder Besu. The latter is an enterprise Ethereum client built by ConsenSys engineers from the ground up to be compatible with the Ethereum public mainnet. The main elements to be aligned to make Besu and Quorum talk to each other include the consensus mechanisms, API interfaces and privacy tools, said Heyman.      “Besu will continue exactly as it is, which is part of the Hyperlegder community and not ours to control. Obviously we’re heavily invested in moving it forward,” Heyman said. “When we sell an enterprise Ethereum stack, we’re going to be calling it ConsenSys Quorum, and it will have two options: the Go Quorum–based version, or the Hyperledger Besu–based version.”      The JPMorgan news was welcomed by Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, who said it was exciting and positive for the enterprise blockchain community.      “It answers concerns about commercial support for enterprises [that] have deployed Quorum and, more importantly, it helps efforts to bring greater interoperability and code re-use between Quorum and Hyperledger Besu,” Behlendorf said in an email to CoinDesk.      Behlendorf, a respected figure in the open-source software world, said the acquisition should make it easy for enterprises that prefer Java, or prefer the Apache 2.0 license, or even prefer to work with other Besu-based vendors, to join the various Quorum-based networks that have emerged.      “This is textbook open-source ‘co-opetition’ at its finest, where competitors can realize they’re actually stronger working together than trying to divide a market,” said Behlendorf. “We look forward to helping ConsenSys and JPMorgan (who are both Hyperledger Premier Members) and other ecosystem members drive adoption.”      In terms of whether Quorum engineers previously employed at the mega-bank would be making the trip to Brooklyn and joining ConsenSys, Heyman said:    “Yeah, absolutely. We’ll be working closely with the JPM engineers on this and we’re going to be building out our own team dedicated towards Quorum on the protocol group.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/25/consensys-acquires-jpmorgans-quorum-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49eec3d59c41ebf5f749ca4bac3c8d61d945a0c2-1449x851.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Tuesday, the fork – when the blockchain divides to provide an alternative version with different features – will usher in a new code release at block 680,000, expected Aug. 28.  The upgrade will enable offline wallet address owners to delegate their blockchain-based holdings – technically termed unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) – to an online node operating Qtum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.  PoS is a distributed consensus mechanism that allows users to vote on governance decisions and support the blockchain by dedicating, or ""staking,"" tokens, earning them network fees as a reward.  Qtum previously only allowed participants to stake tokens online via a full node, but participation was limited by users who did not want to, or could not, run a full node.  Offline staking is expected to increase participation, while also enhancing Qtum's ""democratic, distributed, and secure"" functionality, according to a statement.

42404988,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe97yZ,1598356848,Jerome Powell's Coming Inflation Speech May Weigh on Dollar and Boost Bitcoin: Analysts,"U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to bolster expectations of inflation during his keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium on Thursday.      According to analysts speaking to CoinDesk, that could ultimately lead to further drops in the dollar and greater buying power for bitcoin traders and investors.    The Fed chief is expected to signal tolerance for higher inflation during the speech, with the central bank having mostly missed its 2% inflation target since 2012.  “Powell has previously stated that he doesn't think inflation is a significant risk and is prepared to see it overshoot to meet his objectives,” Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk over WhatsApp.  A more relaxed approach to managing price pressures could power a stronger rise in long-term inflation in the U.S.  “The major impact for crypto out of this symposium would be a change in monetary policy and further depreciation of the U.S. dollar, which could propel bitcoin higher,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack.  Inflation is expected by many in the cryptocurrency space to be a driving factor for bitcoin gains, as it's perceived to be a hedge asset similar to gold.  The symposium, attended by central bankers, Federal Reserve members, economists, financial organizations and academics, among others, will be held virtually this year.  Inflated expectations  The 10-year breakeven rate, which gauges the market's expectations of inflation, has risen to pre-coronavirus levels above 1.6% from a low of 0.5% observed during the March markets crash.  Bitcoin has largely tracked the metric higher over the past five months, while the dollar index has declined by nearly 10%.  The cryptocurrency has witnessed greater year-to-date gains in U.S.-dollar terms compared to those seen against other currencies such as the euro and Japanese yen:  The data suggests bitcoin's recent rally has been to some extent fueled by the diminishing value of the dollar.  While the rally appears to be on pause right now, bitcoin looks well positioned to benefit from a resurgence in inflation and further devaluation of the dollar over the long term.  At press time, bitcoin is trading near $11,550, representing a 1.8% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  Multiple rejections above $12,000 seen over the past three weeks have put brakes on the rally from July lows below $9,000.  A deeper pullback may be seen if the immediate support at $11,000 is breached, according to analysts at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index futures.

In a consultation paper published Monday, the FCA said under the expanded scope of its financial crime reporting obligation it would require crypto exchanges and wallet providers to provide detailed information annually on systems and controls put in place to tackle crimes such as money laundering.  The regulator said that currently only 2,500 out of the roughly 23,000 firms under its oversight must provide such data, including banks, building societies and mortgage providers.  Aside from crypto firms, the extended measure would include entities such as all companies regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Authority, payment providers, electric money institutions and multilateral and organized trading facilities.  The FCA said the extra information the reporting would provide would enable it to be more ""date led"" in its supervision and widen its insight into firms that may carry money laundering risks.

42404979,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe97qh,1598344200,Australian Conman Extradited Over Alleged Fraud Involving $1.2M in Bitcoin,"After a dramatic arrest, an Australian serial conman has been extradited to New South Wales to face fraud charges involving over $1 million in bitcoin.    A Tuesday report by The Sydney Morning Herald said Peter Foster had been escorted by detectives to Sydney, NSW, from Queensland where he had been arrested Thursday.  Foster was tackled by undercover police pretending to be early morning joggers on a Port Douglas beach in the northern state.  After an investigation that kicked off in June, police alleged that from April last year Foster masqueraded under the false name Bill Dawson and scammed victim Konstantinos Stylianopoulos.  Stylianopoulos had entrusted bitcoin to Foster, who then allegedly transferred it to his own account at the Australia-based crypto exchange Independent Reserve.  The fraud netted Foster 1.73 million Australian dollars (US$1.24 million) worth of bitcoin in transactions of between $125,000 and $890,000 on multiple occasions.  Foster has been described as a career criminal, having previously spent time in jail in Australia, the U.K., the U.S., and Vanuatu for fraud-related crimes.  Paul Dunstan, the Sydney City Police area commander detective acting superintendent, noted Foster's repeat offenses and said Foster was ""a significant fraud offender.""  The charges relating to his arrest include five counts of publishing false and misleading material to obtain advantage and 10 counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception.  He is also being charged with knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime with intent to conceal, according to the Herald.  On Tuesday, Foster's legal representation appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court via video link opting not to apply for bail. The case will return to court on Oct. 22.

Aave now has $1.47 billion worth of different crypto assets staked for credit lines, while MakerDAO has $1.45 billion in total value locked (TVL).      ""Reaching the highest TVL was possible due to the wide range of developers building on top of Aave who are expressing their innovation in DeFi,"" Stani Kulechov, Aave CEO, told CoinDesk. “This innovation has sparked interest from institutions [that] are now dipping their toes into Aave.”      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      This is only the second time a project has had more ""total value locked"" (TVL) than MakerDAO, as measured by DeFi Pulse. On June 20, fueled by a yield farming rush spurred on by the initial distribution of its governance token COMP, Compound took the lead for collateral locked up until late July.      For context, though, when MakerDAO and Compound switched positions, each had about $480 million in TVL. MakerDAO now has well over twice the collateral locked up as it had then.      In the recent surge of interest in DeFi, four projects have now broken $1 billion in assets as measured by DeFi Pulse at different times: MakerDAO, Compound, Aave and Curve.    Fertile soil    Founded as EthLend, Aave was conceived as a peer-to-peer crypto lender, funded by a 2017 initial coin offering that raised $16.2 million, according to Messari. It later pivoted to the pooled lending approach it uses today.      With creative new communities of yield farmers coming up with wild schemes, Aave has proven to be a key financial backbone of some projects, as Devin Walsh of CoinFund explained to CoinDesk.      In particular, she noted that Curve and Yearn Finance rely on Aave. ""Stablecoin deposits into either of those protocols will ultimately be deposited into Aave's money markets. Both Yearn and Curve's yield farming programs have contributed to the massive spike in TVL over the past few weeks and in particular over the past week,"" she wrote in an email.      Read more: Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum      Another relevant project is Opium, which announced Saturday it had created a credit default swap (CDS) on the Aave protocol. A CDS is a type of contract that insures the buyer against a third party defaulting on a loan. These instruments are best known for their role in the 2008 financial crisis, though they arguably provide markets an early warning signal of credit problems.      Aave has announced a governance token distribution plan, but it has not yet taken effect.
