42379403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iSJ,1491514265,Bitcoin Hardware Maker Canaan Calls for Mining Industry Changes,"In the wake of allegations that bitcoin hardware manufacturers may be engaging in unfair practices, one of the industry's largest mining chip providers is calling for new transparency in the sector.  In a new interview with Canaan Creative, maker of the Avalon chip series, spokesperson Steven Mosher said the company is willing to take the first step to make its practices more open, arguing accusations levied against fellow chip maker Bitmain have exposed an issue that those in the industry now need to correct.  The comments come during a time of deep division in the community about assertions made by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell in a reddit post last night.  Unpacked further in our CoinDesk explainer, the resulting controversy has rekindled bitcoin's scaling debate, and unearthed new ethical questions about how miners should be expected to engage with the bitcoin blockchain.  Mosher, who heads the company's sales and marketing outside of mainland China, said that regardless of whether the allegations prove true, it's the ""perception"" that miners may be harmful to the network that is dangerous.  Mosher told CoinDesk:  ""Even the perception of an attack... A denial costs you ink. We want to get to the place where the software guys have more of an idea of what we're doing.""  Mosher went on to address what he acknowledged was the business necessity that miners face the issue, given the fact that bitcoin's developer community has shown an increasing willingness to consider protocol changes that would reduce the power – or even eliminate the need for miners altogether.  Already, other blockchain networks are in the midst of such protocol changes, as ethereum plans to switch to a new consensus algorithm, proof-of-stake, designed specifically to eliminate the type of hardware mining seen in bitcoin.  At the same time, Mosher sidestepped the nuances of the debate, stating that while this would likely spark a debate about the forensics of mining chips and what can be achieved, Canaan prefers to stay out of such speculation.  ""People shouldn't process this on anecdote. There's going to be a forensic look at it, let it be a transparent look at it,"" he said.  However, Mosher did address the technique at the heart of the controversy, the use of a patented technology called AsicBoost in an attempt to optimize mining returns.  ""Do we support AsicBoost? The answer is no,"" Mosher said.  Mosher continued, stating that he would like for major mining hardware providers to meet as part of an effort to make more information public about their practices.  ""Standing up and recounting the past, recounting Hong Kong or said what, or who called who a dipshit, it's time for the grown-ups to do what we know how to do,"" he said, adding:  ""We have to be open about what we're doing and what our intentions are.""

42379421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87inh,1491504642,Litecoin Price Nears Two-Year High As SegWit Hopes Rise,"Litecoin prices continued a recent rally today, pushing the digital currency to its highest value in more than one year.  Far from a standard cryptocurrency pump, however, the market appears to be responding strongly to its technical roadmap. Namely, the increase comes as the network nears the key 75% support level needed to activate Segregated Witness, a scaling solution that will boost block capacity.  While signaling had declined slightly to 67% at press time, litecoin traded as high as $11.32 today, up nearly 40% in the space of 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Late yesterday, the digital currency even reached $11.42, its highest price since May 2014.  These recent price increases have built on the gains the cryptocurrency began experiencing roughly one week ago, when the digital asset surged nearly 70% on 30th March.  As a result of these continued upward price movements, litecoin's value surged more than 100% in a week. According to Coinmarketcap.com, 24-hour volume surpassed $250m today, a drastic increase from the $10m recorded during the 30th March rally.  SegWit support builds  The major development that has coincided with litecoin's continued rise is progress toward obtaining the support levels needed for activating SegWit.  First designed for use on the bitcoin blockchain, SegWit would nonetheless increase litecoin's block capacity by altering how transaction date is stored by the network.  Once breached, the level of support will need to remain at or above the 75% threshold level for 8,064 blocks (roughly two weeks) before it can officially be implemented.  The recent rally in litecoin prices compares to a long period when the digital currency's price experienced little volatility.  The price of litecoin rose to more than $50 in late 2013 but has traded below $20 since early 2014.

42379408,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iUp,1491499279,Bitcoin's New Controversy: The AsicBoost Allegations Explained,"Bitcoin is abuzz with fresh controversy following an inflammatory new post by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell in which he alleges some miners are engaging in unfair practices that may be harmful to the network.  Posted to the bitcoin mailing list last night, the entry asserts that a mining hardware maker is secretly exploiting a previously known weakness in bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm that enables them to mine roughly 20% faster than competitors.  The allegation is that this activity is ongoing, and that this has been proven by an analysis conducted on a mining chip.  Here's where the intellectual gymnastics begin.  Of note is that the technology in use has already been patented by developers Timo Hanke and Sergio Demian Lerner in a scheme called ""AsicBoost"" for which a patent was filed in November 2014.  Maxwell contends that someone has discovered what he called a ""covert"" version of the technology used in a mining chip. He did not state who conducted the analysis, whether him or a separate party.  Taking a step further into speculation, the inference of the post is that Segregated Witness, a scaling solution developed and proposed by the Bitcoin Core team, would render the covert version of AsicBoost discovered obsolete, hurting the bottom lines of any miners using the workaround.  As such, the statement has stoked controversy in bitcoin's long-simmering scaling debate in that the allegation that the miner engaged in the practice is China-based Bitmain – one of the industry’s largest providers of mining equipment. (Bitmain has a separate patent for the AsicBoost technology in China).  The assertion is that Bitmain is not only blocking a technical solution favored by the Core developers (through its support of alternative development teams), but doing so because it would enhance its profitability at the expense of users.  In statements, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu has vehemently denied that the company is using the AsicBoost workaround on the bitcoin blockchain.  ""There is no relationship between SegWit and AsicBoost,"" Wu told CoinDesk.  Bitmain released a statement on Thursday, adding that they tested AsicBoost, but they never used it in a real mining capacity, and further pointed to an agreement where they expressed support for SegWit in the past.  Even those involved in the debate acknowledged that, given present information, it remains difficult to prove whether the allegations are true.  Former COO of bitcoin mining firm BTCC, Samson Mow, told CoinDesk that the post confirms rumors that have been floating around for some time, though he did not offer any new evidence in the conversation.  Mow told CoinDesk:  ""This is not something that you're going to get solid proof for, but there’s smoking guns all around. All the science points to manipulation.""  What is AsicBoost?  First things first, it may be beneficial to understand the specific mining technique at the center of the allegations.  In short, AsicBoost is best described as a ""mathematical trick."" Instead of taking a huge amount of computation, miners can use the technique to whittle down their choices of potential hashes that enable them to solve a puzzle and claim bitcoin's rewards.  These mathematical tricks can lead to an increase in mining profitability by boosting key mining hardware profitability ratios.  For example, a primary measurement of mining profitability is the amount of money earned in gigahashes per second (GH/s). This is most often measured in USD per Gh/s.  The other measure of hardware profitability involves determining energy consumption, commonly measured in Joules, and dividing that by the hashing speed. This is the Joule per Gh/s.  The creators of the technology claim these key ratios are improved by roughly 20% thanks to AsicBoost.  According to mining firm representatives, the technique has been known for some time, though it is largely out of use through a combination of patent protection and industry standards that aren't enforced by any body or organization.  But this isn't AsicBoost?  Going back to Maxwell's original post, what's being speculated is that the company in question, allegedly Bitmain, isn't using AsicBoost exactly.  Rather, the mining chip in is said to implement another version of the idea whereby it is implemented in the hardware. Further, it is argued that Segregated Witness would, as a bi-product of its code, make this specific technique obsolete.  Should this be correct, and should the mining chip maker be implementing the chip widely, it's argued that they may have a business interest in blocking the software.  For mining firms, which produce mining chips on a massive scale, the pace of technological innovation renders hardware obsolete within a period of months. It is argued that such a recall could be potentially devastating, adding pressures to the scaling argument.  Exploitation or efficiency?  At the center of the issue is whether the specific technology use represents a natural desire for a competitive advantage, and whether miners can be working ""against the network"" if no rule prevents them from engaging in that activity.  For example, there is no rule that currently prevents use of the AsicBoost design, meaning that miners have more of an unspoken agreement to refrain from using the technique on the basis it is ""bad"" for the network.  As explained by an executive at one of the world’s largest mining firms, who wished to speak on privacy citing business concerns, the practice is widely known, and has little impact on their operations.  ""They operate differently, but that I think it is normal. Jihan [Wu] said it is the freedom given by protocol so they can do it,"" he said.  Mow noted that the technique isn't ""kosher"" among miners, as it essentially enables them to try to solve bitcoin's puzzle, without performing any useful work – say, processing transactions.  Notably, others don’t think ""attack"" or ""flaw"" is the right term, arguing it’s simply a way for miners to mine more efficiently.  IC3 co-director Emin Gün Sirer, for example, asserted in a blog post that there isn't enough public evidence yet to verify Maxwell’s claims.  Merkle grinding?  The details of the so-called ""attack"" are rather technicalhttps://pastebin.com/RU5SXsFE, but in its most basic form it deals with how miners find blocks.  To recap the mining process, miners use specially designed equipment to repeatedly hash bitcoin block data (or turn it into a fixed-length scrambled string of letters and numbers) until they hit a particular solution that unlocks bitcoin mining rewards.  There’s certain data that miners aren't supposed to know before they calculate hashes so that miners all have to go through the same calculation process, leveling the playing field.  The problem, developers claim, is with the hashing algorithm, which miners can exploit in a couple ways. For one, the subject of Maxwell’s post, is a technique that developers call ""merkle grinding."" But, Maxwell claims that some miners found a clever way of finding out more about the data that they expect to find ahead of time.  In each block header there's a ""merkle root"" that you can think of as a summary of the transactions bundled in a block. Miners can order transaction data in the merkle tree such that they need to calculate less data.  ""If the miner finds multiple candidate root values which have the same final 32-bit then they can use the attack,"" Maxwell writes.  This speeds up the process. Essentially, if it goes according to plan, it means occasionally skipping a step.  Further, some developers contend that one sign that this technique being used is that some miners have been mining blocks without transactions, making it easier to reorder transactions in the merkle tree. (Bitmain, specifically, has been known to occasionally mine empty blocks).  Who's saying what?  Notably, Timo Hanke, AsicBoost co-inventor and former Cointerra CTO, allege that the argument that AsicBoost is inhibiting Segwit adoption is overplayed.  While admitting via Twitter that AsicBoost could potentially be used for purposes that may be detrimental to the network, he said he would not support any Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would use the technology to harm bitcoin.  AsicBoost co-creater Sergio Lerner noted on Twitter that newly proposed Segwit2MB, an alternative to SegWit, would also prevent miners from continuing to utilize the exploit.  Still, the big worry is that this technique is being used to further centralize mining in bitcoin – a problem that developers have been concerned about for a long time – since miners using the faster mining technology could have an advantage over those who don’t.  ""Patents conferring large advantage are a problem for bitcoin,"" Blockstream CEO Adam Back said.  Further, there's an economic advantage to the attack. A mining pool comprising 50% of the bitcoin mining power could save as much as $100m per year by exploiting the flaw, Maxwell noted.  Others have gone on to theorize that, since SegWit somehow fixes the problem, there might be an economic reason that miners do not support the solution.  ""If you had a $100m cash cow, and it gets destroyed by a feature, you do everything you can to block it,"" argued developer Alphonse Pace.  Maxwell added that this implication is exactly why he began looking into the issue, adding:  ""An incompatibility would go a long way to explain some of the more inexplicable behavior from some parties in the mining ecosystem.""

42379407,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iYb,1491494458,Samsung Targets Blockchain Consortia With Nexledger Tech,"Global technology giant Samsung today unveiled its Nexledger blockchain platform, alongside a series of other announcements.  The solution is portrayed as an enterprise-grade blockchain platform hosted with cloud computing, in a Korean Herald report today. But details uncovered by CoinDesk indicate that Samsung may be targeting the increasingly crowded consortia business model with this latest release.  A trademark filed by Samsung for the Nexledger name describes the technology as a permissioned blockchain system created specifically to form a consortium.  The trademark describes Nexledger as:  ""A platform based on permissioned blockchain model that is composed of only trusted participants in order to block potential access from unspecified nodes whose trust is not guaranteed.""  The consortia model aims to optimize blockchain network effects by giving potential competitors access to the distributed ledger solution, while ensuring only data required for a transaction is visible by the counterparties.  Similar to other groups of banks and other corporations such as R3 and Hyperledger, Nexledger appears to be a broadly applicable solution.  Other functions described in the trademark filing include smart contracts for financial services, a loyalty point program and authentication for financial services.  Part of that authentication process could include biometric verification, the data of which would also be logged on the blockchain, according to a ZDNet report, also today.  Today's news is the latest development in the South Korean electronics giant’s ongoing blockchain efforts.  Last July Samsung revealed it had invested in South Korean blockchain-as-a service platform Blocko, and months later joined Hyperledger, the Linux-led blockchain consortium working with open source technology.

42379419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ilB,1491489053,An Ethereum Voting Scheme That Doesn't Give Away Your Vote,"Voting on the blockchain sounds like a brilliant idea, promising to eliminate fraud while providing complete transparency to the final results.  But in practice, blockchain voting is extremely difficult to implement in a way that both keeps the votes private (so you don't know how a person voted) and doesn’t require a third party.  There are a few voting apps already out there, like the Blockchain Voting Machine, Follow My Vote and TIVI, that use the blockchain as a ballot box. But each of these, in some way or another, relies on a third party to achieve voter privacy.  At the Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference in Malta this week, however, a PhD student from Newcastle University in the UK, caught audience attention when he stepped forward with a proposal for secure voting that involves no third party for privacy – or for tallying votes.  Patrick McCorry's Open Vote Network is a smart contract written in Solidity, where ethereum takes over the work of the trusted third party.  The solution, McCorry said, is ideal for boardroom voting, although not for large groups.  He explained the idea to CoinDesk:  ""Everyone can cast their encrypted vote. And then at the end of the election, once all the votes have been cast, anyone, including observers, can simply add the encrypted votes together. It will cancel out all the random factors in the encryption and it will just reveal the final tally.""  Hurdles to overcome  When McCorry and his fellow researchers first took on the project, they ran up against two issues.  The first was that, in designing a voting scheme in ethereum, the platform would not compute the final tally until the final voter cast a vote, requiring 100% participation. The second was an adaptive issue where the final voter was able to compute the tally before casting a vote. This posed a problem, since knowing the vote tally upfront has the potential to sway a person’s vote.  However, using ethereum and cryptography, the Open Vote Network team found a way around both problems.  The system works like this: an election admin sends ethereum a 'white list' of voters. Later, when a voter registers for an election, he or she puts down a small deposit. Voters then have a limited time to cast their vote, or lose the deposit.  When a vote is cast, it is first encrypted before being submitted to ethereum. Once all the votes are in (or the time limit for voting is up), ethereum computes the tally, keeping votes private.  And once the final voter casts a vote, he or she cannot change that vote, even after computing the tally.  McCorry explained that his approach rides on the fact that the people in the election are known — an advantage in that it allows the use of peer pressure to encourage voting.    Road ahead        Moving forward, McCorry foresees a time when decentralized vote collections are implemented widely.  ""We wanted to show that decentralized elections were possible. Because it has been in academic literature for years, but it has never been practically implemented,"" McCorry said.  He added that the project – the code for which is now available on Github – also demonstrates that ethereum can support cryptography, as the Open Vote Network uses both ElGamal and zero-knowledge proofs.  McCorry concluded by saying that he and his team are moving on to research use of the blockchain for larger-scale elections.  Voting image via Shutterstock.

42379420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87imR,1491481805,Use or Speculation: What's Driving Ripple's Price to All-Time Highs?,"Even by cryptocurrency's often exaggerated market standards, the price of XRP has been on a tear of late.  The cryptocurrency that powers the distributed Ripple Consensus Ledger, a business-focused distributed ledger technology platform developed by San Francisco startup Ripple, has surged more than 1,000% over the last 30 days, reaching a new all-time high on 2nd April.  But what's the reason for the sudden surge?  So far, markets have been left to speculate, watching as the wider cryptocurrency markets have seen new volatility. Yet, Ripple is now weighing in on the market activity, arguing that the sharp spikes in value of late are evidence of its progress.  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CoinDesk:  ""We have had a significant rally in XRP prices, but it is reflective of a lot of work we have done to make Ripple a very compelling solution.""  He emphasized that there have been ""huge"" network improvements, adding that his company has invested significantly in ensuring that the Ripple Consensus Ledger – along with XRP – truly becomes a leading technology.  Yet, not all market participants agree there's a direct correlation.  As the price of XRP has experienced sharp volatility of late (rising and falling 10% in some single sessions), some assert the digital currency became the latest victim of 'pump and dump' trading activity, several analysts told CoinDesk.  Ripple is certainly not alone in this regard, as several other alternative asset protocols have surged to all-time highs lately and then suffered notable declines.  Scaling and speculation  Another major development that has helped provide tailwinds for XRP prices is bitcoin's ongoing scaling dilemma, according to Garlinghouse.  The bitcoin community has thus far been unable to form a consensus on how best to address the problem of block size, and that is sparking interest in alternatives, he reasoned.  Because of the technical issue, the average time needed to confirm bitcoin transactions has risen significantly in recent months, reaching 168 minutes on 27th March and 145 minutes on 31st March.  Garlinghouse sought to contrast this performance with Ripple's, tweeting on 31st March that his network's confirmations were taking an average of 3.7 seconds, while it costs $0.00031 per transaction compared to $0.48 using bitcoin.  Yet, here too, analysts offered an alternative picture, contending the quick rise in Ripple's price was more indicative of speculative market activity.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund trader, told CoinDesk that XRP is most certainly benefiting from an ""altcoin fervor"" amongst active traders. As a result, buyers were either swayed by some news, or some large buyer chose this week to spark market activity, he posited.  As for the decline in price that soon followed, analysts said this may have marked a period of ""profit taking"", where long-term Ripple holders sold (and bought back at a lower price) to increase their return on their investment.  Growing credibility?  Still, it remains an open question whether this activity amounts to real use for the Ripple platform. As such, the statements above mark a divide between the startup's view on the market and those of avid traders.  Garlinghouse, for example, suggested that the Ripple network may also be more practical than bitcoin's, a feature that he argued is attracting users.  ""One of the big differences between XRP and many other digital currencies is that we are solving a real-world problems for banks and providing ROI. This has been giving us credibility in the broader cryptocurrency space,"" he said.  Some analysts mentioned Ripple's partnership with Japan's largest bank, MUFG, as helping bolster XRP's price. As a result of this partnership, the Asian financial group will become the latest financial institution to get involved in creating and overseeing payment transaction rules and standards for Ripple's network.  However, such ideas are countered somewhat by the rise in trading activity on markets typically associated with more speculative trading.  For instance, one Ripple gateway operator projected more than three-quarters of XRP's trading activity is now taking place on Poloniex, an exchange for alternative cryptocurrencies that does not offer trading in fiat currency.  In this light, the recent moves may mark a combination of factors.  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, suggested that Ripple's developing value proposition was perhaps encouraging it to be more aggressively traded.  He concluded:  ""On a percentage basis, BTC moves have been getting steadily smaller for years. For those who have grown used to trading in that environment – with the attendant risks and rewards – alts have simply become more interesting.""

42379424,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iqD,1491471029,Here Comes the Pickaxe Race: Bitcoin Mining Jumps to GPU,"An early bitcoin developer and entrepreneur, Alex Waters served as COO and CIO for bitcoin exchange startup BitInstant. Waters would go on to start several bitcoin ventures, and was at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance.  In the second entry in CoinDesk's 'Bitcoin Milestones' series, Waters discusses the early escalation in what would become an arms race to mine bitcoin, reminiscing on what was lost along the way.  I didn't take the bitcoin white paper seriously when I first read it in late 2009.  It wasn't until a few months later that I thought, 'Wow, this is starting to catch on'. I saw someone trade bitcoin for some pizza on the forums. It was awesome, but I didn't really grasp what was happening.  At that point, my commitment level was very casual. I remember thinking that if I got some bitcoins, they could maybe pay for a new computer in a couple of years...  But bitcoin wasn't like anything I'd seen before. It captured my imagination and I was hopeful that someday it would be discussed outside of forums and IRC chats.    ***    Soon, that started happening. I put on my hat, met the locals at the saloon and began working on the blockchain.  I started panning for bitcoin gold via the default client. At the time, most people generated bitcoins by letting the v0.3 bitcoin client run in the background on their computers (a quaint notion by today's standards).  I earned some coins and I loved it. I liked it so much that I spent huge amounts of time researching the mechanics of bitcoin. I immersed myself in understanding the computer science. (This served me better in the long run than any of the mining.)  I get asked occasionally if I'm a 'bitcoin millionaire' because I was an early miner, but the answer is no. The early miners I knew traded thousands of coins for the value of a new video game.  Most people I spoke with on IRC were mining, but few of the discussions were about the value of a bitcoin. Gavin Andresen, the project's first maintainer, went so far as to give tons of bitcoins away for free to spur the movement.    ***    Soon, the parameters of mining would change, though.  Mining proved to be a dynamic system, with larger unknown actors who had the tools and resources to outpace me. Even after realizing this, I decided that I would keep mining. Mostly because mining was fun. I enjoyed the process of learning and improving — but knew that I couldn't compete.  The history of bitcoin mining would go on to progress through several phases.  CPU mining took off in 2010 when bitcoin was Slashdotted and a small crowd began mining with the Bitcoin Core client. Then, there was pooled mining.  But the big change was the emergence of GPU miners in late 2010 and their total dominance — decimating the CPU mining contingent. (GPU mining would eventually be rendered useless, too, when the first ASICs began to ship).  Throughout these movements, there have been a group of people within the bitcoin community called miners. I like to think that I'm part of that group, along with others who have a passion for bitcoin.  Although, it's probably more appropriate to label that group 'local miners'.  I say local miners because we were a bunch of hobbyist, mom-and-pop operations. We were displaced by large corporate industrial mining.  Similar to other markets, economies of scale bore down upon us...    ***    Looking back, it's easy to say this was just capitalism at work, and it could be argued that it was better for the network as a whole.  But I take exception with this idea. Bitcoin mining for me wasn't just about making money (I didn't make much anyway). It was about being part of the bitcoin ecosystem as a contributor, as a voice among many, a sort of crypto-democracy.  Mining bitcoins made me feel like I was part of the movement, more than anything else. I was at every step, and was captivated from CPU through ASIC.  Somehow I even inherited one of the first two ASICs (shout-out to Yifu Guo, Jeff Garzik, and Charlie Shrem). It stares at me while collecting dust, and reminds me of how I came to where I am today.  By creating bitcoins, miners are useful as a bulwark against malfeasance: if bitcoin was a government, the miners made up a branch that prevented others from gaining too much power.  For me, one of the biggest moments in bitcoin history was the advent of GPU mining and excitement within the bitcoin community that mining created. It's what kept me fascinated with bitcoin. From working with the core development to working with various bitcoin companies, it all started with mining.  GPU mining was when the beat dropped for the bitcoin universe...    ***    But I still loved that moment when CPU mining was the essence of bitcoin — as Satoshi and many of us saw it. Over time, it was revealed that the system tended toward oligarchy when we moved to GPU. Maybe it was inevitable.  I still believe something can be done to take crypto-democracy back.  We're mostly a group of people on the internet trying to find and create value together. We know what bitcoin looks like with the current state of centralized mining, and I think we can improve it.  Sure the economics of mining have changed. The jump to GPU ensured that. But there's more to mining than money.  Be a local miner, bitcoin still needs you.
