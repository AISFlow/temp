34825939,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648468,1729206043,Bitcoin Whale Transfers See Massive Spike: Sign Of Profit-Taking?,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whale transactions have spiked following the latest rally, a sign that profit-taking may have begun. Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count Now Highest In Over 10 Weeks According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Bitcoin whales have shown an increase in activity recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which keeps track of the total amount of transfers taking place on the BTC blockchain that are carrying a value of at least $100,000. When the value of this metric is high, it means the whales are making a large number of moves on the network right now. Such a trend implies these humongous holders have an active interest in trading the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Is Negative Despite $68,000 Rally: What It Means On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests the whales may not currently be paying much attention to the cryptocurrency as they aren’t making too many transactions. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count has seen a notable spike recently, suggesting that the whales have made a large amount of transfers. More particularly, these humongous entities made a total of 11,697 transfers in the span of 24 hours at the peak of this spike. Generally, it’s hard to say anything about what sort of transfer activity it is exactly that the whales are participating in based off the Whale Transaction Count alone, since both selling and buying transactions look the same from the perspective of the indicator. The accompanying price action, though, can provide some hints. The latest peak in the metric is the highest that the indicator has gotten since early August. Back then, the spike had coincided with a crash in the asset’s price, implying that a lot of the whales’ moves may have had been for selling. The current increase in the Whale Transaction Count has come as Bitcoin has been rallying, so it’s possible that the whales may be participating in profit-taking again. Since the spike occurred, BTC has slid down under $67,000, which may add evidence for this. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another BTC metric: the Social Dominance. This indicator basically tells us about the share of social media discussions that Bitcoin is occupying as compared to the total for the top 100 assets in the sector. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Social Dominance has spiked to 25.5% for the cryptocurrency, which is the highest value since late July. Thus, Bitcoin’s mindshare is currently high when compared to that of the altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Nearly Here: Will This Lead To A Top? This is usually a sign of fear of missing out (FOMO) among traders. Historically, excessive hype has been a poor sign for BTC, with tops often following it. “Both of these signals are signs that the rally may be on hold due to key stakeholder profit taking and high crowd FOMO,” notes the analytics firm. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,900, up more than 9% over the last week.

This bullish momentum is driven by price action and supported by key market data signaling a potential uptrend continuation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising Daan, a top crypto analyst, shared crucial insights showing that Bitcoin ETFs have been buying heavily for the past four days. This surge in institutional demand is a positive signal for the market, as it could further propel Bitcoin toward new all-time highs. The next few days will be critical for Bitcoin’s trajectory, with many traders and investors eyeing a potential breakout to historic levels. The anticipation grows as BTC edges closer to these highs, making the upcoming price movements pivotal in shaping the market’s direction. Bitcoin Demand Rising The whole market is buzzing with excitement and volatility, with Bitcoin leading the way by establishing a clear uptrend since early September. Analysts and investors are attributing part of this surge to the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts, but other significant factors influence Bitcoin’s price action. Key data shared by Daan, a top crypto analyst, reveals that Bitcoin ETFs have seen substantial inflows over the past week. The last four trading days alone have witnessed a combined $1.639 billion in inflows, making this week one of the most successful since the inception of Bitcoin ETFs. This surge in institutional demand signals that traditional investors are increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s future, driving up demand and boosting the price. Despite the current optimism, there is caution among market observers. Historically, periods of heightened excitement and euphoria in the market are often followed by price retracements or consolidation. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Bitcoin tends to mark local tops when sentiment peaks, which could signal a cooling-off period before the next major move. Investors are closely watching for signs of a potential pullback or whether Bitcoin will continue to climb toward new all-time highs in the weeks ahead. Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $67,000 after a 2% retrace from its recent local top at $68,388. Despite this slight pullback, the price is holding firmly above the previous high of $66,500, signaling a strong consolidation phase that could set the stage for another move higher. For the bullish momentum to continue, BTC must maintain its position above $66,500. If it does, the price could soon push toward new highs. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above this critical level, a healthy retrace to the daily 200-day moving average (MA) would still indicate strength in the market. The 200-day MA has historically been a reliable support level during uptrends, providing a foundation for further gains. Related Reading: Solana Targets $160 Resistance As TVL Hits New Yearly Highs If the price falls below the 200-day MA, a deeper correction to $60,000 is likely.

34822695,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648483,1729198810,"BTC Held On Exchanges Hits Lowest Point In 5 Five Years, Here’s What It Means For Bitcoin Price","The Bitcoin price has already been up by 10% in the past seven days, breaking above the $67,000 mark again in the last few hours. The Coinmarketcap Fear And Greed Index has now switched to greed in light of recent buying momentum and is showing no signs of slowing down. The buying pressure on Bitcoin has been so great in the past few days, leading to a huge decline in the number of BTC available on crypto exchanges. According to on-chain data, this has caused the Bitcoin exchange reserve to drop to its lowest point in five years. BTC Exchange Reserve Drop to 5-Year Low Over the past few days, the demand for Bitcoin has outweighed its supply, leading to a sharp decline in the exchange reserves. According to CryptoQuant data reposted on social media platform X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the number of BTC held on exchanges is now at a five-year low of 2.6 million BTC. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies Bull Flag That Could Send Solana Price To $1,400 Martinez’s chart reveals an intriguing trend in Bitcoin’s exchange reserves that has unfolded throughout the year. At the beginning of 2024, the reserves stood at approximately 3.05 million BTC. However, this number has declined massively since that time. The dwindling supply of Bitcoin on exchanges can be attributed to several key factors. First, there’s the surging interest from institutional players, especially following the approval and growing momentum of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs have triggered significant buying activity, with US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs eventually becoming the second-largest holders of BTC behind Satoshi Nakamoto. Many long-term holders also contributed to the buying pressure, as many continued buying in droves. Even periods of price corrections and selloffs from short-term holders were highlighted by the movement of more BTC into stable long-term hands who are less likely to sell. As a result, the total amount of Bitcoin held on crypto exchanges has dropped by about 450,000 BTC since January, bringing the current reserve to just 2.6 million BTC. This is the lowest level seen since January 2019, and such a sharp decline typically signals a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. “We all know what this means,” Martinez said. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? The current state of Bitcoin’s exchange reserves suggests that market participants are increasingly holding onto their BTC in anticipation of future gains, as many people continue to speculate about where the Bitcoin price could be heading in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holder Base Falls To 6-Month Low, But Analyst Believes DOGE Price Is Headed To $10 When fewer coins are available on exchanges, it often indicates reduced selling pressure, which drives the price higher as demand continues to rise. Uptober is now fully in play, and Bitcoin is already up by 6.3% in the month. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,200. This notable price point puts Bitcoin on the path to breaking above its all-time high of $73,737 before the end of October.

While other altcoins have experienced significant pumps, Cardano has yet to see the same breakout, leaving analysts and traders searching for confirmation of a bullish trend. Despite the lack of a major move, optimism remains high for ADA as market watchers await a signal to ignite the rally. Related Reading: Strong Buy Signal For DogWifHat (WIF) – Key Indicator Hints At Rally To $4 Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis suggesting that Cardano could be on the verge of a bullish rally, potentially pushing ADA to $0.54. This prediction has generated excitement within the Cardano community, but the next few days will be critical in determining whether ADA can follow through with a breakout. As the market remains volatile, traders will closely monitor Cardano’s price action for signs of a confirmed uptrend. Cardano Holding Above Key Level Cardano is trading above a key resistance level at $0.33, sparking optimism among analysts and investors. This crucial price point could be the springboard that propels ADA to new highs. Analysts in the crypto community believe that Cardano is poised for a breakout, and some expect a rally in the coming days. Prominent investor and analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish pattern forming on Cardano’s chart. According to Runefelt, if ADA manages to break this pattern to the upside, the next target could be as high as $0.54, representing a potential 58% gain from current levels. This prediction has generated excitement, as ADA holders are looking for signs of a sustained upward trend after a period of consolidation. However, not all scenarios point to a smooth ride for Cardano. If ADA fails to break above this pattern, further consolidation or a potential correction could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Solana Targets $160 Resistance As TVL Hits New Yearly Highs The $0.33 level is now a key marker for traders and investors to watch closely in the coming days, as it could signal the beginning of a major price move—or the continuation of a more uncertain path for Cardano. ADA Technical Analysis Cardano’s (ADA) price action has been underwhelming compared to other altcoins. Currently trading at $0.34, ADA has seen a 7% decline from its recent high of $0.37 set on Tuesday. Despite some volatility, the price remains below the critical 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.40, following a failed breakout attempt in late September. For the bulls to regain control, ADA must reclaim the $0.40 level and push toward setting a new local high above $0.41. A breakout above these levels would signal a potential momentum shift and spark renewed optimism among investors.

If this level is lost, a correction to lower demand areas around $0.30 is expected.

42373566,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloBXr,1729192015,"Staked Ether Is Creating a Benchmark for the Crypto Economy, Says ARK Invest","It’s hard for projects to beat the returns offered by staked ether on a risk-adjusted basis.  Consequently, the asset and its yield are becoming a benchmark for the crypto economy in similar fashion to the fed funds rate and the traditional economy.  Slowly but surely, staked ether (stETH) is becoming a benchmark for the entire on-chain economy.  According to a new report from investment management firm ARK Invest, Ethereum’s monetary policy has turned staked ether into a unique type of asset – one that resembles sovereign bonds.  “The ETH staking yield is a gauge for smart contract activity and economic cycles in the digital asset space, much like the fed funds rate in traditional finance,” wrote Lorenzo Valente, a research associate at ARK Invest.  Comparing staked ether to sovereign bonds  Ethereum is designed in such a way that ether {{ETH}} holders can stake their tokens, essentially locking them up in the network in exchange for a yield. At the time of writing, the yield on staked ether generating a 3.27% annualized yield, according to CoinDesk CESR data.  There's also a so-called liquid staking token, stETH, from the Lido project, that Ethereum stakers can redeploy into DeFi protocols.  The fact that staked ether produces a yield makes the asset comparable to sovereign bonds, which are debt securities issued by governments to finance themselves. Investors can buy up this debt and earn interest on it over time.  But staked ether differs from bonds in several crucial aspects, the report said.  Some of the distinctions are positive. For example, while governments can default on their debt obligations – like Argentina did in 2020 – Ethereum cannot default on staked ether. The network is programmed to let users access their funds whenever they want, and the yield is designed to keep being issued no matter what happens, though the interest rate will vary depending on on-chain activity. Another big risk for bonds is inflation. If the government prints too much money, and the inflation rate outstrips the yield on bonds, investors end up losing purchasing power.  Ether can also suffer from inflation (as is currently the case) if network activity slows down so much that ether issuance ends up exceeding the ether burn rate – a mechanism that removes a fraction of ether from circulation every time a transaction is made. However, on-chain data makes ether’s inflation rate much more transparent. Data aggregator ultrasound.money shows, for example, that in the last 30 days, ether’s supply expanded at a rate of 0.33% per year.  But exposure to staked ether also comes with its own risks. Staked ether can be destroyed by the network, for example, if the used validators – entities with whom investors stake their ether; their role is to process transactions – suffer from an operational malfunction, or behave in a way that’s detrimental to the network. This is known as ""slashing.""  While government bonds come with political and regulatory risks, they aren’t going to be obliterated by an automatized system if anything goes awry.  Finally, a major appeal of sovereign bonds is their lack of volatility. If the country issuing them is stable, they are usually deemed low-risk investments, and are even sometimes considered cash-like instruments. Ether itself is highly volatile: at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was up 65% in the last 12 months. Naturally, that means staked ether cannot be classified by investors in the same low-risk category as bonds.  “While both can be influenced by inflation, interest rate changes and currency depreciation, the nature of those risks and their implications can vary significantly,” the report said. “Additionally, ETH staking introduces unique risks related to network security, validator behavior, and smart contract bugs, which have no direct parallel in traditional sovereign bonds.”  Growing use in DeFi  Generally speaking, there are two different ways investors can stake their ether: by setting up their own validators, or by staking through specialized DeFi protocols like Lido {{LDO}} or Rocket Pool {{RPL}}. These protocols partner up with trusted validators and execute all the technical aspects of staking for their customers.  Importantly, they also provide liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which represent the amount of ether that has been staked by the investor into the network. That’s a massive benefit, because while their ether is locked away earning yield, investors can keep using stETH tokens (the most popular LST) for additional purposes – for example, as collateral in lending protocols.  That advantage is so great that stETH is beginning to replace ETH as the collateral of choice in the DeFi economy.  “Today, stETH supplied as collateral in DeFi totals ~2.7 million, or roughly 31% of the entire stETH supply,” the report said, noting that investors prefer it to other crypto assets due to the “capital efficiency it offers users, liquidity providers and market makers.”  “Currently the collateral of choice on Aave V3, Spark, and MakerDao, 1.3 million stETH, 598,000 stETH, and 420,000 stETH, respectively, are locked into those protocols and used as collateral to issue loans or crypto-backed stablecoins,” it added.  Becoming the benchmark  With stETH so widely used across the biggest DeFi protocols, staked ether is slowly forcing the rest of the crypto financial ecosystem to reorganize itself, the report argued.  That’s because projects need to convince investors that, on a risk-adjusted basis, their own assets will offer higher returns than simply staking ether, and compounding those returns, will provide.  “If the ETH yield is 4% after compounding over seven years, [a] closed-end fund would have to outperform ETH more than 31% [over that period of time], even without taking into account price appreciation,” the report said.  It’s one of the reasons why competing Layer 1 projects – like Solana {{SOL}} or Avalanche {{AVAX}} – all offer higher interest rates for investors to stake their tokens. The implication is that these assets are riskier and more volatile, and investors need to be incentivized with higher yields to hold them in the long run.  The demand for staked ether has also put pressure on DeFi protocols in the business of lending stablecoins, according to ARK Invest.  For example, Sky {{SKY}} (formerly MakerDAO) was forced to increase the interest rate on locked DAI (the protocol’s native stablecoin) following significant selling pressure and a decrease in its circulating supply, the report said. Furthermore, on Aave {{AAVE}} and Compound {{COMP}} investors are seeing increased rewards for lending stablecoins – because users would rather lend stETH and borrow stablecoins, than lend stablecoins directly.  In other words, the more stETH captures market share, the more the crypto economy will begin making choices based on staked ether’s yield. And that means staked ether could play the same role in crypto as the Federal Reserve’s funding rate does in the global financial system.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL | RPL,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL | RPL,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/17/staked-ether-is-creating-a-benchmark-for-the-crypto-economy-says-ark-invest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8ecca269d6e54f7c5ca165c080ca55ab09dee66-6443x3624.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: SUI Price Hits All-Time High – But Questions About Valuation Remain The price surge is accompanied by a substantial rise in trading volume, which has increased by 90% in the last 24 hours, as reported by CoinMarketCap.

Analysts are closely monitoring these developments, with some predicting a more promising future for Dogecoin, despite ambiguous indicators in the short term. A Bold Call For $24 Ali Martinez, a Dogecoin expert, has a bullish prognosis for the canine-themed coin: DOGE can increase substantially and hit the vaunted $10 mark. On October 16, Martinez tweeted over the rising wedge patterns that have been in place since 2017. He said that this trend shows a very positive outlook for a long period of time which suggests that, in the long term, DOGE could attain a value of $24.

He asserts that these levels have contributed to Dogecoin’s upward trajectory, and he anticipates a significant price surge from its most recent support level. Musk’s Influence Remains Robust Meanwhile, it is impossible to have a discussion on Dogecoin without Elon Musk being mentioned. The billionaire has been openly supportive of DOGE saying ‘this is the people’s crypto’ earlier this year which appreciated its price significantly. It can be observed that, on several occasions, the price of Dogecoin has surged by more than 50% within a short span of time whenever Musk publicly expresses his support for the cryptocurrency. Hence, it is clear how much power he wields when it comes to affecting the price of the coin. The substantial user base of Dogecoin, coupled with Musk’s backing, has positioned the coin to frequently contend with significant altcoins. This positions DOGE in a compelling situation, straddling the line between a meme and a credible cryptocurrency with enduring promise. Price Projections Exhibit Variability There is however a slight degree of pessimism that has creeped into the market despite the prevailing optimism. Predictions are such that Dogecoin is likely to decrease by an estimated 13% and drop to $0.106 by the middle of November.

At the moment, the market outlook favors buying opportunities however it’s clear that the risk associated with volatility is very high for those investors who wish to capitalize on the current upward movement of DOGE.

The district court judge overseeing Kalshi's suit against the CFTC ignored the definitions of terms under the Commodity Exchange Act and ""without basis"" barred the agency from examining ""'transactions' that involve gaming,"" the filing said.  The judge ruled last month that the CFTC couldn't bar Kalshi from listing election contracts. The regulator filed with the appeals court for a stay that would have prevented the company from launching the product pending the outcome of the appeal. But that court's judges ruled the CFTC had not demonstrated there would be irrevocable harm.  As a result, Kalshi has listed a number of events contracts tied to the 2024 election, ranging from the winner of the presidential contest to who will win various states.  Wednesday's filing went deep into definitions, arguing that the CFTC did not use an ""expansive definition of gaming"" in its rejection of Kalshi's application to launch election markets.  The CFTC pointed to the new contracts in its filing, making a similar argument to its filing when it sought an emergency stay of the district court's order to let Kalshi list these contracts.

Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a bullish perspective for Dogwifhat on social media platform X, with the TD Sequential indicator indicating a buy signal. TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal At $2.5 As Ali Martinez noted, the TD Sequential has been highly spot on with predicting trends in the price of Dogwifhat for a while now. The TD Sequential indicator consists of two phases: a setup phase, which generates a count from 1 to 9 based on a specific price, and a countdown phase, which also counts down based on previous price action. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Can Port To $86,600 If It Breaks This Level Martinez shared insights from the WIF/Tether US 4-hour candlestick price chart, illustrating that the TD Sequential indicator has consistently delivered accurate buy and sell signals for Dogwifhat since the beginning of October. As it stands, the indicator is now pointing toward a buy signal. For a buy setup on the TD Sequential, the current candle’s close must be lower than the close of the previous four candles. At the time of writing, Dogwifhat has experienced a correction of approximately 14% over the past three days, having peaked at $2.958 on October 14. However, the TD Sequential on the 4-hour candlestick chart is now pointing towards the continuation of a larger upward trend for the rest of the month. What’s Next For The Dogwifhat Price? Dogwifhat’s popularity kicked off in early 2024 when the meme coin community enthusiastically dubbed it the “Shiba Inu Killer.” Dogwifhat, which started the year around $0.15, was shot into the spotlight in March and April during a frenzy surrounding Solana-based meme coins in the first half of 2024. This surge in interest caused Dogwifhat to go on a price rally, culminating in an all-time high of $4.83. Following this all-time high, the meme coin experienced a substantial correction and is now characterized by smaller rallies and corrections. However, it still remains the largest Solana-based meme coin with a market cap of $2.56 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $130,000 By January, Here’s The Roadmap Even with the recent price decline over the past three days, Dogwifhat has managed to maintain impressive gains of around 68% over the past 30 days. Now that the TD Sequential indicator is printing a buy signal, this price increase is expected to continue for the rest of what looks like a bullish October. At the time of writing, the Solana-based meme coin is trading at $2.57, with a bullish price target of $4 before October comes to a close. Solana, on the other hand, hasn’t been able to keep up with Dogwifhat gains in the past 30 days. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $153, up by 15% in the same 30-day timeframe.

34816310,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648486,1729184416,Turbo Team Selling After The AI Meme Coin Flies To New All-Time High: Time To Exit?,"Turbo is trending at around all-time highs. The upswing started in mid-September and initiated a move up that saw the AI meme coin break above local resistances, which is now supported and propelling valuation to record highs. At press time, TURBO is changing hands at $0.010 but is down nearly 20% from this week’s highs. Turbo Team Selling: Time To Exit? According to Lookonchain analysts, the retracement from all-time highs at $0.013 early this week could be primarily due to the team dumping. The team has been sending tokens to Binance and OKX, leading to concerns about whether they are exiting the project and dumping on holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Are Quietly Accumulating—Is A Major Price Breakout Coming? Movements to centralized exchanges are often seen as bearish, signaling the holder’s intention to liquidate. Whether they sold or not remains to be seen at this point. However, after the signal was flagged on October 16, the token trended lower, suggesting a possible supply spike. To put the numbers into perspective, the team sent 810 million TURBO to Binance and OKX. The dump follows the team’s steady liquidation over the past few months. Since June 5, Lookonchain analysts observed that the team had deposited 1.5 billion TURBO to multiple exchanges. The Turbo daily chart shows that prices rose to $0.009 in late May. The liquidation by the team coincided with this expansion. Prices dropped sharply after sending tokens to centralized exchanges in June, losing over 65%. TURBO found support at $0.0029 before printing higher highs and eventually erupting above May 2024 highs in early October. Is This A Pump-And-Dump Scheme? If past trends guide and the team actively sells, the probability of TURBO sliding from its recent swing high remains elevated. This contraction may trigger a massive sell-off, pushing prices to $0.007—or worse. Whether the team is “pumping and dumping” remains only a speculation. However, if the team makes a statement, it could assuage fears and possibly prop up prices. For now, no definitive evidence supports any allegations of a possible pump-and-dump.

34814774,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648464,1729180842,"Is $100,000 Bitcoin Possible? Analyst Breaks Down Major Catalysts","As Bitcoin (BTC) edges closer to the $70,000 mark, the crypto community is abuzz with predictions of a potential surge to $100,000, accompanied by a significant altcoin season. Amidst this fervor, crypto analyst Axel Bitblaze has provided an analysis on X, examining whether the necessary liquidity and catalysts are in place to propel Bitcoin to such heights. Bitblaze emphasizes the fundamental role of liquidity in the crypto market. Drawing parallels to previous bull runs, he notes, “Our space is fully driven by just one thing, i.e., Liquidity.” He references the 2016 and 2020 bull markets, both of which were significantly fueled by increasing liquidity. This time, the question is whether similar or greater liquidity events are on the horizon to drive Bitcoin’s price higher. #1 Bitcoin Surge Set To Be Fueled By Stablecoins A cornerstone of Bitblaze’s analysis is the current state of the stablecoins market. He describes stablecoins as “the gateway to the crypto industry,” underscoring their indispensability to the crypto ecosystem. The total market capitalization of stablecoins has surged to $173 billion, reaching its highest level since the collapse of TerraUSD (UST). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive Surge In Active Addresses: Here’s What It Signals For Price Tether (USDT) remains the dominant player, comprising 69% of the total stablecoin market cap with $120 billion. Bitblaze highlights the historical correlation between BTC prices and USDT’s market capitalization, stating, “Between March 2020 to November 2021, USDT MCap rose by 17x while BTC price pumped by 16.5x.” However, since March 2024, despite USDT’s market cap continuing to rise, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stagnant. “This indicates there’s a lot of liquidity waiting on the sidelines to enter BTC and crypto. I guess they’ll start deploying soon, right?” the analyst states. #2 FASB Rule Change Another significant factor is the impending change in accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Currently, publicly listed companies face challenges in holding Bitcoin due to unfavorable accounting treatments. Bitblaze explains, “Let’s say a company bought 100 BTC at $67,000 each. If BTC drops to $60,000 and then pumps to $68,000, the company still needs to report it at $60,000… they will have to show it as a loss even though it’s in profit.” This results in misleading earnings reports and adversely affects share prices, discouraging companies from investing in Bitcoin despite its potential as an asset. The upcoming FASB rule change, set to be implemented in December 2024, is poised to address this issue. Under the new guidelines, companies will be able to report the fair value of their Bitcoin holdings based on market prices at the end of the reporting period. Bitblaze suggests that this regulatory shift could incentivize more corporations to adopt Bitcoin as part of their balance sheets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Best On-Chain Metric For ‘Day-To-Day Trading’ He cites MicroStrategy as a precedent, noting that since August 2020, the company has accumulated 252,220 BTC worth $17.4 billion, currently realizing a profit of $7.4 billion. With S&P 500 companies collectively holding approximately $2.5 trillion in cash and cash equivalents—assets vulnerable to inflation—Bitcoin presents itself as an attractive, inflation-resistant alternative. #3 Expanding M2 Money Supply Bitblaze also delves into the macroeconomic landscape, particularly the M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and other easily convertible near money. Currently, the M2 money supply stands at $94 trillion, nearly 39 times the total crypto market capitalization. Bitblaze references an analysis indicating that “for every 10% increase in M2 money supply, BTC pumps 90%.” Despite the M2 money supply being approximately 3% higher than its previous peak, Bitcoin has yet to surpass its 2021 highs, suggesting that ample liquidity remains untapped. “Currently, M2 money supply is almost 3% higher than its last peak, while BTC is still below its 2021 high. With Global rate cuts happening along with QE, fiat will become a worse investment. As Ray Dalio said, #Cash is Trash,# and now this gigantic money supply will find a way into different asset classes, including crypto; the analyst claims. #4 Shift From Money Market Funds To Bitcoin Since November 2021, money market funds have grown to $6.5 trillion as investors sought the safety of Treasury bills amid rising interest rates. However, with the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts and signaling more to come, the yields on T-bills are expected to diminish, likely causing a significant outflow from money market funds. Bitblaze predicts, “This’ll cause a massive outflow from money market funds as the T-bills yield will diminish,” suggesting that investors will seek higher returns in riskier assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He refers to these digital assets as “the fastest horses” in a QE environment, forecasting that this shift could channel substantial capital into the crypto markets. To quantify the potential inflow, Bitblaze aggregates the available liquidity sources: the M2 money supply of $94 trillion, money market funds totaling $6.5 trillion, cash holdings of S&P 500 companies amounting to $2.5 trillion, and the stablecoins market cap of $173 billion. This brings the total to approximately $103.17 trillion, which is 43 times the current total crypto market capitalization. He further addresses skeptics, concluded: “For a $200 Billion inflow, only 0.19% of this account needed to enter crypto. For those who think this isn’t possible and 200B is too much, BTC ETFs had over $20B in net inflows despite sideways price action, no rate cuts, and no QE.” At press time, BTC traded at $66,944.

The collection of 1,935 generative images, ""Elvis Side $Btc,"" will be minted by Bitcoin-focused IP project Royalty in partnership with inscription service OrdinalsBot.  Royalty will use revenue from the collection to form the ""Elvis Legacy Council"" DAO.  Elvis Presley will soon arrive on Bitcoin thanks to a digital art collection of the King of Rock and Roll inscribed on Ordinals.  The collection of 1,935 generative images, ""Elvis Side $Btc,"" will be minted by Bitcoin-focused intellectual property (IP) project Royalty in partnership with inscription service OrdinalsBot, and is inspired by the artwork of Joe Petruccio, an artist licensed by the Elvis Presley Estate.  The inscriptions will be among the first to mint when OrdinalsBot's marketplace goes live later in the year.  The Ordinals protocol allows data to be ""inscribed"" onto individual satoshis (the smallest unit of BTC at 1/100,000,000 of a full bitcoin), making them unique and therefore able to attain individual value. In this sense, they are the Bitcoin version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which brought Ethereum-based digital art to mainstream prominence in 2021.  OrdinalsBot, a platform for minting the inscriptions, has emerged as one of the more influential projects in the Bitcoin development sector. It claims to be responsible for 80% of the 10 biggest files inscribed on the Bitcoin network, including the largest ever block, an inscription of the manifesto of privacy-focused tech stack Logos, which cost 3.5 BTC ($235,000).  Such inscriptions are referred to as ""four meggers,"" as their size is close to 4 MB, the maximum size of a Bitcoin block.  ""We see it as being like acquiring a billboard in Times Square because of the visibility that it gives you within the Bitcoin network and that will last forever,"" Ordinals co-founder Toby Lewis told CoinDesk in an interview.  (The new Elvis-themed series are more of the regular variety of inscriptions, not four meggers.)  Royalty is set to publish a litepaper in the coming weeks, detailing how 5% of primary and secondary sales revenue will fund the Elvis Legacy Council, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) aimed at ""governing the future of Elvis' digital legacy,"" through a native token.

This bullish forecast comes as Bitcoin experiences new momentum that has pushed its price well above $67,000. New Bitcoin Target Set At $109,000 A Bitcoin technical analyst identified as ‘CryptoCon’ has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to unveil his bullish prediction for the Bitcoin price. While many analysts believe that this Q4 is a significantly bullish period for Bitcoin, CryptoCon confirms this sentiment by forecasting that Bitcoin could see its price reaching $109,000 as early as December 2024. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holder Base Falls To 6-Month Low, But Analyst Believes DOGE Price Is Headed To $10 In the analyst’s words, “$109,000 is just the next rung on the ladder for Bitcoin.” This suggests that the analyst is confident that Bitcoin could hit this new all time high, but also has the potential to increase even further over time. Sharing a detailed chart of Bitcoin’s historical price movements, the analyst highlighted periods when Bitcoin hit new highs, suggesting a possible correlation in past bullish trends. In April and July 2023, Bitcoin experienced a massive 52% surge, pushing its price to $30,362 at the 1.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Again, in January 2024, the cryptocurrency saw another 52% increase, jumping to $46,831 at the 2.618 Fibonacci level. More recently, around March Bitcoin witnessed another 52% price spike, hitting its current all-time high above $73,000, with its price dropping slightly back down towards $71,000 in May. Following this historical trend, CryptoCon predicts that Bitcoin is gearing up for another 52% increase, potentially reaching $109,000, at the 4.618 Fibonacci level. The analyst emphasized that Bitcoin’s recent price rally had a different ring to it, hinting at the possibility of a sustained bull run. Furthermore, the analyst has confidently stated that a recession or bear market is unlikely for Bitcoin shortly. He asserts that all conditions are aligning perfectly for 2025 to become the year of all-time highs. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through $67,000 Bitcoin recently surpassed the $67,000 mark for the first time since July, when the hype and demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs was still strong. The unexpected market rebound has generated significant profits for numerous short-term Bitcoin holders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies Bull Flag That Could Send Solana Price To $1,400 While the value of Bitcoin jumped as high as $67,820 at some point in the past 48 hours, the price of the cryptocurrency has since stabilized and is currently trading at $67,170. CoinMarketCap’s data reveals that in the past seven days, Bitcoin has surged by more than 10%, underscoring investors’ growing interest and demand in the pioneer cryptocurrency. Additionally, the data has also shown that the broader Bitcoin community is 69% bullish while only 31% are bearish. This suggests that investors’ positive sentiment towards Bitcoin is rising as they may be expecting more upcoming price gains.

42422060,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeiwFcF,1729177200,Crypto for Advisors: Bitcoin’s Price,"In today's issue, Andy Baehr from CoinDesk Indices breaks down bitcoin’s price action.  Then, Leo Mindyuk from ML Tech provides insights into advisor sentiment and how they can help their clients in Ask an Expert.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Bitcoin’s Price Actions  It has been an action-packed 2024 for bitcoin and other digital assets.  For financial advisors, this can mean one of two things:  Advisors who have been eager to allocate to bitcoin now have an easier way to do so, and can think about what’s next.  Advisors who have adopted a wait-and-see approach may now start to get more questions from clients.  To recap the price action, bitcoin began to gain wider attention in the October 2023 rally when it became more clear that so-called “spot” ETFs would be approved and launched soon. Bitcoin was still trading below $30,000 at the time. The launch of 11 ETFs on Jan. 11 was a milestone for the digital asset world and broke ETF records.  Bitcoin’s rally continued until mid-March when it marked a new all-time high above $73,000, and the rally was broad across major digital assets. By March 13, bitcoin was up 72% on the year, ether up 75%, and the CoinDesk 20 Index 58%.  As the inflows into ETFs stabilized – with bitcoin ETFs now holding around $60 billion in assets – other factors came to dominate digital asset prices, again, with bitcoin leading the way. Foremost among these were Federal Reserve monetary policy, the upcoming U.S. election and ramifications for crypto regulation and some crypto-specific housekeeping to provide resolution to some of crypto’s “teething pains” of the past.  These factors, in aggregate, created uncertainty about digital assets with bitcoin receiving particular focus. Bitcoin, as a store of value, is sensitive to macroeconomic factors such as inflation and interest rate expectations. Our favorite metric is expectations for future real interest rates: To the extent that the market believes that future inflation will trend higher than future nominal interest rates, bitcoin will look more attractive.  Bitcoin, and digital assets more broadly, have had a more constrained regulatory environment in the United States than other countries and regions. There are without question feelings about how different U.S. presidents and administrations will handle crypto regulation, and whether the U.S. will be permitted to “catch up to the rest of the world.”  The market also anticipated large pools of bitcoin that could come to market as one-time supply. Resolutions of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange debacle of 10 years ago and sales of seized bitcoin by regulatory authorities in the US and Germany made some buyers wary. However, by Q3, most of these concerns were resolved.  In the six months following bitcoin’s new all-time-high in March, we saw bitcoin retrace and other assets fare worse. However, this gloomy sentiment shifted notably on Sept. 18, when the FOMC assertively cut rates by 50 basis points. The price of bitcoin lifted, but even more affirming was the rebound in the broader crypto market, with the CoinDesk 20 index outperforming bitcoin by 4% in the week and a half following the Fed’s cut.  As the U.S. election looms, more macroeconomic data comes in to contour expectations for the Fed’s pace of easing, and other factors such as geo-political events in the Middle East jolt markets, folks will watch the price of bitcoin and the broader market for their reaction.  Longer term, these assets represent, in the eyes of many, the future of finance. Bitcoin has a unique position here, as the largest, oldest, and, in many ways, simplest cryptocurrency. It exists mainly just to be sent from one address to another, with constrained supply, a 15-year track record of security and a powerful network. It is a store of value, one that is still young and under-adopted but one that has faced and survived anything the global financial universe has thrown at it. It remains a great place to start for investor education and portfolio consideration. Oh, and it’s the best-performing asset across all major asset classes in eight of the last 11 years.  But after bitcoin, what’s next? This is a big question for many advisors who don’t want to become crypto specialists but also don’t want to miss out on the biggest growth opportunities for Web3, smart contracts, Defi and other themes that blockchain assets offer.  - Andy Baehr, CFA, head of product, CoinDesk Indices  Ask an Expert  Q. What is the current advisor sentiment towards digital assets?  Advisors invested in digital assets are currently navigating an evolving landscape due to new crypto products, regulatory developments and a shift toward broader adoption.  The regulatory landscape remains fragmented globally. The U.S. has been slower in implementing cohesive crypto regulations, though efforts to regulate stablecoins and exchanges are underway. Meanwhile, other regions like Asia and the UAE are more progressive, providing clearer regulatory frameworks.  Advisors must stay informed to help clients navigate the dynamic digital asset market, particularly as crypto transitions from early adoption to more mainstream investment opportunities.  Q. Why is it important to understand where advisors stand on digital assets?  Digital assets are becoming an increasingly important component of portfolio diversification and risk management strategies. Cryptocurrencies offer attractive correlation to traditional investments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Advisors are exploring these assets to enhance diversification, especially as digital assets mature and institutional products like spot Bitcoin ETFs become available. This allows for broader participation without the technical challenges of direct ownership.  Q. How can advisors offer clients protection from the recent volatility?  Encouraging clients to focus on the long-term potential of digital assets can help reduce emotional reactions to volatility. Historically, markets like bitcoin have experienced cyclical volatility, but many long-term holders have benefited from price appreciation over time. Advisors can help clients maintain a disciplined investment strategy, emphasizing long-term gains over short-term speculation.  With these approaches, advisors can help clients gain exposure to the upside potential of digital assets while minimizing the risks associated with market volatility.  - Leo Mindyuk, CEO, ML Tech  Keep Reading  Bitcoin ETFs posted their biggest inflows since June Monday, bringing in $555.86 million, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the charge.

The strategic move aims to provide investors with a diversified portfolio that includes major digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP and Avalanche (AVAX). Diversified Exposure To Bitcoin, Ethereum, And More The proposed ETF comes at a time when investor interest in regulated cryptocurrency products is on the rise. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund currently holds approximately $524 million in assets under management, with a significant focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Specifically, about 75% of the fund is allocated to Bitcoin, while Ethereum comprises roughly 19%, with the remaining investments distributed among Solana, XRP, and Avalanche. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin According to reports on the matter, this diversified approach is designed to offer a balanced entry point for investors seeking broader exposure to the cryptocurrency market. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had previously filed a 19b-4 application on behalf of Grayscale, seeking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval to amend its rulebook to permit the listing of this new ETF. This filing follows a pivotal year for the market, which recently saw the approval of spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in January and July respectively, allowing these funds to hold actual tokens rather than relying on futures contracts. This shift comes after years of rejections of such index funds, spurred by a court ruling in favor of Grayscale that prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission led by Gary Gensler to reconsider its stance. Grayscale Aims For Fifth ETF Launch This Year The successful conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund into an ETF would mark the fifth launch by the firm this year, highlighting its strategy to expand its product offerings in response to increasing demand for diverse digital asset exposure. Balchunas noted that the ETF’s holdings, predominantly consisting of Bitcoin and Ethereum, could provide enough flexibility to accommodate smaller, less liquid assets, potentially paving the way for approval. Over the course of the year, Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum funds have seen significant outflows, with around $20 billion and $3 billion withdrawn respectively. In response, the firm has introduced lower-fee versions of these funds, attracting over $700 million in inflows thus far. These approvals have contributed to a surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, indicating a renewed investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Can Port To $86,600 If It Breaks This Level Other asset managers are also positioning themselves to launch ETFs that include smaller tokens such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin, with recent filings from Canary Capital and Bitwise Invest highlighting a broader trend to integrate a wider range of cryptocurrencies into regulated investment vehicles, despite increased scrutiny from regulators in the US.

42422056,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeiwFWs,1729172845,Four Reasons Elon Musk’s Tesla May Have Moved $760M of Bitcoin,"Some bitcoin traders were spooked as Tesla on Wednesday moved its BTC stash for the first time in over two years.  So far, though, none of the bitcoins have apparently made it to exchange wallets or were swapped for stablecoins.  Here's some reasons why companies may move their digital assets.  Elon Musk-controlled Tesla (TSLA) created ripples earlier this week as it moved over $750 million worth of bitcoin {{BTC}} to new wallets after nearly two years of the stash being untouched.  The action sparked conversation around Tesla's/Musk's intentions and concerns of further selling pressure.  The electric carmaker as of the time of the move roughly 40 hours ago was the fourth-largest corporate holder of bitcoin, BitcoinTreasuries data showed, with about 10,000 tokens. Tesla accumulated its holdings in 2021 and sold a sizable chunk amid the 2022 bear market.  Available data from Arkham Intelligence on the Wednesday move showed the BTC was transferred to new wallets and not to any exchange, alleviating early fears of a sizable sale. Tesla or Musk are yet to publicly comment on the movement, though more detail may come early next week when the company reports its third quarter earnings results.  The reason(s) for now are limited to speculation and they range from wallet management to restructuring, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn told CoinDesk in a Telegram interview on Thursday:  Compliance or Internal Audits: Tesla may transfer bitcoin to meet accounting or legal obligations related to reporting or internal audits.  Wallet Management: Tesla likely uses multiple wallets for operational purposes. This doesn't seems likely because the newly created addresses uses similar Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (P2PKH) addresses.  Restructuring Funds: This could be part of a strategy to reorganize bitcoin holdings in anticipation of future sales or loans, similar to movements seen with Mt. Gox. However, that speculation should be avoided until there is evidence of a sale, such as a transfer to Coinbase. For now, that's not the case.  Another possible reason getting some social media chatter could be the consolidation of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) - i.e., the process of combining multiple UTXOs into one or fewer UTXOs. A UTXO can be considered as individual, unspent amounts of any token waiting to be used in future transactions.  Each UTXO used in a transaction increases the transaction size, which can lead to higher fees because miners charge based on the data size of the transaction. Consolidating leads to fewer inputs for future transactions, potentially reducing the cost and increasing the speed of a larger transaction in the future.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/17/four-reasons-elon-musks-tesla-may-have-moved-760m-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9be5ac7b3a35e08bf14a6189f14e47d5cb15d92-2048x1399.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34809929,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648471,1729170018,BNB Rejection At Key Level Hints At A Potential Price Correction,"BNB has faced a significant rejection at a critical resistance level, raising concerns among traders about a potential price correction. After an impressive rally, the momentum has faltered, leaving the cryptocurrency at a crossroads. This key level has proven to be a formidable barrier, indicating that selling pressure may be increasing as bears step in. However, the big question is whether this rejection marks the beginning of a downward correction or if the bulls can muster enough strength to regain their footing and continue pushing higher. As the market navigates this pivotal moment, this piece will analyze BNB’s recent rejection at the critical resistance level and assess the implications for its price trajectory. By examining market trends, technical indicators, and trading volumes, this analysis will explore the possibility of a correction and what it could mean for traders. Indicators Pointing Toward A Downside Correction For BNB Recently, BNB’s price has turned bearish on the 4-hour chart, pulling back toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after facing rejection at the $605 resistance level. This downward move signals a shift in market sentiment as bulls struggle to maintain upward momentum. The rejection at the $605 resistance level has triggered heightened selling pressure that could push the price lower for a potential correction. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that the signal line has dropped to 57%, retreating from its previous position in overbought territory. Typically, this decline indicates that the bullish momentum is weakening after reaching a peak, as buyers are beginning to lose steam. Related Reading: BNB Under Siege: Failed Recovery Sparks Fears of Deeper Losses Furthermore, on the daily chart, BNB is exhibiting negative momentum, as evidenced by the formation of a bearish candlestick, despite trading above the 100-day SMA. This situation reveals a possible contradiction in market sentiment. Meanwhile, if selling pressure continues and BNB is unable to maintain its position above the 100-day SMA, it may lead to a more significant price drop. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI has experienced a decline to 69% after rising to 62%, reflecting strong optimistic sentiment and buying pressure. Although the RSI remains above 60%, which suggests a bullish outlook, the recent drop signals that the upward momentum may be slowing down. Key Support Levels To Watch After The Rejection Following BNB’s recent rejection at the $605 resistance level, the critical support zone to watch is around $531, where buying interest may emerge. If the price drops below this level, it could signal a deeper bearish move, with the potential to push BNB down toward the $500 mark and beyond. In addition, a break below these key levels could intensify selling pressure and set the stage for further declines, making them crucial areas for traders to monitor in the short term. Related Reading: BNB Price Struggles to Hold $500: Is a Breakout Coming? However, should the bulls manage to mount a comeback and push the price above $605, the asset could continue its upward movement toward the next resistance range at $635. A successful breach of this level may trigger additional gains, allowing the price to challenge other resistance points above.

42422065,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeiwFmz,1729167162,Ongoing Profit-Taking Could Slow Bitcoin's Move to Record High,"The last time the DXY index was above 103, it was during the Yen carry trade unwind back on Aug. 5 when bitcoin dropped to $49,000.  Over 94% of the bitcoin circulating supply is now sitting in profit, historical data tell us profit-taking should start to build up.  Bitcoin {BTC}}, the largest token by market cap, has surged 12% this week, likely setting the stage for a record high in the coming weeks.  The expected progress toward new highs, however, may be slow due to profit-taking. That's because data tracked by Glassnode show approximately 5% of the BTC circulating supply is in loss, while the rest of 95% is in profit.  The latter means there could be selling pressure from profitable holders liquidating their coins in a rising market.  Historically, bitcoin has faced selling pressure, resulting in price corrections, whenever the percent of supply in profit has crossed the 94% threshold.  Long-term holders (LTH), defined by Glassnode as those holding coins or at least 155 days, could be the one taking profits, living up to their reputation of being smart traders or those that buy when prices are depressed and sell into a rising market. As of writing, LTHs hold only 500,000 BTC at a loss, which is a small fraction, considering they hold 14 million BTC as a cohort.  Meanwhile, short-term holders currently own 235,000 BTC at a loss, the lowest since March during bitcoin's all-time high.  Profit-taking has begun  Realized profit has increased over the past week, signaling profit taking from some investors.  Glassnode data shows that over $11 billion in realized profit has taken place in just over a week, with $5.6 billion on Oct. 8 alone, making it the single biggest profit-taking day since May 28.  Strong momentum  Two factors show the true strength of this rally: bitcoin dominance making new cycle highs and approaching 60%, which was last seen in April 2021.  In addition, BTC remains resilient even as the DXY index continues to climb higher, now above 103.5. The last time the DXY index was above 103 was during the yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5, which sent bitcoin plummeting from $65,000 to $49,000 over a few days.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/17/ongoing-profit-taking-could-slow-bitcoins-move-to-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63d641b872a4055f8df2480055e96ded7276dc30-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,039.00 -1.08%  Bitcoin (BTC): $67,083.27 -0.76%  Ether (ETH): $2,609.37 -0.27%  S&P 500: 5,842.47 +0.47%  Gold: $2,688.52 +0.54%  Nikkei 225: 38,911.19 -0.69%  Top Stories  Bitcoin pulled back to $67,000 throughout the Asian and European mornings, showing signs of a consolidation following Wednesday's jump above $68,000. BTC was about 0.7% lower in the last 24 hours as of the late European morning, trading just above $67,000. Other major tokens showed similar minor retracements, with the broader digital asset market dipping 1%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. For the time being, bitcoin appears to have avoided an outright rejection following its move above $68,000 on Wednesday and is instead taking a breather, as traders wait for the next catalyst.  Donald Trump's lead over Kamala Harris in the prediction markets has spread beyond Polymarket to Kalshi, which is now also showing strong momentum for the Republican candidate. Trump is currently leading against Harris 56-44 on Kalshi, with a surge occurring in early October. The rise in Trump's odds on Kalshi isn't an entirely unexpected event, Jack Such, a market research analyst at Kalshi, wrote in a note Wednesday. ""Harris is falling in key demographics and has lost ground in every “Blue Wall” state over the past three weeks,"" Such wrote. Trump's lead on Polymarket has spread to 20 points, with traders seeing a 60% chance of him returning to the White House in 2025.  A growing number of Asia-based private wealth managers are entering the crypto market, with some forecasting bitcoin will hit $100,000 by year's end, according to a report by digital asset technology platform Aspen Digital. Digital assets have emerged as an alternative investment class for private wealth in Asia, with 76% of family offices and high-net-worth individuals investing in cryptocurrencies and 16% planning to do so in the future. That's a notable improvement from the previous study in 2022, when 58% had exposure to digital assets and 34% planned to invest. Most respondents cited higher returns as a primary driver, with an increasing number of respondents citing diversification and inflation hedge appeal as key motivations to invest in digital assets, the report shared with CoinDesk said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows top blockchains by the total dollar value of cryptocurrencies bridged in the past four weeks.  Ethereum leads the way, followed by Coinbase's layer 2 Base, which has seen significantly higher activity than its rival Arbitrum.

34808447,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648429,1729166418,Why This Crypto Asset Is Bitwise CIO’s Best Contrarian Bet Right Now,"In an interview with Aaron Arnold, founder of Altcoin Daily, Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Bitwise Asset Management, shared his optimistic outlook on Ethereum for 2025. Amidst a crypto landscape where Bitcoin and emerging high-performance blockchains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos dominate headlines, Hougan positions Ethereum as a “contrarian bet” that may offer significant returns for investors willing to look beyond current market sentiments. Why Ethereum Is The Best “Contrarian Bet” Hougan acknowledged Ethereum’s unique position within the crypto market. He describes Ethereum as “the asset that people love to hate; it’s kind of the middle child of crypto.” While Bitcoin maintains its status as the original cryptocurrency and a store of value, newer blockchains capture attention with promises of superior performance and innovative features. Ethereum, meanwhile, is often criticized for issues like high fees and the migration of activity to Layer-2’s, leading some to view it as outdated technology struggling to keep pace with its competitors. Related Reading: How The Israel-Iran War Could Shake Crypto Prices, Explains Arthur Hayes However, Hougan challenges this narrative by emphasizing Ethereum’s foundational role in some of the most critical and rapidly growing areas of the crypto industry. “When you step back and look at it, what are the killer apps of crypto outside of Bitcoin? They are things like stablecoins, DeFi [decentralized finance], and tokenization,” he notes. Despite the emergence of alternative platforms, Ethereum remains the leading blockchain supporting these applications. It is the primary choice for developers and institutions. “If you’re a large traditional financial player looking to build on a public blockchain what blockchain are you going to choose most likely? You’re going to choose Ethereum,” Hougan claims. The Bitwise CIO attributes Ethereum’s underperformance to a transitional phase in its development. “I think Ethereum has sort of passed over this year because it’s going through this complex teenage adjustment in its architecture,” he explained. This “teenage adjustment” refers to Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades. Hougan remains bullish on Ethereum’s long-term prospects, considering it a strong contrarian play for 2025. “Ethereum is the best contrarian bet in crypto right now,” he stated via X. Hougan believes that the market’s current focus on Bitcoin and newer blockchains has caused many to overlook Ethereum’s enduring strengths and potential for growth. He asserts that as the blockchain completes its architectural upgrades, it will be better positioned to capitalize on its dominant role in key sectors like stablecoins and DeFi. When asked whether he believes Ethereum will break it’s all-time highs, Hougan expressed cautious optimism. “I certainly think we could see that in 2025 if we see significant growth in the application space,” he responded. However, he emphasized that Ethereum’s ability to reach new price levels is more conditional compared to Bitcoin. “I think it’s maybe more conditional than Bitcoin,” he admitted. Related Reading: Crypto Prices Go Up: A ‘Cautious Bullish’ Outlook Amid Fed Worries And Market Volatility Key among these conditions is the enactment of favorable stablecoin legislation. “We need to see positive stablecoin legislation that helps that move aggressively into the mainstream,” Hougan stresses. Regulatory clarity and support for stablecoins could lead to increased adoption and integration into the mainstream financial system, directly benefiting Ethereum as the primary platform for these digital assets. Additionally, he points to the necessity for continued growth in decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum network. “We need to see more growth in apps that are built on the Ethereum ecosystem,” he added. Hougan advises investors to focus on the overall growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem rather than short-term concerns like fee structures or the migration to Layer 2 solutions. “I don’t think that’s the game to play with Ethereum right now,” he remarks regarding worries about fees and network congestion. Instead, he suggests that the intrinsic value of Ethereum will become apparent as its ecosystem expands and matures. “Think about the growth of the ecosystem, and the value will sort itself out,” he asserts. Hougan stated that while he remains bullish on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, he sees a unique opportunity with Ethereum due to its current undervaluation and the market’s overlooking of its potential. “I know I just made a very bullish case for Bitcoin; now I’m making a very bullish case for Ethereum. I am bullish for both, and I think the setup for both is pretty good,” he concludes. At press time, ETH traded at $2,624.

Thus, the fundraising activities have been described as a total failure within two days after it was launched on 15 October since WLFI has raised only around $11 million accounting for only 4% of the target. Actually, with so much effort placed to advertise the project, which was even described as a ‘crypto bank,’ things have turned out different. Related Reading: SUI Price Hits All-Time High – But Questions About Valuation Remain Technical Issues Affect Trump Token Sales It was assumed that the WLFI token would generate a huge interest especially with Trump at the helm. Co-founder Zachary Folkman said that there were more than 100,000 people ready to put their money in. The other side of the coin however is quite different. The project’s website could not be accessed for long periods, exasperating potential purchasers who tried unsuccessfully to participate in the sale. In actual sense though, the token is really held by less than 9,300 unique wallets, a far cry from the expected investor uptake. The teething problems associated with the project not only curtailed the sales during the launch but also created viable concerns regarding the future of the project. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.25 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Determining Investor Attitude And Regulatory Issues The WLFI token is described as a D regulation offering whereby it is offered to only a specific group of people known as accredited investors or individuals who either have a net worth of over $1 million or gross income of up to $200,000 annually. This limitation on investor inclusion effectively reduces the available clientele base. In addition, unlike many of the cryptocurrencies that allow for immediate trading of their tokens, WLFI tokens are non-transferable and are mainly governance tokens. Investors can vote on proposals in the platform but are relatively passive at the moment. Apart from these obstacles, Trump quite quickly after the launch published a post on social media urging his fans to invest in WLFI. He went on to say that cryptocurrency was the means to go, but his call to action did not result in an immediate upsurge of sales. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Tops $66K, Fear & Greed Index Moves To Neutral—What’s Next? A Cloudy Future Ahead? WLFI’s future is nevertheless unknown even as it battles to acquire momentum. The money gathered is meant for WLF’s treasury, but without a clear path plan or significant rewards for investors, confidence could continue to erode. Critics note that WLFI is opaque; it has not published a comprehensive white paper or business plan that seasoned investors usually demand from such initiatives. Meanwhile, despite the hiccups, Etherscan data verified that thousands of investors rushed to the Trump-endorsed DeFi project. In the first hour, 3,000 distinct addresses collected about 350 million WLFI coins in the face of the rough start.

The token, based on Solana, has an initial circulation of 1.8 billion out of a maximum 10 billion supply. Recipients can claim their tokens in two phases, with a penalty for early full withdrawal.  Trading for DBR began at $0.03 per token, aiming for a fully diluted valuation of $300 million.  The governance token of cross-chain crypto platform deBridge (DBR) went live earlier Thursday with an airdrop to 491,286 early users and loyal community members across DeFi.  DBR is an SPL token on Solana with an initial circulation of 1.8 billion and maximum supply of 10 billion. All airdrop recipients have the option to claim 50% at the token generation event (TGE), 50% six months later, or 80% at TGE minus a 20% penalty.  An airdrop is the automatic distribution of tokens to a wallet, usually based on interaction with a project or meeting certain metrics such as trading volumes or number of trades placed.  All strategic partners and core contributors are locked until six months after TGE, when vesting begins (20% unlocked, remainder vested quarterly for 3 years). Trading has opened at $0.03/DBR (at a $300M fully diluted valuation) both onchain in a DBR/USDC Meteora pool - a decentralized exchange on Solana.  DBR will allow holders to vote on future strategies and implementations of the deBridge protocol. The project has tentative plans to introduce staking features in the future.  Staking typically involves users locking up their tokens on a protocol or blockchain in exchange for a cut of fees. Cross-chain services allow users to transfer tokens between different blockchains, allowing for funds to be utilized on networks where they weren’t originally supported.  Data shows that deBridge is widely used to transfer funds between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana and Base, among other blockchains. Since April 2023, it has recorded over $3.3 billion in bridged volume between Solana and Ethereum networks alone, bagging the platform millions of dollars in revenues.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/17/debridge-token-goes-live-with-dbr-airdropped-to-491k-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48cf269fc960874795ab1f931a07703eea11717a-5333x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what this could mean for the asset. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Is Currently Showing Red Values As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index is inside the negative zone right now. The “Coinbase Premium Index” is an indicator that measures the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means the BTC price listed on Coinbase is currently higher than that on Binance. Such a trend suggests the former is observing a higher buying pressure (or a lower selling pressure) than the latter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Nearly Here: Will This Lead To A Top? On the other hand, the negative indicator implies that Coinbase users are participating in a higher degree of selling than Binance ones, as the coin is trading at a lower rate there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has shown an interesting relationship with price until recently. It would appear that whenever the metric would assume positive values, the asset would rally, and whenever it would dip into the negative territory, the price would also plunge. This pattern extends beyond the chart window, as 2024 in its entirety has generally shown the two moving with notable correlation. The trend naturally suggests that Coinbase users have been potential market drivers, as the changes in their behavior have been inducing price action. Coinbase is the preferred platform of investors based in the US, especially large institutional entities, while Binance is the hub of global investors. As such, the index’s value tells us about how the behavior of American whales differs from the rest of the world. While the US-based institutional investors have been key for much of 2024, the pattern appears to have diverged recently. The chart shows that as the latest rally in the Bitcoin price has occurred, the indicator’s value has been red. This isn’t the only pattern that has been broken, as the index also tends to turn green whenever the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness inflows. The spot ETFs have seen significant net inflows recently, but the metric’s value has not flipped. “This raises the question of whether investors on Binance, whether retailers, institutions, or whales, are surpassing the buying pressure on Coinbase Pro,” notes the quant. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Fastest Rise In 5 Months: Brace For More Volatility? It remains to be seen if the index and the price will continue to show a divergence shortly, implying a possible shift in market structure away from being Coinbase-dominated, or if it’s just a temporary deviation.

42422055,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeiwFTI,1729158401,Vitalik Buterin Wants Ethereum to Hit 100K Transaction Per Second With Rollups,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin set a goal of 100,000 TPS for Ethereum in a Thursday blog post.  This goal will be hit with increased integration of Layer 2s, but some work on standardization will need to be done first.  Ethereum will eventually be able to push through 100,000 transactions per second (tps) according to a roadmap laid out in a new blog post from the network co-founder Vitalik Buterin, which outlined what users can expect from 'The Surge' – the next chapter in the protocol's Dencun upgrade.  Buterin says this 100,000 TPS goal will be achieved through Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, which combines Layer 2 scaling solutions, advanced data availability sampling, and data compression techniques.  ""The rollup-centric roadmap proposes a simple division of labor: the Ethereum L1 focuses on being a robust and decentralized base layer, while L2s take on the task of helping the ecosystem scale,"" Buterin wrote in the post.  ""This is a pattern that recurs everywhere in society: the court system (L1) is not there to be ultra-fast and efficient, it's there to protect contracts and property rights, and it's up to entrepreneurs (L2) to build on top of that sturdy base layer,"" he continued.  Buterin writes that the easy solution to all of this might be to simply increase Ethereum’s gas limit, however, this would increase centralization as any increase would demand costly hardware, pushing out smaller nodes and leading to fewer, more centralized validators.  Instead, Buterin advocates a nuanced approach, exploring cost-optimized gas fees and introducing an efficient bytecode format, EOF (Ethereum Object Format).  Buterin also took aim at the friction between Layer 2s, which play an important role in helping scale Ethereum, but feel like walled gardens.  ""Ethereum should feel like one ecosystem, not 34 different blockchains,"" he wrote, suggesting adding standardized chain identifiers to addresses and improving cross-L2 standards to streamline multi-chain interactions.  Buterin gave an example of how he lost $100 on Polymarket not from a bad bet, but by selecting the wrong chain.  ""If we are serious about the idea that L2s are part of Ethereum, we need to make using the L2 ecosystem feel like using a unified Ethereum ecosystem,"" he wrote in the post.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/17/vitalik-buterin-wants-ethereum-to-hit-100k-transaction-per-second-with-rollups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/635cd07942635ddd916c4ea9676cbae4e87431a8-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kaiko pointed to a notable drop in 2% BTC market depth on Coinbase in a report early this week.  Trading conditions on Coinbase (COIN) remain stable, the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange said on Tuesday, downplaying reports of a notable drop in the bitcoin {{BTC}} order book liquidity amid the U.S. SEC's lawsuit against market maker Cumberland.  ""We have not seen a material change or decline in BTC-USD depth at 2% throughout Oct,"" Coinbase's spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email, responding to a recent report by Paris-based Kaiko, which said liquidity, measured by the 2% market depth, declined on Oct. 10 after the SEC charged Cumberland for operating as an unregistered dealer in more than $2 billion worth of crypto assets traded since March 2018.  In a report published Monday, crypto data analysis firm Kaiko said the 2% BTC depth on Coinbase started declining on Oct. 10 at 18:00 UTC, dropping by 37% to 315 BTC within a few hours. The decline meant an order 37% smaller in size than before 18:00 UTC could have moved the spot price by 2% in either direction.  The 2% market depth represents a collection of buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price or average bid and the ask/offer prices. The metric helps gauge liquidity or the market's ability to process large trading orders at stable prices while minimum slippage – the difference between the expected price and the price at which the order is filled – for the market participant.  Kaiko noted that while the ask-side depth, representing sell orders, dropped, bid depth for buy orders increased, indicating that ""market makers had readjusted their positions, possibly anticipating a price decline.""  Other exchanges also witnessed a drop in liquidity, Kaiko added, saying overall liquidity on U.S. exchanges remained below pre-lawsuit levels.  In a mail to CoinDesk, Cumberland expressed reservations with the analysis, drawing attention to their recent public statement, which suggested no changes in its activities due to the SEC's lawsuit.  ""We are not making any changes to our business operations or the assets in which we provide liquidity as a result of this action by the SEC,"" the statement said.  Kaiko, in its latest statement to CoinDesk, said the liquidity has since recovered, reiterating that the initial drop in the ask-side liquidity may have been due to shifts in market expectations.  10:04 UTC: Corrects the decline in the market depth to 37% from the previous 46%.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/17/coinbase-says-bitcoin-liquidity-on-exchange-unfazed-after-secs-lawsuit-against-cumberland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f8e845d301c236d4f4687a125d984bf99f2fe55-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Ethereum Could Target $3,400 Once It Breaks Above Bullish Pattern – Details The Quiet Accumulation Of ETH From Whales IntoTheBlock reported via its X account that Ethereum’s large holder net flow has increased notably over the past 30 days. Specifically, whale wallets, which hold more than 0.1% of Ethereum’s total supply, have recorded consistent net outflows, signaling “accumulation.” According to the data, net outflows were recorded on just three days in the last month, meaning these large holders were predominantly adding to their positions.

In the last 24 hours, the asset has seen a slight increase of 1.3%, bringing its current trading price to $2,616, at the time of writing. Additionally, Ethereum’s daily trading volume has also increased significantly in the past week from below $14 billion last Wednesday to currently above $18 billion as of today. Amid this price performance, crypto analyst CrediBULL shared his latest outlook on Ethereum. In a post on X, the analyst expressed concerns over Ethereum’s relative weakness against Bitcoin.

42422064,lZj3zXFJWcbTdP3qeiwFlC,1729152794,Kalshi Finds 'Widespread Evidence' of Strong Republican Momentum in U.S. Elections,"A market research report from Kalshi shows that there's strong Republican momentum going into the last weeks of the campaign.  Meanwhile many are suspicious of the motivation of one of the largest holders of the pro-Trump side on Polymarket's election contract.  Republican candidate Donald Trump commands a significant lead against his Democratic rival Kamala Harris on Kalshi and other prediction markets. While this has led to accusations that dark money is manipulating markets, a new research report from Kalshi outlines the case for broad support for Trump and suggests that it might not be a close race.  Trump is currently leading against Harris 56-44 on Kalshi, with a surge occurring in early October – a few days after Trump's surge on Polymarket.  The rise in Trump's odds on Kalshi isn't an entirely unexpected event, Jack Such, a market research analyst at Kalshi, wrote in a note Wednesday.  ""Harris is falling in key demographics and has lost ground in every “Blue Wall” state over the past three weeks,"" Such wrote, pointing to Harris' significant underperformance with black men, who traditionally are stalwart democrat supporters, compared to Obama.  With Trump's odds of winning the popular vote rising, Such observes that there's not a misprice as the odds of winning the popular vote are in line with his chances in the main election contract.  ""Relative to the changes in the main presidential market’s odds, Trump’s chance to win the electoral college and popular vote came exclusively at the expense of his odds to win the electoral college and lose the popular vote,"" Such wrote. ""[This tells] us that the hypothesis on Kalshi behind a Trump victory is rooted in a belief in his widespread support rather than a belief that he’ll scrape by in a key swing state or two.""  Trump's projected popular vote surge is largely fueled by North Carolina, where his landslide win odds jumped from 3.5% to 19%, alongside gains in Pennsylvania (+4%) and a slight lead in Michigan, reflecting a weakening Blue Wall for Harris.  Dark money or a French connection?  Trump's surge isn't isolated to one prediction market, as his momentum is observed on Polymarket as well as the U.K's gambling platform Betfair.  But massive pro-Trump bets on Polymarket – which does not have a know-your-customer (KYC) mechanism – by one account, which appears to have a collection of affiliated accounts, has many within the political forecasting community wondering if dark money is trying to manipulate the markets.  A mysterious high-stakes bettor, identified as ""Fredi9999,"" has spent $25 million solely betting on Trump across prediction markets, according to research done by Polymarket whale 'Domer'.  Fredi, according to on-chain detective work done by Domer, appears to operate under multiple accounts, Fredi9999, PrincessCaro, Michie, and Theo, funded through sizeable Kraken deposits (in precise amounts like $500,000 or $1 million).  Each account follows a similar betting pattern, concentrating exclusively on Trump, likely to disguise the trades as individual actions rather than one coordinated investment.  Domer briefly chatted with Fredi on Discord, and crowd-sourced linguistic analysis of their conversation points to someone who has French as a mother tongue.  But what's missing is an explanation of why Fredi is doing this. Is this an operative trying to pour in dark money to influence an election? Or, is it just a wealthy French trader with a strong pro-Trump conviction?  On Twitter, many have pointed to a hole in the theory that this is dark money at play: Trump's surge is reflected across multiple markets, and, as Kalshi's analyst Such argued, in the polls as well.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/17/kalshi-research-finds-widespread-evidence-of-strong-republican-momentum-in-us-elections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ad5dce42b8b4ec691fff2a833386c188d5bbc3f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some analysts believe the cryptocurrency is preparing to catch up with Bitcoin and aim for March highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Road To $70,000? Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels Ethereum Getting Ready To Challenge BTC This week, Ethereum has successfully reclaimed the $2,500 support zone following the market’s recent performance. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen an 8.6% increase in the last seven days, moving from the $2,300-$2,400 range to the $2,600 mark. In the last 24 hours, ETH has retested the $2,600 resistance level, currently holding it as support as it attempts to reclaim the $2,700 price range. This zone is the next crucial level, as the cryptocurrency hasn’t successfully broken above it in nearly three months. Market analyst CryptoWolf pointed out that Ethereum has been rejected from the local top around this level twice since August’s market crash, making it the next big resistance to break. However, once the zone is cleared, ETH’s price is “heading straight to the 3500s” since the analyst considers that the $3,000 mark “won’t stand a chance.” Similarly, crypto analyst Alex Clay suggested that the King of Altcoins is about to “catch up on BTC” and rise toward $3,500. To the analyst, Ethereum completed its local accumulation within the $2,100-$2,700 range, and “it’s ready to switch the short-term trend for the bullish.” Other market watchers also suggested that the market is near the bottom after the sideway moves, based on the ETH/BTC chart. Tony Research stated that the chart “suggests that altcoins are currently cheap relative to Bitcoin. An increase in this chart will positively affect altcoins and their prices.” As the investor pointed out, altcoins could see significant growth during Q1 2025 since Q4s have historically been Bitcoin’s best time to grow. ETH Attempts Breakout From Bullish Pattern Analyst Crypto Yapper noted that Ethereum is trying to break from its consolidating formation. The cryptocurrency has been within a three-month symmetrical triangle pattern, and it attempted to break above the upper trendline on Tuesday. Yesterday, ETH rose momentarily above the trendline after hitting $2,688 but quickly retraced to $2,550. Ethereum tried another breakout from the symmetrical triangle upper trendline on Wednesday, surging above $2,630 before settling around the $2,600 support zone. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Gearing Up For ‘Massive Breakout’, Will It Skyrocket To $20? To the analyst, Ethereum will target the $2,900 mark next if it breaks out of this formation. Recovering this level could propel ETH’s price to its March highs, as the $2,900-$3,000 price range was a key support zone during the rally’s first leg. Meanwhile, season trader Peter Brandt recently highlighted an inverted Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern on ETH’s chart.

34800874,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648373,1729148412,"Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Of 58.9%, More Pain Before Altcoin Season?","As Bitcoin (BTC) inches closer to $70,000, its dominance in the wider crypto market has risen to a cycle high of 58.9%. Bitcoin Dominance Rises, Are Altcoins In Trouble? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), a metric that measures the proportion of the total cryptocurrency market cap commanded by the leading digital asset, has hit a new cycle high of 58.9%. The last time the crypto market witnessed this level of BTC.D was in April 2021. After a slight pullback following Iran’s attack on Israel earlier this month, Bitcoin has risen by almost 10% in the past week, trading at $67,769 at the time of writing. Related Reading: Crypto Market’s “Shallow Sell-Off” Indicative Of Strong Bid For Risk Assets: Trading Firm Concurrently, the total crypto market cap has surged from $2.26 trillion on October 8, to $2.41 trillion on October 16, according to data from CoinGecko. However, the rise in the total crypto market cap is largely buoyed by the upward movement in BTC price. At the start of October, BTC.D hovered around 57.1%. Since then, it has risen by approximately 1.8%, showcasing Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and others. The current level of BTC.D has cast doubt on the prospects for the much-anticipated “altseason,” typically characterized by parabolic price increases in altcoins and a decline in BTC.D. Notably, BTC.D peaked at 70% during the post-COVID bull market in 2020-21 before dropping to 40% by mid-2021. In late 2022, BTC.D bottomed out at around 39% amid the collapse of FTX, which halted operations due to fraud charges against its leadership. Since then, BTC.D has been on a gradual rise, as shown in the chart below. ETH/BTC Ratio Must Rebound For A Potential Altseason As BTC.D continues to rise, it is important to consider the ETH/BTC trading pair. For the uninitiated, the ETH/BTC trading pair – colloquially known as the ETH/BTC ratio – tracks Ethereum’s (ETH) performance against BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains On Bitcoin Following Fed Rate Cut: Altseason Soon? At press time, ETH/BTC trading pair stands at 0.0385, a level last seen in April 2021. The chart below shows that Ethereum has failed to establish a higher high against Bitcoin since at least November 2022, reflecting weak ETH price action over the past two years. A strong ETH performance against BTC often precedes an altseason, but there are no clear signs of a meaningful trend reversal. Further, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols across all blockchains has slid from almost $110 billion in June 2024 to $88 billion, indicating weak demand for altcoins among crypto investors. However, some crypto analysts and technical indicators still suggest a potential altseason may be on the horizon. For example, earlier this month, the altcoin market cap surpassed its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), a key resistance level that signals strong altcoin performance in recent days. Similarly, Steno Research recently remarked that ETH is set for a comeback following the US Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts. BTC trades at $67,769 at press time, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

DeFi, AI, and DePin are key areas of interest.  Private wealth is long-term bullish on crypto, expecting BTC to trade in five figures by the end of December.  A growing number of Asia-based private wealth managers are entering the crypto market, with some forecasting bitcoin {{BTC}} will hit $100,000 by year's end, according to a report by digital asset technology platform Aspen Digital.  Digital assets have emerged as an alternative investment class for private wealth in Asia, with 76% of family offices and high-net-worth individuals investing in cryptocurrencies and 16% planning to do so in the future.  That's a notable improvement from the previous study in 2022, when 58% had exposure to digital assets and 34% planned to invest.  Most respondents cited higher returns as a primary driver, with an increasing number of respondents citing diversification and inflation hedge appeal as key motivations to invest in digital assets, the report shared with CoinDesk said.  The latest findings are based on a survey of more than 80 family offices and high-net-worth individuals conducted in the second half of this year. Most respondents had assets under management (AUM) between $10 million and $500 million, with 20% boasting an AUM of $500 or more. The report includes contributions from contributions from SBI Digital Markets and Family Office Association of Hong Kong.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) remained a significant area of interest, with 67% of respondents interested in DeFi development, followed by 61% in artificial intelligence and decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePin), 50% in blockchain infrastructure 47% in real-world assets (RWA) tokenization.  ""We believe every asset class will eventually transition onto the blockchain, capitalizing on the competitive advantages that blockchain technologies offer, representing immense growth potential for DeFi. Currently, approximately 85 million users are engaging with financial services on-chain and we anticipate this number will surpass 200 million by the end of 2025,"" Re7 Capital said.  One respondent pointed to the ease of trading memecoins on Ethereum's rival Solana, while another manager called liquid restaking tokens (LRT) ""too complex"" to take the exposure.  The survey also highlighted a preference for institutional-grade digital asset custody.  Market outlook  The private wealth sector held a long-term bullish outlook, with 31% of respondents expecting bitcoin to rise to at least $100,000 by the end of the fourth quarter.  Respondents mentioned interest rate cuts, the U.S. presidential election results and favorable crypto industry developments as main bullish drivers.  Muted allocation  Despite the optimism, the majority of private wealth managers allocate less than 5% of their portfolio to digital assets.  The report cited the fragmented nature of the digital asset landscape, regulatory uncertainty and poor user experience as critical obstacles for widespread adoption.  That said, 30% of respondents were hopeful of boosting exposure in the future, and several high-net-worth individuals and family offices have already increased exposure from less than 5% to over 10% in 2024 while seeking exposure to the broader crypto market in the wake of the debut of spot-based bitcoin and ether ETFs.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/17/asian-private-wealth-managers-embrace-crypto-some-foresee-bitcoin-at-100k-by-year-end,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d85b5013bc134d2f3686eec3883bd8ccc41b2ee-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Swarm and OrdinalsBot's service involves inscribing satoshis with unique gold kilobar serial numbers, in effect allowing them to be traded on Bitcoin's Ordinals protocol.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is often referred to as ""digital gold,"" but now it will be possible to mint and trade physical gold on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol for the first time.  Swarm Markets, a real-world assets (RWA) platform licensed by German regulator BaFin, is offering investment in gold bars on the Bitcoin network in partnership with OrdinalsBot.  Gold will become the first RWA available on Trio, a marketplace developed by OrdinalsBot which is set to launch by the end of the year.  Ordinals involves inscribing individual satoshis (the smallest unit of BTC at 1/100,000,000 of a full bitcoin) with data, such as images or text, making them unique and attaining individual value. They're often thought of Bitcoin's version of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.  Swarm and OrdinalsBot's service involves inscribing satoshis with unique gold kilobar serial numbers, in effect allowing them to be traded on Bitcoin's Ordinals protocol.  Bitcoin is often compared to gold because of the properties they share as a store of value due to their finite supply. However, BTC does not always perform as well as gold during risk-off situations. This was highlighted in the third quarter of this year amid concerns of a U.S. recession when gold climbed 10% to record highs while BTC managed a negligible 0.8% gain.

Inflows into the U.S. BTC ETFs continue to be significant with $458.5 million inflow during the Wednesday trading day.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} demand is returning after being mostly muted since May, with apparent demand spiking to a monthly growth of 177,000 BTC last week in a move that preceded a 5% rally.  Bitcoin is up 11% on-week, according to CoinDesk Indices data, beating the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index of the largest digital assets, which is up 9.6% during the same time period.  That’s the largest reading since late April and has helped push BTC to a ten-week high price level of over $67,800, analysts at CryptoQuant led by Julio Moreno said in a weekly report.  “An expansion of apparent demand is necessary for bitcoin prices to rally sustainably to a new all-time high. In these cases, apparent demand peaked at 490,000-550,000 BTC,” Moreno said, indicating more room for prices to grow.  The chart below shows how positive and growing apparent demand preceded the BTC price rallies to new record highs in 2020-2021 and 2024.  Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the USA have been net buyers, with positive inflows of an average of almost 9,000 BTC daily in Q1 2024, helping to drive the price of bitcoin to fresh highs.  Data from SoSoValue shows that the U.S. BTC ETFs had another significant day of inflows Wednesday, with $458.5 million. Of all the listed products, Blackrock’s IBIT took in the most at $393.4 million.  Other large investors also continue to accumulate bitcoin. The total balance of bitcoin whales - or influential large holders - excluding exchanges and mining pools, has continued to expand yearly, growing to 670,000 BTC. Moreover, the growth of holdings stands above its 365-day moving average, a positive sign for prices.  The BTC open interest (OI) weighted perpetual futures funding rate spiked to a multi-month high of over 0.0136% earlier this week - signaling increased volatility ahead as new money entered the market.  Polymarket bettors are giving a 64% that BTC will hit $70,000 in October, odds that are up 45 percentage points in the last week. They are also giving a 75% chance BTC will hit a new all-time high in 2024, up 23 percentage points during the same time period.

Singh pled guilty to six criminal charges in February 2023.  Lawyers representing former FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh have asked a federal judge to spare him prison in a sentencing submission document filed with the U.S. Southern District of New York on Oct. 16.  The filing describes Singh as an “uncommonly selfless individual” and includes more than 100 letters from family, friends and former colleagues.  “His role was far more limited than any other defendant. He does not minimize his conduct; he pled guilty to serious crimes at the outset of this case and will regret his actions for the rest of his life. But his sentence should recognize that Nishad did not join the conspiracy at the heart of this case – the theft of FTX customer funds – until September 2022, just two months before the collapse of FTX,” his lawyers wrote.  The document also noted that following FTX’s announcement that it would declare bankruptcy, Singh flew to New York and cooperated with authorities.  “The evidence Nishad provided in those early meetings was critical to helping the government bring both Sam Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame to justice,” the document states.  Singh pled guilty to six criminal charges, including fraud and conspiracy for his role in the collapse of FTX in February 2023. He testified against his former boss, Sam Bankman-Fried, during his trial in October 2023.  Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March this year after being found guilty on seven different fraud and conspiracy charges. His former girlfriend and CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, received two years last month after pleading guilty to the same charges as Bankman-Fried. The CEO of FTX Digital Markets, Ryan Salame, began a 7.5 year prison sentence earlier this month after pleading guilty to charges of operating an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiring to defraud the Federal Election Commission.

34799327,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648368,1729144802,"Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin Could Surge 250%, Yet Warns Of Potential Drop To $10,000","As the week progressed, the Bitcoin (BTC) price steadily climbed toward its all-time high of $73,700 in March of this year. This upward momentum is in line with the predictions of various market experts, expecting significant gains for the leading cryptocurrency by the end of the year. One such expert, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen, recently shared his insights on Bitcoin’s price trajectory via social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He analyzed BTC’s parabolic curve and identified a distinctive step-like formation pattern, which he believes signals a colossal wave 5 rally in the coming months. Potential ‘Shake-Out Of The Century’ In his analysis, van Lagen presented a Bitcoin chart demonstrating that the cryptocurrency has successfully navigated several hurdles since April 2023. He categorized the price movement into three distinct phases, marking the base of the uptrend pattern that has ignited the current bullish trend. Currently, van Lagen notes that Bitcoin’s price action is centered around base 4 of this pattern, indicating a consolidation phase between the $53,700 and $68,000 levels, with the former identified as bull market support for this cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin Van Lagen asserts that the validation of Wave 4 is imminent as Bitcoin approaches its record peak. He predicts that once Bitcoin breaks through base 4 and achieves a new all-time high, it could trigger a substantial rally in wave 5, potentially targeting prices around $250,000. However, the analyst also warns of a significant downturn that may follow this surge. He suggests that once Bitcoin reaches the anticipated peak, a “recession” could ensue, with price targets plummeting to as low as $10,000, and in a more extreme scenario, down to $1,000. He describes this potential decline as the “shake-out of the century,” should these projections materialize. In the medium term, the increased volatility that has characterized Bitcoin’s price over the past month has prompted the analyst to explain that if Bitcoin fails to break through the $70,000 resistance level – a barrier it has struggled with in four previous attempts – then the $57,500 level will serve as a crucial support level for the cryptocurrency. Historical Patterns Suggest Bitcoin Price Increases Ahead In another sign of confidence in the biggest cryptocurrency’s prospects for further gains, Blockforce Capital’s Brett Munster noted that conditions are ripe for a “perfect storm” favoring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies after six months of price consolidation. Munster highlighted the role of global liquidity in this potential surge, pointing to increased capital injections from central banks worldwide. Notably, China has implemented stimulus measures to revitalize its economy. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Fastest Rise In 5 Months: Brace For More Volatility? Historical data suggests that when global liquidity surpasses its moving average, it often coincides with substantial price increases for Bitcoin. In addition, optimism in the crypto market is further bolstered by a commitment from US Vice President Kamala Harris to support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in response to long-standing concerns from the crypto community regarding the regulatory environment. At the time of writing, BTC has been trading at $68,300, up 3.6% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin mining remains challenging with profitability near historic lows, despite MARA's Slipstream product slightly boosting transaction fee revenue. MARA's strategy of borrowing to buy Bitcoin has significantly increased its BTC holdings, but at higher interest rates compared to competitors like MicroStrategy. With 25.7% short interest, MARA shares are highly shorted, reflecting market skepticism, yet potential for short squeezes could drive price spikes. Back in May when I last wrote about Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) for Seeking Alpha, I called the stock a 'hold' and made note of the company's edge over other mining pools in average block fees. I also highlighted the trend in production and industry profitability, among other things. Since then, we have some new catalysts that I think lend credence to the notion that MARA shares will ultimately serve as little more than trading instruments rather than a quality investment over time. In this update, we'll look at MARA's 'diversification' of the company's mining footprint to another cryptocurrency, re-assess how MARA Pool is progressing against the competition, and consider the company's new BTC acquisition strategy. Pivoting To Kaspa Mining In late-June, MARA announced it had begun mining Kaspa ( KAS-USD ) in addition to its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining operation to diversify away from just BTC. In the press release, MARA mentioned the Kaspa mining strategy actually started in September 2023. Marathon also noted Kaspa mining margins of up to 95% in certain cases, given the price of KAS and the low network difficulty rate for miners. Marathon guided for full energization of its 60 petahash Kaspa ASIC purchases by the end of Q3. The chart below is quite telling: KAS Hash Rate (kaspalytics) Kaspa currently has a global hash rate approaching 1.2 EH/s. But what I find interesting is the timing of the enormous spike in KAS mining in mid-July. The global hash rate for Kaspa mining was 0.35 EH/s the day Marathon announced its Kaspa mining strategy. Global exahash is now roughly three times that level, and yet, the price of KAS is actually down 25%: KAS Daily Chart (TrendSpider) So any real Kaspa profit edge that MARA had in June before announcing its Kaspa strategy is likely gone at this point. It's three times more difficult to generate a coin that is worth 25% less than it was the day of MARA's press release. If the company's goal was to tout a profitable new business line, it doesn't appear that it has lasted very long. Bitcoin Mining Challenges I think it's important to understand that the very notion that MARA would mention Kaspa mining is not a small admission from the biggest public miner in the industry that mining BTC is a bad business: Bitcoin Hashprice, 1yr (Hashrateindex) Though it's slightly ahead of the lows from August and September, the US dollar-denominated hash price for Bitcoin has been under $50 per PH/s for most of the last 5 months. Bitcoin mining profitability is still very much near the lowest levels in the history of the chain. I've covered this ad nauseam at this point, but the fixed supply of the native asset means miners need higher BTC prices in perpetuity or a larger share of transaction fees as a percentage of total rewards. Miner Rewards Distribution (IntoTheBlock) I think it should go without saying, Bitcoiners would want to see the latter option be the way miners are incentivized going forward. So far, we're simply not seeing the stickiness of transaction fees for longer than a few weeks at a time. Since the April halving, transaction fee percent of total miner rewards has averaged about 4%. This is inline with what the average has been since the beginning of 2022. However, more recently, that average has dipped back below 2%. To company's credit, MARA has taken steps to get more than its 'fair share' of revenue from transactions through its Slipstream product. I covered this in my last MARA article from May, and I would recommend reading that for more details. But the main takeaway is MARA Pool can generate more from transaction fees if users decide to go to MARA directly for transaction validation. In May, MARA Pool was getting an 11% bump over expected block fees, which, I believe, was a direct result of Slipstream. Rank Pool Blocks Avg Block Fees Empty Blocks 1 Foundry USA 7748 (29.33%) -1.71% 0 (0.00%) 2 AntPool 6682 (25.3%) -1.73% 34 (0.51%) 3 ViaBTC 3533 (13.37%) -1.61% 4 (0.11%) 4 F2Pool 2784 (10.54%) -2.18% 6 (0.22%) 5 MARA Pool 1086 (4.11%) +0.65% 0 (0.00%) 6 Binance Pool 792 (3%) -1.73% 6 (0.76%) 7 SpiderPool 777 (2.94%) -6.45% 27 (3.47%) 8 Luxor 603 (2.28%) -1.94% 5 (0.83%) 9 Braiins Pool 469 (1.78%) -1.20% 0 (0.00%) 10 SBI Crypto 466 (1.76%) -2.44% 0 (0.00%) Source: Mempool, last 6 months as of 10/16/24 We've since seen a normalization of that block fee premium going to MARA Pool. As of article submission, the block fee bump for MARA Pool is just 0.65% over the last 6 months. The good news is, MARA Pool is still outperforming the other mining pools even at that rate. Adopting The 'Infinite Money Glitch' Bitcoin mining is a very difficult business long term; that's fairly obvious at this point. I suspect MARA already knows the same is true for Kaspa mining today - which has 87% of its total supply already mined. What can the company do to benefit from long term price appreciation of BTC if there is only so much mining revenue remaining? It can adopt the 'infinite money glitch' approach that has been pioneered by MicroStrategy ( MSTR ): Monthly BTC Treasury (MARA Holdings, Author's Chart) Since the end of June, we've seen MARA's BTC position explode from 18,536 to 26,842 BTC. The company has mined 2,070 BTC since the end of June but grown its treasury by over 8.3k BTC over that period of time. This 45% three-month rip in MARA's HODL stash is mostly attributable to MARA borrowing to buy Bitcoin. The company bought $100 million in BTC in July and $249 million worth of BTC in August. For the August purchase, Marathon Digital issued $300 million in convertible senior notes due in 2031. These notes pay 2.125% interest, which is a much higher rate than what MicroStrategy has been paying creditors to do exactly the same thing. The good news is at $67k, Marathon already has a $31 million paper gain on those August BTC purchases as they came at an average price of $59.5k. Short Interest Headed Higher For me, the long term investment thesis for MARA shares is getting a bit more challenging. The company's mining operation needs higher BTC prices to be profitable. I believe the Kaspa mining experiment is already a non-winner. And the short interest in the company probably tells the tale: Data by YCharts At 25.7%, MARA has the largest percentage of shares outstanding sold short of any of the top 5 BTC mining companies in the public markets. Being a highly shorted stock isn't anything new to MARA, but the current 25.7% level would be near the high of the year. There are two ways to look at this, though. On one hand, shorting a stock shows a high level of conviction in future price declines and with more than a quarter of the shares sold short, the market is telling investors this is not a stock to buy. On the other hand, if the bears are wrong and are forced to cover, we could theoretically see an explosion to the upside as bears get squeezed: Data by YCharts We saw this happen twice in 2023 when short interest declines directly coincided with large price moves higher for MARA shares. Essentially, bears may not be wrong about the fundamental problems with Marathon's long-term business model, but that doesn't necessarily mean the price of MARA shares can't move higher anyway. Investor Takeaways I'm still rating MARA shares a 'hold' today because I suspect Bitcoin is very close to a technical breakout of 6 month resistance. Due to the fact that MARA has such a large BTC position, I suspect BTC price appreciation will drag MARA shares higher as well. But there can be little doubt at this point that the market has been rewarding BTC miners that have pivoted to HPC services. MARA seems to be pivoting more to the MicroStrategy model of borrowing long term to buy Bitcoin. If you like that approach, MSTR is probably a much better expression of that idea because the company has lower borrow costs and doesn't have the depreciation baggage that public miners have.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4727249-mara-mining-kaspa-doesnt-fix-the-fundamental-problem?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34798600.jpeg

As the broader crypto market navigates a period of volatility and uncertainty, traders eagerly search for confirmation of a potential rally. WIF, which has gained significant traction in recent months, is now at a crucial point where the next move could define its short-term future. Related Reading: Solana Will Target New ATHs Once It Breaks $160 Resistance – Analyst Prominent analyst and investor Ali Martinez has shared insightful data suggesting a bullish outlook for DogWifHat. Metrics point toward a rise in price action, which could lead to a breakout, with WIF potentially surging to the $4 mark if momentum continues to build. However, the coming days will be key in determining whether a bull trend can be confirmed as market participants await signs of sustained upward movement. All eyes are on WIF to see if it can capitalize on this moment and rally to new heights. DogWifHat Turning Point DogWifHat (WIF) is at a critical turning point, with its price hovering just above the $2.5 mark, a crucial psychological level for confirming an ongoing uptrend. Investors and traders are closely watching this level, as its ability to hold will determine whether WIF pushes to new highs or retraces to lower demand zones. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that a buy signal has appeared for WIF on a key indicator, the TD Sequential. The TD Sequential, known for accurately predicting trend reversals in the crypto market, has previously been spot-on for DogWifHat. According to Martinez, this new buy signal could be the catalyst that sends WIF into a bullish phase, fueling optimism among investors. The overall sentiment in the market is also leaning toward a potential surge as volatility continues to rise and other major cryptocurrencies show signs of life. Martinez’s analysis supports the growing belief that WIF could be on the verge of a breakout, especially if it holds the $2.5 level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising However, if the price fails to maintain this support, investors expect a drop to lower demand levels. In the coming weeks, WIF’s price movement will be pivotal in determining whether the meme coin continues its upward trajectory or faces further corrections. WIF Technical Analysis WIF is currently trading at $2.62 after experiencing a few days of volatile price action within a sustained uptrend. On Monday, the price set a new high at $2.97 but has since retraced slightly and is now testing crucial demand at a previous resistance level of around $2.5. This level is key for bulls, as holding above $2.5 would maintain the upward momentum and set WIF up to target the $3 mark, in line with the broader market’s continued push upward. However, should WIF fail to hold the $2.5 level and close below it, this could indicate a shift in the price structure and signal the start of a correction. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Traders are keeping a close eye on these levels, as a drop below $2.5 would suggest weakening bullish momentum and the potential for a pullback to lower support areas. The next few days will determine whether WIF continues its uptrend or faces a short-term retracement.

34796371,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648372,1729137609,Bitcoin Sees Massive Surge In Active Addresses: Here’s What It Signals For Price,"Bitcoin has been experiencing a notable increase in network activity, as indicated by a surge in active addresses. Data shows that the cryptocurrency has seen a resurgence in user engagement following a sluggish performance during July and August since the start of September. With this uptick in activity, it is worth assessing Bitcoin to see what this development could spell for the asset’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Breaks Above Falling Wedge Pattern—Here’s The Next Target The Increase In Active Addresses A CryptoQuant analyst, who goes by the pseudonym Crazzyblockk, recently highlighted this trend on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, emphasizing that the spike in active addresses is a promising sign for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the “Bitcoin Active Address Momentum” metric, which compares monthly and yearly moving averages of active addresses, has shown a significant rise, indicating a positive shift in network activity. For context, the Bitcoin Active Address Momentum metric is used to track changes in the level of user activity on the network. By comparing monthly and yearly moving averages, the metric helps detect increased or decreased engagement patterns. In this case, Bitcoin’s active addresses have surged above both the monthly and yearly moving averages, marking a potential turning point for the network. What This Surge In Active Addresses Means For Bitcoin Crazzyblockk explained that while it is challenging to correlate the rise in active addresses with price performance directly, this growth represents a broader trend of renewed interest in Bitcoin. Historically, spikes in active addresses have been associated with increased demand, often preceding or occurring during bullish market cycles. This surge in user participation may signal a growing demand for Bitcoin, potentially fueling a more sustained upward movement in price. Meanwhile, although Bitcoin’s price performance throughout the summer months was lackluster, increasing active addresses may catalyze a renewed bullish phase. The analyst further noted that increased network activity is often critical to long-term price growth. Therefore, this spike in active addresses is a positive development that should be monitored. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Best On-Chain Metric For ‘Day-To-Day Trading’ Network activity is often viewed as a key indicator of market sentiment and investor interest. The market may be gearing up for another expansion phase, with user engagement increasing. This could also impact other cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin’s price trends often influence the entire crypto market. So far, Bitcoin seems to be gradually reflecting the implication of this increase in network activity. Over the past week, the top crypto has risen by nearly 10% as it trades above the $67,000 price.

The price is trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $2,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rally if it clears the $2,650 and $2,680 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Eyes More Upsides Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,550 pivot level like Bitcoin. ETH cleared the $2,600 and $2,620 resistance levels. The price even spiked above $2,650 before there was a downside correction. The price is again rising and trading above the $2,600 level.

In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,750 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,880 level or $2,920. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,610 level and the trend line.

The liquidity staking platform said it now supports the deployment of its stETH value-accruing token on Optimism, a layer-2 solution for Ethereum. Expansion to Optimism: What It Means In a blog post, Lido Finance said the decision will allow its users to benefit from daily staking rewards. At the same time, the platform said, those who choose to deploy their stETH on Optimism will have a seamless bridging experience while concurrently unlocking other multichain opportunities. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Gearing Up For ‘Massive Breakout’, Will It Skyrocket To $20? The deployment means Lido Finance is expanding in line with its multichain strategy. By offering stETH and wstETH on multiple layer-2 platforms on Ethereum, including on Arbitrum, the liquidity staking solution gives users a more flexible way to stake their ETH. Moreover, because Ethereum layer-2 solutions are designed to be scaled, all transactions, Lido Finance said, will be cheap. Lido Finance is among several liquidity-staking platforms that allow users to stake their ETH and earn a yield. This is possible because Ethereum successfully migrated from a proof-of-work consensus to a staking system in 2022 after the Merge. Once developers powered off the proof-of-work system, the network was migrated to the Beacon chain. In this new chain, validators secured and processed all transactions. With validators in the equation, those who sought to operate full nodes and compete for a part of the 3 ETH block reward and fees had to lock in 32 ETH. This threshold was out of reach for most users. Accordingly, the platform allows users to stake ETH without having the 32 ETH required to run a full node. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin Lido Finance Manages Over $25 Billion, LDO Down 72% In 9 Months As of October 16, DeFiLlama data shows that Lido Finance had a total value locked (TVL) of over $25 billion. Over the last year alone, the protocol has generated over $845 million in the last year and more than $1.8 billion since launching. Although the protocol helps secure the Ethereum mainnet, ETH holders of several layer-2s, including Arbitrum, Base, Linea, and Scroll, can stake directly from these off-chain solutions. Despite Lido Finance growing its ecosystem, LDO prices are struggling for momentum. Even after gains of October 14, the token is yet to break above September highs and reverse losses of the last nine months. After peaking in March, LDO is down 72%.

34793354,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648287,1729130420,Solana Targets $160 Resistance As TVL Hits New Yearly Highs,"Solana is testing a crucial supply level around $160 following a strong 15% surge since last Friday. The crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility as optimism grows, increasing token prices. In recent weeks, Solana and other major cryptocurrencies have been on a rollercoaster ride, and the coming weeks promise continued uncertainty as volatility shows no signs of slowing down. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Bitcoin Demand Is Growing – Can BTC Break ATHs In Q4? Key metrics from DefiLlama reveal that Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has reached a new yearly high, now at around $6 billion, its highest level since September 2022. This TVL increase signals confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and decentralized finance (DeFi) offerings. Investors and traders are closely watching the market, with Solana’s performance likely to serve as a key indicator for broader market sentiment. As Solana tests this crucial resistance level, the next few days will determine whether the token continues its upward momentum or faces another round of volatility. Solana Testing Crucial Resistance Solana is flirting with a 5% surge, poised to challenge local highs and potentially confirm a long-term uptrend. As the broader crypto market experiences a shift, investors and traders are eagerly searching for signals that Solana is ready to break into new highs. Key data from DefiLlama shows that Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has reached a new yearly high of $6 billion. TVL measures the total value of assets deposited into a blockchain project and is a key indicator of user confidence and engagement. A rising TVL suggests that more users are locking their funds into Solana’s decentralized applications, a sign of growing trust in its ecosystem. This increase in TVL further supports the bullish outlook that many investors hold for Solana. The platform’s expanding DeFi offerings and solid infrastructure make it a strong contender in the altcoin space. As Solana continues to push toward new highs, such fundamental data reinforces optimism about its future price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Target $3,400 Once It Breaks Above Bullish Pattern – Details A confirmed surge above key resistance levels could begin a sustained upward trend for Solana, positioning it as one of the top performers in the market. Investors are watching closely to see if the current price movement can translate into a longer-term rally. Key Levels To Watch Solana is currently trading at $155 after a volatile session yesterday. The price successfully retested and now holds above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $151, signaling strong support for the asset. This level has been a key indicator for traders, and maintaining it is crucial for sustaining the current bullish momentum. For bulls to keep the momentum going, SOL must stay above this 200-day MA and break through the $160 level. Such a move would likely confirm a bullish trend and propel Solana to test its yearly highs around $210. This would mark a significant upward move, reflecting optimism in the market and increasing confidence among traders and investors. However, the bullish momentum could weaken if the price fails to close above $160 and holds above the 200-day MA. In this case, a retracement is likely, with the price potentially dropping to lower demand levels around $140.

Congrats to those that listened to me. pic.twitter.com/FtU5vk8f8M — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) October 13, 2024 At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $2.04, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours, but sustained an 8.7% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Valuation Inquiries Arise The rapid rise of SUI has evoked excitement among many but it has also raised doubts. In fact, some analysts are questioning whether there is a justification in the prevailing market capitalization of the token to its real fundamentals. The rising value has sparked a debate because people are trying to measure SUI’s market capitalization in order to come up with underlying problems. Such an occurrence is not unusual for coins and even tokens on the rapid expansion corner; however, it also tends to instill some doubts into potential buyers. Insider selling is another worry. Significant transactions from a foundation wallet during the token’s recent rise have raised questions about its price sustainability. Divesting during a price spike may indicate insider insecurity, making investors doubt long-term prospects. SUI market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Comparison Of Fully Diluted Valuation The complexity of SUI’s current condition is exacerbated by its Fully Diluted Valuation. The FDV of SUI is $1.2 billion, far lower than Solana’s $4.7 billion. Several market experts claim that Solana could be mispriced because the fully diluted valuation of Solana is less than one-third that of Ethereum. This has led some to conclude that SUI is overvalued at this time. Such a comparison also raises the issue of possible mispricing in the market, which makes it necessary for investors to weigh the pros and cons before getting involved. At present, there is a competition among various cryptocurrencies and knowing the valuation of such projects relative to other tokens makes one comprehend better each of the tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin Revival: Active Addresses Skyrocket To Highest Level In 8 Months What’s Next For SUI? Despite the concerns, SUI’s pictured development in the near future is optimistic.

In the coming three months, the price of SUI is expected to shoot up by 244%, which attracts many hopeful investors. It is advisable for the investors to be careful. Considering the high volume of insider sales and concerns on valuations, the future might not be so rosy as it has been projected. Keeping track of market dynamics and technical analysis will be very important for addressing the risk that comes with the rapid rise of SUI.

By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price climbed above the $60,000 level this past week. BTC is currently up ~52% year-to-date. Ether Ether ( ETH-USD ) is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $2,600. ETH is now up ~11% year-to-date. XRP XRP ( XRP-USD ), which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~14% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch.

34790291,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648310,1729123237,"Dogecoin Holder Base Falls To 6-Month Low, But Analyst Believes DOGE Price Is Headed To $10","Dogecoin (DOGE), the world’s largest meme coin has recently seen a sharp decline in its holder base, with new data confirming that the number of active long-term holders has fallen to a six-month low. Amidst this bearish development, a crypto analyst remains optimistic about Dogecoin’s price outlook, believing that it can reach new All-Time Highs (ATH) of $10 soon. Dogecoin Holder Base Sees Rapid Decline Santiment, a Market Intelligence platform has unveiled a rather bearish trend involving Dogecoin investors and holders. The platform revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on October 15 that the number of active Dogecoin holders is falling at a significantly rapid pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic Breakout Puts BTC Price Above $500,000, Here’s When Based on its reports, there has been a net loss of approximately 106,600 non-empty wallets since Tuesday, October 8. A non-empty wallet here refers to a crypto wallet that contains at least some DOGE tokens. Sharing a chart illustrating the decline in the Dogecoin holder base, Santiment revealed that the total number of Dogecoin holders is estimated currently at 6.62 million. This figure marks the lowest the DOGE holder base has ever been since April 25, 2024. The net drop of 160,600 indicates that more people are either selling off or withdrawing the DOGE tokens from their wallets than those buying the meme coin. In light of this, Santiment has noted a shift in investors’ sentiment and interest in Dogecoin. The market intelligence platform has disclosed that many traders who had invested in Dogecoin are expressing frustration about the meme coin’s poor market performance. As a result, traders, especially those looking for short-term gains, are moving away from Dogecoin in search of a cryptocurrency that might offer rapid price increases. As of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.12, experiencing slight upticks over the weeks, according to CoinMarketCap. It appears the meme coin’s 10% surge and 17% increase in the past week and month respectively, has not been enough for many investors. As the top meme coin in the market, many expect a dramatic DOGE surge to occur in order to reap immense benefits. However, the cryptocurrency’s recent fluctuating performance and inability to reach the coveted $1 mark has left many investors concerned.
