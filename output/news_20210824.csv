LTC is currently trading at $179.93, having fallen from the established key resistance point of $190 yesterday. The strong run for Litecoin has been associated with its correlation to Bitcoin. Both tokens have a correlation of almost 1, owing to the blockhain operation of both at the same time and the use of LTC as a proxy blockchain for BTC by some investors. As the largest cryptocurrency in the world extended above $50,000, Litecoin also continues to dart higher.

42413933,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAnTOV,1629844019,House Moves to Consider Unamended Infrastructure Bill,"House lawmakers will vote on Sept. 27 on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that includes a crypto tax-reporting provision that has been the subject of extensive debate on Capitol Hill. And although amending the provision has bipartisan support, it does not appear that any amendments to the infrastructure bill will be accepted.  The crux of the debate is how the infrastructure bill defines “broker” in a provision that banks on raising $28 billion over 10 years by requiring crypto ""brokers"" to report transactions .  Critics of the provision argue that the definition of a “broker” is too broad and could be interpreted to include crypto miners, node validators and developers. Crypto advocates are also concerned that the provision could impose expanded surveillance on crypto users and make it difficult for crypto businesses to operate in the United States.  A bipartisan group of crypto-friendly senators proposed an amendment to the bill that would exclude developers, validators and miners from the reporting requirement. The amendment needed unanimous consent to be adopted and was blocked by Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who tried and failed to tack on $50 billion in extra funding for the military.  On Tuesday, the House voted 220-212 to advance the bill without considering any amendments.  Brewing opposition  A growing number of congressmen have publicly stated their intentions to push back against the cryptocurrency reporting provision in the infrastructure bill.  A group of Silicon Valley-area Democrats, including Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), have voiced their opposition to the provision and called for an amendment to narrow the definition of a broker.  The bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus, headed by Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), sent a Congress-wide letter earlier this month calling for an amendment to update what he called the “dangerous” provision.  “Congress cannot cross-jurisdictionally try to pay for an infrastructure bill on the backs of our crypto industry through legislation that was slapped together with little to no consideration for the crypto industry,"" Emmer wrote in a statement.  Other representatives, including Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), have joined the bipartisan fight, calling the provision “hastily drafted” and “burdensome” on the cryptocurrency industry. A spokesperson for Donalds said the congressman plans to vote against the bill.  Complicating factors  The infrastructure bill has become a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s policy and his establishment of a legacy built on public works.  The sweeping bill has been described by the White House as a “once-in-a-generation investment” that seeks to expand high-speed internet across the country, modernize the power grid, upgrade the nation’s roads, bridges and public transit systems and fund clean drinking water and electric vehicles.  There is concern on Capitol Hill that the infrastructure bill, which languished in Senate negotiations for months, could be further snarled – or even die – if the House adds any amendments, which would require the bill to return to the Senate for another vote.  Despite the growing number of representatives who have announced their intentions to add amendments to the bill, it does not appear that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will allow the bill to be amended.  In a “Dear Colleagues” letter on Saturday, Pelosi told House Democrats that her goal is to enact both the infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package by Oct. 1.  “The House would be very hard-pressed to meet that goal if they amend the bipartisan infrastructure bill, so I do not expect the bill to be amended,” Andrew Hinkes, a blockchain lawyer and partner at K&L Gates, told CoinDesk.  Though the Democrats have control of the House, the margin is slim, and Pelosi potentially needs near-unanimous support from Democrats to pass the bill, though even that remains unclear because of varying levels of support from Republicans.  Further complicating matters is that the fate of the infrastructure bill has become intertwined with the reconciliation package.  Possible outcomes  According to Hinkes, the most likely outcome for the infrastructure bill is for it to clear the House with no amendments and be signed into law by Biden.  Stephen Palley, a crypto lawyer and partner at Anderson Kill, agrees with Hinkes’ assessment.  “It seems unlikely that the bill’s progress will be delayed over only the crypto-tax reporting language, particularly where Treasury will be issuing clarifying guidance that says they do not intend to apply [the provision] to miners, developers, etc,” Palley told CoinDesk.  As Palley points out, the Treasury has reportedly said that it will provide clarifying guidance after the bill is passed to provide exemptions to firms that do not actually operate as brokers. If reports that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was lobbying against amendments to the bill are true, it suggests that Treasury’s end goal was to leave the language purposely vague so that Treasury could decide what it means.  Though many critics of the provision consider that to be a worst-case scenario, Palley said he thinks that floor testimony and Treasury guidance will prevent the provision from being interpreted too broadly.  “Assuming the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) honors [Treasury’s guidance], I don’t think the language is as bad as some people have suggested,” he said.  Though there is a chance that the bill dies in the House, Palley thinks it's unlikely. “If I had to bet I would say no – it’s too politically important for Democrats to get this through. At the end of the day, I suspect that representatives on the left who are complaining it's not enough will be legislatively and presidentially browbeaten into submission,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/24/house-moves-to-consider-unamended-infrastructure-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54078df4f5477f6670a9d861a883d307391b65e6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fund, called the Osprey Solana Trust, was registered with U.S. securities regulators Tuesday. It didn't have any sales as of press time and is open only to accredited investors, which means that retail traders are shut out for now.      That could change, though. Osprey is “seeking approval” for its Solana Trust to trade on the same over-the-counter marketplace that its bitcoin trust does, documents reviewed by CoinDesk show.      The trust appears to be the first private SOL investment vehicle in the U.S.      It comes as a growing number of investors take interest in Solana, whose SOL token is up over 4,500% this year. It’s nearly doubled in value in the last week and now touts a market cap of over $20 billion.    Read more: Solana, Terra Hit All-Time Highs as Markets Disregard Last Week’s DeFi Hacks    Osprey has been working on its own Solana trust since at least mid-June, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission records. Rival fund manager Grayscale also signaled in June that its own Solana fund was in the works. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)      Trust products such as Osprey’s give Wall Street types a way to gain exposure to crypto prices without directly holding the underlying tokens. Instead, they give their cash to an investment vehicle that does the buying and holding on their behalf – usually for a fee.      Osprey won't begin charging a 2.5% management fee until 2023 in a sign of the competition for institutional crypto products, according to the documents reviewed by CoinDesk.

42397029,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYNPX,1629837028,Market Wrap: ‘Extreme Greed’ for Bitcoin Falters at $50K,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly lower on Tuesday after a period of extreme bullish sentiment has started to wane. After breaking above $50,000 earlier this week for the first time in three months, bitcoin slipped below $48,000 at press time and is down about 3% over the past 24 hours. Technical charts suggest support is nearby, which could stabilize the pullback and maintain the breakout move above $45,000.      Some analysts expressed caution after bitcoin failed to keep pushing higher above the $50,000 resistance level.      “Our bullishness comes with some moderation, and we don't expect more exponential upside breaks like what we saw at the end of 2020 into 2021,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $4,8,125, -1%  Ether (ETH) $3,192.9, -2.76%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4486.2, +0.15%  Gold: $1,803.2, -0.14%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.289%, compared with 1.251% on Monday  'Extreme greed' comes, then goes    “The fear is gone for now, and the market is optimistic,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday newsletter. Bitcoin’s rise towards $50,000 pushed the crypto “Fear and Greed” index to ""extreme greed"" territory this week, before the more recent decline.      Arcane noted that other indicators suggest neutral sentiment. For example, relatively low funding rates in bitcoin’s futures market indicates less exuberance among investors.      “Funding rates and future premiums in both BTC and ETH actually continue to be relatively low and muted,” QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat. “This means most of the rally has been driven by demand in physical spot rather than from leveraged speculators.”      “A euphoric market could indicate a local top and a signal to traders who want to take some chips off the table,” Arcane wrote.    End of bitcoin capitulation?    Bitcoin’s ""spent output profit ratio"" (SOPR) – the price at the time the cryptocurrency was sold divided by the price at the time it was originally bought – turned positive after a steep decline since January. The uplift in SOPR could be a sign that the “capitulation period has ended and the market is back on solid ground,” Coin Metrics wrote in a Tuesday newsletter.      SOPR is a proxy for realized profit and loss for all coins moved on the blockchain. The SOPR was negative for most of June, which meant that investors were selling bitcoin at a loss. Now positive, the SOPR is currently suggesting that, in aggregate, holders are sitting on profits relative to their cost basis.    Divergent blockchain activity    Blockchain data has not responded to bitcoin’s price rally (yet), which could point to limited upside. Transaction counts are at historically low levels, similar to previous periods when investor interest in bitcoin waned, according to Glassnode.      “The Bitcoin network is setting around $18.8 billion in daily volume,” Glassnode wrote in a blog post. “This is 37% lower than at the 2017 bubble peak, and a whopping 57.6% below the peak set during the May capitulation event.”    Bitcoin hashrate recovery    Bitcoin’s hashrate has been recovering from a local bottom in late June and early July, after China started cracking down on crypto mining in the country, according to Coin Metrics.      The seven-day moving average of bitcoin’s hashrate stood at 127.5 exahashes per second on Monday, August 23, up from a local bottom of 84.3 exahashes per second on July 2, according to data from Glassnode.      “The recovering hashrate is a signal that some mining operations are starting to come back online in new locations and that the worst of the crackdown is likely over,” Coin Metrics wrote in the notes.    Altcoin roundup  DeFi Exchange SushiSwap Builds on Avalanche: Popular decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap is the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) project to join Avalanche’s $180 million incentive program, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports. Avalanche Rush has already attracted lending protocol Aave and automated market maker (AMM) Curve. As a proof-of-stake blockchain built by Ava Labs, Avalanche claims to process 4,500 transactions per second without the security trade-offs usually associated with low-latency blockchains. Avalanche Rush has no doubt boosted investors’ confidence in the layer 1 blockchain that launched its mainnet last September: Prices for AVAX, Avalanche’s native token, were up by more than 300% in the past week, according to data from Messari.  Paxos Renames Standard Stablecoin as Pax Dollar: Blockchain infrastructure company Paxos is renaming its Paxos standard stablecoin as Pax dollar with the ticker USDP. Paxos believes the USDP ticker more easily identifies the stablecoin as a U.S. dollar-backed token, Walter Hessert, head of strategy, said in a blog post Tuesday. ""USDP reserves are held 100% in cash and cash equivalents. ... This name makes it obvious to anyone – USDP is a dollar,"" Hessert wrote.  DeFi adoption still far from mainstream, per Chainalysis: Mainstream adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remains at an early stage relative to the wider crypto industry, a Chainalysis report released Tuesday said. In its “Global DeFi Adoption Index,” the blockchain data firm found that while DeFi adoption has increased significantly over the past 18 months in both emerging and developed markets, most of that growth has occurred in countries and regions with higher incomes and more professional investors and traders.  CryptoPunk NFTs Break Sales Record as Visa Sparks Buying Frenzy: Sales of CryptoPunk non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are soaring to record levels, another sign of just how frenzied the market has become as credit-card giant Visa jumped into the fray. On Monday, sales volumes of CryptoPunks topped $86 million, a daily record, according to data from the industry tracking website CryptoSlam. And sales so far in August have already reached $332 million. Prior to August, the largest single monthly sales total was $135.2 million during July. This month’s average price for a CryptoPunk is $199,069, more than double last month’s average.

What could be the reason behind this behavior? Bitcoin Breaks $50k, But Activity Lags Behind As per this week&apos;s edition of the Arcane Research report, on-chain activity seems to be slow to recover despite the price of the cryptocurrency jumping high. The metric used for measuring the activity here is the Bitcoin 7-day average number of active addresses indicator, which as its name suggests gives the number of address on the network that saw transactions within a specific period of time. Now, here is the chart for the BTC number of active addresses (7-day average) vs the price: Bitcoin&apos;s activity seems to be lagging behind the price | Source: Arcane Research On examining the above graph, two things become apparent. First, the number of active addresses right now is just under 900k. This shows that the indicator has certainly recovered since the lows of around 750k after the price crash. Second, while the Bitcoin price has now risen to about $50k, the activity hasn&apos;t shown as big a spike yet. The active addresses are still at the same levels as they were during the summer of 2020, when the price was around $10k.

42397028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYNOY,1629826167,Bearish Bitcoin Bets Might Signal Return of This Popular Trade,"Hedge funds and other large traders continued to pile into bearish bets on bitcoin last week even as the cryptocurrency extended price gains.      Leveraged funds ­ – typically hedge funds and various types of money managers – held 16,000 short positions in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in the week ended Aug. 17, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as tracked by data analytics firm Skew. Each CME contract consists of 5 BTC.      The tally of short positions has increased by 6,000 since July 20 to hit the highest in three months. The cryptocurrency's price has risen from $30,000 to $48,500 in the past four weeks.      But the data doesn't necessarily indicate that the traders are betting on outright price declines.      The spike in leverage funds' short bets might have stemmed from a return of the so-called carry trade, which involves buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market against a short position in the futures market. The strategy seeks to make money from the difference between the futures and spot prices, also known as premium, which tends to evaporate as expiration nears. That way, a carry trade can pocket a relatively riskless return.      ""I would assume it's mostly carry trades,"" said Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research. ""It's been growing in the last few weeks during the bullish price action, causing the basis premiums on CME to be significantly lower than the basis premiums on the offshore futures platforms.""      The CME currently offers an annualized rolling three-month basis (futures premium) of nearly 3% versus 8.5% to 10% on other offshore exchanges such as Binance, FTX and OKEx. This premium represents the percentage difference between the futures price on a given exchange and the going spot-market rate for the cryptocurrency.      The existence of the premium means a trader could lock in a 3% annualized return by selling the quarterly futures contract on the CME and buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market, in a bet that the prices will eventually converge. Some traders borrow stablecoins to purchase bitcoin in the spot market, in which case the interest paid to the stablecoin lender would be subtracted from the net return.      Such carry trades have lost their shine over the past few months as the price crash in May crowded out excess leverage from the market. Notably, the sell-off below $40,000 seen on May 19 liquidated more than $8 billion worth of positions in the derivatives market.      Another factor could be that several big cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, the world's largest exchange by volume, and FTX have recently cut their leverage limits to 20x (20 times a trader's money down) from 100x amid widespread criticism of leveraged trading.      ""The trade is not yielding the same profits as earlier,"" Lunde said. “At its peak in the middle of April, the cash-and-carry trade yielded annualized returns of 20% in the front-month contract, in contrast to the current levels"" fluctuating around 1% to 4%.      Bitcoin futures on Binance and other exchanges traded at a premium of 40% during the height of the bull run in mid-April.      According to Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG, the current yield is not attractive enough for funds to take carry trades.      ""If you look at the absolute yield you can generate right now, I doubt that 'the carry trade' is back,"" Heusser said.      ""Maybe some market makers or liquidity provider has changed or remodeled his flow concept,"" Heusser added. ""Usually, the market makers on the CME are the same guys making markets on crypto native exchanges ... and some of these guys are labeled as leveraged funds.""      Also read: The 3 Reasons Why Bitcoin's Ascent May Slow      Market makers are individuals or entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. They ensure there is enough depth in the order book by offering to buy or sell when required and run a direction-neutral book. For instance, a market maker filling a short position in the futures market often takes a short or long position in the spot market or buys a call option.      In this case, per Heusser, the bitcoin market makers may be short on the CME and hedged on native exchanges.

The seven-day average real BTC trading volume is still around $5 billion, less than half of what the market witnessed the last time bitcoin was at $50,000, Arcane Research analysts wrote Tuesday in a report.      If trading volume continues to be relatively flat and bitcoin prices push higher, the market could become exhausted and the rally won't be sustainable, the analysts said.      “We have not seen the desired spike in volume with this latest move higher for the bitcoin price, which could indicate that we’re not ready for $50,000 just yet,” the report stated.      “This means there’s not a lot of interest from traders to get engaged,"" said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance. ""This is typical range-trading behavior.      “Either we break out of the range or some news will be the catalyst for a larger move,” he said.      Matthew Blom, global head of trading at digital-asset firm Eqonex, said that “as lovely, timely and wonderful as this rally has been, the headwinds of the Fed, $50,000, and the muted effect of PayPal announcing their entrance into the U.K. market, could put it on ice.”      Bitcoin blockchain activity also has remained anemic as the bitcoin price recovered, Arcane Research analysts noted, saying that ""the number of active addresses is still far from the top levels seen during the hype of early 2021.”      That's despite signs that market sentiment has climbed along with the price: “Extreme greed is back, the fear is gone for now, and the market is optimistic,” Arcane Research analysts wrote.

The digital asset broke the $50K price point earlier this week, before seeing a slight retracement down to $49K. This has been driven by a number of factors in the market. Growing interest is at the top of the list. As the price rallies, a number of interesting things have been happening in the Bitcoin space, ranging from holding patterns to the duration of the hold. Recent data shows that the number of short-term bitcoin holders has declined to new lows. Most investors are now just holding their coins and not moving them out of their wallets. This is happening regardless of where the price of BTC is at any moment. A record of approximately 84% of the total bitcoin supply has not been moved in three months. This timeline coincides with the end of the last bull rally that saw the asset hit a new all-time to the present rally.

42376278,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69vjd,1629823696,Are NFTs Securities?,"NFT mania has reached such a fever pitch (see yesterday’s news of Visa buying a non-fungible token) that people are now comparing it to the initial coin offering boom of 2017. Of course, there’s one big difference: ICOs were touted as a chance to buy what amounted (very roughly) to a share in a project.      That meant these were, as many observers were happy to point out at the time, unregistered securities offerings, leading to a series of crackdowns by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. Many of those enforcements took three or four years to work their way to a judgment or settlement, which sometimes reached into the millions of dollars, even when no outright fraud was alleged.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    So if you’re a non-fungible token maker, you might reasonably hear a nagging voice in the back of your head wondering: Am I going to wake up three years from now to the Securities and Exchange Commission knocking on my door?      First, a caveat: I’m not a lawyer, and those who are will spend plenty of billable hours giving authoritative answers to questions about NFT regulation. But I have been reporting on financial regulation for a while, which is about the best definitely-not-legal-advice you can expect for free on the web.      Anyway, here’s the good news: Most NFTs currently circulating are almost certainly not securities. A security is generally defined as a claim on the future proceeds from the work of others, while an NFT is usually the product of work that has already been undertaken. The closest and most obvious comparison is to a painting: even if you buy it because you think the value of the thing will go up, you still only bought the thing itself, rather than any sort of secondary claim. The SEC is unlikely to take much interest.      Which makes it all the more strange that a good number of NFT series or adjacent projects are going out of their way to turn their nice little non-security collectibles into things the SEC would definitely take an interest in.      The most straightforward way that NFTs can become subject to SEC oversight is through fractionalization. Fractionalizing an NFT means allowing multiple investors to buy portions of it, instead of one person or entity having to own the whole thing. With CryptoPunks in particular regularly reaching multimillion dollar valuations, the appeal of just owning a piece of one as an investment is clear (even if to my mind it’s against the spirit of the entire endeavor, on which more in a bit). At least one marketplace, Fractional.art, is pursuing the idea.      We already know that such efforts are within the purview of the SEC. We know because there are already significant companies, particularly Masterworks, which fractionalizes physical art for investors. Masterworks registers its offerings with the SEC, though the company is not a registered broker. Nominally that’s because it is primarily an issuer – though it seems to be running a public over-the-counter board for art shares on its website, so I guess that’s also fine? Seems weird to me but, again, I’m not a lawyer.      But there are other NFTs that are moving even more clearly into securities territory, particularly by offering revenue distributions to current holders. Two examples are Buzzed Bears and Lazy Lions, which both attach certain governance rights to ownership. That, according to the projects, can include the right to redistribute the profits from future sales to current holders. Buzzed Bears even has a staking system that lets you “hibernate” your bears to increase returns, and the organizers are promising to sell merchandise to fill a DAO controlled by holders, so ... yeah, that's probably a security, baby.    Read more: Why Did Visa Buy a $150K NFT? Why Does Anyone? | David Z. Morris    It should be said that these are worthy experiments, part of the potential of NFTs to be something weird and novel. You can build a lot of features into them, and a lot of those are interesting. Most obviously, the idea that owning an NFT can get you special access to an artist or band has a lot of potential.      But it will be a complicated and likely messy process to determine the boundary between “an NFT with some cool secondary features” and “an NFT that is definitely a security.” And by “messy” I mean “the SEC might sue some people.” The projects on the market now are likely too small for any such attention (Lazy Lions's initial sale netted a reported $380,000), but I’d wager we’re about to see much bigger targets given the market’s vibrancy.      And here’s the other thing: These security NFTs may cause problems down the road for the individual issuers, but they’re even more likely to become a problem for NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. You need a special license to sell securities, and it comes with all sorts of more or less burdensome requirements about tax reporting and the like. OpenSea could certainly get that registration, plenty of crypto projects that aren’t nearly as big have done it. And the various regulatory requirements, while burdensome, are certainly doable.      The bigger loss, I think, would be to the spirit of the NFT mania. One reason it’s fun is that, yeah some people are “investing” and getting rich, but it’s also all just kind of a big goof, and in many cases a genuinely creative process. OpenSea and other NFT markets have the feel of a playground, and that’s what makes it fun, and – here’s the real catch – the fun is what makes it valuable, both monetarily and just as a human activity. Turning that into just another batch of algorithmic internet money-beans would be a downgrade.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42376273,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69vdL,1629823564,Nasdaq Reveals Valkyrie Bitcoin Futures ETF Application,"The race to launch a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) for U.S. investors now has a (procedural) front-runner: Valkyrie Investments.      On Tuesday, a surprise regulatory filing by Nasdaq to “list and trade shares” of the Valkyrie XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund revealed the existence of the previously undisclosed ETF proposal, Valkyrie’s second that seeks to wrap bitcoin futures into an ETF.      In fact, it was really Valkyrie’s first; the firm said it confidentially filed for the product months ago.      The fact that it now has a partner exchange means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can begin consideration of the product, moving Valkyrie closer to judgment day on a bitcoin futures ETF than every other hopeful issuer.    Read more: Crypto Asset Manager Valkyrie Files for Bitcoin Futures ETF    The SEC is also considering a handful of bitcoin ETF applications that are based on the underlying asset, rather than any futures markets.      It remains to be seen whether Valkyrie’s product can pass regulatory muster. Industry observers believe Gary Gensler’s SEC may look more kindly on a bitcoin futures ETF proposal than on the dozen or so ETF applications that would trade the asset itself.      “I think we're really the only ones out there that has a pure-play futures product,” said Valkyrie CIO Steve McClurg. He said the firm is partnered with XBTO for futures trading.    Read more: Gensler’s Preference for Bitcoin Futures Products Is Likely Bad News for a Spot BTC ETF    McClurg said the newly-revealed Valkyrie futures ETF is a so-called “33 Act fund,” referring to the Securities Act of 1933, that could invest its assets in bitcoin futures contracts exclusively. Many of the recent bitcoin futures ETF filings would be “40 Act” products, referring to the Investment Company Act of 1940, that would have to partly invest in fixed income or treasuries, he said.      All that regulatory minutiae could complicate the Valkyrie/XBTO fund’s path. Gensler has expressed interest in “40 Act” funds that he has said better protect investors than “33 Act” counterparts.

42376279,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69vkt,1629815815,State of Crypto: The Latest on Congress's Crypto Tax Provision,"The U.S. House of Representatives is finally taking up the Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. If the bill passes, it seems increasingly likely that the original crypto tax provision will pass with it.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  How’d we get here?  The narrative    The House takes up the bipartisan infrastructure bill this week. Industry advocates are pessimistic about their chances of inserting an amendment to modify the crypto tax provision, which they've suggested might outright kill the U.S. crypto industry or drive it out of the country. But there's still a lot we don't know, including whether the bill will be passed or how the Treasury Department will interpret the law.    Why it matters    In last week’s newsletter, I wrote about how non-crypto issues might hold up any crypto-related amendments. It’s looking increasingly likely that this will happen. The outcome of this crypto provision will likely be decided by issues that have zilch to do with crypto.    Breaking it down    The House of Representatives is taking up the bipartisan infrastructure bill this week, having cut its summer recess short.      I wrote last week that non-crypto issues would determine the fate of the crypto provision. As of 5 p.m. Eastern yesterday, that seems to still be true.      Lawmakers are, as of Monday night, still grappling with political issues like whether a massive $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill will be sent to the House before they take up the bipartisan bill, and so crypto issues are far from front and center. We’ll keep an eye on things throughout the week to see if that changes, but for the moment, I wanted to write about how we got here.      First: My understanding as of Monday, based on multiple conversations with insiders who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly, is that the U.S. Treasury Department is looking to clarify its authority to impose tax-reporting requirements on crypto exchanges and certain decentralized exchanges.      Specifically, Treasury appears to want to capture DEXs that have intermediaries as part of their platforms, rather than true peer-to-peer projects.      The crypto tax provision rose out of this perceived need.      The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which projected that the provision would raise $28 billion over 10 years, still hasn’t explained how exactly that figure came about.      Stronger information reporting rules would boost compliance, meaning JCT’s projected figure is based on an assumption that just by encoding the crypto tax provision, more exchanges or other trading platforms will provide the reporting information that some exchanges already provide. That, in turn, is expected to bring the total amount of tax revenue generated through crypto transactions over the 10 years after the bill is enacted up to the $28 billion figure.      Of course, that is all subject to Treasury interpreting the final bill, which cannot happen until the bill itself is passed by the House and signed into law. As of now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is targeting an Oct. 1 deadline for passing both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a reconciliation bill driven entirely by the Democratic caucus.      Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the senator who inserted the tax provision, tried to detail what that interpretation may look like.      In an effort to specify which types of entities would be subject to the broker definition under the provision, Portman and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) engaged in a colloquy, a sort of back-and-forth intended to clarify for the Congressional Record what exactly the lawmakers’ intentions are with any given provision.      According to a transcript on Portman’s website:    “The purpose of this provision is not to impose new reporting requirements on people who do not meet the definition of brokers. For example, if you are someone who is solely involved with validating distributed ledger transactions through proof of work – commonly known as miners – if you are solely mining, you will not be considered a broker. The same would be true for proof of stake validation, and other validation methods, now or in the future, associated with other consensus mechanisms that are developed and might come into the market as the technology evolves. If you’re solely staking your digital assets for the purpose of validating distributed ledger transactions, you will not be considered a broker.”    In the absence of any amendments, this colloquy will serve as the intended narrowing factor for the legislation. This is not as forceful as an amendment, but it’s still an important tool for lawmakers to explain what they intended for the bill.      Amendments remain unlikely, my sources tell me, because any amendment runs the risk of sending the overall infrastructure bill back to the Senate for reconciliation, and House leadership is not willing to reopen that can of worms.      Plus, if a crypto amendment is adopted, other lawmakers might push to add their own priorities. Remember, the reason a crypto amendment ultimately died in the Senate is because of an unrelated defense provision that a senator wanted to attach to the bill.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    Brian Quintenz, a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, announced he will formally depart the agency on Aug. 31 (a week from today). During his time at the CFTC, Quintenz was a vocal advocate for the crypto industry, suggesting that businesses form a self-regulatory organization (SRO) and otherwise arguing for a do-no-harm approach to regulating the industry. After he departs, the CFTC will have just three commissioners: Acting Chairman Rostin Behnam, Dawn Stump and Dan Berkovitz. U.S. President Joe Biden has yet to nominate anyone to fill the seat left open after Heath Tarbert stepped down as chairman.    Elsewhere:  Bitcoin Use Will Be ‘Totally Optional’ in El Salvador, Finance Minister Says: El Salvador published some new documentation around its Bitcoin Law, which is set to take effect next month, and Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said local entities will not be forced to accept bitcoin as a means of payment. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele echoed these comments on Sunday. However, it doesn’t look like the government will amend the actual law that requires everyone to accept bitcoin.  TON Legacy: How Telegram’s Crypto Coin Lives On: Telegram shuttered its TON blockchain project last year, but two different groups are trying to keep it alive by forking its open source code.  CFTC Commissioner Stump Decries ‘Oversimplification’ That Crypto Is Either a Security or Commodity: We’re really going to have to talk about this more in depth at some point, but rhetoric around the SEC’s role in regulating crypto markets vs. the CFTC’s role in regulating crypto markets seems to be heating up.  Outside CoinDesk:  (CNBC) Some locals in Afghanistan are turning to cryptocurrency after banks and local currency exchangers shut their doors amid the U.S. withdrawal from the nation. However, cash is still king, according to CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos.  (The Washington Post) U.S. President Joe Biden has yet to nominate or hint that he will nominate a new vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. Randal Quarles, who currently fills that seat, will finish his term in October. The role is important because of its impact on banking policy. For the crypto crowd, the Fed is looking at crypto banking issues, as well.

Similarly, BTC can be withdrawn as cash at any of the 200 ATMs that the government would institute.

42376271,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69vX3,1629810061,DeFi Exchange SushiSwap Builds on Avalanche as Part of $180M Incentive Program,"Popular decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap is the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) project to join Avalanche’s $180 million incentive program. Avalanche Rush has already attracted lending protocol Aave and automated market maker (AMM) Curve.      Avalanche is a proof-of-stake blockchain that was built by Ava Labs. It claims to process 4,500 transactions per second without the security tradeoffs usually associated with blockchains that can transfer data quickly.      Avalanche Rush has no doubt boosted investors’ confidence in the layer 1 blockchain that launched its mainnet last September, as the price for AVAX, Avalanche’s native token, rose by more than 300% in the last seven days, according to data from Messari.    Read more: Avalanche’s AVAX Token Jumps on $180M Incentive Program    The addition of SushiSwap adds another degree of functionality to what Avalanche can offer DeFi users.    DeFi building blocks    Avalanche is not the only blockchain jumping into the booming DeFi market.      Other layer 1 blockchains like Solana and Terra have also been grabbing headlines as they attempt to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar DeFi market. Layer 1s are the blockchain networks on which financial applications are built, and Ethereum is the leading network for doing that.      The DeFi sector has caught more attention from institutional investors, and many top venture capital firms have invested heavily in alternatives to Ethereum that offer a better ability to expand. Solana, for example, recently raised $314 million in a token sale from investors, including Andresseen Horowitz (also known as a16z) and Polychain Capital.    Read more: Solana Labs Raises $314M in Token Sale Led by A16z, Polychain    Avalanche is backed by financier Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Beijing-based crypto mining machine maker Bitmain, a16z and Dragonfly Capital, with about $60 million in funding through both private and public token sales.    Battle for the base layer    With the large amount of investment in the sector, the layer 1 competition has been heating up as platforms begin offering lucrative incentives to attract both DeFi projects and users.      The incorporation of SushiSwap in Avalanche’s Rush program will allow SushiSwap and the Avalanche Foundation to each allocate up to $7.5 million worth of AVAX and SUSHI tokens to liquidity mining incentives over the next three months, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.      Liquidity mining refers to when DeFi users are rewarded with fresh tokens for committing assets to a protocol. Those rewards have become the vehicle of choice for DeFi projects seeking to attract new users since last year’s DeFi Summer.    Multi-chain SUSHI    While SushiSwap has been deployed across several blockchains, Avalanche is one of the new platforms that provides SUSHI token incentives outside of the Ethereum network, according to Tuesday’s release.      “The Avalanche community is one of the most compelling reasons to align incentives with the Avalanche chain,” Sushi’s lead contributor, 0xMaki, said in a statement.      In late July, Solana, another blockchain, announced the launch of staking pools, where holders of SOL tokens can earn rewards and help secure the Solana network by staking their holdings. Some of the rewards can be used in DeFi protocols built on Solana, including Raydium, an AMM that just started an incentive campaign where users can earn extra native tokens, called RAY, in addition to the existing rewards.      “Incentives are just the easiest way to attract interest for now,” Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “So everyone does it.”    Interoperable future?    With more than 200 protocols, Ethereum remains the king of layer 1. According to DeFi Llama, the total value locked in Ethereum was around $119.8 billion at the time of writing – more than five times of the total value locked on Binance Smart Chain, the second biggest blockchain by that metric, which refers to the total amount secured on a blockchain.      “Blockchains seem to be very sticky, as it is both unintuitive and cumbersome to switch between ecosystems and in its current state interoperability between chains is quite weak,” said Nate George, crypto asset analyst at Cumberland, the Chicago-based crypto trading unit of trading firm DRW Holdings.      George added:    “As interoperability infrastructure advances, I imagine there is an argument that the lines of which chain you are on will blur and be abstracted away from the end-user experience.”    Avalanche announced a new cross-chain technology called Avalanche Bridge at the end of July to replace its previous Avalanche-Ethereum bridge. The new connector, according to a Medium post by Avalanche, will provide “seamless” user experience for DeFi platforms to join Avalanche with better security and cheaper transaction fees.",POSITIVE,AVAX | SOL,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SOL | TOKEN SALE,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/24/defi-exchange-sushiswap-builds-on-avalanche-as-part-of-180m-incentive-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31af9b988b1450f6e17cd874fc208edb2f988760-1500x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69vVn,1629810000,"Y Combinator, Dragonfly Back Seed Round for Crypto Trading Dashboard Hedgehog","Hedgehog Technologies, a platform that lets investors sync their cryptocurrency wallets and exchange accounts to visualize their portfolios in aggregate, has raised $1.6 million to develop a crypto robo-advisor.      Dragonfly Capital led the seed round, which also had participation from Baroda Ventures and startup accelerator Y Combinator.      The funding follows crypto exchange Coinbase’s deal to buy Zabo, a startup that offers a similar, all-in-one portfolio dashboard. However, while Zabo white-labels its service through other companies, Hedgehog offers its app directly to consumers. In traditional financial services, aggregators like Plaid and Yodlee have long enabled consumers to obtain a comprehensive view of their bank and brokerage accounts.      Hedgehog does not currently charge its nearly 7,000 users a fee. Instead, its founders say their long-term plan is to charge exchanges a sort of referral fee for pushing clients to purchase crypto through the exchanges’ platforms.      Hedgehog Technologies is not to be confused with Hedgehog Markets, a prediction betting platform on the Solana blockchain that recently raised its own seed round.    'Eureka' moment    The company was co-founded in 2017 by college friends Taylor Culbertson and Colton Dillion, who were later co-workers at mobile fintech platform Acorns, which allows users to invest spare change in stocks and bonds, and uses a robo-advisor to help them make decisions. That company is now on the cusp of going public through a proposed merger, valued at $2.2 billion, with a special-purpose acquisition company.      After leaving Acorns in the mid-2010s and starting a digital marketing company, Culbertson and Dillion discovered Ethereum. The idea of self-executing smart contracts resonated with them after a freelance client refused to pay for services rendered, Culbertson, Hedgehog’s CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview.      Once Culbertson and Dillion learned more about crypto, they set about starting Hedgehog, even pulling in their brothers.      “We were like, ‘This is the future. This is it,” Culbertson said.    In retail's corner    Hedgehog’s robo-advisor feature will go live in the next few months, Culbertson said. It will assess connected accounts on the platform and make suggestions to users about how to balance their holdings and take advantage of price dips to purchase crypto at bargain levels.      “A lot of crypto platforms look at retail users as price-agnostic users,” Dillion said. “Retail flow is very wanted, because you can make a lot of money off that, especially in market making. We’ve taken the opposite approach--we’re building a platform for retail users. We’re catering to the user that’s kind of disadvantaged in this environment.”      Hedgehog’s founders say the company’s relationship with Hopscotch, the platform’s clearing partner run by Culbertson’s brother Morgan, who also serves as Hedgehog’s head of trading, will connect users with prices 0.5% better than what competitors offer.

42411922,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5Gr,1629806595,Should You Invest in Bitcoin for Retirement?,"As the bitcoin market matures, there is an increasing number of options available to add the digital currency to retirement plans.  Bitcoin has been consistently gaining momentum over recent years, despite lingering concerns about its high volatility, energy consumption and risk of fraud. Last year, bitcoin (BTC) – the native cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin network – trounced gold and the S&P 500 with a 164% return. Gold, by comparison, rose 21% last year, and the S&P 500 Index gained 13%. Even with the current rebounding post-pandemic economy, bitcoin continues to lead the pack as the most profitable asset class of the three. So far this year, it's up 69.55%, compared with a loss of 5.11% for gold and gain of 19.26% for the S&P 500.  With that performance, it’s not surprising 40% of young investorshttps://coredataresearch.co.uk/blog/making-dc-pensions-more-appealing/ recently said they were interested in including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their retirement plans.  So what are the benefits, risks and available options to be aware of?  Benefits of buying bitcoin for retirement  Supply and issuance  While bitcoin’s potential for growth is balanced by its volatility, much of that risk becomes mitigated in the long term when you understand its intrinsic properties.  Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which means that unlike with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, no more can be created once the circulating supply reaches that figure. That is one of the major upsides for bitcoin’s projected value over time, which is expected to increase as the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases because of inflation.  In addition to having a fixed supply, Bitcoin goes through what is called a “halving” event every 210,000 blocks (about every four years) where the reward for mining BTC transactions is cut in half. That reduces bitcoin’s inflation rate, improving its longevity. While it took four years to mine 50% of all bitcoins, it will take an additional 120 years to mine the remaining 50%. For long-term investors, that is a good thing, as it accentuates the assets' limited supply.  A statistical model known as the bitcoin stock-to-flow model takes into consideration the asset's supply (stock) and its annual issuance rate (flow) and uses that data to predict the future appreciation of BTC. Despite drawing criticism from a number of other traders, the model – created by pseudonymous trader Plan B – has forecasted the asset’s price well so far.  What’s most interesting, perhaps, is that the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model suggests BTC could reach $1 million per coin by as early as 2024.  Hedge against inflation  The asset bitcoin’s most been compared with in recent years has been gold, historically considered to be a leading hedge against inflation. Both bitcoin and gold have a scarce, limited supply, but the advantages of bitcoin over gold include the fact that BTC can be transported instantly, it’s significantly cheaper to store and secure, and it’s easily divided into smaller units and impossible to counterfeit.  Bitcoin’s price has also consistently outperformed gold since its inception in 2010.  Here’s how much $1 would be worth if invested in the given year.  2020 BTC: $3.78 | Gold: $0.93  2019 BTC: $4.38 | Gold: $1.28  2018 BTC: $5.14 | Gold: $1.49  2017 BTC: $15.39 | Gold: $1.44  2016 BTC: $64.24 | Gold: $1.36  2015 BTC: $146.02 | Gold: $1.68  2014 BTC: $74.70 | Gold: $1.41  2013 BTC: $434.83 | Gold: $1.38  2012 BTC: $4,631.80 | Gold: $1.13  2011 BTC: $3,109.53 | Gold: $1.12  2010 BTC: $776,397.69 | Gold: $1.56  How to invest in bitcoin for retirement  Bitcoin IRA  One of the leading ways to invest in bitcoin for retirement is through a bitcoin Individual Retirement Account (IRA). A bitcoin IRA is self-directed, meaning the account owner chooses which investments they wish to make. That opens the doors to investing in alternative asset classes like real estate, precious metals and cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin IRAs work much like traditional ones, except your money goes toward cryptocurrency instead of mutual funds.  Like with a Roth IRA, you pay taxes upfront on the assets you hold instead of when you come to withdraw them. That is advantageous for investments that yield high returns, as bitcoin has a tendency to do. Bitcoin IRAs also have yearly contribution limits akin to traditional ones – typically around $6,000.  There are three parts to a bitcoin IRA:  A custodian is a third party that manages the account and makes sure it adheres to Internal Revenue Service and government regulations. In a traditional IRA, banks play the role of the custodian.  An exchange is a third-party platform that manages your crypto trades, and is where you’ll purchase the bitcoin from for your IRA.  A secure storage service protects your assets from theft after purchase, and is typically provided by the bitcoin IRA.  Many self-directed IRA providers include an “all-in-one” package, where the bitcoin IRA company partners with specific crypto exchanges. While 13% of all Americans traded crypto in the last year, only 2-5% of all IRAs are invested in alternative assets, according to the Retirement Industry Trust Association (RITA). An array of bitcoin exchange-traded funds have also popped up in the past year to meet the growing demand of institutional investors entering the crypto market.  It is worth noting, however, that there are typically more fees involved with a bitcoin IRA. These include setup fees and account management fees. If you use the popular bitcoin IRA from Blockmint, for example, you will be hit with a 15% transaction fee, 2.5% purchase transaction fee, 1% sell transaction fee, $195 annual maintenance fee and 0.50% monthly storage fee assessed on your IRA balance.  Some self-directed IRAs also come with more limitations, and you may not be allowed to trade with your crypto exchange of choice. Another disadvantage is that capital losses from bitcoin cannot be deducted to offset capital gains like they would with a typical IRA.  Bitcoin 401(k)  A small 401(k) provider called ForUsAll has partnered with crypto exchange Coinbase to give their customers the option of investing up to 5% of their retirement funds into cryptocurrency like bitcoin. A 401(k) is an account that allows an employee to dedicate a percentage of their pre-tax salary to a retirement account, often matched by their employer. The funds are typically invested in stocks, bonds and mutual funds, but demand is rising from retail investors to add cryptocurrency as an available asset. According to the Investment Company Institute, a fifthhttps://www.ici.org/statistical-report/ret_21_q1 of the $34.9 trillion U.S. retirement market is made up of 401(k) plans, worth $6.7 trillion.  Buying bitcoin yourself  If you want to avoid the hassle of setting up a bitcoin retirement account, there are benefits to buying bitcoin directly from an exchange and holding it yourself long term. You’ll avoid having to pay middleman fees, which can become costly if you plan on making a lot of transactions. You’ll also be able to contribute as much or as little as you want, avoiding minimum and maximum contributions found in traditional 401(k) and IRA setups. This method also lends itself to the use of third-party software from companies like 3Commas, which automates exchange purchases so that you can more easily control your positions. There are drawbacks, however, to buying bitcoin on your own. Those include the fact you’ll have to pay more taxes on your returns than you would with an IRA or 401(k), and you’ll be responsible for securing your investments.  Ultimately, bitcoin is a volatile asset with more inherent risks than the assets you’d typically invest in for retirement. But investing in it for the long term is a great way to diversify your portfolio, and with more upside than other alternative assets. And while the asset is still in its infancy compared with a commodity like gold, it has delivered an annual average return of 891% (2011-2020.) Gold, over the same period, has returned an annual average of 4.08%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/should-you-invest-in-bitcoin-for-retirement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5118987fd025b1092d7a0574a12cf87874eb8d3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376281,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69vnP,1629802800,DeFi Adoption Is Still Far From Mainstream: Chainalysis,"Mainstream adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remains at an early stage relative to the wider crypto industry, a Chainalysis report released Tuesday said.      In its ""Global DeFi Adoption Index,"" the blockchain data firm found that while DeFi adoption has increased significantly over the past 18 months in both emerging and developed markets, most of that growth has occurred in countries and regions with higher incomes and more professional investors and traders.      DeFi adoption “has primarily been powered by experienced cryptocurrency traders and investors looking for new sources of alpha in innovative new platforms, even when we weight our index to favor grassroots adoption,” the report said. Alpha refers to a return on investment beyond a benchmark.      Although DeFi has attracted larger investors, the sector will need to do better in engaging smaller retail investors, the report said.    DeFi minnows wanted    DeFi, a crypto sub-sector in which financial services use smart contracts to facilitate transactions without intermediaries, has skyrocketed over the past year, as the total value of crypto assets in that corner of the crypto market surged from roughly $5 billion to $159.52 billion, according to data tracker DeFi Llama.      According to Kimberly Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis, the majority of DeFi use cases are “more sophisticated” applications that have posed challenges for retail investors to embrace.      The Chainalysis index used three metrics that emphasized grassroots DeFi activity – on-chain crypto volume received by DeFi platforms, total retail value (transactions of under $10,000) and individual deposits to DeFi platforms – to rank 154 countries.      The on-chain crypto volume received by DeFi platforms, for example, is adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita, meaning that if two countries contributed the same amount of volume to DeFi, the country with lower PPP per capita would rank higher.      Developed markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Canada remain among the top-ranked countries in the index, although emerging markets such as China, India, Thailand and Vietnam have shown high DeFi adoption rates, too.      The report’s findings also differ from an earlier Chainalysis’ report on the larger crypto market, which showed higher adoption at the grassroots level.      Based on monthly web visits to DeFi platforms by geographic location, DeFi’s popularity grew most notably in North America between April 2019 and June 2020, and then in Western Europe starting around September 2019. Other regions started catching up in June 2020 – the beginning of last year's ""DeFi Summer.""      A breakdown of the transaction volume based on transaction sizes also shows that institutional and professional DeFi activity has gradually increased over the past 18 months.      “Right now, DeFi is targeted towards crypto insiders,” David Gogel, growth lead at decentralized derivatives protocol dYdX, said in the report. “It’s people who have been in the industry for a while and have enough funds to experiment with new assets.”      Gogel added that once gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain drop over the long term, DeFi platforms, which are mostly built on Ethereum, will become more accessible to ordinary people. Gas fees refer to the cost of transactions on Ethereum, which require computational power to execute. The fees are paid in Ethereum’s native currency, ether.      “The question for the coming years is whether we’ll see DeFi follow the same pattern as the cryptocurrency services that came before it, with wider swaths of the population adopting it for tangible benefits beyond speculation and investment,” the report concluded.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/24/defi-adoption-is-still-far-from-mainstream-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da3cb7bac521cd885d295b18f7968e824c6d91a0-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX69vpv,1629801617,The 3 Reasons Why Bitcoin's Ascent May Slow,"Bitcoin has risen 70% in the past four weeks, topping the $50,000 mark for the first time in three months. While the ascent appears to have revived the broader bullish bias, further gains toward record highs may be slow to come, blockchain metrics and chart factors indicate.    Pickup in exchange inflows    The number of bitcoin held in exchange wallets is rising, departing from the recent trend of outflows and a signal of renewed investor intention to sell.      Data tracked by Glassnode show crypto exchanges received 16,606.80 BTC on Monday, the highest daily net inflow in over a month. Over the past week more than 29,000 BTC have been moved to exchanges. ""[It's] not a trend we want to see continue,"" William Clemente, lead insights analyst at Blockware Solutions, tweeted.      Investors typically move coins from their wallets to exchanges when they plan to sell. Assuming demand-side pressures remain unchanged, the increase in the exchange balance may put the brakes on the price rally, if only temporarily.      The exchange balance declined by more than 100,000 BTC in the three weeks ended Aug. 19, reflecting a largely bullish market sentiment. Bitcoin bottomed out at about $30,000 and recovered to $45,000 during that period.    Whale accumulation halts    Whales, or large investors with an ability to make or break market trends, who accumulated coins after the mid-May price crash, have begun running down their inventory.      The supply held by entities with a balance of 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC has declined by nearly 75,000 BTC over the past three weeks, diverging from the rising price.      Entities refer to clusters of addresses held by a single network participant. These large investors began accumulating coins after bitcoin's slide to $30,000 in mid-May, signaling a price bottom. Bitcoin held on to the support in subsequent weeks and bounced this month.      The recent price action also reflects weakening on the buy side. ""The failure to close the day above $50,000 shows some weakness in demand,"" QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel. Bitcoin printed a high of $50,496 on Monday, but closed the day (UTC) below $50,000. At press time, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at about $49,400.      QCP Capital doesn't foresee exponential upside breakouts like those at the end of 2020. The firm also mentioned the continued calmness in implied volatility, or investors' expectation for price turbulence, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust discount as reasons for moderation in the bullish outlook.      The annualized one-month implied volatility is hovering near the recent low of 82%, even though bitcoin rose above $50,000 on Monday. Meanwhile, GBTC shares traded at a discount of 14% to their net asset value on Monday, according to data provided by Skew. ""As a proxy for U.S. interest, GBTC should at least trade at par if we are to expect any strong follow-through in spot,"" QCP Capital said.      ""The clear trade for us here is short vols [sell call/put options] as we expect the spot to be sticky around the $48,000-$51,000 level,"" the firm added. (Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)    Chart barriers    Technical studies indicate the cryptocurrency may consolidate before scaling the critical resistance level of $51,110, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the mid-April to July sell-off.      The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is now sidelined and not showing a clear directional bias. ""A consolidation triangle in the RSI also reflects the hesitancy in the market despite the positive price action,"" QCP Capital said.      The DeMark indicators are signaling short-term upside exhaustion, according to Fairlead Strategies' weekly research note published on Monday. The weekly stochastic indicator is also signaling overbought conditions.      ""Bitcoin is coming into resistance at a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level near $51,000, which would be a natural place for a short-term pause in the rally,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in the weekly research note.      Stockton, however, added that the long-term momentum has strengthened, with the 200-day moving average (MA) rising again. As such, the cryptocurrency would eventually topple resistance at $51,110.

This funding impacted greatly in developing the fast-growing ecosystem of Solana. This pushes it as one of the top competitors to Ethereum, the blockchain with the widest usage. Before now, the Ethereum blockchain has high demand from crypto users and investors. Unfortunately, this results in network congestion and exorbitant transaction fees.

It began in 2017 with the introduction of Ethereum&apos;s ERC-20 token standard, which allowed for the creation of a new class of digital assets: utility tokens. These tokens gave their holders access to a service or product, and were sold to investors as an investment opportunity. The second wave was IEOs (Initial Exchange Offering). IEOs are similar to ICOs but instead of selling tokens on a startup landing page, they are listed directly on exchanges like Binance or Bitfinex, which immediately provides access to a huge number of investors. The third wave was STOs (Security Token Offerings), where companies issue their own tokens that are backed by equity, debt, or real assets, rather than providing access to a service or product. The fourth wave was IDOs (Initial Decentralized Exchange Offering), similar to an IEO, but on a decentralized exchange like UniSwap or PancakeSwap.

Details of the attack vectors and their fixes weren't disclosed ""to give node operators and dependent downstream projects time to update their nodes and software,"" according to a posting on the release page.

The last time a fix for a bug in Geth code was released, it caused a temporary chain split on Ethereum. Due to a deliberate lack of communication from Geth developers about the bug, several computers, also called “nodes,” did not upgrade their Geth client to the fixed implementation, which resulted in a blockchain consensus failure in November 2020.    Read more: Ethereum’s ‘Unannounced Hard Fork’ Was Trying to Prevent the Very Disruption It Caused    The Geth developer team said in a post-mortem blog post at the time that not speaking publicly about the security vulnerability was aimed at delaying any potential attacks on node operators who needed more time to upgrade to the latest version.      This time around, Geth developers emphasized in advance the urgent need for all users of their software to upgrade to the latest version, but the initial announcement on Aug. 18 did not explicitly describe the nature of the vulnerability.      “Last time we did a hotfix, people were angry that we didn’t announce it. This time we decided to try it differently. Let’s see which works better,” tweeted Geth developer Péter Szilágyi about Tuesday’s code release.      Major Ethereum-based wallets and services such as Infura have publicly announced on Twitter their support for this new Geth release.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/24/ethereums-most-popular-software-client-issues-hotfix-to-high-severity-bug,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc0c7dddaa7956a67ef4c0b215f13d3a4f0bfdba-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Swiss regulators are close to approving the first Tezos-tokenized product, said Crypto Finance Group’s Stijn Vander Straeten.
