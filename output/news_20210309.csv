42433889,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP627h,1615328717,"Inflation Rate, Closely Tracked by Bitcoin Traders, Probably Accelerated in February","When Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed the threat of rising inflation last week, market participants saw the opposite: The recent rise in 10-year U.S. Treasury-bond yields and so-called breakeven rates – a gauge of inflation expectations – reflects growing enthusiasm over economic growth prospects but also anxiety over the potential for accelerating price increases.      The matter is crucial to bitcoin traders, since the largest cryptocurrency is seen by a growing number of investors as a potential hedge against higher prices after the Fed pumped trillions of dollars of freshly created money into financial markets over the past year, a form of monetary stimulus for the coronavirus-racked economy.      On Wednesday investors will get the latest reading on price pressures when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes its February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.    Economists and analysts on average project that the headline CPI probably rose 1.7% over the past 12 months, accelerating from the 1.4% pace reported last month January, according to FactSet.  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, probably rose 1.4% from a year earlier, the same pace as in January.  While those rates are still considered low, expectations for future inflation have been on the rise. Consumer inflation expectations for the year ahead have edged up to 3%, the highest since July 2014, based on a February household survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  ""Inflation risks are skewed to the upside,"" according to a Deutsche Bank research report published March 7.  The rapid rise in inflation-adjusted yields on U.S. Treasury bonds presents risk of an unwanted tightening of financial conditions, which might present a challenge to markets, according to Deutsche Bank: ""We see limited scope for the market to further accelerate the timing of monetary tightening for the time being.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/09/inflation-rate-closely-tracked-by-bitcoin-traders-probably-accelerated-in-february,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9032401df3544b581d22c587523914bf757fc7f4-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP62Fh,1615325969,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Gains for Fifth Day, the Longest Streak This Year","Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,368.84 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 5.02% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $51,428.66-$54,813.03 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin headed for its fifth straight daily gain, the longest winning streak this year, as a pullback in U.S. government-bond yields rekindled demand for risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies.      Analysts who track price-chart patterns said bitcoin’s climb to about $54,000 could position the largest cryptocurrency for a fresh ascent toward last month’s record price above $58,000, and from there potentially to $60,000 or higher.      “Bitcoin is recovering after having logged a short-term oversold reading in late February above its rising 10-week moving average,” Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, wrote in her newsletter on Tuesday. “Short-term momentum is positive and there is room to initial and final resistance near $58,000.”      Read more: JPMorgan to Launch ‘Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket’ of Bitcoin Proxy Stocks      Bitcoin’s gains this week were anticipated in the bitcoin futures markets, according to Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights. He’s affiliated with the OKEx cryptocurrency exchange, where a key metric known as the long-and-short ratio fell below 1.0 on Sunday for the first time this year. The quarterly contract premium narrowed to less than 1%.      “In a bull market scenario, a long-and-short ratio below 1.0 and a very small quarterly contract premium may reflect an overly bearish market sentiment, often the sign of an impending price reversal,” Liu told CoinDesk.      According to Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of U.K.-based crypto exchange CEX.io, in a daily newsletter on Tuesday, the oldest cryptocurrency was also getting uplift on Tuesday from the continued momentum of President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 billion coronavirus relief package, which is designed to stimulate the U.S. economy.      Some investors say that bitcoin might serve as an effective hedge against inflation if the flood of money ends up spurring price increases.      As with earlier stimulus bills since the coronavirus hit a year ago, bitcoin’s price appears to benefit. “Should history repeat itself, bitcoin will be on track to retest new price levels above its previous all-time high of $58,000 in the coming weeks or months,” Anissimov added.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Break Above $54K Could Open Path to New Price Record: Technical Analysis      Tuesday’s bullish sentiment on bitcoin was reflected in the performance of technology shares. Tech stocks suffered heavily in recent weeks amid rising Treasury yields and a sell-off in the bond markets because rising fixed-income returns theoretically diminish the appeal of riskier assets, The Nasdaq 100 Index jumped Tuesday after falling over the past few weeks.      Bitcoin was also reportedly whipsawed by the investor anxiety over rising Treasury yields. But data shows bitcoin has shown stronger resilience during the latest market correction, with the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and macro assets continuing to decline over the past few months.      “Bitcoin’s price bottomed out near $43,000 and the Nasdaq's plunge on March 3-4 did not trigger the leading cryptocurrency to hit a lower low,” Liu said.    Ether faces medium-term downside volatility    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up on Tuesday, trading around $1,835.54 and climbing 3.62% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      On the hourly price chart, ether has gained short-term momentum, rising from its 10-week moving average, said Stockton. But an overbought downturn on February’s weekly price chart suggests that ether’s rebound may “give away to additional downside volatility.”      A potential support level is near $1,255, according to Stockton.

42411654,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glRQ1l,1615312800,"‘Women Aren’t Into Crypto.’ Look Around, Dude","As Satoshi mined the first bitcoin in January 2009, I was delivering a large corporate event for a bank in Paris. I remember this conference in particular because the world seemed to be falling apart around us. The 2008 financial crisis was still reverberating as we grappled with a lack of confidence in our banks, a plummeting stock market, and government bailouts that essentially “we the people” were paying for. A crippling credit crunch had left many people I knew financially insecure – without jobs, with mortgages they were struggling to afford and in some cases, without homes at all. It was bleak.      We were angry and confused. How could this happen? What caused this? What the heck was a CDO? The world seemed to wake up from a dream of unlimited prosperity to realise that in fact, the financial system we lived within was shockingly fragile.    Teana Baker-Taylor is the general manager of Crypto.com in the U.K.    I’m often asked why I went into the crypto industry. I’d love to be able to say that my indignation about the financial crisis was an immediate trigger. It wasn’t. But it was the catalyst that turned me into the seeker I am today. And so began my journey to try to understand what went so wrong, which led to my introduction to bitcoin.      It would still be a few years before I made the leap into working in crypto, but looking through the hindsight lens of the financial crisis, it was clear to me that the transparency, cost savings, enhanced security and privacy enabled by blockchain technology could have an extraordinary impact on improving consumer finance. And of course, I wasn’t alone. The crisis disturbed consumer financial services, creating a surge of innovation and gave birth to an entirely new industry.      Crypto has a fabled past, complete with a mythical founder. But not all myths are alluring. One myth in particular I believe is slowing the growth of crypto is that “Women aren’t into crypto.” Our history, recorded in mailing lists, cypherpunk bulletin boards and Reddit might seem to confirm that belief. Sure, there are lauded women in fintech, women in blockchain, even notable women in tech. But crypto? Nah, girls don’t get crypto.      So, in honor of Women’s History Month 2021, I wanted to address the “women aren’t into crypto” by highlighting a couple of ways women are indeed involved in our financial revolution.    Market mavens  Women crypto users and investors have been steadily increasing. In December 2019, Grayscale published a reporthttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bitcoin_Female_Investors.pdf that showed 43% of Bitcoin investors were women – an increase of 13% from 2018. The following April, CoinMarketCap released the results of a study indicating the number of women cryptocurrency participants had increased by 43.24% in the first quarter of 2020.    But wait, there’s more. In January this year in its State of U.K. Crypto 2021 report, Gemini highlighted that out of the 13.5% of 2,000 people surveyed who were current or previous crypto investors, 41.6% were women; of the 9% of respondents who said they planned to invest, 40% were women.      See also: Few Women Are Contributing Code to Major Crypto Projects, Report Finds      Are we seeing an explosion of women crypto investors or have we always been here, quietly stacking our sats? The data is clear: Women definitely “get” crypto. However, by any measure, male investors still outnumber women. Why? I’d proffer that crypto’s marketing machines today aren’t designed to attract women. I’m not suggesting we’re being intentionally excluded, but I will argue we aren’t being intentionally included either. Does your company have both men and women speaking at events? What if the prize for your next trading competition was center court tickets at Wimbledon or a private box at a The Weeknd concert? A gender-neutral narrative attracts a wider customer base. More customers, more profit.    I’m not suggesting that we’re being intentionally excluded, but I will argue we aren’t being intentionally included either.    The entire industry benefits when more people join our revolution. Simply put, we will not achieve mainstream adoption without the participation of a demographic that makes up 50% of the human population.      Were you excited to see the market's reaction to the corporates finally entering the space taking on significant treasury balance sheet positions in crypto? I was. Do you want to see more of that action? I mentioned earlier I used to work in banking – most recently in treasury. I’ll let you in on a secret. Corporate treasury, one of the key stakeholders in assessing balance sheet risk, is one of the more gender-balanced areas of finance.    Ecosystem builders    During my early career in traditional finance, I became used to being one of the few women or the only woman in the room. I expected working in crypto would be similar. But I find that today I work with more women than I ever have previously. Many of us were attracted to this industry for similar reasons. We saw a system that was broken, didn’t work for everyone and we wanted to create change.      “I came to crypto from a highly regulated payments industry. The developed world was failing to deliver efficient and cost-effective financial inclusivity in the traditional finance space. I was drawn to crypto’s ability to lower these barriers and was excited by the simplicity, transparency and cost-efficiency of on-chain value transfers”, says Mariana Gospodinova, general manager, Europe, at Crypto.com.      Quantifying the number of women working in crypto today is difficult, but in my personal work experience, I’ve been surrounded by women – and women in leadership roles as well. Unfortunately, this isn’t yet our industry’s norm. Have I had this experience because I intentionally seek positions within companies that have women in their ranks? Yes. And why?      I’m attracted to success and the data shows gender-balanced teams are more successful, especially within innovation. Companies with greater gender diversity report higher levels of overall innovation, particularly those with women in director and board level roles. There is also data to support that companies recognized as innovators have more women directors. So if you don’t buy the narrative that hiring more women is good for business, do it for the accolades! How do you attract more women to your team? Hire more women.      Our crypto culture fosters an alternative mindset to the status quo. If we’re on a mission to disrupt finance, let’s extend the invite wide and bring as many people along for the ride as possible.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Teana Baker-Taylor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/09/women-arent-into-crypto-look-around-dude,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eab52feda2e6940a12a7c0094a2d7686cb4d8d13-1400x935.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Friday night, Dorsey flagged the listing for the genesis tweet on Valuables, a program for selling tweets authenticated by their authors, created by the startup Cent.      Bidding on the tweet has sat at $2.5 million since March 6. The bid is from Sina Estavi, the CEO of Tron's oracle network, Bridge. The prior high bid was $2 million from Tron founder Justin Sun.      GiveDirectly is a non-profit organization that specializes in giving direct cash transfers to low-income people, without strings attached. ""Africa response"" in Dorsey's tweet likely refers to its ""COVID-19 Africa Response"" campaign. That program is just under $5 million short of its goal. Even if sold at the current bid it would almost be enough to close that gap.      GiveDirectly was early to accepting donations in cryptocurrency. ""We've accepted crypto for a while, and think there's some philosophical similarity (e.g., focus on efficiency of payments, especially through tech, individual empowerment, etc.) which has persuaded a number of folks to give directly,"" Michael Faye, the organization's president, told CoinDesk in a February email.      The pace of crypto donations has accelerated. As of mid-February, GiveDirectly had received more than $20 million worth of crypto donations, with $5 million from the Pineapple Fund in 2017, more than $5 million across two separate gifts from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and $10 million from an anonymous donor.      It's not clear why Dorsey is converting the funds to BTC before donating (the sale will close in ether), though the Twitter CEO is keen on supporting BTC development in Africa.

42433885,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP625h,1615310924,The Node: The Problem of Authenticity in NFT Art,"This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Foundation, a relatively new Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, is carving out a space for old school internet creatives to finally monetize their work. Beginning with the sale of a tokenized version of ""Nyan Cat,"" created by artist Chris Torres, though a ubiquitous feature online, Foundation has opened the floodgates to the “meme economy,” to use Torres’ expression.      In recent weeks, other creators associated with bygone memes have looked to capitalize on their work. While this is an exciting new area for the “ownership economy” made possible through cryptographic tools, it leaves questions about authorship, authenticity and who could claim sole rights – and profits – over images that had previously belonged to the world.      Last week, for instance, the conceptual and controversial artist Ryder Ripps listed the “template” for the DEAL WITH IT meme, a pair of pixelated black shades typically worn by a laid-back dog. The image has no known origins, according to KnowYourMeme, an unofficial documenter of internet ephemera, but has long been associated with Ripps.      Ripps was one of the co-founders of dumpFM, a defunct image repository and chatroom that was upstream from much internet culture in the early 2010s. That’s where DEAL WITH IT, first came to life, Ripps claims. (Verge gives a longer accounting of meme’s shaky origins.)      “How can anything be proved? i made a site called dumpfm that was popular and created the original meme template for it,” Ripps said in a Twitter direct message.      Someone was willing to pay 15 ETH, or about $27,000, for the token, which apparently comes with “the full rights to this image & meme and the Photoshop template used to create it,” according to the Foundation listing. This is a right anyone had before, judging by the number of DEAL WITH IT memes in circulation.      Foundation separates itself from other NFT platforms as an exclusive and curated site. Founded in late-2020, the site has seen volumes in excess of $27 million worth of ETH. Similar to Clubhouse, artists that want on must be invited.      “This work does require a context. It's not just the blockchain. You can't just upload an image to a blockchain and have it have value. There has to be the context of the creator,” Foundation CEO Kayvon Tehranian said in an interview. “That's why we have a curatorial staff on team who actually interacts with artists.”      On some works, like Ripps' DEAL WITH IT and Torres’ Nyan Cat, the site provides “Proof of Authenticity.” It’s a little sticker that appears below the item description, meaning that Foundation’s in-house curators can attest to the provenance of the work or that the artist is who they claim to be: in this case, a bona fide memer.      Asked for specifics about how the authentication process works, the answer left room for doubt. Foundation isn’t searching the Internet Archive for proof that a person created a meme, but it is relying on personal attestations from the author. In other words, they’re using reputation to establish reputation.      “[It's] my word, not Foundation, i’m claiming ownership, i know i created that meme template and like any other claim,” Ripps said. “How do u prove u own a house? how do u prove u ate dinner last night? its a stupid question.”      Ripps’ long-claimed role in the meme’s history isn’t really in dispute, (“there are people who u can corroborate information,” he said). Even if he had nothing to do with it, he’s been claiming ownership over the idea for long enough that it ought to be worth something.      In the past there may not have been a reason to lie about something as stupid as a meme, though there’s real money at stake now. In 2015, Ripps said he didn't care if he received credit for a meme, even if it ""made other people LOTS of money.""      Now: “If there's an economy for people owning parts of internet history, I'd like to make some money and sell my part ... Lord knows I never recouped the 1,000$s in server costs I've spent and never made money or the thousands of hours,” Ripps said. [Note, this quote has been lightly edited for clarity.]      There are dozens, perhaps hundreds of people who could claim ownership of DEAL WITH IT.

42433882,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP61zh,1615308538,"Sorry Coinbase, You’re Not Worth $100B","Recent private sales value Coinbase at approximately $100 billion, but investors should proceed with caution.      Over the past 11-plus years, cryptocurrency has grown from a single coin to a global asset class worth more than $1.5 trillion. That growth has been spurred, in part, by the inflow of institutional capital from the likes of MicroStrategy, Square and Tesla. The market is as bullish as it’s ever been and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has opted to strike while the iron is hot.    Thomas Meyer is the head of marketing for Cove Markets. He previously worked for Peak6 and Spire Trading as an equity options trader. He holds investments in bitcoin and ETH.    The Coinbase direct listing is being hailed as a watershed moment where the innovative spirit of crypto will finally collide with the decades-old tradition of Wall Street. While the moment itself should certainly be celebrated, investors should take a step back and analyze whether Coinbase is really worth $100 billion. Although many articles have been written praising the valuation, in the immortal words of Lee Corso, “Not so fast, my friends.”    Investors should proceed with caution    While Coinbase may very well have a successful listing and an even more successful year, investors should be aware of the risks. A few of those potential pitfalls include an overreliance on trading fees, significant competition from other exchanges and investment platforms, and the threat of decentralized finance (DeFi).      In late February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published the company’s S-1 form. Coinbase disclosed a few facts that are somewhat alarming, including:    “We generate substantially all of our total revenue from transaction fees on our platform.” (p. 17, Risk Factors)  “For the year ended December 31, 2020, transaction revenue represented over 96% of our net revenue.” (p. 92, Our Business Model)    Even though bitcoin set an all-time high last month, remember that cryptocurrency is still a highly volatile market and cyclical in nature. Although not everyone subscribes to this theory, one common school of thought is that crypto tends to operate in a four-year cycle of exponential highs, a bear market, an accumulation phase and then a recovery and continuation period. Although some may disagree on the specifics, one cannot argue that the crypto market is cyclical in nature and will likely remain so until the entire asset class reaches maturity.      In 2019, Coinbase reported a net loss of $30.4 million on revenue of $533.7 million. Last year, as would be expected, those numbers improved significantly with the company reporting a net profit of $322.3 million on revenue just under $1.3 billion. If we take the most recent valuation of $100 billion and divide it by 2020 revenue, that results in a 76x valuation multiple (remember this for later).      See also: Lex Sokolin - How Coinbase Is Worth $100B      Given Coinbase’s disclosure that 96% of its revenue comes from trading fees, it should be obvious that when asset prices are rising and volume is exploding, Coinbase is likely to perform extremely well. Because of crypto’s strong start this year, Coinbase has opted to list at precisely the right time.      But what happens after bitcoin peaks, which, according to some models, may happen as early as this summer? Well, if the last bear market was any indication, investors should expect to feel pain, significant pain.    The competition    Currently, Coinbase is the undisputed king of regulated crypto trading in the United States. While that’s an ideal position to be in, it also means competitors will devote endless resources towards innovation with the end goal of dethroning the champ. One such innovation in the crypto space is deposit interest.      While traditional bank accounts typically offer close to 0% interest on deposits, cryptocurrency accounts can often pay more than 5% on assets such as BTC and ETH and more than 8% on stablecoins. The primary players in this space are BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager. Although they may lack all the bells and whistles that a trading platform like Coinbase offers, for those who are interested in a basic long-term buy and hold strategy, they are more than sufficient. Imagine holding bitcoin for the next five years and being able to simultaneously capture price appreciation along with a 5% annual interest payment. That’s extremely compelling.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: How Coinbase Going Public Is Reshaping Trust in Markets      In fact, the case for paying interest on deposits is so compelling that Gemini launched Gemini Earn, a new interest-generating program that offers customers up to 7.4% APY on cryptocurrency deposits, in early February. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have been at the forefront of crypto innovation for years. So, if they are making the leap it’s safe to assume they have identified an opportunity to generate substantial profit. The question is whether Coinbase will launch a similar program and take advantage of a prime opportunity to help diversify its revenue stream.    The looming threat of DeFi    Pressure from other regulated centralized exchanges isn’t the only risk facing Coinbase. DeFi has soared in popularity with total value locked (TVL) hovering at approximately $40 billion. In fact, the growth trajectory of DeFi TVL over the past 12 months is nothing short of spectacular.      Uniswap, the most active decentralized exchange (DEX), recently reached $100 billion in cumulative all-time volume. While that pales in comparison to Coinbase’s all-time volume of more than $450 billion, Coinbase was founded in 2012, whereas Uniswap didn’t get its start until late 2018. Below is a tweet from Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, that shows just how explosive the trading volume at Uniswap has been since the summer of last year.      Uniswap’s native governance token, UNI, currently gives the exchange a token capitalization of approximately $17.2 billion. It is estimated that Uniswap generates approximately $1.2 billion in annualized revenue. Based on that estimate, Uniswap currently has a 14x valuation multiple. Since equity ownership entitles holders to a portion of the company’s profits and a right to vote on the company’s future, it’s not entirely fair to compare token and equity valuations, but this does help to put everything into proper context.      See also: Coinbase Is Going Public: Everything You Need to Know      Until more data is available, whether Uniswap, and to a lesser extent Sushiswap, can overtake centralized exchanges like Coinbase is a matter of opinion. It’s entirely possible they can all co-exist, but Uniswap may end up taking a huge bite out of Coinbase’s pie.      Valuation can be more of an art than a science. A lot of factors must be taken into consideration before deciding the exact price tag to put on a business. Coinbase is currently the biggest name in U.S. crypto trading and has certainly earned a premium for that as the market has climbed. However, crypto is an all-out arms race with innovation occurring at breakneck pace. Can Coinbase keep up to justify a $100 billion valuation?

42433874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5sdh,1615306211,Troubled Crypto Project Qoin Faces Membership Ruling by New Zealand Blockchain Body,"Following last month's ejection from Australia's leading blockchain industry body, retail-focused cryptocurrency project Qoin is being considered for a similar expulsion across the Tasman Sea.      According to a report on Tuesday by local news outlet Radio New Zealand, BlockchainNZ (BCNZ) is reviewing a submission as to whether Qoin should be removed from its member list.      BCNZ is reportedly looking into the project's transparency and operations, which has previously led some to accuse the company of being a “scam” in Australia.      The review in question is focused on an alleged conflict of interest with BPS Financial Limited, a company with ties to Qoin, according to public information on the Australian Business Register. BPS is said, in the Radio New Zealand report, to own the Block Trade Exchange (BTX) – the sole marketplace on which the project's native cryptocurrency can be traded.      Qoin's chief marketing officer, Andrew Barker, initially told CoinDesk via email that Qoin is not ""owned"" by any company and that BPS, Bartercard International Limited and Block Trade Exchange Limited were merely ""service providers.""      ""BTX is the first official exchange for the Qoin community and further exchanges are being considered to approach by the Qoin Association,"" Barker said.      See also: Mystery Over Why Blockchain Australia Revoked Membership of Crypto Project Qoin      BTX and Qoin are registered to the same address in Southport, Queensland, according to public records. Meanwhile, BPS and Bartercard listings don't state the full address, but all have the same Southport postal code.      When asked about the above details, Barker clarified his prior statement.      According to Barker, BPS owns the Qoin wallet and has set up a subsidiary (Qoin Australia Pty Ltd) to conduct sales and marketing activities in Australia while also registering the trading name. Meanwhile, Bartercard ""provides the trading and support services to the Qoin community in Australia and New Zealand.""      Barker added that Qoin had communicated with New Zealand's industry body ""when the BCA [Blockchain Australia] issue surfaced,"" outlining ""timelines and facts"" regarding the organization's decision.      He said Qoin was later contacted by BCNZ on Feb. 24 to inform the company it had received the submission and that BCNZ would be ""back in touch should there be further queries.""      Qoin has since had no further communication with BCNZ, according to Barker.    'Not unusual'    Stephen Macaskill, a member of the executive council at BlockchainNZ, said that while the industry body was yet to make a decision, a company operating a cryptocurrency that was tied to one marketplace was not unusual.      ""There's an international exchange that has their own digital asset and initially when they launched you could only buy their own digital asset on their own exchange,"" said Macaskill. ""There are a few of them out there like that.""      The council member added he personally believes Qoin is legitimate, but also recognized friction caused arising from Blockchain Australia's merger from two separate entities in 2019.      See also: Australia’s Blockchain Ecosystem Needs More Support From Regulators, Says Industry Body      The merger was designed to bring two separate camps together – one advocating for an open-source model and the other business enterprise. Macaskill said he could see where those within the crypto community observed Qoin and took a negative stance due to the project not being ""open-sourced"" or ""decentralized.""      ""We agree with most of Stephen Macaskill’s comments,"" said Barker.

42433867,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5sjh,1615303310,State of Crypto: It's Time to Talk About NFTs and Intellectual Property Law,"NFTs are everywhere now. But how do they fit into the existing legal and regulatory structures?    You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Selling things  The narrative    The other day, I sold a pair of tweets. This isn’t a sentence I’d have imagined writing a year ago, but, well, here we are. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have really taken off over the past few weeks. One of my favorite musicians has created NFTs, the Associated Press is selling an NFT, the National Basketball Association has made headlines selling NFTs and we’re even at the point where hackers are offering to sell 0-day exploits as NFTs.    Why it matters    NFTs are exploding in popularity, but it’s unclear how they fit into the existing legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the financial, technology and cryptocurrency industries. NFTs don’t behave like initial coin offerings (ICOs), so they can’t just be treated like a security. And while there are laws that govern the behavior of NFT activities, it’s essential to ensure consumers are aware of what they’re doing.    Breaking it down    NFTs are basically digital collectibles. They can represent things (like tweets, real estate, real-world assets, etc.) or they can be the things (like art). Their value proposition is that they are digitally unique, they exist on a blockchain (like Ethereum) and while anyone can copy and download video clips or image files, an NFT has a record saying that it has only one owner.      To be clear: You can still download the image file recorded in an NFT. If you sell a tweet, that tweet will still exist on Twitter, visible to all. So in that sense you’re not buying the tweet itself, but more a digitally authenticated note. Think of them as autographed football cards. You could print as many copies as you want but if the player signs only one, that’s the card that’ll likely have the most value. For example, an autographed Tom Brady card just sold for $1.32 million.      We might only be beginning to scrape the possibilities for what NFTs can be used, said Andrew Hinkes of Carlton Fields. At its core, an NFT can identify a unique financial asset, which can in turn lead to new efficiencies for current transactions.      Land ownership is one example: At present, people are dependent on land registries maintained by other parties, like a government agency, to record that they are the owners of a piece of land. Hinkes said an NFT could instead represent that land, letting an individual prove ownership using a cryptographically secured and signed digital token.      Daniel Rollingher, a real estate attorney with Fabrica, noted that real estate NFTs could also require consumers borrowing from lenders, which would lead to these NFT issuers having to ensure they address consumer protection and disclosure regulations.    Consumer protection    One of the issues with NFTs is many consumers may have no idea what it is they’re buying, said Donna Redel, a board member at New York Angels and an adjunct professor at Fordham Law. Furthermore, NFTs raise further questions about who exactly is conducting know-your-customer/anti-money laundering procedures, whether any specific party is actually recording the sale of an NFT and what sort of rights buyers have.      “I’m not so sure the artists know exactly what their rights and obligations are a) under the contract and b) in the general, more legal world,” she said. “My assumption is we’re going to see more things like [NBA] Top Shot, which is a walled garden.”      NFTs are also now becoming popular with an increasingly younger and less-sophisticated audience, said Seward and Kissel’s Andrew Jacobson.    OFAC/FinCEN    Jacobson told CoinDesk that NFTs could run into U.S. sanctions law, which prevents U.S. residents or citizens from conducting business with individuals or entities from sanctioned nations.      However, there is an exception that could cover information and information materials, which could allow people to deal with artwork from sanctioned nations, he said.      “What if you had an NFT that originated in Iran or North Korea or some other sanctioned country … how would you treat that from a sanctions perspective?""      There’s also a risk malicious actors might see NFTs as an opportunity to raise or launder funds, he said, pointing to the Marine Chain ICO as an example of how a sanctioned entity tried raising funds using cryptocurrencies in the past.      ""I think platforms that sell NFTs or process them or originate them should consider that,” Jacobson said.      Platforms also need to take care to ensure they aren’t treated as money transmission businesses, said Jeffrey Alberts of Pryor Cashman.      “FinCEN rules govern things that substitute for value so you could make an argument that an NFT would be a substitute for value. FinCEN doesn’t think about the product, they think about the people and conduct,” Hinkes said, referring to an agency of the U.S. Treasury Dept.    Copyright and intellectual property    The question is whether buyers' perception of what they bought matches the legal reality, said Nelson Rosario, one of the founders of Smolinski Rosario Law. Sellers face the same issue, particularly mainstream firms that are hopping on the trend.      Sellers have the added issue of making sure the NFT they sell has exactly the content they want to sell; unlike other digital files, an NFT cannot easily be edited once it’s been recorded on a blockchain.      “There’s no going back, you can’t make changes. You can put out a second token but that existing NFT is going to be out there and so you need to appreciate and be mindful of any potential risks with this,” Rosario said.      There are also questions about how NFTs might fit into existing copyright law. Mike Shinoda, one of the founding musicians behind Linkin Park, told Input Magazine that “there’s nobody who’s serious about NFTs who really humors the idea that what you’re selling is the copyright or the master,” meaning the artists retain the copyright even as they sell some form of licensed content to buyers.      While musicians or artists who create NFTs of their own artwork likely have an understanding of their rights, people can also mint NFTs of works they didn’t create.      “I do wonder if the NFT platforms that are on the market at the moment have policies and processes in place to deal with that eventuality,” Rosario said. “What would happen if someone minted a bunch of Mickey Mouse-related NFTs on OpenSea and then Walt Disney lawyers contact the platform?”    Counterfeiting    Many NFTs represent real-world items, which raises the possibility that the link between a real-world item and the NFT representing it can be broken, Alberts said.      “The real thing that could happen is you would sell something on a website, say that it’s an NFT that exists on a blockchain, and you’re just lying and that’s false ... [M]ost users would have no way of knowing whether that’s true or false because they’re not sophisticated enough to go and check,” he said. “The items could either not be an NFT at all, it could just be a cool-looking image or it could be an NFT that’s tied to a different blockchain.”    Securities/tax laws    NFTs might run into securities laws, though this seems less likely than some of the other regulatory regimes with which they interact.      If people buy an NFT on the expectation that it will rise in value, they might sue the creator if the NFT instead drops in value, Alberts said.      ""I think it’s similar in that there’s lots of public demand but the classic securities law and classic sanctions law and classic commodities law will have to be reapplied. It’s a different product at the end of the day so it’s just another thing that regulators will have to [think about],” Jacobson said. “Is there pricing transparency and is there a secondary market?""      NFT buyers may also have to deal with different jurisdictions’ tax regimes. If NFTs are compared to art, that usually means the buyer has to deal with this concern, Redel said.      “Who’s collecting sales tax? When you buy $4.6 million of art someone has to pay sales tax, and it’s the buyer’s jurisdiction,” she said.    Digital dollar    Last week, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard endorsing the idea of a token-based digital dollar and asking the U.S. central bank to lay out a timeline for when it will decide whether or not it wants to build a central bank digital currency.      “Some of our international counterparts are moving quickly to determine whether to implement a central bank digital currency,” Brown said. “The United States must do the same. We cannot be left behind.”      David Treat, a senior managing director at Accenture and a director of the Digital Dollar Foundation, told CoinDesk that Senate involvement in any digital dollar efforts is “essential,” noting that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Fed Chair Powell have both said they want to prioritize modernizing the U.S.’s real-time payments infrastructure.      Brown’s letter could help ensure the Fed has the resources it needs to make progress on this effort, Treat said.      Still, while Brown encouraged the Fed to commit to a firm timeline, the U.S. is still likely a ways out from deciding whether or not to implement a digital dollar, and further still from actually doing so.      “When you’re talking about systemically important infrastructure, it has to be right. It has to be safe, secure, with all of the core infrastructure for any country,” Treat said. “Systemically important infrastructure takes time.”    Biden’s rule    The Senate Banking Committee will consider the nominations of Gary Gensler and Rohit Chopra for SEC Chair and CFPB director, respectively, tomorrow. Assuming both are passed out of committee, the nominations will move to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote after that. Missed last week’s confirmation hearing?

Crypto Exchanges Discussed XRP’s Status With SEC Ahead of Listings, Ripple Says: Ripple filed its answer to the SEC’s amended complaint last week. Most of it was the same, but it added a bit on how crypto exchanges apparently discussed XRP’s legal status with the SEC prior to listing it. In other Ripple news, it’s winding down its partnership with MoneyGram (last month, MG announced it was suspending said partnership). I’m not sure if Ripple is maintaining its stake in MoneyGram or not.

Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) introduced legislation Tuesday to create a working group composed of industry experts and representatives from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to evaluate the current legal and regulatory framework around digital assets in the U.S.      The three other co-sponsors of the bill are Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and Warren Davidson (R-Ohio).      The ultimate goal of the legislation, called the ""Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021,"" would be to clarify when the SEC has jurisdiction over a particular token or cryptocurrency (i.e., when it is a security) and when the CFTC has jurisdiction (i.e., when it’s a commodity).      U.S. regulations can often appear lacking, with no clear rules on when a certain cryptocurrency is treated as a security or not, with SEC enforcement actions providing much of the guidance in this area. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is outspoken on the issue, tried tackling it in 2020 by proposing a three-year safe harbor for projects to get off the ground.      Under the terms of the bill, Congress would create a working group within 90 days of the bill’s passage composed of SEC and CFTC representatives.      Non-governmental representatives would come from a financial technology company, a financial services institution, small businesses using financial technology, investor protection groups, organizations that support investments in underserved businesses and at least one academic researcher.      Within a year, this group would be required to file a report analyzing current regulations, the impact they have on primary and secondary markets and how the regime impacts the U.S.’ competitive position.      The report would also look at how custody, private key management and cybersecurity are currently treated under law, and what future best practices for fraud prevention, investor protection and other issues could look like.      The report would also include recommendations for improving primary and secondary digital asset markets, including their “fairness, orderliness, integrity, efficiency, transparency, availability and efficacy.”      Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, told CoinDesk the legislation aims to establish an organized, comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S.      “It brings together both the SEC and CFTC in a formal way, to work through some of the key issues that have impacted legal clarity in the space for years,” Kim said. “Now we have an opportunity to start addressing them in a methodical way with a number of stakeholders.”      The bill was originally supposed to be introduced Monday and considered under a voice vote by the full House of Representatives, indicating broad bipartisan support, according to Rep.

The Moon browser extension’s latest feature allows its users to pay for purchases using a Visa prepaid card which they purchase on the extension using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. Once purchased, this card is immediately used as the payment option at checkout.      Upon checking out, the user employs the Moon browser extension to instantly generate a prepaid card for the exact amount of the purchase. The browser extension generates a Lightning invoice, which the user pays from any Lightning wallet. and then they can use the card to pay for the items in their cart.      These cards can only be used once, have no fees and are only available to United States users.      Moon also integrates with Coinbase so users of both can pay for the cards directly from their Coinbase accounts onchain.      The payment solution is the latest Bitcoin startup to combine traditional payment rails with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a bleeding-edge technology stack that facilitates instant, low-fee transactions.      “We've been working with the Visa Fintech team and their network of partners to build Moon. Since the vast majority of merchants don't accept Bitcoin payments, sending payments over the Visa network is the best option due to its ubiquity,” Moon Founder and CEO Ken Kruger told CoinDesk.      “Visa has provided us with access to the Visa network, world-class expertise and the best financial partners to bring Moon's Bitcoin payment solution to market.”    Visa Fast Track meets bitcoin    Over the past year, Visa has been generous with this expertise and network access to help bring Bitcoin and, more specifically, Lightning-focused business to their next phases of product development through its Fintech Fast Track program.      Notably, Visa has been involved in Jack Maller’s Strike, a Lightning Network-powered Venmo alternative that can settle cross border-payments.      The payment company has also helped Fold launch its bitcoin rewards debit card. Others like eToro and BlockFi are following suit by launching their own bitcoin rewards debit and credit cards through the program.      These products can complement each other and ultimately strengthen Bitcoin’s burgeoning payments technologies.

42433868,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5sth,1615291701,Bitcoin Eyes Record Highs as Market Cap Bounces Back Over $1T,"Bitcoin is marching north toward record highs once more, having shown resilience in the face of a rallying U.S. dollar in recent days.      ""While many were concerned about the USD strength and a turbulent macro market, BTC has continued to break recent highs,"" Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""We believe the risk-off correlation between these markets is slowly unwinding, and the cryptocurrency could challenge record highs.""      The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, jumped 1.21% last week as rising U.S. Treasury yields and losses in the stock market boosted haven demand.      However, despite the dollar charting its biggest weekly gain since October, bitcoin jumped over 12% in the same period. The top cryptocurrency was last seen trading above $54,170, representing an 8% gain over 24 hours, and with a market capitalization that has now returned over $1 trillion, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      A convincing move above resistance at $52,666 has put within reach the record high of $58,332 hit on Feb. 22.      ""There are other positive signs on the technical chart,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, said, while drawing attention to a breakout above the Ichimoku cloud red line – a technical analysis tool used to help identify support and resistance levels and other essential information such as trend direction and momentum.      According to Heusser, the bitcoin market has witnessed positive structural changes over recent weeks that would pave the way for a more sustainable move to lifetime highs. The futures premium has dropped, alongside continuously increasing futures open interest, and spot and futures trading volumes, he told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Futures listed on major exchanges are trading at a considerably lower premium to spot market prices compared to the record spread seen in mid-February when bitcoin reached new highs above $58,000. The peak premium represented excess bullish leverage, which has been cleared by the pullback to sub-$50,000 seen at the end of last month.      Futures open interest, or the number of open positions, jumped to 334,328 BTC on Monday – the highest level since Feb. 19 – having dropped along with prices in the second half of February.      A rise in prices alongside an uptick in open interest is said to validate an uptrend. Meanwhile, a price drop is said to be temporary if it is accompanied by a decline in open interest. That's what happened during bitcoin's recent correction to $43,000.      And lastly, blockchain data shows holding sentiment remains strong as ever, with the balance held on exchanges continuing its uninterrupted decline last week with an outflow of 35,200 BTC.    Turbulence ahead?    With key events such as Federal Reserve's rate decision due next week, Dibb foresees some price turbulence ahead of a possible breakout above $60,000.      At the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting March 16-17, Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reaffirm his pro-stimulus stance. Traders, however, will have an ear out for his comments on rising bond yields. Powell recently refrained from sounding too worried about the turmoil in the bond market. However, an unchecked rise in yields may force him into action.      Heusser, meanwhile, has some concerns the bitcoin order books are currently skewed to the sell side. However, he remains confident these offers will be absorbed by strong inflows.      ""We have seen this before, and continuous market spot buying (mainly on Coinbase) made it possible for the price to go up,"" Heusser said.      The cryptocurrency may still see losses if the stock market suffers a big drawdown on a continued rise in yields, if any. Heusser, however, does not expect a drop below $47,000.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the news source said shares changed hands for $350 apiece last Thursday via a Nasdaq Private Market auction.      The $90 billion figure is up $13 billion from February when shares were trading for around $303 each, as CoinDesk previously reported.      Bloomberg's sources said some shares had reached as high as $375 apiece, which would place the company value at around $100 billion – a sum previously suggested by Lex Sokolin, CoinDesk columnist and global fintech co-head at ConsenSys.      The people also suggested the auction is the last time Coinbase shares will be privately traded before the company's public listing on Nasdaq later this month.

42433854,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5sPh,1615280498,Next Step for Institutional DeFi? Institutional NFTs,"The institutional appetite for decentralized finance (DeFi) is being extended to incorporate the frothy world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      Announced Tuesday, custody and wallet technology firm Trustology is providing support for Ethereum-based NFTs, with a view to allowing institutional investors to use these tokens as collateral, for example, within the DeFi space.      There’s currently an explosion happening in NFTs, which can be thought of as blockchain-based title deeds to a digital artifact. The trend is a carry-on from things like the original CrypoKitties phenomenon in 2017, with the technology (Ethereum’s ERC-721 token standard) later morphing its way deep into the world of digital art.    Read more: It’s an NFT Boom. Do You Know Where Your Digital Art Lives?    Today, the value being conferred on everything from art to music to seminal tweets is measured in hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. Meanwhile, institutional NFT is becoming a thing, with funds like Delphi Digital, Scalar Capital and Sfermion investing in digital collectibles.      “A couple of years back when NFTs first became popular, DeFi protocols for lending, collateralizing and pledging assets didn't really exist,” Trustology CEO Alex Batlin said in an interview. “Now there are marketplaces to buy and sell NFTs, marketplaces to use NFTs as collateral for loans and so on.”    Read more: The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs, Explained    Like DeFi, NFTs are normally associated with non-custodial wallets. But a collection of valuable NFT assets being managed on the behalf of a fund, for instance, would require a custody solution including rules to allow certain individuals to lend the asset or use it as collateral, said Batlin.      “When it comes to selecting a custodian of NFTs, there’s potentially the need for more functionality than simply locking these valuables away in a vault,” he said.      Trustology, which was recently granted temporary Financial Conduct Authority registration, offers a range of automated transaction security controls such as co-signing, allow-lists and DeFi firewall rules.      “All this stuff is highly integrated,” said Batlin. “It’s becoming the world's largest marketplace for financial services.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/09/next-step-for-institutional-defi-institutional-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3eaf89423ae51c0d25fd595f678439e1ac14963-1200x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
