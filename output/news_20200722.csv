42384153,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA124r,1595457807,Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Sues YouTube Over Bitcoin Giveaway Scams,"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is suing video-sharing giant YouTube and its parent company Google for allegedly allowing bitcoin giveaway scams that use his likeness to thrive on its platform.      Wozniak was one of 18 plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit on Tuesday, which seeks punitive damages, a trial by jury and demands YouTube remove all bitcoin giveaway scams and promotions using Wozniak’s name and likeness.      The suit praised Twitter for acting “swiftly and decisively” to shut down malicious accounts and “protect its users from the scam,” referencing the platform’s response to last week’s coordinated cyberattack that gained access to a host of verified Twitter accounts and posted a crypto giveaway message.      “In stark contrast, for months now, Defendant YOUTUBE has been unapologetically hosting, promoting and directly profiting from similar scams,” the suit said.      Wozniak is not the first to take action against YouTube over crypto scams. Earlier this year, Ripple Labs, along with CEO Brad Garlinghouse, sued the platform for allegedly failing to effectively police fake XRP giveaway scams that were causing monetary and reputation harm to the company.      According to the new complaint filed with the Superior Court of the State of California in the county of San Mateo, YouTube has “featured a steady stream of scam videos and promotions that falsely use images and videos of Plaintiff Steve Wozniak, and other famous tech entrepreneurs, and that have defrauded YouTube users out of millions of dollars.”      The suit alleged that the image and likeness of other well-known entrepreneurs including Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Michael Dell were also being exploited in these scams.      According to screenshots attached in the complaint, the scams involving Wozniak uses images and videos that tell users that the entrepreneur is hosting a live bitcoin or “BTC” giveaway event. The suit alleges that the posts “convince” users to transfer their cryptocurrency promising that, for a limited time, they “will receive twice as much back”.      “YOUTUBE and GOOGLE took the further step of promoting and profiting from these scams by providing paid advertising that targeted users who were most likely to be harmed,” the suit said.      Wozniak is accusing defendants YouTube and Google of violating his right of publicity, misappropriating his name and likeness, as well as aiding and abetting fraud, and negligent failure to warn users.      “Defendants’ failure to warn was willful, malicious, oppressive, fraudulent, and/or in reckless disregard of the Plaintiffs’ rights, thereby entitling Plaintiffs to punitive damages,” the suit said.      The suit demands a trial by jury on all issues triable, and damages that include legal expenses, and any “gains, profits, or advantages wrongfully obtained by Defendants.”      The lawsuit was filed by Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, LLP.

42384145,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA11w3,1595455276,NBA Player Spencer Dinwiddie's Token Sale Hits 10% of $13.5M Goal,"Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie fought the National Basketball Association for months over his plan to tokenize his $34 million contract. Now, with the NBA’s concerns apparently addressed and the sale closed out, Dinwiddie’s plan hit a different obstacle: investor interest.      Dinwiddie’s issuer SD26 LLC sold just nine of the 90 available tokenized contract shares to eight total investors as of Wednesday, according to CoinDesk’s review of Form D regulatory filings and the security’s token’s issuance history on Etherscan.      With shares priced at $150,000, just $1,350,000 (or one-tenth of the target $13.5 million sale) was sold. Project insiders have previously said the sale would last only until the end of July. It now appears to be closed out for good.      The sluggish sale of an innovative crypto-contract project indicates that Dinwiddie, who has become the NBA’s de facto crypto hype man, will not succeed in garnering the $13.5 million in tokenization revenue he targeted.      Tritaurian Capital CEO William Heyn, whose firm conducted the sale in coordination with Paxos and Spencer Dinwiddie’s Dream Fan Shares, declined a CoinDesk request for comment. Dinwiddie could not be reached for comment.      Dinwiddie first proposed tokenizing his three-year contract in September 2019. But meeting fierce opposition from the NBA and facing threats that he could see his contract terminated, the point guard retooled and delayed his sale. It launched on Jan. 13, 2020. The sale began in March.      The project was recast as a bond sale that raised the contract’s upfront value and allowed Dinwiddie access to more capital sooner as a business loan. His shareholders (the token holders) would in turn receive payouts as the season progressed.      But Dinwiddie could not have anticipated that the 2019-20 NBA season would not be completed as planned. Less than two months after he apparently started his tokenization sale, the NBA lurched into a virus-induced hiatus that scrapped most of the regular season. The league is only now preparing to return on July 30 with eight games leading into a modified playoff schedule.      Dinwiddie, who has previously tested positive for the coronavirus, will not be there for the Nets’ final push. He has opted out of the remainder of the NBA season.      Still, the global pandemic did not completely derail Dinwiddie’s contract sale. His first sales came during the NBA hiatus, on July 10, according to Form D filings. Etherscan records of the SD26 tokens reveal that nine tokens were sent to eight different addresses on July 12.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/22/nba-player-spencer-dinwiddies-token-sale-hits-10-of-135m-goal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0acc5b2e49b9bd2f8b5ba83eb62c9f946fb7a34-2300x1725.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA129t,1595451437,CFTC Seeks Industry Advice on Blockchain Applications,"Not all central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are created equal, a Georgetown Law Professor said during a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) tech advisory meeting last Thursday.      A digital currency backed by the Federal Reserve was one of the main topics discussed during the four hour-long remote meeting, organized by the commission’s technology advisory committee (TAC).      Chris Brummer, Georgetown Law Professor and Faculty Director of the Institute of International Economic Law, presented an overview of CBDCs, explaining how one might be designed and issued, on behalf of TAC’s Virtual Currencies Subcommittee.      CBDCs have graduated from a niche idea to a topic that the U.S. Congress has discussed repeatedly this year. Advocates have called for a “digital dollar” as a response to the COVID-19 crisis, and also as a way to confront economic threats posed by other nations' tokenized national currencies. Barely a week after the CFTC meeting, the idea of a digital dollar as an economic weapon to fight China’s digital yuan was raised during a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing.      “A central bank can issue a CBDC in a myriad of ways,” Brummer said in the CFTC meeting last week.      Other industry experts also weighed in on possible applications and legal ramifications of distributed ledger technology (DLT), and compared the volatility of bitcoin and ethereum to other securities. CFTC Chairman Heath P. Tarbert and Commissioner Brian Quintez made opening statements while four TAC subcommittees made presentations.    Decisions, decisions    In his presentation, Brummer discussed six key design considerations for a CBDC that included the need to decide between an account or token-based model, meaning customers would either access currency though something like a commercial bank account, which would require identification, or through a tokenized system that wouldn’t.      Another key consideration is whether the CBDC would be a currency with a retail or wholesale based system. A retail CBDC is reserved for the public to purchase goods or send and receive money, for example, while a wholesale currency will be limited for use by commercial banks and markets, Brummer said.      Brummer said the nature of a CBDC depends not only on how it is designed, but also on how the federal reserve would choose to issue it. A federal reserve could either issue the currency itself, or ask commercial banks to issue one on its behalf and ensure that it’s backed by the reserve.    Better than stablecoins?    A particularly important application of a potential CBDC is how successful it would be in enabling efficient cross-border transactions, Brummer said. Stablecoins, or privately issued instruments that are used as a stored value or medium of exchange, are rising in popularity as a potential solution to that problem, he added.      But a CBDC can have competitive advantages over stablecoins, Brummer said. In his view, stablecoins, like central bank currencies, are underpinned by varying degrees of trust in the issuer. “Central bank currencies can be seen as trying to provide more certainty and safety, if one will, behind the utility that a traditional stablecoin aspires to achieve.”      He also noted that CBDCs and stablecoins are trying to solve some of the same problems, like facilitating the continuous movement of fiat currencies and contactless payments in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.    Destabilization    When the commission asked about the impact of a CBDC on financial stability and economic growth, Brummer said it was perhaps a “$1 trillion” question.      “If you have a retail CBDC, where ultimately the money creation that has been reserved to the central banks is somehow now being reasserted by the Federal Reserve, and where people and individuals are taking their money out of commercial bank deposits and putting that money in central bank deposits, that is naturally going to have a destabilizing impact on some of the intermediaries in the financial system,” Brummer said.      But no central bank that he knows of, Brummer said, is looking to disintermediate local financial systems to that degree. Central banks don’t have experience onboarding customers, or implementing know-your-customer (KYC) measures, he said. He also raised a larger question: If financial institutions' capacity to lend money is undermined, could it lead to a “knock-on-effect” on GDP growth and monetary instability?    The 'Cotton Token'    The Distributed Ledger Technology and Market Infrastructure Subcommittee presentation discussed the resiliency and scalability of DLT systems through various applications of tokenization.      “A potential reason for decentralization and the use of DLT is improved resilience to faults in the traditional system,” said Shawnna Hoffman, Global Cognitive Leader at IBM, adding that the Bitcoin distributed ledger has proven relatively resilient to cyber attacks when compared to traditional systems.      Mark Pryor, CEO of trading platform provider The Seam LLC, said tokens can represent physical assets like a bale of cotton (weighing 500 pounds), but they can also represent a range of non-physical assets, for example carbon credits that represent one ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere.      “In cotton in the United States, 15 to 20 million records or tokens of ownership are managed in proprietary systems today,” Pryor said.      Pryor aligned the various tokens in these systems to the standards found in the ethereum token ecosystem. Ethereum tokens can be fungible (interchangeable) or non-fungible (unique). For instance, the non-fungible ERC 721, Pryor said, could be used to represent one-of-a-kind-products or “identity preserved commodities like a bale of cotton.”      But ethereum’s relatively new multi-standard token, that allows one token to reference a basket of one-of-a-kind products, each with its own non-fungible token, can also improve batch transactions, Pryor said.    Volatility: Stocks vs. Crypto    Tom Chippas, CEO at crypto derivatives platform ErisX, discussed the volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum against other well-known traded commodities and securities.      “Bitcoin is on average more volatile than the other securities and commodities noted. But there's certainly some that have similar and sometimes greater volatility and though we didn't do an entire comparison of all stocks say versus bitcoin, there [are] small cap U.S. stocks that had even greater volatility than bitcoin,” Chippas said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/22/cftc-seeks-industry-advice-on-blockchain-applications,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9c079ebbf40c1b290b28ff8f021c73ceba28b51-1424x775.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a recent press release by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Orange County, California, resident is pleading guilty to one count each of money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program.    The DOJ press release said Mohammad laundered money by taking fiat currency from customers in person and using the bitcoin ATMs to launder the cash. In the plea agreement, he also admitted he laundered from $15 million to $25 million between December 2014 and November 2019.   The bitcoin ATMs were operated under the name “Herocoin” and were located in gas stations, malls and convenience stores in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The kiosks allowed customers to both buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for fiat.   According to the DOJ, Mohammad intentionally did not register his firm with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) initially, and also did not develop or maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. He also failed to report any transactions that should have been flagged as suspicious.   When contacted by FinCEN in July 2018, Mohammad registered his firm but then failed to comply with any of the regulations, the DOJ said. In the plea agreement, Mohammad also admits that he knew at least one of his clients was engaged in criminal activity on the Dark web.   As part of their investigation, undercover agents conducted multiple transactions on Herocoin ATMs that were not reported by the firm. In September 2018, one of the agents purchased about $14,5000 in bitcoin in three successive transactions from the ATMs; even though Mohammad's firm would have been required to report this, it failed to do so. The agents also conducted multiple in-person transactions with the defendant.   In August 2019, one of the undercover agents met Mohammad, gave him $16,000 dollars in cash and said the funds had been earned through illegal activity. The agent received 1.58592 bitcoin in return but Mohammad did not flag that transaction.   Mohammad faces a maximum of 30 years in federal prison and, as part of the plea agreement, has agreed to forfeit cash, cryptocurrency and the 17 bitcoin ATMs he operated.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/22/superman29-may-do-time-california-resident-pleads-guilty-to-laundering-millions-using-illegal-bitcoin-atms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ead273067706072cddad72fb328bc33c90bb9cd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stockton said bitcoin is currently part of a “risk-on market” - where investors take on riskier assets - and could fuel upward price pressure. “A ‘risk-on’ environment could help foster a rebound, although resistance remains strong above $10,000,” she said.

Indeed, bitcoin’s implied volatility, the options market’s expectations of a likely movement in price, was 49% on Wednesday, near the three-month low of 46% on July 3.      Volumes in July on spot exchange Coinbase continue to be weak as well, which makes things tougher for traders. “As liquidity dries out it becomes more difficult for large participants to take positions on the market without leaving a large footprint,” Pavageau added.      Bitcoin’s market conditions haven’t changed in the past week, according to Sasha Goldberg of Toronto-based brokerage Global Digital Assets. ""I don't see anything special - still in the same range as a week ago. I don't see any bullish or bearish signs,"" he said.

42432401,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCG1h,1595443275,Mempool Manipulation Enabled Theft of $8M in MakerDAO Collateral on Black Thursday: Report,"The Takeaway:    A company that keeps data on Ethereum mempools around the world, Blocknative, may have an explanation for the ""zero-bid"" attack on MakerDAO on Black Thursday.  Mempools are a holding bin for transactions waiting to get mined into blocks. Under market stress, they tend to get clogged.  Blocknative found an endless stream of clever, worthless transactions in mempools on the day of the attack, apparently designed to make it hard for transactions to get through.  Falling ETH prices triggered auctions of collateral on MakerDAO. Because the mempools were clogged, bidders could not get bids on those auctions through in many cases, allowing attackers to win ETH collateral with bids worth $0.  The attackers walked away with $8.3 million.    A clever hustle in Ethereum's mempools enabled attackers to steal $8.3 million from MakerDAO users on Black Thursday, according to research published Wednesday.      To recap: The price of ether (ETH) plummeted on March 12 and the Ethereum network was congested by a flood of attempted transactions. As investors fled to fiat, ETH's price sunk low enough to trigger liquidations of the collateral held on the MakerDAO lending platform. These programmatic liquidations enabled attackers to walk away with $8.3 million in ETH, for free, shorting borrowers and MakerDAO itself.      The congestion, though, was key and completely intentional, according to Blocknative, a company focused on studying action in blockchain mempools.      The new research suggests March’s “Black Swan” event for Ethereum may have actually been a sophisticated plan to cash in on a global sell-off fueled by COVID-19 concerns.      ""The entire affair meant [the attackers] were able to achieve over 1,000 zero-bid auctions … and collect that underlying value with almost no out-of-pocket expense,"" Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler told CoinDesk in an interview.    Mempool manipulation    At the heart of Blocknative's work is mempools: the temporary storage on every Ethereum node where transactions wait to get mined and finalized.      In mid-March, mempools got congested with useless transactions on purpose, Blocknative said, as part of a plan to win zero-bid auctions for ETH on MakerDAO under just these conditions.      Indeed, the Maker Foundation wrote as much in its post-mortem published in April:    ""Network congestion and high gas prices caused transaction delays and, in many cases, failures. Those issues, combined with the unprecedented drop in the value of assets, caught Maker Vault owners, Keepers, and liquidity pools off-guard.""    (The Maker Foundation referred CoinDesk to the above blog post and declined to comment further for this story.)      Obviously, many Ethereum users will wonder whether the drop in ETH price itself was somehow manufactured, but that question is outside the scope of Blocknative's investigation. The attackers could have been poised to opportunistically take advantage of a dramatic drop in ETH's price; whether the price drop itself was manufactured remains unknown.      That said, Blocknative did find what appears to be a March 8 test run of the attack's mechanics, a fact the research firm doesn't describe in its report.      ""It is an interesting coincidence that the test and the attack were within just four days of each other,"" Cutler told CoinDesk. ""[But] we don't have any evidence that this is anything other than opportunistic.""      Either way, the attackers took advantage of some very subtle insights about both Ethereum and MakerDAO. ""They basically exploited some techniques that had never been seen before,"" Cutler said.      More on those techniques later. First, we need to cover a few basics about MakerDAO and Ethereum.    MakerDAO basics    MakerDAO is known as the creator of dai (DAI), the decentralized stablecoin currently beloved by yield farmers. DAI is created with debt. Users put ETH or other crypto-assets up as collateral on the Maker platform to then withdraw a portion of the value of those assets in the form of brand-new DAI.      To get back their collateral, users must repay the DAI they borrowed plus whatever interest the loan has accrued (in MakerDAO parlance this is the ""stability fee,"" but it's just a variable interest rate). MakerDAO enforces the DAI price by liquidating collateral if its value falls below the minimum threshold to maintain proper collateralization. For ETH, that's 150%, but most users put in a lot more ETH than the minimum.      So, if ETH were at $200 and the user posted 1 ETH to borrow 100 DAI, they won't get liquidated unless ETH drops below $150.      But on Black Thursday, ETH's price fell almost $100, from $193, so that triggered a lot of liquidations.      Liquidations can be done by anyone, by the way, with bots called ""Keepers."" MakerDAO itself runs a Keeper, but a few other unknown entities do as well.      Keepers win liquidations through an auction (described step-by-step in plain language by CoinList), so different Keepers bid to close the loan, and on Black Thursday, those auctions only lasted 10 minutes, or a few dozen Ethereum blocks.      The idea is that these auctions should (and normally have) resulted in users getting back their collateral minus however much they owed, plus the stability fee and the liquidation fee (it's the last part that hurts). But that's not what happened this time.      Borrowers got nothing and, in fact, MakerDAO got paid back much too little DAI, and the whole system was undercollateralized.    Ethereum basics    Ethereum is a blockchain, which means it’s always gathering up transactions and miners are competing to compose blocks of those transactions, encrypt them, break the encryption and then prove their work to the rest of the miners to win a block reward.      Transactions aren't real until they are in a mined block. And there are usually more transactions out there waiting to get into a block than there is room for more transactions. Those delayed transactions wait in what's called the ""mempool.""      Mempools are one of those things that most people don't really need to think about most of the time, except they become really important when situations get urgent: like when the price of ETH is falling off a cliff.      ""When you most need to be sure that things are happening are happening in an orderly fashion,"" Cutler said, ""is when things are least reliable.""      This is the whole point of Blocknative. The firm keeps a detailed account of mempools all over the world, studying what it calls ""value in motion."" Blocknative helps its customers decide if they need to be more aggressive in things like gas payments when things are going crazy. Mempool data is ""value in motion;"" finalized blockchain data is value at rest.      Crucially, miners cannot process a new transaction if the prior transaction hasn't gone through. Every transaction on Ethereum from a wallet gets a number, and 515 won't go through if 514 hasn't (this is tracked by the transaction ""nonce,"" in Ethereum-speak). This sequential reality turns out to be the key to the attack.    What Blocknative found    Blocknative has been keeping mempool data for Ethereum going back to early 2018 (also its testnets and for the Bitcoin network as well). The firm decided to take a look at the mempool data to see what happened around March 12.      Blocknative found that an unusually high proportion of the mempool was clogged by transactions with very low gas prices on them.      Usually this proportion isn't very high because users actually want their transactions to go through, so they will monitor gas prices and set them at levels that are likely to get picked up by a miner. But that's not what was happening on March 12. There were loads of transactions in the pool that had low gas prices on them. Too many.      This allowed the attackers to submit ""zero bids"" in MakerDAO's collateral auctions with strong gas prices attached – knowing full well they could likely win those auctions against well-intentioned Keeper bots who couldn't get their bids through.      Blocknative describes something called ""Hammerbots."" These would be bots designed to craft transactions precisely for the purpose of clogging the mempool.      ""The bots hammered the mempool with transactions that were never intended to be finalized. These 'Hammerbots' consumed mempool resources by issuing extremely high rates of replacement transactions without any corresponding increase in gas,"" Blocknative wrote on its blog.      These transactions were additionally designed with a lot of pointless operations that could be shifted and changed easily to vary the hash, but appeared to serve no real purpose.      ""These particular transactions, they would be particularly good at consuming mempool resources,"" Chris Meisl, a Blocknative co-founder, told CoinDesk.    Cascading problems    So that's the first problem: Congestion made it hard for borrowers on MakerDAO to add more collateral and it made it hard for Keepers to get bids through.      ""This resulted in anomalous mempool conditions, which would ultimately favor certain transactions,"" the Blocknative post reports.      But there was another crucial observation the attackers appear to have made about Keepers: they didn't seem to be checking to see if transactions were getting through.      ""When you do transactions on an account or address on Ethereum, they have to be ordered,"" Meisl said.      As we wrote above, if a nonce is missing in a blockchain's record, miners can't take later transactions until one with the prior nonce comes through. So a later transaction will get stuck, even if it has a very high gas price attached, until the prior one goes through.      This had a bizarre upshot. From the Blocknative blog post:    ""When viewed in aggregate, even though the volume of transactions entering the mempool increased dramatically, the gas price of a significant portion of the mempool collapsed to an artificially low value.""    In short: The attackers knew Keepers would fail to get their first bids through and it would result in subsequent bids ""probabilistically"" (in Cutler's words) getting stuck. And it worked often enough.      The open-source code that MakerDAO published for Keeper bots didn't have measures to check for stuck transactions.      This created a potential gap that allowed the attacker to submit a bid with a strong gas price but a 0 DAI bid for the collateral, starting that short 10-minute auction clock ticking.      ""While automated trading systems are often designed to programmatically increase the gas price of transactions, many such trading systems do not handle nonce gaps well – if at all,"" the Blocknative post warns.      In 1,462 cases, the Keepers failed to notice that their bids were getting stuck in the mempools, the attackers won the bid, stealing millions of dollars in ETH and nearly forcing an emergency shutdown on MakerDAO.      MakerDAO has since extended the auction time to six hours. Blocknative has opened its data set of mempool activity for members of the community to study further.      The blog post notes:    ""The mempool is a critical – yet ephemeral and often overlooked – element of the blockchain ecosystem. As such, mempools present many 'unknown unknowns' to builders and users alike.""    In this case, however, the attackers studied Maker's Keeper code and realized it was possible to know what the real Keepers didn't.",NEGATIVE,ETH | DAI,ETH | MARKET | MKR | TRADING | DAI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/22/mempool-manipulation-enabled-theft-of-8m-in-makerdao-collateral-on-black-thursday-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b0a853586978509fe59cc78850d398f6e3e7b71-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432408,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCGFh,1595443073,Ethereum 2.0 Developers Announce ‘Final’ Testnet Before Network Launch,"Ethereum 2.0 developers released the specifications for the “official” testnet on Wednesday, ahead of a presumed end-of-year launch. The testnet will begin Aug. 4 and has been named “Medalla” after the Buenos Aires metro stop.      In this case, “official” means the testnet is deployed by the Ethereum Foundation (EF). The testnet is still run by a decentralized group of programmers, developers and code auditors organized by fork coordinator Afri Schoedon.      Official also means the network’s code base is nearing ready for launch as investors and developers have begun to itch for the multi-year project’s release. Eth 2.0 researcher Justin Drake recently announced a unilateral effort to get the first part of the network shipped before the year’s close due to pushback on a later date.      Medalla joins multiple prior tests of Eth 2.0’s code bank on various client implementations, including Görli, Witti, Schlesi and most recently Altona.      Read more: Schlesi Testnet Is Latest Step in Long Road Toward Eth 2.0      “The Schlesi testnet was one of many steps in that direction. The Witti testnet was another. The Altona testnet is yet another. The Medalla testnet aims to be the final one prior to mainnet launch,” Schoedon said in the testnet GitHub Wednesday.    Clients    Clients by Prysmatic Labs (Prysm), PegaSys (Teku), Status (Nimbus) and Sigma Prime (Lighthouse) have participated in all the most recent testnets. All four clients plus one, Chainsafe’s Loadstar, have the ability to join Medalla, the GitHub reads.      Each testnet, furthermore, has chosen to practice or focus on different parts of Eth 2.0’s launching sequence, given the enormous technical challenges associated with moving a running blockchain network onto an entirely different consensus algorithm.      In the case of Medalla, the testnet will focus on improving the experience for moving ether (ETH) over to the new network in what is called “staking.” As Schoedon explained:    Medalla means ""medal"" and can be seen as a reference to the Olympic testnet that was used to prepare the ETH1 launch. It emphasizes the importance of the network at this stage towards the ETH2 launch. It can also be seen as a hint that Medalla validators will receive a proof of attendance ""medal"" on the Ethereum network for participation.  Attacknets    Eth 2.0 developers have also recently released guidelines for “attacknets” complete with $5,000 bounties for stress testing the network.      The attacknets will help finalize each client’s specification – written in different programming languages – before launch.      Eth 2.0 developers have pushed for a multi-client release of the project due to lessons learned from the current Ethereum network. The original network launched with a few implementations, but grew to be dominated by only one, Geth.

42432418,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCGPh,1595442809,Open Interest in Ether Options Jumps to New Record High,"Investor interest in ether options is stronger than ever, possibly due to excitement surrounding Ethereum’s long-awaited protocol change, dubbed ETH 2.0.      Data from major exchanges – Deribit and OKEx – shows that open interest in ether options rose to a new lifetime high of $194 million on Tuesday, surpassing the previous record high of $173.4 million reached on June 23, according to data supplied by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Options are derivative contracts, which give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents a right to buy, while a put option gives a right to sell.      The Panama-based Deribit exchange, the world’s biggest options exchange by volume, accounted for nearly 94% of the total open interest of $194 million on Tuesday.    Preparing for ETH 2.0?    A closer look at the distribution of the open interest as per expiry shows December as the month with the most open interest.      At press time, there are 240,237 open contracts with a notional value of $59 million expiring in December. Meanwhile, the July expiry open interest is 193,919 contracts ($47 million notional), according to Genesis Volatility, an options data platform.      “Concentration of activity in December expiry suggests traders may be gearing up for ETH 2.0,” said Greg Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, a derivative data platform.      Read More: Ethereum Turns Five Next Week and We’re Producing a Special Series      Luuk Strijjers, COO of Deribit, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat that ""the bullish momentum in open interest is based on the upcoming ETH 2.0 staking potential.”      ETH 2.0 refers to Ethereum’s long-awaited transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). The switch to staking mechanism would help ether holders generate additional yield by staking their tokens in the network. The transition, which was originally expected in the first quarter, now may not happen until early next year.      Even so, investor interest in the cryptocurrency is rising. The number of addresses holding 32 ETH or more — the minimum amount a holder is required to maintain as a balance to become a validator on Eth 2.0 (and hence earn staking rewards) — has increased by over 12% on a year-to-date basis to 123,530, according to data source Glassnode. In addition, ether has gained 90% this year compared to bitcoin’s 30% rise.      Some investors may be expressing their bullish view on the cryptocurrency by buying call options expiring in December, causing a rise in the open interest. Also, the possibility of investors hedging their long spot positions with long put options cannot be ruled out. After all, the transition has already faced several delays and the cryptocurrency’s price may drop if the upgrade is again pushed out beyond January 2021.    The DeFi harvest    And yet, ETH 2.0 may not be the only reason for the surge in open interest in ether options. “The recent DeFi success and the growing transacted value in stablecoins may have played a role,” Strijjers said.      Indeed, using ether options as a hedge may be increasing demand. That’s because there are concerns that the frenzy surrounding speculative activities such as “yield farming” in the DeFi space and interconnected leverage would lead to a systemic crisis. Most DeFi projects are based on Ethereum and have witnessed phenomenal growth over the past few months, causing a big rise in the network activity and transitions fees.      One may argue that investors, in search of yield, may be selling call and put options. That seems unlikely, especially in longer dated options, given the cryptocurrency’s one-month implied volatility is hovering well below its lifetime average of 71%. The metric fell to a multi-year low of 46% on July 3 and has remained largely sidelined ever since according to data source Skew.      Read More: DeFi Hype Has Sent Ethereum Fees Soaring to 2-Year High: Coin Metrics      Volatility has a positive impact on options’s price and is mean reverting. In other words, there is a good chance of seeing volatility rising in the near term and making options costlier than what they are right now.      As such, seasoned traders prefer to be option buyers when volatility is low and write options when they think volatility has peaked.      That said, the possibility of traders having sold July expiry options cannot be ruled out, given the cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last two months trading the narrow range of $225 to $250.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/22/open-interest-in-ether-options-jumps-to-new-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49ed9a6ae4c138bf0205d9715925ede595b1e086-1581x557.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432404,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCG9h,1595440033,Crypto Needn't Fear GPT-3. It Should Embrace It,"Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University.      During the last few days, there has been an explosion of commentary in the crypto community about OpenAI’s new GPT-3 language generator model. Some of the comments express useful curiosity about GPT-3, while others are a bit to the extreme, asserting that the crypto community should be terrified about it.      The interest is somewhat surprising because the GPT models are not exactly new and they have been making headlines in the machine learning community for over a year now. The research behind the first GPT model was published in June 2018, followed by GPT-2 in February 2019 and most recently GPT-3 two months ago.      See also: What Is GPT-3 and Should We Be Terrified?      I think it is unlikely that GPT-3 by itself can have a major impact in the crypto ecosystem. However, the techniques behind GPT-3 represent the biggest advancement in deep learning in the last few years and, consequently, can become incredibly relevant to the analysis of crypto-assets. In this article, I would like to take a few minutes to dive into some of the concepts behind GPT-3 and contextualize it to the crypto world.    What is GPT-3?    GPT-3 is a massively large natural language understanding (NLU) model that uses an astonishing 175 billion parameters to master several language tasks. The size makes GPT-3 the largest NLU model in the world, surpassing Microsoft’s Turing-NLG and its predecessor GPT-2.      GPT-3 is able to perform several language tasks such as machine translation, question answering, language analysis and, of course, text generation. GPT-3 has captured the attention of the media for its ability to generate fake text that is indistinguishable from real.      How is this relevant for crypto? Imagine having the ability to regularly generate fake press releases that move the price of the smaller crypto assets? Sounds like a scary threat, but it is not the most important part of GPT-3.      GPT-3 is a language-based model and, consequently, operates using textual datasets. From the crypto market standpoint, that capability is cool but certainly not that interesting. What we should really be paying attention to are the techniques behind GPT3.    The magic behind GPT-3    GPT-3 is based on a new deep learning architecture known as transformers. The concept of transformers was originally outlined in the paper ""Attention is all you need,"" published in 2017 by members of the Google Brain team.      The main innovation of the transformer architecture is the concept of “attention” (hence the title of the paper). Attention is typically used in a type of problem known as Seq2Seq, in which a model processes a sequence of items (words, letters, numbers) and outputs a different sequence. This type of problem is incredibly common in language intelligence scenarios such as text generation, machine translation, question answering and so on.      Every time you see a Seq2Seq scenario, you should associate it with what’s called encoder-decoder architectures. Encoders capture the context of the input sequence and pass it to the decoder, which produces the output sequence. Attention mechanisms address the limitations of traditional neural network architectures by identifying the key aspects of the input that should be “paid attention to.”    Traditional deep learning architectures need constant feedback between encoders and decoders, which makes them highly inefficient.    Think about a machine translation scenario from Spanish to English. Typically, the decoder will translate the Spanish text input into an intermediate representation known as the “imaginary language” that will be used by the decoder to translate it into English. More traditional deep learning architectures need constant feedback between encoders and decoders, which makes them highly inefficient.      Conceptually, attention-mechanisms look at an input sequence and decide at each step what other parts of the sequence are important. For instance, in a machine translation scenario, the attention mechanism would highlight words the decoder “should pay attention to” to perform the translation.      The transformer architecture that powered models like GPT-3 is a traditional encoder-decoder architecture that inserts attention blocks to improve efficiency. The role of that block is to look at the entire input and current outputs and infer dependencies that will help to optimize the production of the final output.      The transformer architecture has produced models that can be trained in massively large datasets and can be parallelized efficiently. Not surprisingly, after the original Google paper, there has been a race to build super large models that master different language tasks. Google’s BERT, Facebook’s RoBERTa, Microsoft’s Turing-NLG and OpenAI GPT-3 are newer examples of these models.      GPT-2 astonished the world by operating using 1.5 billion parameters. That record was smashed by Microsoft’s Turing-NLG, which used 17 billion parameters, only for GPT-3 to use a ridiculous 175 billion parameters. All that happened in a year. Plain and simple: when it comes to transformers, bigger is better.      See also: Ben Goertzel - AI for Everyone: Super-Smart Systems That Reward Data Creators      The first generation of transformer architectures has focused on language tasks. But, companies like Facebook and OpenAI have published recent research adapting transformer models to image classification. You might think that this is just an attempt to generate fake images. But the impact goes way beyond that.      Fake image generation is super important to streamline the training of image classification models in the absence of large labeled datasets. There have been attempts to adapt transformers to financial time series datasets, with the hope they can advance quantitative trading strategies.    Transformers and crypto assets    Now that we have some context related to transformers and GPT-3, we can revisit the original question. Is GPT-3 really scary for crypto assets?      Sure, the prospect of models that can generate fake news that move crypto markets is nothing to joke about. But I think that, in its current form, GPT-3 does not represent a threat for the crypto space. What is more interesting is the impact that transformer architectures can have in the next generation of crypto intelligence solutions. Here are a few real scenarios to consider:      Trading strategies. Obviously, if transformers are proven to be applicable to financial datasets, they can have a major impact in quant strategies for crypto assets. Deep neural networks in general are opening new frontiers in quantitative trading. From basic machine learning models like linear regression or decision trees, quant funds are now looking at sophisticated deep learning strategies.      Being natively digital, crypto is the perfect asset class for quant strategies. Techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in the quant space and seem to work well in crypto. Just like in language analysis, transformers could have an edge over CNNs and RNNs, specifically when comes to focus “attention” in several segments of a dataset (for example, during the March 2020 bitcoin crash) and also operate with massively large volumes of records (e.g. blockchain transactions).    More interesting is the impact that transformer architectures can have in the next generation of crypto intelligence solutions.    Blockchain analysis. Transformers can be adapted to detect patterns in blockchains in more computationally efficient ways than current methods. Part of the magic of transformers is their ability to “focus attention” on specific parts of an input dataset and infer potential outputs. Imagine a scenario in which we are analyzing bitcoin mining transactions or flows to exchanges and try to extrapolate patterns in order book activity. Transformers seem particularly well equipped to attack this task.      Decentralized transformers. There are ongoing efforts to adapt transformer models to decentralized AI architectures like SingularityNet. This type of use case could expand the use of transformers to scenarios we haven’t imagined yet. Until now, transformer models such as GPT-3 has been the privilege of large corporate AI labs that have the data and resources to build and operate such massive neural networks. Decentralized AI offers an alternative, in which the training, execution and monitoring of transformers can occur in decentralized networks that operate based on incentive mechanisms.      Just like other neural network architectures have been able to operate in decentralized infrastructures, it is not crazy to think that soon we will see models like GPT-3 running in decentralized AI platforms like SingularityNet or the Ocean Protocol.      GPT-3 and the transformer architecture represent a major breakthrough in the history of deep learning. In the next few years, we are likely to see transformers influence every major area of deep learning, and the influence is likely to expand into financial markets. Crypto should be a beneficiary of these breakthroughs.      Yes, GPT-3 is impressive, but there is no reason to be terrified. Quite the opposite, we should do the work to adapt these major AI achievements and make crypto the most intelligent asset class in history.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/22/crypto-neednt-fear-gpt-3-it-should-embrace-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a74014869bd9eaf24d4510c48a732f386d7e360c-2400x1602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCGDh,1595437204,"Banks in US Can Now Offer Crypto Custody Services, Regulator Says","The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is letting all nationally chartered banks in the U.S. provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.      In a public letter dated July 22, Senior Deputy Comptroller and Senior Counsel Jonathan Gould wrote that any national bank can hold onto the unique cryptographic keys for a cryptocurrency wallet, clearing the way for national banks to hold digital assets for their clients.      The letter marks a major development for the crypto industry. Previously, custody was the province of specialist firms, such as Coinbase, which typically needed a state license, such as a trust charter, to offer the service to large investors. Now, large, regulated financial companies that already provide similar safekeeping services for stock certificates and the like could enter the fray.      The letter, which appears to be addressed to an unidentified bank or similar entity, notes that banks ""may offer more secure storage services compared to existing options,"" and that both consumers and investment advisors may wish to use regulated custodians to ensure they don't lose their private keys, and therefore, access to their funds.      ""Providing custody for cryptocurrencies would differ in several respects from other custody activities,"" the letter said.      It pointed to the need for digital wallets, adding that because they exist on a blockchain, there is no physical possession for cryptos.      ""The OCC recognizes that, as the financial markets become increasingly technological, there will likely be increasing need for banks and other service providers to leverage new technology and innovative ways to provide traditional services on behalf of customers,"" the letter said.      Banks can provide both fiduciary and non-fiduciary custodian services, the letter said.      It also specified that banks entering the space ""should develop and implement those activities consistent with sound risk management practices and align them with the bank's overall business plans and strategies.""      The OCC is currently headed up by Brian Brooks, a former Coinbase exec who joined the regulator earlier this year. He's filled in as Acting Comptroller since the beginning of the summer, and has already proposed a number of reforms that would benefit crypto companies, including a national payments charter which would let crypto startups bypass the state-by-state approach in terms of acquiring money transmission licenses if they provide payment services.      Wednesday's letter also ""reaffirms the OCC's position that national banks may provide permissible banking services to any lawful business they choose, including cryptocurrency businesses, so long as they effectively manage the risks and comply with applicable law.""      JPMorgan Chase is one such national bank that provides banking services to crypto companies, having provided support to Gemini and Coinbase earlier this year.

42432414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCGRh,1595435553,"Blockchain Bites: Coinsquare Conclusion, Ethereum Fees and a GPT-3 Poet","Australian blockchain startups are taking tech giants to court for banning crypto advertisements during the ICO boom, Coinsquare executives have settled over accusations of wash trading and South Korea is mulling increased taxes on crypto profits.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    'Be Thankful I Don't Take It All' The South Korean government has proposed a 22% tax – including the 2% local income tax – on crypto trading profits. The Ministry of Economy and Finance tabled a proposal Wednesday to introduce the measure for gains above 2.5 million KRW (~$2,000). If approved by Korea's National Assembly, the tax rule will come into force in October 2021, and will also apply to non-residents and foreign companies who trade on Korean exchanges. Separately, Russian officials have updated a draft bill that would redefine crypto as a taxable property, though not as a means of payment. Previously, the country’s lawmakers introduced a version of the law that would make any business issuing or trading crypto using Russia-based infrastructure illegal.      Crypto Class Action Australian crypto startups have banded together in a class action against Google, Twitter and Facebook related to the banning of crypto advertising in 2018. The business owners claim they were harmed by the bans – meant to minimize harm to potential investors in initial coin offering (ICO) scams, but which may have overreached into legitimate businesses – and seek damages amounting to A$872 million (US$600 million). That amount could rise to A$300 billion in total as more litigants join the class action, according to the Daily Mail Australia.      Strengthening Rights The Supreme People’s Court of China has said the country’s legal system should strengthen protections around digital currency ownership rights. Published Wednesday, a new guideline from the court, under the section ""Strengthening judicial protection for property and equity rights,"" specifies that the legal system should enhance protections over new types of ownership rights such as digital currencies, online virtual assets and data. Previously there have been legal decisions made by provincial and municipal courts in China in which digital currencies like bitcoin were treated as virtual properties.      Wash Trade Settlement Coinsquare will settle with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) over allegations executives had employees fake trades to inflate the platform’s volumes. As part of the settlement agreement reached Tuesday, Coinsquare admitted that around 840,000 illicit wash trades were conducted on the platform, amounting to a total value of around 590,000 bitcoin (BTC) (worth almost $5.5 billion at press time). Senior executives have also agreed to resign, with CEO Cole Diamond to pay a $1 million penalty and founder Virgile Rostand $900,000.      Watching the Watchdog SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on Tuesday criticized the watchdog’s decision to penalize Telegram’s $1.2 billion ICO. Speaking to the Blockchain Association Singapore, ""Crypto Mom” Pierce said the SEC fundamentally erred in prosecuting and punishing Telegram's Gram token sale, saying the decision to sell Grams under a ""Simple Agreement for Future Tokens"" offering structure should have protected the project from securities violations. Peirce again called for a ""safe harbor"" that would give certain token projects three years to experiment while regulators retooled their frameworks for what is and is not an investment contract.    Quick bites  Grayscale is closer to listing Bitcoin cash and Litecoin trusts for OTC traders  BlockFi, a crypto-backed lender, is eyeing a $50 million Series C (The Block)  Robinhood is abandoning plans of a U.K. launch  BitMEX is supporting a Bitcoin Lightning dev  The big idea    CoinDesk spoke with Gwern, the pseudonymous tech researcher, about his ongoing experiments with the most powerful AI language model to date.      OpenAI’s GPT-3 has “read” nearly every word published online, and now has the ability to complete human prompts. The tool can write media articles, business prospectuses and – as Gwern has discovered – poetry.    Human: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.AI: Countless their wheat-stacks tall and trains which roar across it by night, All these must fall like Gabriel’s hair, Which was all gold before it withered.    As others have noted, the model can’t think on its own and has clear limitations in always writing what its users want it to. To this end, Gwern found that the biggest hurdle is in coming up with the right prompt.      “I think it is partially a matter of intelligence and the technology, yes. I should be able to write out clear descriptions and provide a few examples, which would be enough for a human to infer my intent, but right now it's still quite chancy for GPT-3 to pick good completions,” he said over a direct message.      Considering this, CoinDesk asked whether the final result of running a situation feels like his own work of art.      “[W]hen I nail a prompt, what I tend to feel is more that I've created a new genre,” he said. “[I]n the way that JRR Tolkien might feel that he was the author of 'fantasy' even if he didn't feel otherwise like the author of any specific fantasy book, if you follow me. [O]ther people take the idea and run with it. [Y]ou feel proud of how your idea goes on without you.”      Still, after a month of experimentation, Gwern has found the novelty has worn off. “[I]f I'm going to spend half an hour on something, it'd better be testing something interesting on GPT-3.”      That’s a fine position to take while the program is still in a private beta. It might be a different story when it’s released to the world.    Market intel    Users Up, Transactions Down? Despite recent price doldrums, the Bitcoin network has as many users since the cryptocurrency topped $20,000 in 2017, according to an on-chain metric. The seven-day moving average of Bitcoin's ""active entities"" rose to 305,355 on Tuesday to hit the highest level since Dec. 23, 2017, according to Glassnode, which defines active entities as a ""cluster of addresses controlled by the same network entity."" This would include both businesses like exchanges and custodians and individuals. However, the seven-day moving average of bitcoin’s transaction count has increased 23% over the past four months, but is still well below the 2020 high registered on March 5.      Open Interest Open interest for bitcoin futures on BitMEX – the largest derivatives exchange by open interest – passed $1 billion Tuesday morning for the first time since the cryptocurrency market crash in March, a sign of life in a very quiet market. Before the March crash, open interest for bitcoin futures on BitMEX was about $1.2 billion. Further, open interest for bitcoin futures across all cryptocurrency exchanges broke above $4 billion for the first time since March, according to data from Skew.      Broken Record Decentralized exchange volumes have already topped $1.6 billion, as of Tuesday, breaking the previous all-time high set in June, according to Dune Analytics data. Four platforms – Uniswap, Curve, Balancer and Bancor Network – have already surpassed their June volumes. “For investors racing to get exposure to the newest decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, decentralized exchanges are the earliest and often only place to make those initial investments,” said Joseph Todaro, managing partner at Blocktown Capital.    Tech pod    Hype & High Fees Ethereum fees are at a two-year high as the hype around DeFi yield farming leads to a surge in network activity, according to research firm Coin Metrics. Coin Metrics' data shows median transaction fees, which increase in step with network activity, were around $0.50 yesterday – the highest since August 2018. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi projects recently passed the $3 billion mark, according to DeFi Pulse, having only crossed the billion-dollar milestone in February. Digital Assets Data analyst Connor Abendschein attributes ""massive increase"" in ERC-20-standard stablecoins as a contributing factor.    Ethereum at Five    The World Computer at a Crossroads Five years ago, an unlikely project went live. It called itself “the world computer” and it promised to transform not just cryptocurrencies as we knew it, but the very idea of what could be done with cryptography and consensus. Ethereum had arrived.      From its technical aspirations to unicorns and memes, Ethereum is a culture on its own. It has spawned blockchain uses — from digital cats to yield farming — previously unimagined.      Ethereum is at a crossroads. But it must complete an ambitious and fraught retooling of its foundations — the long awaited move to Ethereum 2.0 — to keep up with the market’s demands.      CoinDesk is marking the milestone with Ethereum at Five: a cross-platform series comprising a series of special coverage, a pop-up newsletter and live-streamed discussions. New issues and sessions launch daily from July 27-31. Register for CoinDesk Live and our pop-up newsletter.

42432413,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCGNh,1595432762,How Uniswap Became King of DEXs,"Haseeb Qureshi is a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, a cross-border crypto venture fund. A longer version of this post is here.      Imagine a college friend reached out to you and said, “Hey, I have a business idea. I’m going to run a market making bot. I’ll always quote a price no matter who’s asking, and for my pricing algorithm I’ll use x * y = k. That’s pretty much it. Want to invest?”      You’d run away.      See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Well, turns out your friend just described Uniswap. Uniswap is the world’s simplest automated market maker (AMM). Seemingly from nowhere, it has exploded in volume in the last year, crowning itself the world’s largest “DEX” by volume.      Since Uniswap’s rise, there has been an explosion of innovation in AMMs. A legion of Uniswap descendants have emerged, each with its own specialized features.      Though they all inherited the core design of Uniswap, they each come with their own specialized pricing function. Take Curve, which uses a mixture of constant product and constant sum, or Balancer, whose multi-asset pricing function is defined by a multi-dimensional surface. There are even shifted curves that can run out of inventory, like the ones Foundation uses to sell limited edition goods.      Seeing the growth in AMM volume, it’s tempting to assume that AMMs are going to eat all on-chain volume on DeFi – that they were predetermined to win. But I don’t think this was predetermined at all. In fact, there are several very specific, incidental reasons why AMMs have proven so successful.      Remember, long before we had Uniswap, we had tons of DEXs! Uniswap has decimated order book-based DEXs like IDEX or 0x. Why?    From order books to AMMs    I believe there are four reasons why Uniswap beat out order book exchanges.      First, Uniswap is extremely simple to implement. This means there is low complexity, low surface area for hacks and low integration costs. Not to mention, it has low gas costs! This really matters when you’re implementing all your trades on top of the equivalent of a decentralized graphing calculator.      This is not a small point. Once next-generation, high-throughput blockchains arrive, I suspect the order book model will eventually dominate, as it does in the normal financial world. But will it be dominant on Ethereum 1.0?      The extraordinary constraints of Ethereum 1.0 select for simplicity. When you can’t do complex things, you have to do the best simple thing. Uniswap is a pretty good simple thing.      Second, Uniswap has a very small regulatory surface. (This is the same reason why Bram Cohen believes Bittorrent succeeded.) Uniswap is trivially decentralized and requires no off-chain inputs. Compared to order book DEXs that have to tiptoe around the perception of operating an exchange, Uniswap is free to innovate as a pure financial utility.      See also: Haseeb Qureshi - The DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack That Changed Everything      Third, it’s extremely easy to provide liquidity to Uniswap. The one-click “set it and forget it” LP experience is a lot easier than getting active market makers to provide liquidity on an order book exchange, especially before DeFi attracts serious volume.      This is critical, because much of the liquidity on Uniswap is provided by a small set of beneficent whales. These whales are not as sensitive to returns, so the one-click experience on Uniswap makes it painless for them to participate. Crypto designers have a bad habit of ignoring mental transaction costs and assuming market participants are infinitely diligent. Uniswap made liquidity provision dead simple, and that has paid off.      The last reason why Uniswap has been so successful is the ease of creating incentivized pools. In an incentivized pool, the creator of a pool airdrops tokens onto liquidity providers, juicing their LP returns above the standard Uniswap returns. This phenomenon has also been termed “liquidity farming.” Some of Uniswap’s highest volume pools have been incentivized via airdrops, including AMPL, sETH, and JRT. For Balancer and Curve, all of their pools are currently incentivized with their own native token.      Recall that one of the three ways that traditional market makers make money is through designated market making agreements, paid by the asset issuer. In a sense, an incentivized pool is a designated market maker agreement, translated for DeFi: an asset issuer pays an AMM to provide liquidity for their pair, with the payment delivered via token airdrop.    In 2025, I don’t expect AMMs the way they look today to be the dominant way people trade anymore. In the history of technology, transitions like this are common.    But there’s an additional dimension to incentivized pools. They have allowed AMMs to serve as more than mere market makers: they now double as marketing and distribution tools for token projects. Via incentivized pools, AMMs create a sybil-resistant way to distribute tokens to speculators who want to accumulate the token, while simultaneously bootstrapping a liquid initial market. It also gives purchasers something to do with the token – don’t just turn it around and sell it, deposit it and get some yield! You could call this poor man’s staking. It’s a powerful marketing flywheel for an early token project, and I expect this to become integrated into the token go-to-market playbook.      These factors go a long way toward explaining why Uniswap has been so successful. (I haven’t touched on “Initial DeFi Offerings,” but that’s a topic for another day.)      That said, I don’t believe Uniswap’s success will last forever. If the constraints of Ethereum 1.0 created the conditions for AMMs to dominate, then Ethereum 2.0 and layer 2 systems will enable more complex markets to flourish. Furthermore, DeFi’s star has been rising, and as mass users and volumes arrive, they will attract serious market makers. Over time, I expect this to cause Uniswap’s market share to contract.      Five years from now, what role will AMMs play in DeFi?      In 2025, I don’t expect AMMs the way they look today to be the dominant way people trade anymore. In the history of technology, transitions like this are common.      In the early days of the Internet, web portals like Yahoo were the first affordance to take off on the Web. The constrained environment of the early Web was perfectly suited to being organized by hand-crafted directories. These portals grew like crazy as mainstream users started coming online! But we now know portals were a temporary stepping stone on the path to organizing the Internet’s information.      What are AMMs a stepping stone to? Will something replace it, or will AMMs evolve alongside DeFi? I’ll try to answer this question in a future post.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | MINING | UNI | AIRDROP,Haseeb Qureshi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/22/how-uniswap-became-king-of-dexs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c0b9f42e8f24e94e950b350d1c14f7e95490531-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Security intelligence firm Cisco Talos, part of U.S. tech giant Cisco Systems, said it discovered a botnet – a network of internet-connected devices – that had been active for months, in its report Wednesday.  Dubbed ""Prometei,"" the botnet can disable security controls, copy across important files, and masquerade as other programs to set up covert mining operations in computer systems.  It also constantly reinvents its tools in order to avoid detection.  Since starting operation in early March, researchers estimate it has infected anywhere between 1,000 and 5,000 systems.  Prometei may have earned its owner approximately $5,000 worth of monero – around $1,250 per month, the report reads.  Cisco Talos doesn't know the identity of the hacker, but it is likely to be a single professional developer based somewhere in Eastern Europe.  It also found the botnet had also stolen credentials, such as administrator passwords, possibly to sell on the black market.  Monero is the cryptocurrency of choice for these attack vectors as it can be mined easily with general-purpose CPUs and can be traded with little risk of detection.

In an announcement on its website, the bank said it would release 24,000 digital tokens that commemorate the signing of the nation's Act of Reinstating Independence in 1918.  The launch of LBcoin comes after about two years of blockchain experiments by the Lithuanian central bank. LBcoins, while exchangeable for legal tender, currently seem too advanced for people to actually use.  According to the bank, the tokens will be divided into six categories, with 4,000 digital tokens issued in each.

42432406,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCG7h,1595427036,"Cryptopia Creditor Issues Legal Notice to Liquidator Over Alleged Failures, Fees","A creditor of hacked New Zealand exchange Cryptopia has sent a legal notice to the firm's liquidators over alleged failures to address its claim.    Blockchain machine learning startup GNY claims in a press release Tuesday that accounting firm Grant Thornton New Zealand has failed to accept or reject its creditor claim, has failed to fully make its claim clear in court or reports and has also failed to investigate the cause of the Cryptopia hack in January 2019.  Also at issue are the fees Grant Thornton is taking from the remaining exchange reserves.  GNY says the liquidator has not adequately explained what work it has carried out to warrant NZ$955,618 (US$636,945) in fees.  The startup said it complied with the liquidator’s requests for documentation and further information throughout 2019.  GNY claims to have lost 15 million LML tokens in the hack. It also said the exchange breach caused the value of the token on the market to plummet 95%.  As such, GNY says is owed more than NZ$27 million (US$17.9 million).  In May 2020, GNY sought confirmation of its creditor claim, hoping to recover some of the stolen tokens.  Yet, nine months after the liquidators had sought additional documentation and information, a response was received from Grant Thornton the firm claimed was brief and didn't ""adequately address"" its concerns and queries.  GNY's legal representative has now issued a ""failure to comply"" notice on July 21 to the liquidators under sections 285 and 286 of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993.  Citing the extreme complexity of the liquidation, Grant Thornton New Zealand told CoinDesk: ""We understand that this is a difficult time for creditors. However, the allegations made by this creditor have no merit and we fully deny them.""  In April, Cryptopia creditors won a small victory when it was ruled users of the exchange were entitled to assets, which are classed as property, that they held in Cryptopia accounts at the time of the hack.  The alternative ruling would have seen the assets classed as normal debt to be distributed among both users and creditors.  The funds were valued at over $100 million.

He has also established a new research organization, Judica, that plans to develop and release new software tools for Bitcoin.

42432420,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCGTh,1595419621,First Mover: This DeFi-Ready Token Is Teaching Crypto Traders to Cherish Inflation,"One of the things crypto traders like about bitcoin is that it’s resistant to inflation, potentially serving as a hedge against the trillions of dollars of money that central banks have printed this year to address the coronavirus-inflicted economic collapse.      But what if a cryptocurrency were designed to produce its own inflation – as a good thing?      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      That’s the principle behind the cryptocurrency project Ampleforth’s AMPL tokens, which are suddenly getting a fresh look from traders after a tenfold increase in their total supply over the past three weeks to 340 million.      Though the project’s market capitalization of $398 million is still tiny in relative terms, at just 0.23% of bitcoin’s $170 billion, some analysts say AMPL could see further uptake as a new form of liquidity in the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi.      In fact, demand for the token has been so hot that its current price of about $2.77 is nearly three times the project’s own target of $1.009. The impetus appears to have been Ampleforth’s launch last month of Geyser, a new rewards program that encourages the token’s use on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange.      The token “has been on an absolute tear,” Paul Burlage, an analyst with the cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, wrote in a July 9 report.      Two years ago, a San Francisco-based engineer and robotics researcher named Evan Kuo, alongside co-founder Brandon Iles and their team, decided to tackle a problem in digital-asset markets: tight correlations between bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies that make the market vulnerable to widespread sell-offs – as traders scramble for cash or cash-like instruments such as dollar-backed stablecoins.      The dynamic poses risks for DeFi, where the cryptocurrencies are often pledged as collateral on semi-autonomous lending and borrowing platforms.  “The high correlations prevalent in today's cryptocurrencies create systemic risk,” Kuo told First Mover in a Telegram chat.      So in December 2018, the team launched Ampleforth protocol with $3 million in funding from the likes of Brian Armstrong, CEO of the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase; Pantera Capital, a cryptocurrency investment fund; and True Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm.      The project aims to address the systemic risk by designing a token to be mostly uncorrelated with other cryptocurrencies, and also isolated from swings in traditional financial markets.      The secret to the design is a combination of intentional inflation and anti-dilution: When prices for the AMPL token rise above a target, more units are issued directly to holders’ wallets in proportion to their holdings. Theoretically, the extra supply creates inflation that should help to push prices back down, but traders are made whole because they suddenly have more of the tokens.      The mechanism is supposed to limit price volatility, potentially making AMPL tokens more desirable as a stable form of collateral for DeFi systems.      ""AMPL's differentiated movement pattern reduces the risk of autoliquidation in the DeFi space,"" Kuo said.      According to the project’s website, traders can use the tokens to diversify investment portfolios, park as collateral in DeFi or even hold as a “better bitcoin.”    How AMPL works    Ampleforth has set a target price for AMPL based on the value of the U.S. dollar in 2019. And that target price is adjusted continuously based on the consumer price index, which offers a rough way of gauging monthly decreases in the dollar’s purchasing power.      But during times of heavy demand for the tokens, the market price can diverge from the target price. And that appears to be happening now, as traders deploy the AMPL tokens in fast-growing DeFi platforms.      On June 23, AMPL “traded above its price threshold of $1.06 and never looked back,” according to Delphi Digital’s Burlage.      For example, on July 19, the token was trading at $2.95, nearly three times the target price. Under the rules of the protocol, the supply automatically increased by 16% at the end of the 24-hour period, according to Ampleforth’s dashboard.      The extra supply represents inflation that should theoretically reduce the value of each AMPL token. But since the extra supply goes into holders’ wallets, the overall value of their holdings should theoretically stay the same. Inflation, coupled with anti-dilution, as designed.      Burlage wrote that there are strong incentives built into the system encouraging traders to hold onto their AMPL tokens. But the market could turn, since it’s prone to a “cyclical boom and bust cycle.”      “With the price running up, it is now a game of chicken between large holders to see who sells first and time the top,” Burlage wrote.      It might be the future of money, but as is often the case in cryptocurrency markets, speculation and experimentation are the right-now.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,361 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,445 | 24-Hr Low: $9,304      Trend: Bitcoin is struggling to extend Tuesday's 2.5% price gain.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,360, representing a 0.4% decline on the day.      The immediate bias remains neutral as the cryptocurrency remains trapped in tight range, as represented by Bollinger volatility bands, currently located at $9,424 and $9,037.      A move above the upper band would imply range breakout and could power the cryptocurrency higher to resistance at $9,800 (June 22 high) and possibly to the psychological hurdle of $10,000. Alternatively, a range breakdown would expose the 200-day moving average at $8,560.      A range breakdown may be seen if the global equities suffer sharp losses on the escalating China-U.S. tensions and the U.S. Congress' inability to reach consensus on an additional coronavirus relief package. The cryptocurrency has recently developed a relatively strong correlation with the equity markets.      At press time, futures tied to the S&P 500 and major European indices are reporting moderate losses. Risk sentiment weakened early Wednesday after Washington ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, marking an unprecedented escalation of tensions with the Asian nation.

The seven-day moving average of Bitcoin's ""active entities"" rose to 305,355 on Tuesday to hit the highest level since Dec. 23, 2017, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The previous 1.5-year high of 301,870 was reached on May 12.  The average has risen by 14% this month.  Glassnode defines active entities as a ""cluster of addresses controlled by the same network entity."" This would include both businesses like exchanges and custodians and individuals.  The rise suggests that the number of users of the network is the highest since the cryptocurrency topped out at $20,000 in December 2017.  Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, told CoinDesk the climbing metric is the result of the DeFi frenzy spilling over onto bitcoin.  The surge in active entities also suggests users are anticipating an uptick in bitcoin’s price volatility, he added.  While user numbers may be up, bitcoin's network activity is not at similar highs.  The seven-day moving average of bitcoin’s transaction count has increased by 23% over the past four months, but is well below the 2020 high registered on March 5.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance tabled a proposal Wednesday to introduce a 22% tax – including the 2% local income tax – on crypto trading profits above 2.5 million KRW (~$2,000).  If approved by Korea's National Assembly, the tax rule will come into force in October 2021.  The new tax rule will also apply to non-residents and foreign companies who trade on Korean exchanges.  The news was originally reported by CoinDesk Korea.  Traders will be obliged to keep accurate records of their crypto activity and file with the National Tax Service at the end of the tax year on May 31.  Profits will be based on the difference in the asset's won price at the time of acquisition and time of sale – if the trader doesn't know the acquisition price, it will be assumed to be 0 won.  The government says the new tax rule is needed as many other countries have also introduced their own regimes for cryptocurrencies.

According to a Sunday report from Daily Mail Australia, Australian crypto business owners, represented by Sydney-based law firm JPB Liberty, allege they were harmed by the banning of their advertisements and are seeking damages amounting to A$872 million (US$600 million).  That amount could rise to A$300 billion in total as more litigants join the class action, according to the report.  The ad bans were aimed to minimize harm to potential investors in initial coin offering (ICO) scams, but allegedly also had a sweeping effect on legitimate crypto businesses also.  Facebook, Twitter and Google all took action throughout 2018, including the bans in their terms of service.  A ""no-win no-fee"" case has been put before a senior barrister who will review the circumstances surrounding the case before it will move forward.  JPB Liberty is seeking to raise funding for the case from venture capitalists, litigation funders and investors, with claimants to receive 70% of any settlement and funders a 30% cut.  In May 2019, Facebook softened its crypto ban by allowing ads involving blockchain, industry news, educational content or events related to cryptocurrency to no longer require prior written approval.  Google came around a little sooner, reversing parts of its ban in October 2018 and allowing regulated exchanges to purchase advertising from the tech giant in the U.S. and Japan.

As part of the settlement agreement reached Tuesday, Coinsquare admitted that around 840,000 illicit wash trades were conducted on the platform, amounting to a total value of around 590,000 bitcoin (worth almost $5.5 billion at press time).  The agreement also states that CEO Cole Diamond, founder Virgile Rostand and executive Felix Mazer knowingly “authorized, permitted or acquiesced” Coinsquare staff to carry out the wash trading, made misleading statements and sought retribution against a whistleblower seeking to expose the misconduct.  The senior executives have now agreed to resign, with Diamond to pay a $1 million penalty and Rostand $900,000.  The agreement acknowledged that Mazer had already voluntarily paid $50,000 to the commission, having acted as the company’s CCO contrary to the public interest.  Jeff Kehoe, director of the enforcement branch of the OSC, said the case was the first time the commission has taken action against the reprisal of a whistleblower since protections were added to the Ontario securities legislation in 2016.  Diamond and Rostand have also been banned from being registrants, officers or directors of companies or ""market participants"" for two to three years. Mazer received a one-year ban.  Coinsquare’s investment dealer subsidiary, Coinsquare Capital Markets Ltd., which was seeking registry approval with the OSC prior to the investigation, has been ordered to put in place major governance improvements, including an internal whistleblower program.

42432387,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDVh,1595407233,DeFi Hype Has Sent Ethereum Fees Soaring to 2-Year High: Coin Metrics,"Ethereum fees are at a two-year high as the hype around decentralized finance (DeFi) leads to a surge in network activity, according to research firm Coin Metrics.    Coin Metrics' data shows median transaction fees were just under $0.50 at press time – the highest since August 2018.  Transaction fees increase alongside activity to avoid congestion in busy times.  Ethereum's median gas price – a component of the transaction fees – has also reached levels not seen since early July 2018, according to Glassnode.  Connor Abendschein, a research analyst at Digital Assets Data, said a ""massive increase"" in ERC-20-standard stablecoins had also contributed to a rise in gas prices.  In a newsletter Tuesday, Coin Metrics analysts argued the spike in transaction fees came from increased network usage related to the DeFi hype around yield farming.  Total value locked in DeFi projects recently passed the $3 billion mark, according to DeFi Pulse, having only crossed the billion-dollar milestone in February.  Ether transferred via smart contracts – a telltale sign of a DeFi transaction – was up to a near all-time high of one million ETH ($242.5 million) a day, Coin Metrics said.  The number of active ether addresses hit a two-year high a few weeks ago, but fell again as high fees pushed users off Ethereum, Coin Metrics said.  Richard Rosenblum, a co-founder of digital assets firm GSR, told CoinDesk the gas price spike was part of a wider scalability problem for Ethereum.

42432381,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCDPh,1595406013,China's Supreme Court Calls for Better Protection of Digital Currency Rights,"The Supreme People's Court of China has said the country's legal system should strengthen protections around digital currency ownership rights.    Published Wednesday, a new guideline from the court, under the section ""Strengthening judicial protection for property and equity rights,"" specifies that the legal system should enhance protections over new types of ownership rights such as digital currencies, online virtual assets and data.  While the court did not elaborate on details or provide a definition of ""digital currencies,"" the guideline comes at a time when there are rising numbers of legal disputes in China over the ownership of digital assets, including major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Previously, there have been legal decisions made by provincial and municipal courts in China in which digital currencies like bitcoin were treated as virtual properties.  Until now, the country's top judicial body has apparently not addressed the issue, however.  The guideline was published by the Supreme People's Court, together with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).  The NDRC is China's top economic planning agency and is one of the 26 cabinet-level ministries that make up the central government, namely, the State Council.  The opinion was issued in response to earlier guidelines put out by the State Council in May calling for an acceleration of improvements to China's socialist market economy.  The court's guidance represents the legal system's highest-level opinion regarding judicial services and protections.
