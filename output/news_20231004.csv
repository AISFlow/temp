After a long stretch of abysmal performance, it looks like crypto investors are finally starting to believe in the market as they begin to pool their buying power to enter back into the market. Crypto Buying Power At 6-Month Highs An interesting development reported by the on-chain data tracker Santiment is the accumulation of Tether’s USDT stablecoin by crypto investors. As Santiment points out, the total amount of USDT being held on exchanges saw a notable uptick recently. Related Reading: Why You Should Pay Attention To The XRP Price Predictions The figure which takes into account the total USDT held across the top exchanges went from only 17.6% of the stablecoin’s circulating supply to a whopping 24.7%. This 7.1% jump represents the growing interest of investors to get back into the market which could be bullish for prices. As always, the large whales led the charge in this accumulation trend. The top 10 largest wallets saw their combined holdings rise from $7.23 billion to more than $9.42 billion in the same timeframe. Stablecoin on exchanges reach 6-month highs | Source: Santiment on X Now, when investors start upping their stablecoin holdings, it signals a readiness to begin buying digital assets once more and also shows the current buying power. As the amount of USDT held on exchanges has crossed over to a 6-month high, it could point toward the start of the largest rally seen in the market in 2023. The accumulation being spread across large and small wallets alike shows that this is not a localized sentiment. Rather, most investors are seeing genuine chances for an upside and are looking to harness some of those gains for themselves. Total market cap drops to $1.06 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com What To Expect After accumulating a large tranche of stablecoins as illustrated in the Santiment report, crypto investors would often wait for a good time to deploy it. This is usually when the market experiences a notable crash, plunging the entire space into the red. At this point, investors would be looking to get back into coins at a time when they look to be on discount. This is often when the market forms support and then prices begin to surge not too long afterward. Related Reading: Brace For Impact As $200 Million In Crypto Is Being Unlocked In October Mainly, these stablecoins will be deployed into the largest digital assets first such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Then once there are enough profits, investors will usually rotate into smaller cap coins, which is why altcoins tend to delay a bit in following Bitcoin’s recovery. Such a scenario will likely see the price of Bitcoin rally toward $29,000 and then bring the crypto market cap above $1.1 trillion once more.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at around $27,700 during U.S. afternoon hours. Earlier this week, BTC briefly rose above $28,000 then pared some of its gains.  Crypto services provider Matrixport’s analysts noted Wednesday that BTC broke out from its downtrend starting in the summer and turned the $27,000 level into support.  The report said BTC’s price could be headed toward $30,000. However, the initial surge on Monday lacked a significant follow-through, as BTC trading volume dropped to $11 billion from $19 billion.  Enigma Securities, an institutional digital asset liquidity and advisory firm, forecasted Wednesday in a report that low volatility on crypto markets will prevail for the next months.  Markets will likely consolidate and chop sideways in October, extending the window for accumulation for long-term investors, Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, noted in a market report.  The broader crypto market-proxy CoinDesk Market Index inched 0.8% higher.  Traditional markets calmed after a turbulent Tuesday session as fresh jobs data pointed to a cooling U.S. labor market.  The ADP reported earlier today that the U.S. economy added 89,000 jobs in September, significantly less than the 153,000 analysts expected and August’s 180,000. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that this was the smallest rise in private sector jobs since 2020.  The S&P 500 index closed the day 0.8% higher, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index posted a 1.45% gain.  Ether (ETH) price underperformed and slid 0.7% as market participants digested the disappointing first days of the first futures-based exchange-traded funds in the U.S. K33 Research advised investors to rotate into BTC, citing the lack of medium-term catalysts for ETH.  Solana’s native token SOL also pared its gains from earlier this week, slumping 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The token is still up over 20% in a week.

18381315,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554128,1696456822,"XRP Derivatives Volume Soars by over 200%, Could This Signal A Price Breakout?","In a remarkable turn of events, XRP derivatives trading volume has experienced an astonishing surge of 204% within a mere 24-hour period. This surge coincides with the recent disclosure by Judge Torres regarding the denial of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) interlocutory appeal against Ripple Labs. Judge’s Ruling Against SEC Boosts XRP Sentiment According to data from Coinglass, a leading cryptocurrency analytics platform, XRP derivatives trading volume has witnessed an unprecedented spike, reflecting a significant increase in market activity. This surge in trading activity suggests a growing interest in XRP among investors eager to capitalize on the recent legal developments surrounding Ripple Labs. Related Reading: Chainlink Creator Expects Mass Crypto Adoption To Send Market Cap To $10 Trillion To provide further context, derivatives trading refers to the buying and selling financial instruments that derive value from an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or cryptocurrency. These instruments, known as derivatives, include futures contracts, options, swaps, and other financial contracts. Derivatives allow investors to speculate on the underlying asset’s price movements without owning it directly. A surge in derivatives trading volume can have significant implications for XRP. Firstly, it indicates higher market participation and interest in the cryptocurrency. When more investors and traders actively engage with XRP through derivatives, it can lead to increased liquidity and price discovery. Derivatives trading can also contribute to increased price volatility in XRP. As traders speculate on the future price of XRP through derivatives contracts, it can amplify price swings. With higher trading volume, there is a larger number of participants taking positions on XRP’s price movement, which can result in more pronounced price fluctuations. Furthermore, a surge in derivatives trading volume can reflect growing market sentiment and investor confidence in XRP. When trading activity increases, it suggests a higher level of interest and engagement from market participants. With XRP currently trading at $0.5347, the cryptocurrency has experienced a notable 4.3% surge in the past 24 hours. The surge in derivatives trading volume further adds to the growing evidence that the token could be on the cusp of a significant breakout if the bullish momentum continues. Poised For Upward Movement? Renowned crypto analyst Dark Defender recently highlighted that XRP has exhibited signs of breaking out from its ongoing consolidation phase given the recent win against the SEC. This occurrence draws parallels to a previous instance on July 13, with the first ruling of Judge Torres, during which the token experienced a remarkable rally of 80%, reaching as high as $0.9343 Drawing insights from this historical precedent, it is plausible to speculate that XRP might be gearing up for another upward movement. Dark Defender emphasizes that traders should keep a close eye on the next Fibonacci level, which is $0.66. Related Reading: Crypto Drug Cartel Ties: On-chain Investigator Drags Ethereum Into The Mess However, XRP must maintain support above $0.50 to attain this level. This support level is of particular significance as XRP remained relatively stagnant around it for most of September. Overall, the recent disclosure by Judge Torres, denying the SEC’s appeal, has provided a significant boost to Ripple Labs and its supporters. Furthermore, the news has instilled renewed optimism within the XRP community, leading many investors to believe that a total victory for Ripple Labs is now within reach, possibly just months away.

18379566,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554096,1696453203,Here’s The Level Bitcoin Must Conquer If Rally Has To Return,"Here’s the level, according to on-chain data, that Bitcoin might have to conquer if the rally has to make a real comeback. Bitcoin Is Currently Near Short-Term Holder Cost Basis In a new post on X, analyst Root shared a chart revealing that the BTC price has recently been retesting the short-term holders’ cost basis or the realized price (STHs). The “realized price” here measures the average price at which Bitcoin investors acquired their coins. When the spot price is trading above this indicator, the holders are in a state of profit right now, while below the metric implies the market is in loss. This realized price is for the entire investor base but can be defined only for specific segments. In the context of the current discussion, the holder group of interest is the “short-term holders” (STHs). The STHs include all investors who purchased their coins less than 155 days ago. Their average cost basis should, thus, lie inside the price range of the past five months. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Continue Its Run? These Factors Could Suggest So Here is a chart that shows how the realized price of the Bitcoin STHs has changed over the past few years: Looks like the spot price of the asset has approached this metric in recent days | Source: @therationalroot on X As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin briefly broke above the STH realized price during the latest rally above the $28,000 level. Still, with the pullback, the cryptocurrency has plunged under the metric again. The STH cost basis has been historically important for the asset, as breaks above the level generally mean bullish winds. At the same time, plunges under have often brought with them bearish momentum. But the significance doesn’t end there: the level has acted as support during rallies and has provided resistance in bearish periods. The explanation behind this curious pattern could lie in investor psychology. While rallies are going on if the BTC spot price drops to the cost basis of the STHs, these investors may tend to believe that the price would once again go up in the future, and so, they might buy more at their cost basis, thinking it to be a profitable buy. This extraordinary buying pressure could be behind the support BTC finds here. Conversely, bear markets put fear in the minds of the STHs, so as soon as they can break even, they quickly sell and exit, thus providing resistance to the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: These Are The Altcoins To Keep An Eye On: Santiment It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will make a break above the STH realized price in the coming days, and if it does, whether the price will be able to stay above it for an extended period, unlike the latest attempt. Bitcoin had been enjoying support at this level during the rally in the first half of the year, so if it can reclaim the line again, it would be an optimistic sign for things to come.

18377835,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554082,1696449604,"Will Bitcoin Price Crash To $10,000? Bloomberg Expert Reveals When","Many analysts have weighed on the potential trajectory of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This time, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone has highlighted the possibility of Bitcoin price declining further and when this could happen. Bitcoin Price Could Decline Further In a tweet on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, McGlone noted that Bitcoin risks declining to $10,000 (which could happen by year-end) as it continues to battle the $30,000 resistance level. This resistance level has long been touted as the key to a sustained breakout in Bitcoin’s price. However, going by the analysis that McGlone shared, the odds seem to be against this happening. Bitcoin has risen significantly in 2023, considering that the crypto asset traded at around $16,000 at the beginning of the year. But, McGlone warned that this may be a “short-covering rally.” As part of this analysis, he noted that liquidity in the Bitcoin ecosystem remained negative heading into the fourth quarter. This ultimately means there is more selling pressure than buying pressure, which could affect Bitcoin’s price. Another factor is the rising interest rates. McGlone noted that Bitcoin gained prominence in a “zero interest-rate world” with greater financial freedom. But now, Bitcoin (alongside other cryptocurrencies) might continue to endure a hangover as “global rates continue to rise.” Global inflation is said to be on the rise, and to curb it, authorities are raising interest rates, which could restrict spending and, by extension, the liquidity that goes into the crypto market. Meanwhile, the analysis noted Bitcoin’s importance in the grand scheme of things. Bloomberg Intelligence drew a correlation between the FED fund futures and Bitcoin’s price. According to projections, Bitcoin needs to decline further before there can be a liquidity reversal in those funds. While the Federal Reserve may not care about Bitcoin, he stated that Bitcoin’s “24/7-traded, leading indicator status could be gaining traction.” BTC could fall to $10,000 | Source: X The Fate Of The Broader Crypto Market In another tweet, McGlone noted that cryptocurrencies “might be leaning into recession.” To drive home this point, he highlighted the relation between the crypto and stock market and stated that the latter could succumb to an “ebbing tide” suppose the stock market were to experience a “typical drawdown” due to a recession. Despite the “broader on-and-of-again fluctuations,” this projection is said to be reflected in the “downward trajectory” of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) and Russell 2000 Index (RTY) from their all-time highs in 2022. Both markets have remained tepid and continue to consolidate as they anticipate a “catalyst” that could spark a price surge. This analysis is similar to that of crypto analyst Nicholas Merten, who, while drawing out the direct relation between both markets, noted that if the stocks of big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft don’t start picking up, there could be a “really big problem” for the crypto market.

Expecting ether to continue underperforming, K33 Research advised to rotate back to bitcoin.  The ether-to-bitcoin (ETH-BTC) price ratio dropped to a fresh 15-month low this week, confounding at least some who expected excitement around the Monday launch of futures-based ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to generate buying interest.  The early returns show fairly sluggish volumes for these new investment vehicles. According to K33 Research, first day trading volumes on the ETH ETFs were just 0.2% of similar futures-based BTC ETF products launched in late 2021.  The ETH-BTC trading pair on key crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase slid firmly below 0.06 this week near its lowest level since July 2022 and erasing what had been a modest rally for the ratio in September, per TradingView data.  Read more: Ether Drops to 14-Month Low Against Bitcoin as Vitalik Buterin, Whales Send $60M ETH to Exchanges  What’s next for BTC versus ETH  “The gravitational pull in crypto for the time being stays in BTC.""  Ether is lower by 2.4% so far in October to $1,640, giving up all its gains and more from a short-lived surge on Monday to near $1,750. Bitcoin, meanwhile, gained 1.4% over the same time frame and is also outperforming ETH on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  “We believe it’s time to pull the breaks on ETH and rotate back into BTC,” Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research said in a Tuesday market report.  Lunde explained that the interest for the newly-listed futures-based ETFs in the U.S. had “strongly” missed his expectations, prompting him to ditch his month-old investment advice to increase ETH exposure compared to BTC to profit from the ETF hype.  “After an underwhelming futures-based ETH ETF launch, continuously poor momentum, and a lack of compelling medium-term narratives in Ethereum, I no longer favor overweight ETH exposure,” he said.  Given the lack of any short-term catalyst, apathy reigns on the cryptocurrency market and prices will likely continue chopping sideways, said Lunde This environment favors bitcoin which has medium-term positive catalysts in the forms of a potential U.S. spot BTC ETF listing and its four-year halving event early next year.  “The gravitational pull in crypto for the time being stays in BTC, with a promising event horizon down the line, still favoring aggressive accumulation,” he said.  Matrixport analysts said in a Wednesday market update that waning activity on Ethereum and its native token’s relapse to being inflationary could weigh further on ETH price. The crypto investment services firm said that Ethereum’s network revenues fell last month to its lowest since December when ETH traded at $1,200, suggesting that the token might be 30%-40% overvalued at current prices of around $1,600-$1,700.  BTC, meanwhile, could be seen as a “safe haven” asset at times of market distress, Matrixport pointed out, supporting its price as macroeconomic headwinds grow.  Listen here: Bitcoin Resilience in the Face of Macro Turmoil  “There’s a strong case to be made for being bullish on bitcoin in the current environment,” Matrixport said in a Wednesday update. “However, it remains challenging to identify the fundamental catalysts that would support Ethereum or other altcoins, despite their upside potential if the bull market returns.”  Enigma Securities, an institutional digital asset liquidity and advisory firm, said in a Wednesday report that ETH currently is “in a rough spot” as ETH-BTC price ratio sunk firmly below the 0.06 level. What comes next for ETH’s price may lie in bitcoin’s performance, the report said.  “We will likely see stabilization and modest recovery in the short term should BTC improve,” Enigma head of research Joe Edwards wrote. “If we do indeed see momentum drop into November and prices in general start trailing downwards, expect to see ETH move outsizedly to the downside as part of that move towards ETH-BTC 0.05.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/04/poor-week-for-ether-prompts-research-firm-to-reverse-outlook-advise-favoring-bitcoin-instead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41dd515e8fae31cfc989b1ea3de4db0cd32d837e-2366x1184.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The days before the company collapsed, it just seemed like a few really busy days of trading,” Aditya Baradwaj, a former Alameda employee, said on CoinDesk TV. “We had no idea that anything was going on until the very last day, and that's when Caroline pulled us aside and told us what had been going on behind closed doors.”  Alameda was a cryptocurrency trading fund set up by Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, and Sam Trabucco. Although Bankman-Fried attempted to put some distance between Alameda and its sister company, cryptocurrency exchange FTX, ultimately, it was revealed that the two were bound at the hip when CoinDesk reported that divisions between the two firms were blurry as a material amount of Alameda's balance sheet comprised of FTX's FTT exchange token.  Ultimately, those revelations resulted in the collapse of both Alameda and FTX along with criminal charges against Bankman-Fried. His trial on fraud and conspiracy charges kicked off Wednesday.  CoinDesk verified that Baradwaj was an employee of Alameda by reviewing payslips he provided.  Baradwaj also said that the internal security practices as well as checks and balances at the trading firm were quite poor, which resulted in a “fat finger” trade in 2021 that caused the price of bitcoin to temporarily dip by up to 87%.  CoinDesk reported at the time, also citing Baradwaj, that a misplaced decimal caused a large trade to go through which sold bitcoin for pennies on the dollar.  ""Alameda's poor security and risk checks stood out, especially when you consider that traditional firms would've had these measures in place,” he said during the interview. “The environment at both Alameda and FTX was one where huge monetary decisions were made with minimal oversight. While there were many issues, we never expected outright illegal activities.""  In Michael Lewis’ ‘Going Infinite,’ the author notes that “FTX had switched off Alameda’s risk limits to make itself more appealing,” later writing that the “losses caused by this unsettling policy were in any case trivial.”",NEGATIVE,FTT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | FTT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/04/alameda-was-business-as-usual-before-collapse-ex-engineer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e606bf82601067c85c534cb24d2285a3c4f34c7-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recent positive developments and partnerships have fueled a recovery in Solana's sentiment and TVL, with a 61% rise in YTD TVL. Institutional interest in Solana is growing, with inflows of $5.1 million last week, making it the ""most loved"" altcoin for 2023. Introduction Solana ( SOL-USD ) has witnessed significant declines in price, user base, and Total Value Locked (TVL) since the 2021 crypto bull run. SOL was notably affected by the FTX (FTT-USD) contagion, given that FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, were known supporters and early investors in SOL. Investors' interest in SOL has been renewed, suggesting a potential path to price recovery. In the current year, SOL has made strides, surging from its low of around $9 last year to its present value of $23. However, SOL's current price remains far from its 2021 all-time high of $259. In the 2021 bull market, SOL was a top performer. SOL's great performance and popularity at the time can be attributed to the NFT hype of 2021 and SOL's lower NFT minting costs compared to Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). The recent price surge in SOL mirrors the broader crypto market's momentum over the past few days. Yet, the crypto investment community remains divided over SOL's prospects following last month's court order that permits FTX to sell off its crypto holdings, including ~$128 million worth of SOL, to pay back its creditors. Some crypto investors anticipate that the FTX sell-off may exert continuous selling pressure on SOL, while others argue that SOL has the resilience to absorb this pressure. In this analysis, I'll move away from the typical sentiment-driven viewpoints often found in the crypto space and instead focus on key year-to-date (YTD) on-chain data to provide a comprehensive assessment of SOL's current position. A Look at Solana's On-Chain Metrics 2023 has been an overall better year for SOL compared to 2022 when it suffered its biggest black swan yet - the FTX contagion. Let's see some SOL metrics, then examine some recent trend reversals. Solana network's user activity has experienced a steep decline for the past two years (since the 2021 crypto bull run). On-chain data shows a general decline in activity on the Solana network, including a decline in active user wallets, amount of value moved on-chain, non-vote transactions, number of new wallet addresses, and TVL. Solana's users or active wallet addresses fell to a two-year low last month. Solana - Non-Vote Transactions (theblock.co) Solana - Number of Active Wallet Addresses (theblock.co) Solana - Value Moved On Chain (theblock.co) Solana TVL (DefiLlama) A blockchain network's activity typically declines in a bear market. Besides Solana, other Layer-1 blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), have also experienced a decline in activity since the crypto market slipped into a bear market in late 2021. The peak crypto market TVL of ~$179 billion recorded on November 9, 2021, has declined by ~78%; currently, the total TVL sits at ~$38 billion. Ethereum and Polygon have both seen ~80% and ~89% decline in TVL, respectively. Beyond the broader market conditions, Solana faced additional challenges due to its association with FTX and the repercussions of the FTX contagion. Solana's TVL, in particular, witnessed a dramatic drop of around 96%, falling from its November 2022 high of ~$10 billion to the current level of ~$335 million. The Trend Reversal So far this year, the tides are turning for Solana sentiment. The coin is in a recovery state, and recent announcements and partnerships have been catalysts for SOL. Solana's TVL hit its YTD high two days ago, sitting at around $338 million. TVL at the beginning of the year was $210 million; compared to the current TVL, SOL has seen a 61% rise in its YTD TVL. Ongoing partnerships are an important factor investors use in gauging a crypto project's prospects. Recent announcements of key partnerships have shaped investor sentiment towards Solana. Early last month, Visa ( V ) announced that it had expanded its USDC stablecoin ( USDC-USD ) pilot to the Solana blockchain. This announcement predictably gave some boost to the Solana ecosystem. Solana 1-Month Social Media Metric (LunarCrush) Per LunaCrush data, the social media mention of Solana jumped by 84% in the past month, since the Visa partnership announcement; social engagements are also up 159%. Another noteworthy partnership that Solana has secured in recent times is the integration of its payment framework Solana Pay with Shopify (ticker). The integration allows millions of merchants on Shopify to utilize Solana Pay for payment processing. Institutional Interest Crypto Assets Inflows (CoinShares) The latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report by CoinShares shows institutional interest in Solana. Following a six-week streak of outflows, digital asset investment products saw inflows of $21 million last week. Among altcoins, Solana saw the highest weekly inflows . Besides Bitcoin's inflow of $20.4 million, other altcoins saw outflows; only Solana saw inflows. SOL's inflows this past week are worth $5.1 million, while Ethereum's outflows were $1.5 million. Ethereum has been on a seven-week outflow streak. As a result of the inflows, Solana has been dubbed the ""most loved"" altcoin for 2023. Risk Now that we've examined Solana's recent resurgence and the positive developments that have fueled its momentum, it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks and challenges ahead. Although I think the worst days are behind for SOL, every cryptocurrency project faces hurdles on its journey, and Solana is no exception. Solana's Network Outages Solana has faced network outages in the past, which have raised concerns in the crypto community. These network outages were mainly due to network congestion, software bugs, or problems with specific validators. This year, there have been fewer network outages compared to the previous year. The last reported outage was in late February, and in Q2, the network achieved a 100% uptime record. While this uninterrupted uptime is positive news, in my view, this might just be a result of lower activity on the Solana network during this period. This raises the possibility that network outage issues could resurface if the network experiences a surge in activity similar to previous peak periods. Takeaway Solana faces both challenges and opportunities as it strives to regain its momentum in the cryptocurrency space, with recent positive developments and institutional interest shaping its path forward. Regarding the FTX selloff, reports reveal that the FTX liquidation of crypto assets, including SOL, will be done in weekly batches and will be handled by an investment adviser Galaxy Digital. Therefore, this will likely have very little impact on SOL's price. I give Solana a hold rating because it is worth a hold for crypto investors who already have the coin in their portfolio. Investors who don't have SOL in their portfolio yet but seek to buy SOL might consider monitoring the markets, as they could see a lower entry price sometime soon. In the run-up to the Bitcoin halving, Bitcoin dominance typically increases and alts lose momentum for a while; therefore, I believe a better entry for SOL is imminent.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4639017-solana-bumpy-ride-to-recovery?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18376508.jpeg

18376252,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554057,1696446040,FTX’s FTT Price Skyrockets 20%: Here’s Why the Rally Has Just Begun,"The FTT price has been challenging gravity and the overall trend in the crypto market for the past two weeks. A recent report hints at a potential bullish continuation based on this scenario and to the benefit of the FTX creditors. Related Reading: FTT Up By 21% Despite FTX Claims Portal Troubles As of this writing, the FTT price trades at $1.20, with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The token recorded a 19% profit in the previous two weeks, while the last 30 days show a 15% increase. In the meantime, major cryptocurrencies have seen half of this price action over the same period. FTT Price On The Verge Of Massive Rally? The surge in the FTT price is supported by the current negotiations between Artificial Intelligence (AI) company Anthropic and the big tech sector. As our sister website Bitcoinist reported, the company received a $1.5 billion capital injection from Amazon. The big tech giant committed to increasing their investment by up to $4 billion via Amazon Web Services (AWS). The partners will work to develop AI solutions to compete with Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. The AI company received support from failed crypto exchange FTX before its collapse in 2022. In that sense, if Anthropic can secure support from other big tech companies, the initial investment made by FTX will increase, allowing the new management to count on more assets and potentially repay creditors. A recent report from the Information claims that Anthropic is exploring further partnerships following its Amazon deal. The OpenAI competitor could receive support from Google. The big tech giant already bought a 10% stake in the startup at the same time as FTX. If this deal materializes, the company could increase its valuation from $4 billion to over $20 to $30 billion. Thus, FTX’s initial investment will increase by a significant amount. The negotiations between Anthropic and its potential partners have directly impacted the FTT price. The current manager has publicly emphasized his intention to re-launch the trading venue to repay its creditors. A successful sale of their stake in Anthropic could benefit FTX’s current management and give them enough capital to succeed. If this scenario materializes, the company’s native token is bound to extend its recent run and could potentially reclaim previously lost territory.

42392397,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6OFV,1696445891,A Spot ETH ETF Represents the Dawn of Institutional Liquid Staking,"Picture this: a groundbreaking moment in the world of cryptocurrencies, where the lines between traditional finance and digital assets blur. It's not just a distant dream; it's happening now. The recent news that Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest filed for the first spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund ETF in the United States marks a pivotal turning point.  It signifies not only the opening of doors for institutional investors but also the dawn of institutional liquid staking.  Matt Leisinger co-founder and chief product officer of Alluvial.  Why is there excitement over an ETH ETF? The answer lies in the resounding demand from investors seeking to integrate digital assets into their portfolios. While investors are hungry for these opportunities, current offerings fall short. U.S. investors eyeing a spot bitcoin ETF have to look beyond American shores.  For instance, Grayscale's GBTC, has consistently traded at a 20% discount to its net asset value: when an investor purchases GBTC, they're not just buying bitcoin exposure but navigating the complexities of liquidity in the crypto market — a daunting task.  See also: Grayscale Victory Against SEC Clears Path for Spot Bitcoin ETFs  The global demand for a spot ETH ETF becomes even more evident when you look at the thriving exchange-traded product (ETP) markets in Canada and Europe, boasting a combined market size nearing $33 billion. This is nothing short of a seismic shift in the world of global finance.  Zooming out, we see macroeconomic forces at play with industry giants like BlackRock embracing crypto. Combine that with PayPal's push into the stablecoin arena, and the result is undeniable pressure on Congress and regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a viable framework for digital assets.  But where does liquid staking fit into this picture? A spot ETH ETF, if approved, could induce demand from institutional traders, who will then likely scramble to participate staking. Simply holding ETH won’t be enough, these institutions will pivot to staking, looking to give their investors a higher return on their ETF holdings (especially on a deflationary asset).  If the approval of a spot ETH ETF opens a floodgate of institutional investment, institutions will be eager to participate. This is principally because of recent innovations made in Ethereum staking. Stakers can retain liquidity even while locking up their assets using a liquid staking protocol that gives users a tradable token, something institutions cannot get when locking up capital in government bonds, for instance.  Typically, asset managers gravitate towards shorter redemption periods, aiming for a daily cadence if possible. Liquid staking allows people to stake and earn yield while retaining liquidity, often without a lockup.  This preference for shorter redemption periods stems from minimizing the net asset value discounts, avoiding liquidity challenges and the operational burden of managing staking and unstaking. Given the period of time to withdraw staked ETH is variable (from five to more than 30 days), these managers will need a solution that offers the ability to process daily redemptions while providing their investors the benefit of higher returns.  Institutions will seek a solution through compliant and security-focused liquid staking tokens that offer liquidity, a diverse node operator set and operational efficiency. The best way to manage staked ETH positions with shorter redemption periods is through a compliant liquid staking token.  Approving a spot ETH ETF isn't just likely; it's necessary in crypto's march to mainstream adoption. With the underpinnings of institutional demand beginning to take shape, it’s time for U.S. regulators to take notice and approve ARK Invest’s spot ETH ETF.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Matt Leisinger,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/04/a-spot-eth-etf-represents-the-dawn-of-institutional-liquid-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc45325fd0d2cb766b1bdd4636e52d2fd241b7a8-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The absence of ASIC resistance in Bitcoin doesn't hinder its decentralization, as miners seek out cheap power sources globally. This is probably a stronger decentralizing force anyway. Monero's remaining strengths include privacy by default and a tail emission block reward. Overall, XMR is a narrative call on a sudden prioritization of privacy. Otherwise, it is difficult to acquire and unlikely to outperform BTC. Holding a speculative, small position makes sense. A few months ago I published a comprehensive report on Monero (XMR-USD). If you read the whole thing and retained most of it, you'd have a good understanding of Monero on a deeper-than-surface level. This report is an update because my perspective on Monero has begun to change over the last month. I downgrade to a Hold, although the caveat is that XMR is still a highly speculative buy due to a rather asymmetric risk-reward profile, but only for a small portion of a digital asset portfolio. The main issue I have come to realize about Monero is that it is still a base layer chain and will likely continue to be a base layer chain. Everything scales by adding more layers, but Monero has no ability to do so due to technical reasons. Another issue I have come to realize is that Monero's decentralization through ASIC resistance is not as important as I had thought and matters even less considering some of the developments in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining. The rest of this report expands on these two issues. No Scripts, Means No L2 Scaling, Means No Adoption Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD) are both capable of scaling in layers because certain logic can be coded into the blockchain by users. For example, Ethereum is scaling through rollups. A rollup derives security from the base layer because a smart contract on the base layer (generally called the "" bridge contract "") is programmed such that transactions which occurred on the rollup can be forcibly made to occur on the base layer via the smart contract. Some examples of Ethereum rollups are Optimism (OP-USD), Arbitrum (ARB-USD), and ZKSync . Bitcoin is scaling through state channels. The biggest one is the Lightning Network . State channels also require programmable spending conditions (called ""scripts"") on the base layer. In the case of the Lightning payment channels, this spending condition is a 2-of-2 multi-signature to settle the funds within the channel. A more complex script called a hash-time locked contract ((HTLC)) is used to route payments through different Lightning channels. Routing is critical to the Lightning Network, and completely impossible without scripts. Monero has no scripts. It simply uses advanced cryptography to obfuscate the sender, receiver, and amount transacted. There are multi-signature wallets for XMR, but these are a wallet-level feature, which is different from how Bitcoin or Ethereum implements multi-signatures. Without scripts, Monero cannot use its base layer to enforce the security of higher layers. Here's a way to understand the nuance of what is going on. When a Lightning transaction or an Arbitrum transaction runs into a dispute on Bitcoin or Ethereum respectively, the base layer holds all the logic necessary to resolve the dispute. In the case of Lightning, signed Bitcoin base layer transactions are exchanged between channel users but kept from being broadcasted to the blockchain. At any time, the latest signed transaction can be broadcasted, and at that point, the logic encoded into the Bitcoin base layer can be used to enforce the transaction's validity. Thus, the base layer can resolve the dispute. In the same way, if an Arbitrum transaction was disputed, the procedure for resolving an optimistic rollup would be to run the transactions on the Ethereum base layer to see what the result would be. In that case, Ethereum's base layer can resolve the dispute. The ability for the base layer to resolve the dispute is required for high layer scaling. Monero has no programmability at the base layer, so it cannot support higher layer scaling. This is a big problem because everything uses layers to scale. Blockchains that have tried to scale everything on the base layer have gone nowhere. For example, Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and Bitcoin SV (BSV-USD) were hard forked from Bitcoin with the intention of increasing the block size so that more transactions can be packed into the base layer. Their total market caps are now a tiny fraction of Bitcoin's. Meanwhile, the two biggest chains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have both adopted a scaling in layers approach. The market is very clearly telling us what it thinks works. Without the ability to scale in layers, Monero will never be able to service a truly large number of people, so it will be technologically incapable of reaching mass adoption. This puts a hard cap on the utility and value of XMR. Why ASIC Resistance Doesn't Mean Greater Potential for Decentralization Than Bitcoin In the last report on Monero, I wrote the following paragraph: Monero is better than Bitcoin insofar as being a blockchain that promotes decentralization. Monero uses the ASIC-resistant RandomX mining algorithm. ASIC means ""application-specific integrated circuit."" While ASICs can be specifically optimized for Bitcoin mining, they cannot be optimized for Monero mining. The result is that Bitcoin miners will require capital-intensive investment into ASICs to remain competitive while anyone with a normal personal computer can be competitive as a Monero miner (one could still get more computers to be more competitive in Monero mining, but the point of ASIC-resistance is that it would be hard to specifically optimize computers with the intent to use it for mining XMR). This increases Monero's potential for greater decentralization because barriers to entry and profitability are lower. In contrast, a large percentage of Bitcoin's hash rate belongs to several large-scale mining rigs filled with ASICs. My position on this has changed. While I still believe ASIC resistance is a compelling force of decentralization, I have recently come to see that Bitcoin's ASIC dominance also offers another level of decentralization which is equally, if not more, compelling. And if this is the case, then one of the big strengths which set Monero apart from Bitcoin isn't really all that meaningful. First, we must clarify some of the incentives that come from ASIC acceptance and ASIC resistance. Monero is famously ASIC resistant , and it stays this way through regular hard forks which slightly alters the proof-of-work and renders existing ASICs useless. The goal is to ensure that ""normal"" computers can stay competitive for mining. Bitcoin is ASIC-friendly because it never, ever changes. The same proof-of-work has existed throughout Bitcoin's existence. ASICs designed in 2015 are still usable today, and any decrease in their competitiveness is due to the newer ASICs being more advanced, not due to the network's rules changing. This creates a very curious incentive for Bitcoin miners that we are only recently beginning to observe en masse. Because Bitcoin can be trusted to never change, ASICs can be acquired and expected to have lasting value. Thus, the only remaining variable for miner profitability will be the cost of electricity. As such, Bitcoin miners will go seek out the cheapest sources of power available. They will even explore new sources of power that others have yet to consider. Mining gives such explorations an immediate source of revenue (note: not profit, but revenue) and a proof of concept. This is part of the reason why Bitcoin will be increasingly regarded as an ESG-friendly industry and asset, which will be a big pivot from the dominant narrative a few years ago. See this report , starting on page 35. My focus is that because miners can trust that their ASICs will not be rendered useless, the only thing left for them to do is to seek out cheap power. And these spots can literally be located anywhere on Earth. This is a very compelling force for decentralization. Whereas my previous concern was that Bitcoin's hash rate is concentrated in a few ASIC mining rigs, I now see an overwhelmingly decentralizing force in the form of miners seeking out the cheaper power in their selfish and rational mission to maximize profits. Given the economics of Bitcoin mining, I even expect that large-scale mining rigs will eventually fade away in relevance as they lose their edge to smaller miners which are more mobile and able to capitalize on cheaper and cheaper sources of power. The theoretical long-term destination of this would be a steady state of perfect decentralization. No one would even know where most miners are because miners are so spread out geographically and so hyper-optimized to their own niche cheap power source. This realization completely negates the need for ASIC resistance. In fact, ASIC resistance almost guarantees that this kind of ""perfect decentralization"" will never happen. ASIC resistance trades a long-run, roundabout journey to decentralization (led by economic incentives) for a series of short-term fixes to miner centralization. In the long run, I expect ASIC resistant networks to be confined to an ingroup that knows about it and appreciates it enough to use it. Only by allowing specialization (i.e., ASIC) can economic incentives play out over a long enough time frame to achieve better decentralization through a roundabout procedure. If Monero's ASIC resistance isn't a great thing for decentralization when we objectively consider the alternative presented by Bitcoin in its totality, then why should we still favor XMR over BTC as decentralized money? Reconciling Monero's Benefits Over Bitcoin The remaining pieces of XMR strengths might include: Fungibility of XMR thanks to its inherent privacy. Tail Emissions which is an acceptable solution to a possible security time bomb. Privacy by default. Fungibility becomes less and less of a problem after higher layer scaling enters the picture. While some BTC on the base layer might be considered tainted because of association with illicit activities, these same coins can be put into a Lightning channel and used to send transactions via the Lightning Network. No one would even know that they were ultimately receiving coins from a tainted source, since Lightning uses an onion routing mechanism. And if the end receiver settled to the base layer, their new coins wouldn't be tainted since it won't be linkable to the tainted ones. Also, the concept of tainting is a social construct that probably will fade over time as Bitcoin adoption grows. In the near term, tainted coins pose a problem if and only if you are only trying to transact on the base layer. In the long term, it probably won't be an issue at all. Thus, fungibility isn't a big deal: it is a ""nice to have"" not a ""need to have"" at the base layer. The bigger concern may be Bitcoin's block rewards halving until it eventually hits zero. This would force miners to rely on fees alone. Most miner revenue today comes from block rewards (which are certain) and not fees (fees are uncertain), so it's not clear what will happen to network uptime and security when the block reward disappears completely. Monero solves this with a tail emission : a block reward of 0.6 XMR per block that will never decrease. We can expect that many solutions will be proposed for Bitcoin long before the problem gets serious. Think of it this way: while XMR's block reward solution can be considered adequately resolved with certainty, BTC's solution is uncertain but likely to manifest in the future when a solution is truly needed. The only way to find out is to just wait. Monero's privacy by default is probably its biggest strength. Bitcoin transactions at the base layer are not private. Privacy is obviously very valuable and privacy at the base layer is wonderful because it means all incidences of transactions are protected. If the base layer doesn't have privacy, then users would need to rely on higher layers for privacy. However, there are tradeoffs for this privacy. Privacy is achieved via complex cryptography which occurs with each transaction, and this makes a transaction take up more size than a (far simpler) transaction on Bitcoin. This increases the base layer's size at a much faster rate. That can cause decentralization issues because running a full node (a node that stores the entire blockchain to verify transactions) becomes harder for more people. So Should You Get XMR as an Investment? The answer is probably no. First, XMR is hard to buy because many crypto exchanges do not offer it. Using decentralized exchanges like atomic swap protocols is technically complex and subjects you to some wide bid-ask spreads. You usually need BTC or ETH to do such a swap, and you would need XMR to seriously outperform these assets before you can even make back what you would pay on the bid-ask spreads. Some decentralized exchanges like dYdX offer XMR perpetual futures which can give traders exposure to XMR at much better terms via derivatives. If you consider that route, then your allocation depends on your bullishness on XMR. I now consider XMR primarily a ""narrative call."" Most digital assets function off narratives or fads. When DeFi became the hottest narrative, there were governance tokens of big, decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (UNI-USD) and Curve (CRV-USD) which really took off. These tokens didn't accrue any of the cash flows, but by association alone their prices exploded. Similar things happen all the time in crypto. With XMR, the narrative call is undoubtedly privacy. Interestingly, privacy hasn't really been a big narrative in crypto. There could be some events in the future which trigger a collective shift to consider privacy, and this would be very beneficial to XMR. In fact, XMR would probably be one of the biggest benefactors because it is the leading privacy coin and its only well-known advantage is its privacy (most don't really know the details of tail emissions or ASIC resistance). For this alone, a highly speculative and small allocation to XMR may be appropriate in a digital asset portfolio. It is probably about the same or better than keeping a small allocation of your equity portfolio in GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) in case those meme stocks take off again. In the previous report I wrote the following: I think there is a margin of safety which comes from an uninformed and presently uninterested public. This is based on Monero's very real merits and its relatively small size compared to Bitcoin, and on how undercovered and even ""miscovered"" (coverage tends to be focused on illicit use cases and little else) XMR is. Thus, I rate XMR a speculative buy - a good chance of going nowhere but a visible path to outsized profits. XMR appears a great ""deep value"" play in digital assets today. I no longer take the ""deep value"" and the ""margin of safety"" position. XMR can't be considered deep value unless it can measure up to Bitcoin and Ethereum in scaling via layers. Without programmable scripts, it cannot scale via layers or reach mass adoption, and there isn't really a margin of safety because it is more likely the case that the market simply recognizes the nuance behind the need to scale. This, along with the realization that ASIC resistance isn't really a huge decentralization benefit over Bitcoin's ASIC-friendly model, has prompted a downgrade to ""Hold.""",NEGATIVE,ETH | XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | XMR | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4639011-monero-downgrading-leading-privacy-coin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18375261.jpeg

42392410,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6PPJ,1696442745,"Sam Bankman-Fried ‘Lied,’ DOJ Tells Jury; Defense Tries to Pin FTX Collapse on Caroline Ellison","In their opening statement Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors called Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto empire a “house of cards ... built on a lie.”  His defense team countered that the FTX founder acted in good faith and the crypto juggernaut failed through no fault of Bankman-Fried’s.  The first prosecution witness, a London-based commodities trader, was an FTX customer who lost $134,000 from the exchange’s collapse.  UPDATE (Oct. 4, 2023, 19:59 UTC): Adds first prosecution witness in final paragraphs of the story.  UPDATE (Oct. 4, 2023, 21:43 UTC): Adds second prosecution witness.  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s entire crypto empire was a “house of cards” that was “built on a lie,” the U.S. Department of Justice said in its opening statement at the FTX founder’s trial.  Bankman-Fried’s defense team countered that the onetime FTX founder acted in good faith – even as his businesses grew too quickly and collapsed dramatically through no fault of his own, his lawyers said. They assigned some of the blame to one of his employees, his former paramour Caroline Ellison, and said she failed to install safeguards. Ellison has already pleaded guilty and will testify during the trial.  Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial on fraud and conspiracy charges kicked off Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. in New York. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Rehn told the 12-person jury that the government would present evidence and expert witnesses that would prove the former crypto king “lied to his customers” and used their money to buy himself “money, power and influence.”  “He poured money – other people’s money – into investments,” Rehn said. He “spent that money in all sorts of ways on himself.”  Read all of CoinDesk's SBF trial coverage here.  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued in their opening statement that the former founder of FTX and Alameda Research never meant to steal customers’ money – he was simply overwhelmed by the speed at which both his businesses grew.  “He did not intend to steal from anyone,” said the defense’s lead lawyer, Mark Cohen, to jurors selected earlier Wednesday. He also said that Bankman-Fried “acted in good faith” and that he “didn’t defraud anyone.”  The FTX app and terms of service told customers the money they put on the exchange was being kept for them “as if they were sitting right there” – but, in reality, Bankman-Fried diverted those funds to ""smaller and secretive company” called Alameda Research and spent them on “luxuries” for himself, his friends and family members, Rehn told the court. In addition, Bankman-Fried used the money to make political donations that allowed him to curry favor with powerful people on Capitol Hill, Rehn said.  “You will learn the defendant took billions of dollars from … accounts [holding customers’ funds] … and he spent it, and customers had no way to know,” Rehn said.  Bankman-Fried took more than $10 billion out of FTX to pay its sister company Alameda Research’s debts in May and June of 2022, and attempted to “orchestrate a cover-up” by ordering the creation of false financial statements, Rehn added. He also testified before Congress, alleging FTX had never stolen customers’ funds, he said.  However, that “lie” blew up when Alameda’s financial statements were “leaked online,” Rehn said, referencing CoinDesk’s award-winning reporting on an internal document from Alameda that set into motion FTX’s collapse last fall.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Scoops Help CoinDesk Win a Loeb Award, a Top Journalism Prize  Still, Bankman-Fried attempted to “cover his tracks,” tweeting false reassurances to his customers, instructing his employees to set up his company’s internal communications platforms to automatically delete messages between him and his employees and falsifying contracts and other documents, Rehn said.  The DOJ plans to present documents, investor files, financial statements and Bankman-Fried’s own deleted tweets during the course of the trial, in addition to witness testimony, he said.  Defense position  Cohen started his opening statement in defense of Bankman-Fried by asking the jurors to judge “based on real life experiences,” and said he would explain “what really happened.” Moments earlier, an Assistant U.S. Attorney told jurors that the former crypto mogul “lied to the world” and “stole money” while continuously promising customers that their assets on FTX were safe.  The defense claimed that the government was “taking things out of context.” Rather than being a thief, Bankman-Fried was “someone who worked really hard” and whose companies grew very quickly where hundreds of decisions had to be made every day, Cohen said.  “No CEO and certainly not Sam could be anywhere and do everything,” Cohen said.  The government also told jurors about how closely intertwined the supposedly separate entities Alameda Research and FTX were and that Bankman-Fried, even after he stepped down from his role as CEO, remained very involved in Alameda Research’s business decisions.  The defense said there’s “nothing wrong with that,” and that Bankman-Fried remained a majority owner in Alameda, which is why he continued to be highly involved. He also explained that FTX needed liquidity and that Alameda Research took on the role of market maker.  “Totally normal,” Cohen said.  The defense took a shot at the government’s key witnesses – Ellison and former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh – saying they were testifying due to cooperation agreements.  “Cooperation in the real world means testifying in a way that supports the government’s case,” Cohen said. “That should overhang everything they say.”  In the months leading up to the trial, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have said they would argue that the former crypto mogul acted in “good faith” when he loaned funds to FTX and Alameda executives and in no way meant to defraud customers, investors or lenders.  Both the defense’s and the prosecutor’s opening statements came after Judge Kaplan picked a jury of 12 individuals to follow the case on Wednesday. Those jurors were selected from a group of over 80 prospective jurors who appeared in court on Tuesday and were asked a variety of questions, both work-related and personal.  Before the DOJ made its opening argument Judge Kaplan read a set of preliminary instructions to the jury for about 20 minutes, reminding the 12 jurors and six alternates not to conduct any research. He also explained how they should evaluate testimony and weigh it against, and alongside, other evidence like the FTX and Alameda internal documents. Opening arguments did not count as evidence, he said, likening them to movie trailers.  “Your job is to decide the facts … to come to a conclusion about what happened,” Kaplan told the jurors, later adding that he will teach them everything they need to know about the law and how to apply it to reach a verdict.  First prosecution witnesses  Prosecutors’ first witness was a French commodities trader named Marc-Antoine Julliard, who lost around $134,000 as an FTX customer.  Based in London, Julliard told the jury that he opened an account on FTX.com in 2021 when crypto assets were booming. After doing his own due diligence on the exchange and its then-CEO Bankman-Fried – reading news articles and posts on X (formerly Twitter) – Julliard said he frequently traded bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through FTX.  Prosecutors’ initial line of questioning for Julliard focused on Bankman-Fried’s carefully cultivated public image and hinted at opposition to some of the defense’s opening argument. Bankman-Fried came across as the “leader” and “face” of crypto, the witness recalled, adding that several venture capital companies had invested in FTX, which to the commodities trader seemed like “a vote of confidence” in the platform and its CEO.  In response to a series of questions from Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Kudla, Julliard said that he traded crypto assets on the exchange and would check his FTX app for updates on his trades and asset prices daily, almost hourly.  Kudla walked Julliard into an almost immediate rebuttal of an argument made by the defense in its opening statements, asking him if he engaged in margin trading (the defense argued margin traders, under the FTX terms of service, could have had their funds moved by the exchange behind the scenes).  “I would not,” he said.  Even as potential problems at FTX became headline news in November 2022, Julliard initially left his funds on the service. He said he was reassured by a series of tweets from Bankman-Fried – which Kudla presented to the jury – wherin the FTX founder insisted the exchange was solvent and did not invest client funds.  Once Julliard ultimately tried to withdraw his funds on Nov. 8 – a day after the tweet thread was posted – he said he was unsuccessful.  Kudla asked if Julliard ever expected anyone else would trade his FTX-based funds on his behalf.  “If I trade, I’m responsible for my own decisions,” he said. “If someone else traded on my account, and they lose money ... that’s not what I signed up for.”  Julliard said he still wasn’t able to access any of his funds.  A second witness, Adam Yedidia, described himself as a “longtime friend” of Bankman-Fried who met the defendant while the two were studying together at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Yedidia told the court he served a brief stint at Alameda before working as an engineer at FTX, but he resigned last year after he “learned that Alameda Research had used customer deposits to pay back creditors.”  Yedidia testified under a grant of immunity – meaning prosecutors won’t charge him for any crimes based on what he says in court.  In response to one set of questions from Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, Yedida walked the jury through a brief explanation of cryptocurrencies. His explanation was followed up by a visual aid produced by FTX. The animated crypto-explainer video served the double task of clarifying basic blockchain concepts for the jury, and showcasing how Bankman-Fried positioned FTX as an ethics-motivated blockchain company focused on equity and serving under-banked communities.  Prosecutors also showed Yedidia – and the jury – a number of FTX ads that specifically zeroed in on the exchange’s proclaimed safety and targeting toward retail investors. “In this video, who said FTX was the safest and easiest way to trade crypto,” Sassoon asked after one clip. “Tom Brady,” he responded, referring to the former National Football League quarterback. After the jury was shown a follow-up clip, which Yedidia recalled as an FTX Super Bowl ad, he was asked to identify another of FTX’s celebrity promoters: comedian Larry David.  Asked to describe Bankman-Fried’s role by Sassoon during his testimony, Yedidia said he oversaw FTX’s “grand strategy.” He will resume testimony on Thursday.

18374672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554092,1696442417,Is XRP Growth Real Or Just Smoke And Mirrors? Here’s What Liquidation Data Shows,"XRP, the digital currency associated with Ripple Labs, has been making headlines with its recent price rally. However, a report suggests that the hype surrounding its performance might be overstated, as market data paints a different picture. Despite a positive legal ruling and a robust community, XRP seems to struggle to gain the same level of confidence as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) among investors. Liquidation data from CoinGlass reveals that in the past 24 hours, approximately $4.20 million worth of XRP has been liquidated. Interestingly, the short positions accounted for a mere $66.13K in losses, while long traders recorded a substantial $2.09 million loss. Source: Coinglass Related Reading: Shiba Inu Investors Beware: 425 Billion Tokens On The Move – Is It A Sell-Out? Liquidation Data Raises Questions On XRP’s Price Rally This data underscores the fact that the recent ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which classified XRP as not a security when traded on exchanges, failed to ignite significant bullish sentiment for the cryptocurrency. Comparing this liquidation data with that of Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals a stark contrast, further suggesting that XRP is still considered a less promising digital asset. This contrast raises doubts about the bullish predictions made by some experts following the recent legal ruling. It appears that despite its strong community support, XRP’s growth indicators are not aligning with the optimism that has surrounded it. XRP market cap currently at $28.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Currently priced at $0.529 according to CoinGecko, XRP has seen a 5.0% growth in the past 24 hours and a seven-day rally of 7.4%. Despite these gains, market observers remain cautious about the coin’s long-term potential. XRP Trajectory: Contrasting Perspectives In a separate report, there is a contrasting perspective that suggests XRP could still experience significant growth in value. This report highlights the fact that during the prolonged legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that began in December 2020, XRP has shifted its focus to overseas markets. This strategic move has led to impressive client wins in emerging markets, where Ripple’s payment platform has the potential to make a substantial impact. XRP seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Is Dogecoin On Life Support? Analyzing Its Recent Price Downturn These client wins have paved the way for promising developments, particularly in projects related to cross-border payment systems and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). These initiatives hold the potential to drive the long-term value of XRP, as they expand its use cases beyond speculative trading. XRP’s recent price surge may have garnered attention, but skepticism remains prevalent in the market. While some believe in its potential for further growth, the current data and market sentiment suggest that XRP still has hurdles to overcome to solidify its position as a top-tier digital currency.

Now there’s suddenly a burst of competition among veteran layer-2 teams to supply the technology for Celo’s new system. The migration initially was supposed to rely on Optimism’s OP Stack software kit, which served as the template not only for Coinbase’s new Base blockchain but also the Binance-incubated BNB Chain’s new opBNB network. Then last month, Polygon injected itself into the mix, offering up its Polygon Chain Development Kit, known as Polygon CDK, as an alternative. As of last week, there’s yet another suitor to host Celo: Matter Labs, the creators of another rollup, zkSync, as well as the ZK Stack open-source software, which can be used to create new “hyperchains” on Ethereum. “The modular and open-sourced ZK Stack is the optimal L2 stack for Celo’s transition to Ethereum,” according to the Matter Labs proposal. “We hope to trigger an honest, open discussion amongst the Celo and zkSync communities regarding the tradeoffs between the ZK Stack, the OP Stack, Polygon CDK and other options.” Coming in the depths of crypto winter, the episode offers a reminder of the intensity of the consolidation trend, with the various networks scrambling to find fresh business.  PROOF-OF-PROOF: The crypto developer OP Labs rolled out software a year ago making it easy for companies to spin up their own distributed networks atop the Ethereum blockchain. But the option quickly became so popular that it attracted the likes of the big U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, which used the platform to build its new blockchain, Base. As these things go, success leads to greater scrutiny, and in recent months, technical experts homed in on a crucial deficiency of the setup: Networks based on the OP Labs software were missing an element known as “fault proofs” that theoretically sit at the very core of their inherent “optimistic rollup” design; the lack of the security feature was likened to driving a fast car without airbags. OP Labs officials got the message, and recently had insisted that getting fault proofs into operation was a top priority – so much so that the project even had its own name, “Cannon.” On Tuesday, OP Labs finally delivered – or at least took its first step toward addressing the concerns, launching fault proofs on a test network known as OP Goerli Testnet. Such progress might keep critics at bay, at least for a while.  COLD CRYPTO: Transaction volumes across the crypto industry have slowed dramatically, and the signs of retrenchment are ubiquitous. Chia Network, founded by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen, laid off 26 employees, a third of its staff, and might now consider selling off some of 2.6 million unencumbered XCH tokens ($70 million worth) to raise funds. Chainalysis, the blockchain analytics firm, cut 15% of staff, out of an employee base said to be around 900. On Wednesday, the DeFi lending project Yield Protocol announced plans to wind down by the end of the year, “because there is currently not sustainable demand for fixed-rate borrowing.”  BAD BLOOD IN BSV: Christen Ager-Hanssen, the former CEO of nChain, which is focused on the Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain, posted on X that he had departed, adding that he was “convinced that Dr. Craig Wright is NOT Satoshi” and is “persuaded he will lose all his legal battles.” Calvin Ayre, a patron of the BSV ecosystem, wrote on X that “Christen is a grifter… He had no real plans for nChain other than stealing the silverware.” Wright posted: “Sorry to disappoint my anti-fans. I haven’t gone anywhere.”  TO ENSHRINE OR NOT TO ENSHRINE? Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was once an advocate for the proliferation of layer-2 networks, under a “minimal-enshrinement philosophy” – essentially keeping the main blockchain network as a “simple, beautiful protocol that tried to do as little as possible.” Now, however, he writes that “enshrining certain features in the protocol might be worth considering.”  ALSO:  Ethereum developers prove successful in second attempt at Holesky test network launch.  Monday’s highly anticipated launch of no fewer than nine exchange-traded funds or ETFs offering exposure to ether (ETH) futures proved spectacularly unimpressive; one analyst described the whole affair as “meh.”  Friend.tech users got targeted by SIM swap attacks.  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  1. Nomic, a layer-1 blockchain with a decentralized, non-custodial Bitcoin bridge, said its nBTC Interchain Upgrade ""empowers users"" to bring native bitcoin (BTC) to anywhere within the Cosmos ecosystem.  2.

Money Center  Deals and grants  Matter Labs, the developer team behind Ethereum layer-2 zkSync Era, announced a competitive audit contest focused on Web3 with Code4rena, a smart-contract security marketplace, with 1.1 million USDC available to participants and a minimum of $330,000 to be distributed. The 21-day event runs Oct. 2-23.  Vechain, an enterprise-grade layer-1 public blockchain, ""will host a hackathon at Harvard in partnership with Boston Consulting Group and Web3 educational mobile app, EasyA"" on Oct. 7-8, according to a press release.  Fireblocks, a crypto custody tech company, has acquired tokenization firm BlockFold, a ""smart-contract development and consulting firm specializing in advanced tokenization projects for financial institutions,"" according to an emailed announcement.  Data and tokens  The XRP token price soared after a U.S. judge denied the Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion to appeal a July court loss in its case against Ripple Labs.  In 2021, many FTX employees were set to become fabulously rich because their holdings of Serum’s SRM tokens had shot up in value, author Michael Lewis writes in his new book, “Going Infinite.” Then-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (now on trial) got worried that the employees might not stay so committed to working hard, according to Lewis. So Bankman-Fried changed the rules of the token allocations, locking up the SRM tokens so employees would have to wait longer to sell. The rest is history: After the FTX bankruptcy in November 2022, the SRM tokens plunged in digital asset markets, and are now down 99% from their all-time high price.  Yet Another FTX Spectacle – Not in Court, but On-Chain  In the chaos that followed the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange, a still-unknown party drained affiliated wallets of as much as $600 million. Until this past week, some $26 million of ether (ETH) had sat in a single wallet tagged “FTX Exploiter” by blockchain sleuths. But in the wee hours of Saturday, Sept. 30, just days before Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial was set to commence in New York, the blockchain account suddenly sprung into action, and the funds started moving – flowing quickly through a series of wallets that appeared to have no other purpose but as intermediary accounts; routing through Railgun, a privacy-enhancing protocol; and ultimately ending up at Thorchain, a decentralized cross-chain swap protocol; or reaching a smart contract labeled, “Metamask: Swap Router.” Using blockchain explorers, we traced the flow that one batch of 2,500 ETH took out of the long-dormant wallet.

42392404,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6OkH,1696439653,Sam Bankman-Fried's Trim May Undercut His Defense,"When a wayward kid does wrong and gets found out, typically he doesn’t want to be known as the guy who just joy-rode his neighbor’s Ford Crown Victoria. He wants to make a good impression on everyone, so they talk to him again. He shaves, gets a haircut and puts on the shiny suit he hasn’t worn since his granddad’s funeral. When he appears in court, he acts contrite.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  And, so it is with Sam Bankman-Fried. Turning up this week for his long-awaited trial on multiple fraud charges related to the collapse of FTX, the 31-year-old fallen crypto king gave the impression of someone who’d sobered up. He wore a gray suit, white shirt and striped tie. He tied his shoelaces, and his hair was short, like a “boot” on the first day of Army training camp.  SBF was unrecognizable from the person who lit up crypto circles, and Washington D.C. salons, in the high-ole-days of 2020-21. No more tousled just-out-of-bed hair. No more power-play Bermuda shorts signaling f**k-you wealth.  Apparently a fellow inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn had done the honors with the haircut. But here’s the key question: Does it do SBF any good at this stage?  He would have been better playing his unusual self than playing someone nobody recognizes.  SBF could land in prison for decades. The record at FTX is arguable but, to most legal observers, pretty damning. There’s a high likelihood that SBF will be convicted, because a large percentage of such cases result in convictions. SBF isn’t so much arguing the merits of what happened as his own culpability in what happened.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Blames Everyone but Himself for FTX's Collapse | Opinion  Impressions matter and by turning up as a contrite teen who hotwired a car, SBF perhaps does himself more harm than good. His defense strategy rests on the idea that he was out of his depth, a callow youngster over-influenced by svengalis around him. His lawyers are employing (or trying to employ) a blame-the-lawyers (""advice-of-counsel"") defense, saying that SBF’s actions were a function of other people’s bad advice. Given that, he would be better emphasizing incompetence, rather than presenting himself as a would-be vice president of operations.  SBF’s haircut was top news among mainstream outlets reporting the trial, probably because there’s not much to write about at this stage. This is jury-selection week. They all remarked on SBF’s new appearance, because the hair was such a central part of SBF’s schtick as a ruffled anti-establishment genius.  But will the new look win over a jury? That seems unlikely. SBF has already been indicted in the court of public opinion and his public image is well known. A change of appearance isn’t going to change that. We think we know him, even if we don’t. In this context, turning up at court as a different type of person isn’t going to help much.

The crypto investigator revealed that more than half of the wallets owned by these companies were traced back to Tron and the remainder allegedly being on the Ethereum blockchain. After analyzing the original sales of the TRX token, BoringSleuth stated that he had reviewed the top 20 cryptocurrency wallets in Tron’s original token sale list to decipher the owners of the wallets and how much TRX supply these wallets have acquired. According to the investigator, out of the 20 wallets, 17 were created and owned by the infamous criminal organization disguised to represent genuine investors. He revealed that the criminal organization was connected to the CCP, and 98% of Tron’s total token supply was received by these 17 wallets. The on-chain investigator also mentioned that cryptocurrency exchanges like Huobi Global, and cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu may also be linked to the CCP and Wanxiang, a Chinese multinational conglomerate and the team that funded Ethereum Foundation wallets and Ethereum’s Founder, Vitalik Buterin. ETH prie falls back to mid $1,600s | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Investigations Cast Shadows On Ethereum The crypto industry has experienced a series of Ponzi schemes and rug pulls for years now, causing investors and regulators to be wary of crypto exchanges and organizations in the space. While Tron is faced with speculations of being a well-orchestrated Ponzi scheme and having connections with the CCP, the revelation that Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency may be backed by the CCP and connected to companies involved in drug trafficking has left the crypto community in a paradox. According to BoringSleuth, the CCP is allegedly supporting Ethereum and other blockchains as well as multiple Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and Centralized Exchanges (CEX) in the crypto space. The crypto investigator utilized a previous transaction that saw the CCP receiving 133,700 ether on a single Genesis Block address owned by the party, as a reference to a connection between Ethereum and the CCP. BoringSleuth has also stated a potential connection between Ethereum’s Founders and the CCP, which he said he would be revealing in detail soon. The allegations faced by Tron and Ethereum come amid the increasing scrutiny of China’s role in the cryptocurrency landscape. Although the crypto X community is presently reeling from the on-chain investigator’s hypothesis, no concrete evidence linking Ethereum to the CCP has emerged, leaving the allegations in the realm of speculation.

Chainlink’s Co-Founder Predicts Crypto And Blockchain Prospects Over The Next Decade Sergey Nazarov believes that the collapse of the banking industry will favor crypto adoption and growth in the next decade. Related Reading: Crypto Is On The Brink Of Explosion As 9-Year DXY Formation Returns Nazarov believes the crypto industry and its technological innovations might maintain the same slow growth pace. However, the industry player cited two possible crypto and blockchain adoption scenarios in the next ten years. First, the Chainlink co-founder proposed a fast-case scenario where the collapse of the traditional finance system puts individuals in pain. This pain will force individuals to “acknowledge the relevance” of cryptographic financial systems. Further, Nazarov noted that the continued collapse of banks like Silicon Valley Bank could fast-track crypto adoption. Secondly, based on the first theory, the collapse of traditional finance systems will lead to political tension and international problems. Nazarov believes investors will favor crypto for financial operations if the pain of suffering losses becomes unbearable. Therefore, Nazarov insists that even in the slow case, the crypto market is likely on its way to a $10 trillion market cap. Chainlink’s Adoption By ANZ Banking Group Supports Nazarov’s Growth Theory According to a new industry report, ANZ Bank has adopted Chainlink’s CCIP for cross-chain tokenized asset settlement. CCIP solution helps to transfer data and tokenized assets across blockchains in a decentralized and secure way, according to the crypto founder. Notably, ANZ Bank is one of the world’s largest banks, with over $1 trillion in total assets managed. Sergey Nazarov noted that Chainlink’s adoption by ANZ shows how large companies are now adopting Chainlink’s CCIP. Also, the co-founder stated that building on a global internet needs secure connectivity between private bank chains and public chains. The CCIP is an upgrade on the Chainlink Network that functions as a global Internet of Contracts. This upgrade aims to create the world’s largest liquidity layer across various regions and markets. Remarkably, Nazarov stated that CCIP can create a higher level of cross-chain security. It achieves this extra security with multiple layers of decentralization and advanced risk management techniques. Moreover, most cryptocurrencies offer users fast and secure cross-border transactions cheaply. However, some critics still insist that cryptocurrencies are unreliable based on their volatility and crisis in the sector. Related Reading: Will XRP Price Defy A 50% Stock Market Crash? Analysts Share Predictions With innovations like the CCIP of Chainlink, more banks may integrate crypto and blockchain-based solutions. This drives crypto to mainstream adoption, increasing the market cap to $10 trillion, as Nazarov predicts. Meanwhile, the collapse of banks such as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023 has strained the global finance economy. If another banking crisis occurs, cryptocurrencies might become the preferred option for most investors based on their rising utility.

42392417,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Pox,1696434300,"Investors Fear Volatility and Risk, Particularly With Crypto. Here’s Why They Shouldn’t.","Deciding to invest in the fast-paced, ever-evolving digital assets market can seem daunting. In the past, people were often hesitant to invest in digital assets – namely cryptocurrency – because of their inherent volatility and associated risk. But the tides are changing, particularly as the global cryptocurrency market has grown into a flourishing, multi-sector ecosystem since bitcoin’s (BTC) 2009 debut.  Below, I break down – and debunk – some common misconceptions about the potential risks that investors assume while gaining exposure to the digital assets ecosystem.  Volatility is always a bad thing (FALSE)  The term “volatility” often comes with a negative connotation, but that’s not always the case. Investors can experience swings up or down; it’s important to remember that there is upside potential, too.  For example, bitcoin has been called the best-performing asset of the decade, yet its price heavily depends on a number of factors, including supply and demand, investor sentiment and the media hype cycle. Even the most-prominent and well-capitalized cryptocurrency experiences fluctuations, resulting in positive returns and, at times, losses.  When an investment portfolio is constructed in a professional manner, volatility has the potential to be a portfolio enhancement rather than a disadvantage. That’s because advisers have the expertise to help by setting frequent rebalances and buying and selling orders at certain thresholds. We’ve seen this play out time and time again as the adoption curve for digital assets has ramped up over the years.  Digital assets always carry too much risk (FALSE)  Investors should aim for a balanced portfolio, meaning one that isn’t dominated by a certain asset class (whether digital assets or otherwise). Diversification is key. Adding alternatives to a portfolio can not only help avoid concentration risk but also hedge against inflationary environments.  Around a 2% allocation to digital assets is often standard in an investment portfolio. To some, that may seem like an insignificant percentage. But in practice, that often means the downside risk is minimized and the potential upside is tremendous; even a 2% bitcoin allocation in a standard portfolio over the last five years would have driven a significant share of the portfolio’s growth.  An allocation that small – regardless of how powerful it can be – shouldn’t take up the vast majority of an investor’s time or energy. Instead, financial advisers can help ensure portfolio construction is purposeful, rather than ad hoc. Advisers take on the management burden by keeping track of market conditions and recommending a rebalance schedule that works for the individual investor and their specific financial goals.  Digital assets will never become a mainstream investment (FALSE)  Some risk-averse investors likely have exposure to the digital assets industry without realizing it. That includes established, highly trusted brands that are historically slower to embrace disruptive technologies. For instance, global payments giant Visa recently announced an expansion of its stablecoin settlement capabilities, becoming one of the first major payment institutions to do so.  Although the industry is still in its infancy, the possible use cases are vast. And the investment opportunity is exciting – despite (and, in some instances, because of) volatility and risk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Erik Anderson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/04/volatility-and-risk-get-a-bad-rap-in-investment-portfolios-particularly-when-it-comes-to-digital-assets-heres-why-they-shouldnt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe0e8fbd40ad19293d4e4d5668bd0479d7f19bf9-5046x3364.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392409,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6PF3,1696434300,Asian Banking Giant DBS Is Patiently Wading Into Crypto,"SINGAPORE – As Singapore geared up for the riveting speed of the Formula One weekend in mid-September, crypto-related entities were racing toward opportunity at the Token2049 conference. One seasoned traditional finance player wasn’t in much of a rush, though.  Singapore-based DBS Bank, a regional banking behemoth headquartered near the conference venue, Marina Bay Sands, holds all three licenses required to let clients buy traditional securities using stablecoins. But it isn’t doing so yet, even as competitors move ahead.  The only other entity that holds all three licenses in Singapore, MetaComp, told CoinDesk at Token2049 that it was the first to let their clients pay for securities with their crypto holdings – albeit by first converting the stablecoin to fiat.  Moments later, CoinDesk asked Evy Theunis, head of digital assets at DBS’ institutional banking group, why the company hadn’t entered this crypto triathlon, despite appearing fit to do so. Currently, DBS provides digital asset custody, a digital exchange for listing and trading, security tokens and the ability to manage traditional assets alongside a crypto portfolio using the same app.  “I like your triathlon analogy,” said Theunis. “But I’d say while it’s still winter, we have been swimming. Maybe it’s fair to suggest we’re not going as deep as some of the very focused players,, but we’re still doing a lot, getting our hands dirty for the long run.”  The technical reason for not offering the stablecoin service, Theunis explained, related to how DBS tracks any tokens it processes. For non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, DBS traces every wallet a token has ever touched before it enters the token into its system.  “Can you imagine doing that for stablecoins? That was a technical difficulty because stablecoins are multichain, they cross bridges, etc.,” Theunis said, adding this is why, for some time now, DBS has only offered bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), DOT and ADA trading, because “we want everything that comes into the bank to be foolproof.”  In sporting terminology, DBS, a major player in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and South Korea, is arguably the Eliot Kipchoge of finance in the region. If digital assets were a triathlon, it may not be the reigning champion, but it sure knows how to win. Given crypto’s volatility, DBS’ brand recognition as the “safest bank in Asia"" for 14 consecutive years makes every step it takes towards crypto a giant step towards legitimacy for the space.  DBS started its digital asset platform, DBS Digital Exchange, in 2020, Theunis said. “We go into things early, not to run sprints but to see how things evolve,” she said.  In a panel at Token2049, she revealed that digital assets under custody at DBS grew around 150% year-on-year as of the end of the second quarter. For comparison, BTC and ETH prices rose 50% and 80%, respectively, in the same period, according to CoinMarketCap.  Theunis is at the helm of DBS’ digital assets journey. She originates from Brussels, but given she’s been based in Singapore for almost a decade, she is a unique leader bridging the gap between the West and East’s understanding of crypto.  “The whole ecosystem benefits when regulators and the industry collaborate closely, and this is evident, especially in Singapore,” Theunis said. “This relationship-led approach is a key driver of innovation and could be a model for other jurisdictions.”  DBS’ largest and controlling shareholder is the Singapore government-owned Temasek Holdings. It’s no surprise then that its digital assets strategy appears to walk in step with the monetary policy of the region.  This became apparent most in February 2022 when DBS’ Piyush Gupta revealed plans to launch retail digital asset trading by the end of the year. But shortly after, two major entities with close ties to Singapore, stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), collapsed. Singapore tightened its regulation, censured 3AC and proposed stablecoin rules to reign in the sector. DBS’ retail trading plans have been suspended since.  “Right now we are focusing on institutional players, continuing to evolve on the accredited investor side,” Theunis said as she reiterated DBS wasn’t going to start retail trading of digital assets. “Not so long ago, we enabled all our qualified accredited investors to buy digital assets on the exchange.”  Without naming any of its institutional customers, Theunis said, “we’ve seen how a lot of traditional players have readied themselves, but they've not been really active” in crypto, reflecting how it’s not just DBS that’s playing the wait-and-watch game.  DBS is also heavily entrenched in government-related projects in the space – Project Orchid uses programmable money for government vouchers, while Project Guardian saw a tokenized version of the Singapore dollar bought for tokenized Japanese yen. It also completed an e-Chinese yuan transaction for a client in China, and for shipments between Singapore and India, it completed the first “live” transaction of electronic Bills of Lading (eBL), which are essential documents in shipping.  Historically, scalability has been a problem for this kind of transaction but that problem was solved by issuing title ownership of the eBL as a non-fungible token (NFT) on Polygon.“  Institutions like ours are dependent on builders to make blockchain technology ready for scalable adoption, like with eBLs on a blockchain. That’s why we are participating in all these initiatives to bring together and work with builders,” Theunis said. “I would encourage builders to talk to institutions more about their use cases, which will take time.”  CORRECTION (Oct. 5, 11:35 UTC): DBS headquarters are not in the same venue but near the conference venue Marina Bay Sands.",NEUTRAL,BCH,ASIA | BCH | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/04/crypto-long-short-a-giant-awakens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24c107da45be9d220f9d18ace6371e5eb640812c-3992x2992.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Cash & Other Altcoins Have Observed A Rise In Active Addresses As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a new post on X, some alts are seeing rising activity despite the cooldown that the overall cryptocurrency sector has observed in the past couple of days. The indicator of interest here is the “daily active addresses,” which keeps track of the total number of unique addresses of any given coin that are interacting on the blockchain in some way every day. The metric accounts for both senders and receivers. By “unique,” what’s meant here is that any address participating in transaction activity on the blockchain is only counted once, regardless of how many transfers it may be involved in. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Continue Its Run? These Factors Could Suggest So This restriction helps provide a more accurate representation of the actual activity on the network, as just a few addresses making hundreds of transactions can’t skew the metric by themselves. When the value of the indicator is high, it means that there are a large number of unique addresses taking part in transaction activity right now. Such a trend implies the blockchain is receiving a high amount of traffic currently. On the other hand, low values imply not many users are interacting with the network, a possible sign that interest in trading the cryptocurrency is low at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the daily active addresses for several different altcoins over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has been high for all of these assets recently | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the daily active addresses indicator has observed a sharp surge in the past couple of days for the altcoins listed here: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Small Love Potion (SLP), Mask (MASK), LeverFi (LEVER), and Civic (CVC). According to Santiment, these latest highs in the metric correspond to the highest levels that these cryptocurrencies have witnessed in around three months. Such high activity naturally suggests that there is a lot of interest in these coins among investors right now. Most of these are small-cap coins, though, but there is one among them that has a very notable standing in the rest of the market: BCH. The 16th-ranked asset in the sector has registered a decline in the last two days, much like the wider sector, but the asset’s active addresses have remained high in number. Related Reading: Cardano To Shed Its Gains? Profit-Taking Spikes To High Levels Usually, high address activity is a good sign for rallies, as a large amount of active trader pool means that the move has a higher probability of finding the fuel it needs to keep itself going. Interestingly, besides these altcoins, the largest stablecoin in the sector, Tether (USDT), has also seen the indicator shoot up during this period. Investors use stablecoins for storing their value in a more secure form and for buying into other assets, so the high address activity can potentially be a sign that some moves are taking place in the background. BCH Price Bitcoin Cash had earlier surged past the $250 mark, but with the latest drawdown, the altcoin has plunged to $230.

42392398,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6OPl,1696431600,"Crypto vs. Banks? It’s Not Either-Or for Chainlink, Ripple","Ripple won a partial victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July, prompting speculation that more banks might consider XRP for their money-transfer systems.  Chainlink has successfully conducted experiments with Swift and dozens of financial institutions.  Chainlink and Ripple, along with the firms Fireblocks, R3, Fnality and Zodia Markets, are collaborating with financial institutions to develop infrastructure for digital finance.  The 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper introduced the world to the idea of decentralized blockchains - and the “inherent weaknesses” in payments systems relying “almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties,” as author Satoshi Nakomoto put it.  That’s partly why it’s notable that two of the biggest blockchain firms, Ripple and Chainlink, are now working hand-in-glove with banks and other traditional payments companies to develop what might become the financial infrastructure of the future.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The possibility of a hybrid model might challenge the prevailing paradigm where crypto operates in a parallel universe, often detached from the practical world. The reality is that the lines are far more blurred, with not just Chainlink and Ripple but also companies including Fireblocks, R3, Fnality and Zodia Markets explicitly embracing strategies of working cohesively with financial institutions.  “Some people are very anti-establishment in the crypto community and will question on many different levels why there's any point in dealing with the old guard,” said James Butterfill, head of research at the digital-asset management firm CoinShares.  Ripple, whose CTO David Schwartz was one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger blockchain, says on its website it wants to enable global financial institutions to “move, manage and tokenize value.” The company is renewing its push to be seen as an innovator after winning a partial victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July. The legal case had hung over the company like a Damocles’ sword; the SEC has signaled that it might appeal the decision, though a federal judge has already ruled against that plan.  “Boosted from a partial victory against the SEC, Ripple’s supporters are now hopeful that banks will begin to adopt XRP for cross-border transactions and other services,” Coin Metrics researchers said in July.  Read More: SEC's Motion to Appeal Loss in Ripple Case Is Denied  Central banks have been looking into central bank digital currencies, and a Bank for International Settlements survey showed that in 2022, some 93% of central banks were engaged in some form of CBDC work. For Ripple, it’s not competition but an opportunity: In May the company started a CBDC platform that will allow central banks to issue their own CBDCs.  In July, the Pacific island of Palau started a stablecoin trial on the XRP ledger. Ripple, which contributes to the ledger, had been providing technical assistance and personnel, and Palau leveraged Ripple’s CBDC platform, a company press release said.  Chainlink  Chainlink, a blockchain data “oracle” that figures large as a source of cryptocurrency price feeds for many decentralized-finance protocols, has broadened its strategy to cooperate with the traditional system via partnerships.  In September 2022, Chainlink announced it was partnering with Swift, an interbank messaging platform, to instruct on-chain token transfers using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol.  In June this year Swift announced it would not only use Chainlink’s CCIP for interoperability between blockchains, but also use CCIP to test connecting over a dozen financial institutions to blockchain networks in experiments. The names included traditional-finance heavyweights Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ), BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Clearstream, Euroclear and Lloyds Banking Group. By August the project had been successfully completed.  Chainlink’s CCIP which, “enables users to programmatically transfer tokens from one blockchain,” went live for early access users in July.  “The real goal here is not only to enable the DeFi (decentralized finance) and public blockchain ecosystem, and it's not only to enable the banks to interconnect their private chains with each other so that CitiBank chain can talk to BNY Mellon chain, BNY chain can talk to Euroclear chain,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk in an interview in July. “What it actually is, is getting both of those groups to work and transact.”  The integration of Web3 with these financial institutions is what will propel the value of the crypto ecosystem, Nazarov said. “What that would mean for the public blockchain ecosystem is that tens of trillions of dollars in value from banks would finally be able to easily flow into public blockchain applications, which would massively increase the market opportunity,” Nazarov said.  At Chainlink’s annual conference in Spain on Monday Nazarov argued that blockchain technology and oracles could make industries like banking and derivatives more verifiable so users can monitor events easier and choose when to opt in and out of networks.  “Firstly, everyone who's in the system would know what they're entering when they do business or put their value in one of these organizations,” he said. “Second, then everyone would know at the same speed as the people in the organization about what's going on with their values. And third of all, if they didn't like what they saw, they could leave.”",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | REGULATION | SPONSORED | XRP,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/04/crypto-vs-banks-its-not-either-or-for-chainlink-ripple,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1f6c29904a74a372570afea3afb24416279f386-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18368265,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554065,1696428032,Ripple Scores 3 Major Wins That Could Drive XRP Price To $1,"Certain events have been touted as being able to impact the XRP price significantly. Some of these events already seem to be happening, raising the hopes of the XRP community that the token could indeed hit $1 before the year runs out. Ripple Expands To Singapore In a statement released on October 3, Ripple announced that its subsidiary had secured a Major Payments Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This announcement comes four months after the company received its in-principle approval from the regulator. Related Reading: XRP Price Disappoints: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why He Will No Longer Accumulate Following this announcement, Ripple is fully licensed to provide “regulated digital payment token services in Singapore.” Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse also confirmed this development on his X (formerly Twitter) platform. With Singapore already housing Ripple’s Asia Pacific headquarters, this move undoubtedly provides the company with momentum to continue expanding to countries in the region (which the company considers one of its fastest growing regions) for the adoption of its “crypto-enabled payments solutions.” Ripple is already enjoying significant success in Asia, with banks in countries like Japan, China, South Korea, Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam adopting the company’s cross-border payment service. Specifically, Japan is believed to have contributed significantly to the trading volume in the XRP ecosystem, with the token enjoying massive adoption among locals. Ripple Secures Another Victory Against The SEC Meanwhile, the crypto firm has more reason to celebrate following another significant victory in its ongoing legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an order given on October 3, Judge Analisa Torres denied the SEC’s motion for certifications of its interlocutory appeal. As to the reason for the denial, she noted that the SEC “failed to meet its burden to show that such an appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” Instead, she reasoned that granting the application could further prolong the action as the interlocutory appeal could open the door to other appeals from a dissatisfied party. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Very Bullish On XRP Price, Sets Make Or Break Point Instead, she stated that the litigation will likely be “expeditiously advanced” if they advance to trial and then appeals come after. That way, the appellate court can review the case based on a complete record rather than considering disjointed legal and factual issues. In line with this, she set April 23, 2024, as when the trial is set to commence. XRP Price Looks Good As Ripple Enters Top 100 Fintech Of 2023 Ripple’s President Monica Lang recently reiterated the company’s intention to continue to expand globally in its bid to disrupt the global financial architecture.

This rally, which began in late September, has propelled ADA’s price up by more than 10% in just one week, measured from its lowest point to the recent peak. Although ADA experienced a retracement in the past few hours, it has managed to retain its overall bullish outlook. The initial signs weren’t entirely encouraging, as evidence from volume indicators hinted at dwindling buying pressure. Nevertheless, the bulls rallied with determination, successfully defending the critical $0.24 level. As of the latest data, ADA is priced at $0.254 on CoinGecko, representing a marginal 3.1% decline over the past 24 hours. However, over the course of the last seven days, it has recorded a noteworthy gain of 5%. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin On Life Support? Analyzing Its Recent Price Downturn ADA Technical Indicators Analysts closely monitoring ADA’s price action have pointed toward a potential move to a range high of $0.28. For traders eyeing long positions, a lower timeframe bullish structure break could provide an entry point, targeting the range’s high. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also made a promising climb back above the neutral 50 mark, while the On-Balance Volume (OBV) exhibits an encouraging uptick. The big question now looms: will the existing demand be sufficient to fuel a sustained rally? Whether this demand will be sufficient to fuel a sustained rally remains a subject of speculation. ADA market cap currently at $9.02 billion.

This opportunity emerges in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent surge, which catapulted it above the $28,000 mark. Analysis suggests that ADA could possibly decouple from broader market trends, presenting traders with a unique opportunity to capitalize on market divergences and seek profit. Cardano seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko ADA has exhibited resilience and determination in the face of fluctuating market dynamics. While initial signs pointed to a faltering of buying pressure, ADA has managed to pivot, defending the $0.24 level and setting its sights on the $0.28 mark.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  A U.S. federal judge has rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) bid to appeal its ground-shaking loss against Ripple, the crypto company associated with the XRP token. XRP’s price rallied about 5% on the news. District Judge Analisa Torres said in a brief ruling on Tuesday that the SEC had failed to meet its burden under the law to show that there were controlling questions of law or that there are substantial grounds for differences of opinion. The decision isn’t a complete loss for the SEC, though. The judge set an April 2024 trial date for other issues that still need resolution. The agency could still try to appeal the entire case following that trial.  The absence of a clear U.S. legal framework for crypto is no bar against pressing fraud charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a filing published early Wednesday morning. Bankman-Fried’s trial began Tuesday. The former CEO of the crypto exchange has pleaded not guilty to allegations he misappropriated customer funds from FTX. Meanwhile lawyers from both sides are still sparring over what evidence the as-yet-unselected jury will be able to hear. The prosecutors are now fighting claims, reiterated by Bankman-Fried on Monday, that the regulatory status of crypto exchanges is relevant.  A new decentralized finance data platform could underpin future regulation of crypto market actors, according to a study released by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Wednesday. Project Atlas has initially been used to map out significant international flows between crypto exchanges, said a proof-of-concept report issued jointly with the Dutch and German central banks. “We are developing a new and important public good for central banks globally,” Cecilia Skingsley, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, said in a statement. “Data on cross-border flows are relevant for areas like payments and macroeconomic analysis.”  Trending Posts  Why Some Crypto Firms Are Suspending Services in the U.K.  No Sam Bankman-Fried Jury Yet; Judge Expects to Cull 50 Prospects Quickly on Wednesday  Crypto-Friendly Congressman McHenry Temporarily Takes Over U.S. House",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/04/first-mover-americas-judge-dismisses-secs-attempt-to-appeal-ripple-ruling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/058267b7b8ee3a27e94682e195769f0040a8c004-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the most notable instances of this happened 9 years ago, and since then, the formation has not returned, until now, signaling a massive price surge in October. DXY Readies To Clock 12th Consecutive Candles In an X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst TheCryptoMann has revealed an important formation in the DXY. The DXY is the United States Dollar Index which measures the value of the dollar to other major (6) currencies around the world. Related Reading: 3 Reasons Why Shiba Inu Price Might See A Massive Surge Over 400% Now, since Bitcoin is often touted as an alternate and better currency to the likes of the US dollar, there is often some competition between them leading to an inverse correlation over the years. This is why this DXY formation is important. As TheCryptoMann points out, the DXY is headed toward a 12th consecutive green candle which is bullish for the crypto market. This is because the last time that this happened was in 2014, and the results were very bullish for crypto. The analyst explains that when this happened in 2014, the DXY had fallen 8%. Crypto had then gone in the opposite direction, mounting a rather impressive rally. A look at the chart shows that in the year 2014, the crypto market went from $5.4 billion to over $8.2 billion, an over 50% surge in price. Total market cap jumps from $5.4 billion to $8.2 billion 2014 | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com A Bullish Time For Crypto TheCryptoMann likens the current movement to what took place in 2014 and actually expects this movement to repeat once more. As he explains, the incoming correction in the DXY will see the crypto market explode as it did 9 years ago. He also points out that “the DXY is also being rejected from the 0.5 FIB Retracement level from its most recent local highs and lows!” He further added: There is a clear inverse correlation between the DXY and the cryptocurrency market. So over the next month, we’re about to see some major price movements, so eyes on the market. Related Reading: Twitter IPO: Dogecoin Takes Center Stage In Elon Musk’s X IPO Rumors Another analyst Cryptoinsighuk also seems to share the views of TheCryptoMann as he also believes there is correction coming for the DXY. “Also, whilst sentiment is this bad we are having the SBF trial.

Just waiting for their confirmation. I think the $DXY will soon turnover. Also, whilst sentiment is this bad we are having the SBF trial.

A similar rally would see the total market cap go from $1.065 trillion currently to over $1.5 trillion, signaling a bullish end to the year 2023.

18363601,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554029,1696417237,Will XRP Price Defy A 50% Stock Market Crash? Analysts Share Predictions,"The financial world is abuzz with speculations on the resilience of cryptocurrencies amidst potential global financial upheavals and a looming recession in the United States. XRP, with its unique standing, has become the centerpiece of these discussions, following a series of comments and analyses from renowned crypto analyst Egrag Crypto. XRP Price Amid A 50% Stock Price Crash On X (formerly Twitter), Egrag took a comprehensive look at the six-month chart of the XRP price, presenting two scenarios that couldn’t be more different: a crash to $0.017 and a rally to $27. The analyst emphasized XRP’s pioneering nature due to the remarkable degree of legal clarity it offers, setting it apart from other digital assets. “The current state of XRP offers a remarkable degree of legal clarity, making it a pioneering digital asset in terms of regulatory acknowledgment,” Egrag stated. This legal acknowledgment, combined with its designed role to simplify cross-border payment solutions, strengthens the case for XRP to potentially rise to a $27 price target, Egrag claims. But his analysis wasn’t purely optimistic. He alerted followers to looming shadows in the broader financial spectrum. Related Reading: Ripple CEO’s Tattoo Predicts XRP Price Surge? Here’s When It Will Hit The Moon A significant number of technical analysts have forecasted a drastic 40%-50% downturn in global equity and stock markets. Egrag pondered the implications of such a downturn on cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. He shared the following chart and warned of a potential sharp XRP price crash: Under such circumstances, a measured move of 0.017c becomes a pertinent consideration. I find myself somewhat perplexed by the dichotomy presented by certain technical analysts who foresee a collapse in traditional markets while advocating for crypto to adhere to its four-year cycle. He further remarked that “it’s imperative to maintain a consistent and non-contradictory thesis when assessing these scenarios,” highlighting the inconsistency of predicting both a market collapse and a steady crypto four-year cycle. Community’s Mixed Responses Feedback on Egrag’s analysis was multifaceted. @300Mill300, a prominent voice in the crypto space, extrapolated from Egrag’s initial analysis and offered a chart that was bullish for XRP. He projected a rally to $1.15 by early 2024, followed by a brief retraction to $0.79, and a subsequent bullish surge to reach $1.40 by the close of 2024. However, the sentiment wasn’t unanimously optimistic. Rainmaker, a crypto aficionado with nearly a decade’s experience, struck a cautionary note. He predicted a pronounced “wash out” preceding each Bitcoin halving event, pushing the XRP price down, possibly to the mid $0.20s. Responding to this, Egrag showcased his balanced stance. While agreeing with Rainmaker about the potential drag of macroeconomic elements on XRP, he remained bullish about XRP’s intrinsic strengths. He noted, “I think the general macro will drag it down but other than that it is solid like a rock.” Stepping into the discussion, Analyst Ata Yurt had a different take. He expressed skepticism about XRP achieving the mentioned price points, stating, “At $0.017 there would be no sellers nor buyers… At $27, there will be no buyers either apart from a small group of FOMO orders, majority will FOMO in at $3 or $5 as those are the expected levels considering previous ATH.” Yurt proposed a more pragmatic approach, suggesting a blend of technical analysis and market psychology. He believes that the $5 mark for XRP is more attainable, urging the community to consider a linear chart for assessment. Related Reading: XRP Price Historical Data Suggests Substantial Q4 Rally Possible Egrag, not one to step back from a discussion, retorted with a thought-provoking question, “Good idea but what if the equity and stock markets crashed 40-50%? Then what?” Yurt countered by estimating the potential fall of Bitcoin in such a scenario, speculating that if Bitcoin were to lag behind and drop by 60%, XRP, in relation to BTC, might settle around the $0.22-$0.25 range, a figure he deemed more realistic than the prediction of Egrag at $0.017. The Bullish Case: XRP To $27? Egrag recently took to social media, highlighting a potential roadmap for XRP’s ambitious journey to $27 through his interpretation of the “XRP ATLAS LINE”. Egrag predicts a near-term positive momentum that could push XRP into the $1.3-$1.5 zone. However, the digital currency might not stay there long, as he anticipates a dip back to the $0.55 region, a crucial breakout retest. Once this phase passes, he sees a dynamic resurgence propelling XRP to its previous highs of $2.8-$3.0. But that’s not the ceiling. Egrag envisions a more aggressive leap into the $13-$15 bracket, although he also foresees a significant sell-off around this price point. His analysis then steers back to a reconnection with earlier levels around $2.8-$3.0 before finally culminating at the coveted $27 mark. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5327.

42392416,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Y5r,1696413600,"No Jury Yet, but We're Getting There","Sam Bankman-Fried had a grin on his face as he entered court on Tuesday morning – clad in a black suit and an uncharacteristically tame (read: closely trimmed) mop of hair. After nine long months, the disgraced crypto founder will finally have the chance to defend himself against a wide array of federal fraud and conspiracy charges tied to the collapse of FTX, his crypto and futures exchange, and Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm he founded and – according to prosecutors – used to illegally re-invest FTX user funds.  The first day of the Bankman-Fried trial was all about voir dire, the process by which a judge, defense, and prosecution worked together to filter more than 80 New Yorkers to a final group of 12 jurors and six alternates. Judge Lewis Kaplan, the judge overseeing the case, peppered the jury pool with questions.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Underscoring the trial’s location in the heart of New York’s financial district – and the scale of Bankman-Fried’s once-giant crypto empire – the initial list of potential jurors included people whose professions overlapped with Alameda and FTX. One potential juror said she had worked until recently at Signature, the crypto-friendly bank that crumbled earlier this year and had ties to Alameda and FTX. Another member of the jury pool said her employer had invested directly in Alameda and FTX.  “Did your employer make or lose money as a result of their investments?” asked Kaplan. “Lost money,” said the juror.  The goal of Kaplan’s questions was to suss out which of the many prospective jurors would be able to serve impartially – a particularly complex endeavor given the headline-grabbing nature of Bankman-Fried’s crypto collapse, as the judge acknowledged at the start of voir dire: “It would not surprise me if some of you have heard about this case.”  When Kaplan asked if anyone in the room had seen a recent 60 Minutes segment – an interview with author Michael Lewis about his just-released book about the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried – at least seven jurors raised their hands (most members of the jury pool were stationed in an overflow room on the first floor of the courthouse).  Bankman-Fried sat silently between his attorneys throughout the bulk of the jury selection process. Mostly, he spent his time pecking away at a laptop keyboard. His attorneys have previously expressed concern that he would not have enough time to review materials or otherwise work on his defense after his bond was revoked in August and he was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center.  Despite the seriousness of the accusations facing Bankman-Fried, his mood from the court’s overflow rooms – where press was sequestered – seemed to range from neutral to positive. The judge himself cracked a few jokes during the jury selection process, though he hammered certain prospective jurors who appeared to be trying very hard to avoid serving for the trial. One prospect tried three different sets of excuses – none of which appeared to convince the judge.  The judge also spoke to Bankman-Fried directly at the beginning of the day, letting the FTX founder know he had the right to testify in his own defense – even if his attorneys didn’t expect or plan for him to do so.  “The decision is up to you,” the judge said, before telling Bankman-Fried how to alert Judge Kaplan that he wished to testify should the defense rest without calling the FTX founder. It’s unclear if Bankman-Fried will actually testify.  What we're expecting  Jury selection should conclude Wednesday, according to Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the trial in the Southern District of New York courthouse. There are around 50 potential jurors remaining, after he dismissed a few dozen during yesterday’s voir dire. Of the remainder, 12 will become jurors and six will be named as alternates, potentially as soon as later Wednesday morning.  The process will see the jurors talk about themselves and their backgrounds briefly so the various attorneys have a better understanding of who they are, the judge said.  The judge expects opening statements to kick off Wednesday. One prosecutor said he expects the Department of Justice’s opening statement to last no longer than 30 minutes, while the defense anticipates taking up to 40 minutes. This means we could begin hearing from witnesses by Wednesday afternoon.

18361981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554038,1696413388,Is Dogecoin On Life Support? Analyzing Its Recent Price Downturn,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the notoriously popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is facing a turbulent period that has left investors and enthusiasts pondering its fate. The central query echoing through the crypto community is a haunting one: Is Dogecoin destined for obscurity? The decline in Dogecoin’s value can be attributed to a confluence of factors, with the broader cryptocurrency market’s downturn chief among them. This overall slump has eroded confidence in the crypto sphere, and Dogecoin hasn’t been spared from the pessimism. Over the past year, Dogecoin’s trajectory has been predominantly bearish, marked by occasional minor price surges that were unfortunately insufficient to counter the prevailing bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Investors Beware: 425 Billion Tokens On The Move – Is It A Sell-Out? Market Downturn And Dogecoin’s Bearish Stint In a sobering turn of events, October witnessed Dogecoin’s price chart painting a bearish engulfing candlestick. This ominous pattern effectively wiped out gains from the previous period, signaling a somber outlook. Currently, DOGE is teetering slightly above the $0.060 horizontal threshold, reflecting the bearish undertones that have gripped the coin’s fortunes. The CoinGecko listing reports DOGE trading at $0.061033, marking a 1.6% decrease over the last 24 hours, and a modest 0.8% gain over the past seven days. DOGE market cap currently at $8.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com One indicator that underscores Dogecoin’s troubled waters is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a metric used to gauge the momentum of a cryptocurrency’s price movements. In this context, readings above 50 and an upward trend suggest that bulls hold the upper hand, while readings below 50 indicate the opposite—bearish sentiments are in play. Unfortunately for Dogecoin enthusiasts, DOGE’s RSI recently faced rejection at the 50 mark and is on a downward trajectory, a telltale sign of a bearish trend in Dogecoin’s price. It’s worth noting, however, that amidst the gloom, an ascending support trendline in the RSI remains intact. This could hint at a glimmer of hope for Dogecoin, though the road ahead remains uncertain. DOGE price action in the last month. Source: Coingecko Global Market Worries Dogecoin’s struggles are not isolated; major cryptocurrencies across the board are grappling with similar challenges. A key concern that has gripped the market is the specter of higher interest rates potentially stalling the housing sector and pushing the global economy toward a recession. This has had a notable impact on the crypto landscape, resulting in a 3% decrease in the global cryptocurrency market capitalization, which currently stands at $1.07 trillion. Dogecoin’s recent slump has left many questioning its viability and future prospects. While the crypto market as a whole navigates choppy waters, Dogecoin finds itself caught in the undertow of uncertainty. Whether it can rise above these challenges and regain its former glory remains a question that only time will answer. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

The then 26-year-old SBF intended to invest these funds in the growing and inefficient crypto markets, capturing price differences across markets and creating high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies to pick up pennies every few seconds.  Most of these were losing bets from the start with Alameda losing millions of dollars in its first months. It lost over $500,000 every day throughout one such month, Lewis wrote, while some trading funds had “simply vanished” due to poor fund management.  Another bot called Modelbot, which was programmed to trade nearly 500 tokens on some thirty exchanges, turned out to be yet another dud initially. It made no distinction between deeply-liquid crypto majors such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) and very thinly-traded memecoins – sparking concerns among early Alameda staff that it could end up evaporating all of the raised money.  The tides finally changed after Gary Wang and Nishad Singh (both FTX directors who have since pled guilty to fraud in the ongoing trial) joined the firm.  Wang is said to have coded a quantitative trading system that finally started to make Alameda money, while Singh put together the pieces to manage the company – putting it on track to what would eventually become the crypto exchange FTX.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/04/sam-bankman-fried-lost-half-a-million-dollars-everyday-after-alameda-launched-michael-lewis-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/507966c5651c101570bbc8ea2d1258dd83091798-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392433,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6ZKn,1696406400,Central Bank Group Unveils Data Project Mapping Crypto Transfers,"Crypto exchange flows are “significant and substantial economically,” said a new study from the Bank for International Settlements examining on- and off-chain data.  Though just a proof of concept, Project Atlas could underpin future crypto regulations, the central banking group said.  A new decentralized finance data platform could underpin future regulation of crypto market actors, according to a study released by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Wednesday.  Project Atlas has initially been used to map out significant international flows between crypto exchanges, said a proof-of-concept report issued jointly with the Dutch and German central banks.  “We are developing a new and important public good for central banks globally,” Cecilia Skingsley, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, said in a statement. “Data on cross-border flows are relevant for areas like payments and macroeconomic analysis.”  “Though relatively small compared with total on-chain network traffic, identified flows between crypto exchanges are significant and substantial economically,” said the study, which initially looked at transactions on the Bitcoin network. “The output of Project Atlas could serve as a starting point for preliminary assessments and inform the drafting of data reporting requirements and regulation of crypto market actors.” The project fuses off-chain data gathered from crypto exchanges with public blockchain data gathered via operating a node, the document said.  Central bankers are looking to gain better knowledge of risks in markets that are often hard to get to grips with. Though BIS first floated the idea of a “cryptocurrency market intelligence platform” in June 2022, more recent crises such as the collapse of the FTX exchange have highlighted the dangers of unregulated actors operating in opaque markets.  The report from BIS, which groups central banks from across the world, warns that crypto data can be “manipulated or distorted.” It cites figures that suggest as much as 70% of activity on some exchanges is wash trading, an outlawed activity in which the same traders buy and sell the same asset in order to mislead and manipulate markets.  Major centralized exchanges such as Binance have sought to assuage investor concerns by publishing details of the wallets they control, a form of assurance known as proof of reserves that BIS says “could be used for novel approaches to data-driven supervision” in the future.

In simple terms, a bearish fractal suggests a potential decline in price. Such a pattern materializes when there’s a peak price with two consecutively lower high bars/candles on its flanks. An up arrow typically marks a bearish fractal, indicating the potential for price descent. Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Could Drop Below $20,000 The essence of this bearish pattern begins with a double top. Contrary to expectations, this double top doesn’t validate with a dip below a significant support level. Instead, the price typically sees a relief rally, forming a lower high, only to crash below the previously mentioned support. This support then morphs into a new resistance level, driving the price further down. This sequence was observed in both 2019 and 2022, and the current market scenario in 2023 mirrors the initial stages of this pattern. Rekt Capital suggests that the market is potentially in the middle of this bearish fractal, with uncertainty around where the relief rally might conclude.

From the beginning of April to the end of August, BTC formed a double-top pattern in the weekly chart. However, the Bitcoin price held above the neckline at around $26,000. Then, in mid-August, BTC started its relief rally which took the price up to $28,600. “We’re probably in the A to B [phase of the] bearish fractal,” the analyst added. Diving deeper into potential scenarios, the analyst believes Bitcoin’s price could rally up to approximately $29,000 before experiencing further declines. Some key events to watch for include potential overextensions beyond the bull market support band. If Bitcoin fails to retest and maintain this band as support after breaking out, the bearish fractal remains valid. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Continue Its Run? These Factors Could Suggest So Another important point to monitor is the revisit of the lower high resistance. Even if the price wicks beyond this resistance, a subsequent rejection would keep the bearish outlook intact. There are, however, criteria that could invalidate this bearish perspective: the bull market support band (blue) consistently holds as support, a weekly close beyond the lower high resistance ($28,000), and breaking past the $31,000 yearly highs. On the topic of other technical indicators, Rekt Capital highlighted that Bitcoin has recently rallied to the 200-week MA. This moving average (MA), however, seems to be acting as a current resistance. Additionally, the 200-week MA aligns with the lower high resistance, presenting a crucial juncture for Bitcoin’s price in the near future. Despite his macro bullish stance on Bitcoin, Rekt Capital cautions that Bitcoin has yet to overcome the $28,000 lower high resistance in the 1-week chart. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is hovering slightly above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement mark. For Bitcoin to avoid a descent beneath the established trend line (represented in black), it’s crucial for it to maintain a position above $27,372.

The absence of a clear U.S. legal framework for crypto is no bar for pressing fraud charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the Department of Justice said in a filing published early Wednesday morning.  Bankman-Fried’s trial began Tuesday. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to allegations he misappropriated customer funds from FTX.  Meanwhile lawyers from both the sides are still sparring over what evidence the as-yet-unselected jury will be able to hear. The prosecutors are now fighting claims, reiterated by Bankman-Fried on Monday, that the regulatory status of crypto exchanges is relevant.  “While the existence of a law might be relevant to establish a statutory duty of care, the absence of regulation is not relevant to whether money was, in fact, entrusted to the defendant’s care by his victims,” the DOJ filing said, adding that the existing criminal rulebook is sufficient. “There are prohibitions on misappropriating customer assets – they are the very laws that the defendant has been charged for violating.”  Prosecutors also dismissed Bankman-Fried’s arguments that pooling and reallocating customer funds was common in the crypto industry at the time, saying that legal argument only worked if he believed the practice was lawful.  Bankman-Fried can point the jury towards his philanthropy and charity work, the DOJ said – but he will need to raise his plans to do so with the court first to ensure he isn’t merely trying to paint a rosier picture of his character.  Congress’s failure to regulate a specific treatment for crypto has been a sore point for the industry for some time. In the absence of tailored laws, federal regulators have argued crypto should be treated like conventional securities trading, a legal claim opposed by major players such as Ripple, Binance and Coinbase (COIN).  The government also clarified how it plans to handle allegations that Bankman-Fried orchestrated illegitimate and indirect donations to political candidates – something that was withdrawn from the charge sheet as it wasn’t included in the original extradition deal with the Bahamas, where the crypto tycoon was arrested in December.  “The Government will not elicit evidence that such a straw donor scheme is itself unlawful under the election laws,” the DOJ said, but was raising the topic “to establish that the defendant spent these funds in a manner inconsistent with his representations to customers, and took steps to conceal his disposition of these proceeds.”  Read all of CoinDesk's coverage here.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/04/lack-of-us-crypto-laws-irrelevant-to-bankman-fried-allegations-doj-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e1f46e024ac913c867577de517fd64efb9c96e0-2957x1663.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392435,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6ZaB,1696404125,Why Some Crypto Firms Are Suspending Services in the U.K.,"New promotions rules that require crypto firms to provide clear risk labels and implement system changes are coming into effect on Oct. 8.  Some international crypto firms serving U.K. clients have decided to pause certain services until they're compliant with the new rules.  Local regulators are concerned some other overseas firms aren't ready to comply with the regime.  Crypto firms serving U.K. customers are getting ready for the country’s tough new rules on advertising, with some announcing they are cutting off local clients from accessing certain services in order to comply.  While the new regime temporarily gives crypto firms the power to authorize their own promotions in the country, only firms that are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as virtual asset service providers get that privilege. The rules also require firms to make significant changes to their online platforms to better warn potential customers of investment risks.  Unregistered firm ByBit has said it is halting services to U.K. clients ahead of Oct. 8, the effective date for the rules. Luno which is also not registered with the FCA is halting some U.K. clients from making crypto investments. Luno, like CoinDesk, is owned by the Digital Currency Group.  While payments giant PayPal said it was suspending some crypto services until it is compliant with the new rules.  Though the FCA consulted on a promotions regime for crypto over a year ago, its guidance only came out a few months back, and “many [firms] feel that there was too short a time period between guidance being issued and the implementation date,” Su Carpenter, director of operations at lobby group CryptoUK said.  “We do know many [firms] are nervous about their interpretation of the guidance and as such will be taking a slow and cautious approach to their future financial promotions,” Carpenter said.  The FCA is letting firms apply for a three-month extension to make the necessary changes. “These rules require significant system builds and operational changes,” the regulator said.  But officials at the FCA told CoinDesk in a Monday interview that the regulator was concerned some international firms were not very interested in complying with the regime.  Read more: UK Financial Regulator Warns Crypto Firms of Jail Time for Unauthorized Ads  It’s technical  Any invitations or benefits offered to a person such as cash or goods to invite investment would be classed as a financial promotion under the FCA regime.  “Essentially, all communications to U.K. consumers in relation to crypto assets which could be seen as an invitation or inducement to invest, must comply with the rules,” said Asim Arshard senior associate at law firm Lawrence Stephens.  For crypto firms, that largely operate online, complying means making changes to their websites. The FCA said earlier this month that firms had faced significant challenges trying to implement a 24-hour cooling period for first-time buyers that requires platforms to wait at least a day for users to re-confirm they want to receive invitations to invest. Firms have also struggled to put in place measures to assess if certain products are appropriate for clients, according to the regulator.  “We’ve just been working as quickly as possible to kind of develop the back-end platform changes that are necessary as well as reviewing our content to make sure it’s fair, clear and obviously in line with the new guidelines,” Moonpay’s Deputy General Counsel Matt Sullivan said.  “I think the FCA set a pretty aggressive schedule. But again, I think the FCA showed their flexibility and their kind of business-orientated approach by pushing the deadline,” Sullivan said, adding that his company will be applying for the extension.  Crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Bitpanda, Kraken and crypto platform Zumo, which are registered with the FCA, also told CoinDesk they were not planning to halt operations.  “The firm is preparing for the new crypto asset financial promotions regime and does not have plans to suspend services to existing U.K. customers at this time,” a Bitpanda spokesperson said.  Unregistered companies – whose ads are not authorized – have to stop communicating crypto services to U.K. clients to comply with the upcoming rules.  Unregistered Companies  Some crypto exchanges have announced they are pulling back from serving some or most U.K. clients in light of the new rules. Bybit said it will suspend U.K. operations and Luno is planning to stop some U.K. clients from investing in crypto.  The FCA declined to comment on individual firms, but an official told CoinDesk on Monday that “where firms are making decisions to actually get to the standards we want to see, that’s really positive.”  Officials said the regulator is concerned by a lack of engagement from some unregulated overseas firms in complying with the rules.  Many companies that failed to register with the FCA under its anti-money laundering register continued serving U.K. clients from overseas, CoinDesk reported in February. But that may be difficult under the new regime.  “If you are an unregistered provider the loopholes that were available to you start getting closed down and people that were relying on reverse solicitation, or they were relying on arguments that they didn’t actually provide the service from the U.K. and things like that. It’s much harder to take those views,” Diego Ballon Ossio, partner at Clifford Chance law firm said. Reverse solicitation is the argument that clients approach a company first.  Read more: UK Crypto Firms and Regulator Blame Each Other for Industry Exodus  The promotions regime looks to see if any communication, whether it’s the first solicitation or ongoing business communication, contains a promotional element, Ballon Ossio added.  Overseas firms can either register with the FCA to be able to approve their own promotions or get an authorized company to do so for them, Ballon Ossio said.  However, crypto advocates fear that not many authorized firms would be willing to approve crypto ads, and the industry’s reputation especially following 2022’s stunning market collapse doesn’t help.  Next year, the FCA will slap firms that approve others’ ads with additional requirements such as having to continuously monitor promotions. This will make it “really hard to find somebody who meets all the criteria, who is authorized, instead of registered, that is willing to take on the liability,” Ballon Ossio said.

Zeberg’s predictions are based on the BTC/SPX Ratio, an indicator that compares Bitcoin’s performance to the S&P 500 index (SPX). BTC/SPX Ratio Says There Is A Monster Move Incoming Despite recent fluctuations and concerns about the crypto market’s sustainability, Zeberg remains bullish on BTC. In the analyst’s view, the BTC/SPX Ratio offers strong evidence that the Bitcoin uptrend is “just starting.” Based on price movements, the current leg down in September could provide opportunities for traders to accumulate. The BTC/SPX Ratio is an indicator that assesses the relative performance of Bitcoin and the stock market. The ratio is derived from dividing the Bitcoin and S&P 500 index (SPX) spot prices. When it is rising, like it is presently the case, it indicates that Bitcoin is outperforming the stock market. Conversely, a declining ratio suggests that Bitcoin is underperforming. In that case, banking on the stock market could generate better returns than HODLing BTC. Related Reading: Twitter IPO: Dogecoin Takes Center Stage In Elon Musk’s X IPO Rumors From the chart shared on October 3, Zeberg said a “bull” signal was triggered in February 2023, preceding a substantial rally in Bitcoin’s price. By July 2023, Bitcoin had surged to approximately $32,000. While there has been a cooling-off period since then, Bitcoin is trending above February highs at around $25,200, confirming the uptrend. Between April 2019 and May 2021, when a similar bull signal was printed, BTC soared by 6X, while the S&P 500 saw a more modest increase of 41%. Zeberg’s assessment, based on the BTC/SPX Ratio, suggests that Bitcoin–and other risk assets, by extension, can post strong gains in the months ahead. Will Bitcoin Fly To $200,000 This Bull Run? Whether this will be printed or not can only be speculated. Looking at the BTC/SPX Ratio, the indicator is lagging and doesn’t precisely capture market peaks or bottoms. For instance, the last bear signal in May 2021 was months ahead before Bitcoin peaked in November 2021 and fell. Therefore, while the bull signal was recorded in early February 2023, it is unclear whether there will be another leg down before prices rise or bears press on, pushing the coin back to 2022 lows.

Profit-Taking Spikes To High Levels If buyers take control and the BTC/SPX Ratio indicator is correct, it is impossible to determine how high BTC will rise at current rates. If the last bull run is anything to go by, BTC may surge by 6X. In that case, BTC may rally and push beyond $200,000 in this bull cycle.

Unveiled during a recent Ripple party held to celebrate the legal triumph on July 13, the tattoo has captured widespread attention, triggering discussions and conjecture about its potential significance. And as for any “announcement” that people are wondering about, tonight’s event is just a celebration…but I will share my recent addition: pic.twitter.com/q4THzsr4Fp — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) September 29, 2023 Related Reading: Bitcoin News: Revival Of “Satoshi Nakamoto” Account Could Signal Slump In BTC Price? Ripple CEO’s Intriguing Tattoo Sparks Speculation The tattoo, prominently displayed on Garlinghouse’s arm, features a combination of intriguing symbols, including the XRP logo, moon, planets, rocket, and constellations. XRP enthusiasts have been dissecting these elements in search of hidden messages and insights into Ripple’s long-term plans. Some interpret the tattoo as a bold statement of confidence in XRP’s prospects. In contrast, others delve deeper into its symbolism, particularly regarding the next anticipated XRP price surge date. Jeremy Hogan, a prominent lawyer supporting XRP, has taken on the role of decoding the tattoo’s cryptic meaning. According to Hogan, the tattoo’s elliptical shape represents the solar eclipse that will occur on April 8th, as observed from the coordinates 37°46′39″N 122°24′59″W. Notably, this elliptical path intersects with the full “moon” when viewed from northern latitudes. Many within the XRP community have embraced this interpretation, considering it a potential indication of an upcoming bull run. Historical patterns in the cryptocurrency market are worth considering to bolster this hypothesis regarding a potential price surge on April 8 or in the first half of 2024. These patterns lend credibility to the notion that significant events, such as the Bitcoin halving, can influence market trends. In April, the next Bitcoin halving is expected, marking a reduction in the mining reward for Bitcoin. Past halving events have often coincided with notable price increases for Bitcoin, suggesting a potential positive impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. Moreover, another crucial factor that could propel XRP to new heights is the possibility of another legal victory against the US SEC. Such a win could restore confidence and open doors for further adoption and usage of the token. Although the outcome remains uncertain, these developments contribute to an atmosphere of anticipation within the crypto community. XRP Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages After experiencing a prolonged downward trend over the past three months, the price of XRP has now dipped below two critical levels: its 200-day and 50-day Moving Averages (MAs). These MAs have proven to be significant obstacles to the token’s potential for future growth, suggesting the possibility of a retracement or consolidation phase below current price levels. Related Reading: Cardano To Shed Its Gains? Profit-Taking Spikes To High Levels XRP is trading at $0.5117, positioned below the 200-day MA of $0.5196 and the 50-day MA of $0.5290. These levels now serve as resistance barriers for the token, making it more challenging for XRP to regain upward momentum. Another noteworthy indicator of the unsuccessful attempt to penetrate upper resistance lines is XRP’s squeeze momentum indicator and ADX. The squeeze momentum indicator indicates a downward slump in what was anticipated to be an upward movement, impeded by the resistance barriers. Additionally, the ADX reflects declining buying activity and bullish momentum among investors and bulls. The future course of XRP remains uncertain, as it is yet to be determined whether the token will succumb again to a wave of selling pressure or remain in a consolidation phase below these critical levels, potentially delaying another uptrend.

The analyst studied the top 100 cryptocurrencies as they stood in December 2017 and found that the fortunes of these digital assets varied significantly over the past six years. Related Reading: Crypto Fund Flows: Bitcoin Leads As Solana Follows, But Why’s Ethereum Left Behind? From Prominent To Obscure: The Rise And Fall Of 2017’s Crypto Stars Six years in the financial world is relatively short, but it can seem like an eternity for the fast-paced crypto market. An X (formerly known as Twitter) user named davanai shared his analysis of the top 100 cryptos in 2017, revealing some startling figures. Out of the top 10 cryptos, New Economic Movement (XEM) is the only one that has dropped out of the top 100 list. On the other hand, previous giants like Monero and Dash are teetering on the brink of exiting the elite group. Amid these declines, the twin towers of the crypto world, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have held their positions at 1st and 2nd spot, respectively. XRP, among the most discussed cryptos in the 2017 bull run, has slipped only slightly to the 5th position. Cardano (ADA), too, while losing two spots, remains in the top ten. However, not all stories are of resilience. Populous Coin (PPT), once the 19th largest crypto, is now a shadow of its former self, trading at 99.97% below its all-time high. Distinguishing The Winners From The Losers Interestingly, the analyst classified 27 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies as “scams”. While this doesn’t directly confirm any deceit, these digital currencies have nearly vanished in terms of market presence and activity. Out of the top 100, just 21 achieved record highs during the initial three months of 2021, while 68 remain below their highest valuations from 2017 or “almost a scam,” according to the analyst.

Binance Coin (BNB), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have defied the broader trend, proving that it’s not all doom and gloom in the altcoin world. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Price Vs.
