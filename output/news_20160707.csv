42399112,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQnu,1467925660,Bitcoin Remittance Startup Freemit to Close Amid Funding Shortfall,"Bitcoin remittance startup Freemit is officially closing its doors, two years after it first began an effort to build a remittance service.  CEO John Biggs, a former editor for TechCrunch, said that the decision to shutter the operation came after a ""perfect storm"" of a lack of a viable product to show investors and, consequently, the inability to raise funds.  Though Biggs said he’s not disillusioned with the technology as a result of the experience, he warned that he believes bitcoin entrepreneurs are giving up control of a technology meant to empower consumers to large banks.  Biggs told CoinDesk:  ""You don’t want to start a bitcoin company right now. There’s a short window between when banks are going to start taking over and when guys with new functionality are going to be able to contribute.""  Founded in December 2014, Freemit was originally designed to be an optimized exchange, but after raising $150,000 from angel investors, the startup pivoted to peer-to-peer payments.  Freemit, Biggs said, employed as many as 10 people and went through two development teams, however, with over 8,000 beta users, it was still unable to deliver functioning tech.  Biggs went into additional detail about the company's difficulties in a blog post published earlier today.  Bitcoin vs banks  In a series of articles published over the past few months, Biggs had taken aim at what he describes as bitcoin entrepreneurs ceding control of the technology's future to existing financial intuitions.  According to Biggs, banks and financial institutions are making more progress than bitcoin entrepreneurs because of ""a lack of telling a sane and understandable story"".  Going forward, Biggs says he plans to continue contributing to TechCrunch, but hasn’t made any concrete plans for the future. While he says he hasn't given up on his desire to help develop technologies around bitcoin, he’s also reluctant to start another company.  Biggs explained:  ""What’s going to happen is they’re going to get eaten up. The small players are going to fall by the wayside and the big players are going to be assimilated.""

42399108,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQjy,1467919146,UK Government Trials Blockchain Welfare Payments System,"The UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions is spearheading an experiment in which a blockchain system is used to distribute welfare payments.  The department has partnered with UK-based banking institution Barclays, the UK arm of German energy firm RWE, fintech startup GovCoin and University College London.  The project was unveiled during a payments conference earlier this month during a talk given by David Freur, state minister for welfare reform. As quoted by regulatory data provider PaymentsCompliance, Freud suggested that the project's success or failure would be determined by the impact on those receiving welfare payments.  Freud reportedly told attendees:  ""We started a small trial in the north west, designed to see if we can send welfare payments using this technology, and more importantly, to see if people reliant on welfare payments would benefit from this approach.""  The system is said to entail a mobile app and a blockchain system that records payments sent or received by welfare recipients.  Notably, the trial was foreshadowed in a major report released by the UK Government Office for Science in January, which called for the government to conduct experiments using the technology.  The report directly refers to a hypothetical ""system to manage welfare support payments for the Department for Work and Pensions"", going on to highlight its potential security needs should it be built.

42399113,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQps,1467907640,Bitcoin Halving 2016: Will the Price Rise or Fall?,"2016 has become a year of revival for the bitcoin price.  At a press time total of $640, the price of bitcoin is up nearly 50% from its opening on 1st January. While macroeconomic factors including uncertainty in China and Europe have arguably played a role, there may be no bigger influence than the upcoming halving, a rare network event that will occur this weekend.  While nobody knows for certain how the long-awaited reduction in rewards to miners will affect the network, market experts offered a range of predictions when speaking with CoinDesk on how it may impact the price of bitcoin.  Some forecasted the event would push prices higher, while others expected it to have a depressing effect or no impact at all on bitcoin prices. Market experts also offered a range of predictions for how the halving will affect bitcoin volatility.  For background, bitcoin miners use high-power computers to compete to add blocks of transaction data to the bitcoin blockchain. Every time a miner successfully completes a new block and provides a proof of work, that miner receives a reward. This reward, which was originally 50 BTC, is expected to drop to 12.5 BTC on or around 9th July.  Over time, this reward will continue to ""halve"", until the network creates 21 million bitcoins, the current cap on how many will be issued.  Market observers have been aware of the upcoming halving for years, a development recognized by Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.  In his words, anticipation for the event has been ""building up over the past few months"", which means investors betting on certain expectations will soon meet reality, and readjust positions accordingly.  Price rally predictions  Some market experts have predicted the digital currency will keep rising after the halving.  Among those is Joe Lee, founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, who told CoinDesk he expects prices to move higher in the days following this event. However, he added that ""in the short term"", the halving will not impact price significantly.  Investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham also expects a price rally should the number of bitcoin owners willing to sell decline. Under these conditions, bitcoin prices should enjoy ""slow but steady increases,"" he said.  In addition, a short squeeze could materialize as a result of some miners coming under pressure, forcing the price to move up rapidly.  Lee told CoinDesk he foresees some ""short-term volatility led by speculative trading activity"", but emphasized that this development will have ""a limited effect on price"".  Lingham, however, stressed that ""bitcoin is always volatile"", adding:  ""The biggest mistake we can all make it is to believe that the price will always rise even when confronted with changes in the macro, political and technology landscapes.""  Potential price declines  Lingham noted that while everything might be fine after the halving, the event could trigger a number of unforeseen possibilities, the impact of which is impossible to know in advance.  The event has ""technical and economic repercussions"" that market analysts have not incorporated into bitcoin’s price, he contends.  Depending on how things turn out following the halving, Lingham projects bitcoin could enter a ""longer term (3-6 month) consolidation phase"" following halving day where it seeks ""a new price floor with high volatility"" that he guesses could be ""in the $400-$500 range"".  While Lingham identified unforeseen events as potentially driving bitcoin prices lower, Zivkovski noted that the excitement the market has built up for the halving won’t last forever.  ""We expect this buy pressure to subside in the weeks following the halving, culminating in large profit-taking events for early accumulators ($200-$300 buyers),"" he said.  This profit taking will push bitcoin prices ""down to historical support levels,"" he predicted. Though, he cautioned he lacks the data for this belief.  Rik Willard, founder and managing director of Agentic Group LLC, revealed that he also foresaw a decline in bitcoin prices, although he expected this drop to be temporary.  ""I think that, like a stock split, we will see a natural initial devaluation per bitcoin,” he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""That said, I expect the price to rise almost to current levels rather more quickly than if it were an actual stock, based on extreme bullishness from the sector.""  Based around this expectation, Willard indicated he did not anticipate significant volatility resulting from the halving event. Zivkovski provided a similar point of view, emphasizing that volatility ""was not substantial"" the last time a halving took place.  ""We expect volatility to be relatively normal this time around as well, at and around the halving, because the event is already well-priced in,"" he said.  Maintaining the status quo  While the aforementioned experts spoke to rallies and declines, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX, asserted that the halving will have no impact on the market.  ""My baseline projection is that the halving will have zero effect on the bitcoin price,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The reduction of bitcoin inflation is such a small amount compared with averaged daily trading volume that is a well hyped distraction.""  He elaborated by stating that if bitcoin’s price were still between $300 and $400, the “halving might have a significant impact on whether miners continued operations"", but that at $600 to $700, he doesn't believe it will be a factor.  Daniel Masters, who runs the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, told CoinDesk that he believes the halving won’t have much impact on bitcoin prices, at least initially.  While some might look to halving events with anxiety, speculating that it may make it economically unfeasible for some miners to stay in business, Lee asserted that many in the bitcoin community take a different tack.  ""The community views halving events as a sign of network maturity,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The halving represents a huge milestone for the field of computer science as it represents the world’s largest and most powerful (cryptographically secure) distributed computing project.""

42399109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQkx,1467900509,Bitfury Releases Proposal for Bitcoin Lightning Micropayments Routing,"Bitfury Group, in collaboration with the open-source Lightning Network community, has released a white paper that explores how the in-development micropayments protocol could more effectively route bitcoin payments between users when launched.  Long an outstanding question facing the Lightning Network, one of the more acclaimed proposals aimed at scaling the bitcoin network to accommodate higher transaction volumes, the 40-page white paper introduces a new routing system it calls Flare, which employs a hybrid of existing strategies for path discovery and selection in decentralized systems.  Overall, the system is perhaps best described as a proposal for how the Lightning Network could manage trade-offs between performance, scalability and centralization while offering a network model that does not assume hostile behavior.  In interview, members of both Bitfury and the Lightning Network community sought to position the paper as a successful collaboration that shows how different stakeholders in the bitcoin community are coming together to forge ahead on difficult technical challenges.  For its part, Bitfury lauded the Lightning Network as an ""unparalleled solution"" to scaling the bitcoin blockchain, one that it would support as a way to enable financial inclusion, as well as non-financial uses of blockchain technology.  ""We decided to collaborate with the Lightning Network team on this project because we believe the Lightning Network will bring scalability to the bitcoin blockchain that is of orders of magnitude beyond what the blockchain can currently support,"" Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov told CoinDesk.  The paper, released today, was authored by Bitfury researchers Pavel Prihodko, Slava Zhigulin, Mykola Sahno and Aleksei Ostrovskiy, as well as new Lightning employee Olaoluwa Osuntokun. It presents a new way for how Lightning Networks could map routing paths, as well as execute routing on-demand.  In more simplistic terms, Lightning co-founder Joseph Poon described the paper as one that moves Lightning Network away from the earlier hub-and-spoke routing models that were critiqued by members of the community as likely to lead to a more centralized node network.  ""With payment channels, there could be millions or hundreds of thousands of nodes connected with each other. This explores how the network could find a path from sender to recipient in a decentralized way,"" Poon told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It shows that nodes can have a partial view, but find everyone with a high probability.""  Node neighborhoods  Perhaps the most important new concept introduced by the Flare proposal is the concept of having Lightning nodes also act as ""beacon nodes"", which would provide other nodes with visibility in a local radius.  Osuntokun explained that, rather than creating a hierarchy of nodes, Flare would allow nodes to select peers to behave as ""landmark nodes"" that would help others identify how to manage steps needed to relay a payments.  ""As a result, a node’s network view is fog of war like, with strong visibility close in a local radius, boosted by random feeler connections farther away. This allows a node to maintain routing state with space complexity logarithmic with respect to total network size, while ensuring reachability to all other nodes with high probability,” the white paper reads.  However, Osuntokun sought to emphasize that this is just one possible solution for Lightning Network routing, and that the team behind the proposal is open to feedback.  ""We’re not promising this is the one true way. This strategy, I think, could work fairly well in terms of where bitcoin is headed and that will allow iterative improvements,"" Poon said.  Poon further suggested that the work being conducted for Lightning could have broader implications for mesh networks, thereby decentralizing the Internet more broadly.  ""If you have a mesh network and you want to pay your neighbors for routing to the Internet, it’s the same tech and it’s a clear application,"" he continued.  Simulation stage  While a step forward, all parties acknowledged that this proposal is at the simulation stage, and that work will need to be done to validate the technology.  For the white paper, the Bitfury and Lightning Network estimate that the network could scale to accommodate ""millions"" of users, a figure that may or may not be enough to accommodate more than bitcoin’s existing users.  ""Simulations show it is enough to store paths to about the square root of the number of nodes in the network (provided nodes are reasonably well connected). For a network with 100,000 nodes, it is enough to store paths to just 600 nodes,"" the paper reads.  In addition, the paper states concerns that still linger about how Lightning Network could be successfully deployed, noting for instance, that one of the unsolved issues is how the network will incentivize a large number of global nodes to stay online simultaneously.  Elsewhere, the paper is similarly measured about challenges ahead, discussing how scaling this network of nodes is another challenge.  ""Unless the network functions efficiently, there may be little incentive for people to put their bitcoin in LN channels. Ideally, a wide array of industry and community participants would run LN nodes, helping to bootstrap the network,"" the paper notes.  Bitfury's new direction  The release also represents a significant investment from Bitfury, the bitcoin mining specialist that has been diversifying its interest into blockchain technology more generally.  For example, Vavilov said that Lightning Network is now one of the company’s “top priorities”, and that it will continue to research and test flare. Vavilov said the company has five full-time employees working on Lightning, as well as forthcoming software offerings.  Going forward, Vavilov said he sees a potential for some of this work to be commercialized, if successful.  ""We are in early stages of testing and research. If the Lightning Network is successful, there are many potential uses and opportunities for commercialization,"" he said, concluding:  ""We are heavily invested in improving the scalability of the bitcoin blockchain, and will continue to explore partnerships that bring about this reality.""

42399114,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQot,1467892812,Why Blockchain Immutability is a Perpetual Motion Claim,"Chris DeRose is a journalist, software developer, bitcoin evangelist, public speaker and lead developer of Drop Zone.  In this feature, DeRose discusses immutability and why he believes excessive marketing has lead to confusion over how blockchain systems can obtain this feature, and whether the feature is even technically possible.  Immutability!  It's the buzzword that magically transforms a simple database into the next milliondollar VC fundraise. However, most of the projects that advertise this feature are not being entirely honest about just what kind of immutability they're offering. And it's becoming increasingly clear that nearly all of these claims are at best, hyperbolic.  So what is immutability? Immutability is the feature of a blockchain that persists data forever, free from censorship and despite the disincentives to do so for some period of time. Typically, ""forever"".  Prior to blockchain, immutability existed in closed systems, through the benevolence of a custodian. After blockchain, or so the thinking goes, such immutability is simply a magical property of blockchains.  But, nothing could be further from the truth.  Defining immutability  For most in the bitcoin world, immutability is only available through proof of work. Outside the bitcoin space, others have little apprehension about claiming that their systems are similarly immutable.  But, arguments over energy consumption aside, the truth in the matter is that immutability is rare in all blockchains, bitcoin included.  Most blockchains promote a system whereby data is syndicated to all peers participating in the network in what could be called 'folders'. These folders are cryptography signed by network participants and broadcast to all parties. The marketing literature in the industry would have its readers believe that because these folders are signed, somehow they are required to be kept by all peers thereafter.  However, such a mechanism is very analogous to how secure transactions are bundled in existing databases and message passing systems. Even the lowly protocol ""SMTP"", by which we send our e-mail, supports the sending of multiple messages in a single, encrypted request, and such batch operations are common throughout most server inter-messaging protocols.  So what is it about blockchain that's any different? Well, not much.  At first glance, bitcoin full nodes would seem to force upon its participants the need to store data. However, efforts are consistently being made by the Bitcoin Core team to reduce these storage requirements.  With ethereum, 'pruning' is a feature that is consistently promoted as a design goal. And to all of the coders in the blockchain space, immutability is starting to become regarded as a bug, and not a feature.  Space constraints  Why? The obvious reason is that this feature is inordinately expensive.  Mobile clients don't have the disk space needed to retain all transactions in a network, nor do users want to bear the inordinate startup times required to spool up a node and download all the transactions that have occurred.  As a network grows, the bandwidth requirements become significant, and the response times that deal with having to track system state grow similarly.  This overhead becomes particularly pronounced with respect to low-overhead systems.  Should IoT become a mainstream goal of 'blockchain', it would be unreasonable to expect your toaster to include the resources needed to maintain the data of all toasters worldwide, for the entire history of IoT toasting.  So, how exactly does one force immutability in their blockchain? Either by actively paying for it, or conversely, by incurring cost-based risks in the network consensus for those that don't store your data.  Available options  For those who store their data 'immutably' in bitcoin, there are currently two competing options for doing so: ""OP_RETURN"", and 'Transaction Output' (TXO) encodings. OP_RETURN is a relatively recent invention designed to give programmers an easy way to encode their data into transactions without encumbering the function of the blockchain.  This mechanism is popular with such meta-protocols as Omni, Open Assets, Blockstack and Factom. ""TXO"" encoding is less popular, and is used by projects such as Counterparty and Drop Zone.  So what's the difference?  TXO encodings disguise data as user addresses, making them indistinguishable from actual user addresses to relays. OP_RETURN encodings label the data simply as 'data', and make no pretense in disguising the encoded data as a network user's value transfer.  So, why would anyone want to encode data as an address? Well, that's what keeps the network from discarding that data.  For a blockchain, keeping track of outputs is essential to keeping in 'sync' with the network, and should a node discard an actual user's outputs, that node stands to become a victim of a double spend in the case that this user subsequently spends money.  It is in this way that the nodes are incentivized to track this data – it will literally cost them money to not do so.  Further, it is very difficult (and currently impossible) for the network to discard data that is merely disguised as a blockchain user's wallet. Unfortunately for blockchain designers, this is where the economic realities of immutability get particularly disconcerting.  Cost benefits  Immutability is expensive.  The bitcoin developers are constantly vigilant about trying to filter these 'disguised' users as much as possible. Depending on how they're encoded, these transaction outputs (particularly the unspent outputs) often need to be kept in the most expensive memory of network nodes – RAM.  Placing the data in this location reduces the number of participants on the blockchain, and increases the time needed to process transactions. For any educated blockchain engineer, this feature is seen an enormous externality cost that creates a tragedy of the commons for all participants in the network.  It is probable that bitcoin will proceed in a manner whereby immutability is treated as a bug, and not a feature, and where 'full nodes' delete data more often than it is saved.  For non-bitcoin systems, these problems are even more compounded. Many of the systems being pitched as 'immutable' have no incentive structures for nodes to retain data that doesn't concern them, and these data are often even more trivially discarded than are bitcoin's ""OP_RETURN"".  Much like SMTP (the technology behind email), nodes store only the messages that are relevant to themselves. This 'feature' of not storing irrelevant data is what allows the global email systems to process so many messages and scale to the needs and size of the entire human population.  For those that believe blockchains enable immutability, a reckoning will soon be in order.  Perpetual motion claim  Who will hold the world's data, and what incentives will blockchain providers actually be able to provide their users to achieve this goal?  While many have been caught up in the hype behind immutability, most of these claims will at best regress to the basic signing mechanisms that have been in place for decades, with little to differentiate their systems from incumbent message passing solutions.  On paper, immutability sounds nice, it seems to be a dubious proposition that some magically benevolent server will show up to perform this service. And certainly, blockchain will not make that benevolence any easier than it is with incumbent HTTP systems.  Purchasers of blockchain systems should ask basic questions about how and why their competing institutions will store their data, as it's becoming increasingly certain that should any of these systems actually achieve scale, that promise will quickly be broken.  As for bitcoin's promises of immutability, it remains to be seen what actions will be taken to prune the TXO-based storage, but judging by recent activity in the bitcoin developers community, it would appear that benevolence is increasingly the favored opinion.  While the world searches for uses of blockchains outside the realm of monetary value transfer, it would seem that programmers will soon find that their solutions will regress to the economic realities that faced the original ""decentralized"" technology, the Internet itself.  Or, put more simply, the unlimited immutability of 'blockchain' may just end up being a perpetual motion claim, whose reality will soon catch up with the limited resources of the 'decentralized' Internet that we already know and love.
