42427671,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2oRh,1501702219,UASF Revisited: Will Bitcoin's User Revolt Leave a Lasting Legacy?,"Attention this week has so far focused on a group of bitcoin users that successfully split off the blockchain to form their own cryptocurrency.  But fascinating as the real-time market creation of Bitcoin Cash has been, for those who have closely watched developments, August 1 marked another lesser-acknowledged milestone – the passing of the deadline for a controversial scaling proposal Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 148.  That's when a vocal group of users had scheduled a so-called ""Independence Day."" The goal was to push through a long-stalled coding optimization called Segregated Witness (SegWit), designed to increase and redefine the network's capacity. The software upgrade would find node operators (users who store transaction history) initiating the move, hoping to lead the way for miners and startups.  And while it's faded a bit into the background, you could argue that, even amidst a busy season for scaling proposals, BIP 148 was perhaps the most influential.  The scaling ""agreement"" Segwit2x followed soon after, proposing to add a feature that BIP 148 wouldn't have provided: a boost to the block size parameter. Bitcoin Cash was even more explicitly a response to BIP 148 – hence, why both were scheduled for the same day.  But those two proposals had one other thing in common, and that was giving some degree of power over the software transition to the miners that secure the blockchain.  Before its introduction, for example, SegWit had stalled for months due to its reliance on the idea miners would signal support to activate the change. However, only about 25 to 50% of mining pools did so from November to June.  Then, suddenly, two weeks before the scheduled UASF, and with little time to spare, mining pools rallied around either Segwit2x or BIP 91 on its own, to activate SegWit.  UASF supporters don't see this as a coincidence.  Blockchain startup founder Ragnar Lifthrasir, a public UASF proponent, told CoinDesk:  ""UASF worked as designed and predicted, it is activating SegWit.""  Balance of power  It's a narrative that adds evidence to the idea that some changes to the bitcoin protocol (and perhaps all public blockchains) are destined to be political.  As ethereum classic and bitcoin cash have now proved, there's capital to be created in splits. The more nuanced argument is that they also seek to aid research and understanding of the science behind open blockchains, though with economic risk to users.  In bitcoin, it could be said the scaling debate has called to mind the balance of power between its major network participants – startups, miners, developers and users. And the argument continues to be that UASF was a movement of the people, one that like any social revolution, was perhaps destined to be feared by the powers that be.  While bitcoin users may be predisposed to such narratives, it's certainly one that has resonated with supporters.  ""We found out that not just miners, but some VCs and bitcoin startups didn't like the power of users, that's why they came up with Segwit2x, to obscure UASF's success and precedent,"" Lifthrasir he said.  He argues that it was a question of incentives. Mining pools didn’t want to risk that their 12.5 bitcoin block rewards (worth approximately $33,000 today) would be rejected, but they didn't want to support the UASF effort.  ""This means hashing power follows nodes and users, not the reverse,"" Lifthrasir argued, and he isn't the only UASF supporter to feel this way (or that this is important).  ""Basically, BIP 148 was an early success,"" remarked Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, one of the UASF's more ardent supporters.  Lasting impact  In the end, BIP 148 was sidestepped by another network proposal. But it's the mere threat of action, supporters argue, was enough.  Calin Culianu, a developer for Bitcoin Cash, the version of the bitcoin protocol boasting no SegWit and 8MB blocks, even agreed that Segwit2x was likely a response to BIP 148 on some level.  Although, Culianu has a different way of thinking about it, arguing that BIP 148 supporters used scare tactics to make it sound like it had more support than it did.  ""Miners got antsy, people got scared and everyone met in New York to hash out a plan,"" he said, alluding to how Segwit2x was originally determined.  The question now seems whether this tactic is good for bitcoin's development.  Culianu almost seesawed on the question of whether UASF was a good thing for his project, as it could be said it spurred the ""big block movement"" to action.  He concluded:  ""UASF was the spark that made all this happen, for better or for worse.""

Dubbed Ethfinex, the service aims to function as a decentralized exchange for tokens under the ERC20 standard. Bitfinex, founded in 2012, is one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges by volume, encompassing more than 20 percent of exchange-based trading volume in the past week, according to data from Bitcoinity.  In its announcement, Bitfinex invoked last summer's $60 million hack – as well as the tokens it issued in the wake of that incident to reimburse user loses – as driving factors toward its push to rethinking how a cryptocurrency exchange could be structured. The issuance of the token, Bitfinex argued, ""proved a powerful lesson in the capacity of exchange decentralisation.""  In addition to serving as a trading platform, Bitfinex said that Ethfinex will also be an information center for ethereum and token-based projects.  As the firm's blog post describes:  ""Spun out of Bitfinex, Ethfinex brings with it the vision of a customer-centric and highly liquid digital asset exchange platform. Ethfinex will be a hybrid community and information hub for developers, traders and enthusiasts alike, designed to facilitate discussion, development and trading in the ethereum ecosystem.""  The exchange will notably feature a token of its own, called the Nectar token (or NEC), though Bitfinex has said that it will forego a crowdsale – rather, the token will be distributed to market makers as a kind of loyalty point, which can be redeemed for a percentage of trading fees each month.  This token will also be used to advise on governance decisions, and larger holders, according to the Ethfinex white paper, will in time have the ability to elect members of an advisory board if they hold 5 percent or more of the total amount of NEC tokens.  Trading of the NEC token will be limited to those who elect to register with the market-maker loyalty initiative. US residents, according to the white paper, won't be allowed to join that program or conduct trades in the exchange's NEC marketplace.

42427670,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2oLh,1501689623,Chilean Regulator: Central Bank Cryptocurrencies May Be 'Many Years Away',"The head of Chile's central bank has said he believes a central bank-issued digital currency may be ""many years"" from coming to fruition.  Mario Marcel, the governor of the Central Bank of Chile, was speaking at an event in the UK on June 29, according to a transcript published by the institution over the weekend. The event was hosted by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.  During his speech, Marcel touched on the subject of blockchain and distributed ledgers several times, noting that financial sector firms are experimenting with applications and possible commercial uses. Taking a seemingly neutral stand, Marcel laid out potential opportunities of DLT such as increasing market efficiency with lower cost, as well as collateral risks including the cryptocurrency market volatility and the potential for flash crashes.  He also invoked work by institutions such as the Central Bank of Canada and the Bank of England in pursuit of wholly digital currency systems based entirely or in part on blockchain. Canada's central bank demoed its ""CAD-coin"" project in April of last year, though it later said that the tech wouldn't be used in the near-term to replace the country's wholesale payments service.  Echoing that sentiment, Marcel declared that, in his view, such a digital currency launch is likely to take a long time given the technical challenges as well as the broader cultural shift that would be spurred at central banks worldwide.  ""[Central bank digital currencies (CBDC)] seems to lead inevitably to the replacement of the classical role of central banks at the top of a tiered liquidity system to that of a massive retailer, where deposit-taking may soon combine with loan-making,"" he told attendees, adding:  ""This means that a real CBDC may still be many years away.""  However, Marcel agreed that such technological innovation should not be held back by strict regulations.  ""According to the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, FinTech innovations should not be in the 'Far West,' nor be choked at birth,"" he concluded.

According to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing from July 26, Nasdaq – which has been working with blockchain technology since as early as 2015 – struck the agreement with SIX Swiss Exchange, a subsidiary of SIX Group. Notably, the group has also been experimenting with blockchain through its SIX Securities business line.  The SEC filing revealed the new deal, stating:  ""In July 2017, Nasdaq also signed an agreement with SIX Swiss Exchange to implement a distributed ledger technology based solution for the OTC structured products business from SIX, highlighting further commercialization of blockchain with the Nasdaq Financial Framework.""  While it's not yet clear when the OTC solution will be developed, or whether there is a timeline for deployment, the news is the latest indication of Nasdaq's aggressive push toward commercializing its work with blockchain.  Among other projects, the stock exchange unveiled a partnership with financial giant Citi in May focused on blockchain payments. That was soon after revealing that it was providing the tech for a digital media contracts exchange in March. Nasdaq has also expressed its desire to invest in more startups that work with blockchain.

Already, the total value of all cryptocurrencies from just over $10 billion at the start of the year, to a high of $115 billion in June.  Further, the announcement comes at a time when institutional investors are increasingly taking note of this price appreciation, and are seeking to determine opportunities for the technology that fit into their existing business models.  Most notably, it follows a decision by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to grant a license to LedgerX last week that would allow it to clear and custody cryptocurrency derivatives for assets like bitcoin and ether.

42427686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2ojh,1501678812,MultiChain 1.0: Bitcoin-Compatible Private Blockchain Opens for Enterprise,"A modified version of bitcoin's software is now available for enterprise use.  Built over the course of almost four years by venture-backed startup Coin Sciences, the open-source MultiChain 1.0 software is said to inherit much of the security and stability of its predecessor, but with differences designed to make it more suitable for corporate users.  Launched today, MultiChain is claimed to enable networks of users to conduct 1,000 transactions per second – a volume the startup argues is required by prospective clients.  As part of the 1.0 launch, Coin Sciences has also unveiled 14 new members of its partner program, including multinational consulting firm Cognizant and Medici Ventures, the Overstock.com subsidiary behind the tØ blockchain stock exchange.  The latest among a string of private blockchain offerings seeking to entice open-source developers, MultiChain 1.0 is designed to let corporations more easily leverage tools originally designed for bitcoin.  Coin Sciences co-founder and CEO Gideon Greenspan told CoinDesk:  ""The whole ecosystem of applications and libraries and explorers built for bitcoin are very highly compatible with MultiChain, or sometimes they can be used immediately without modification.""  Crucial among a series of upgrades in this version of MultiChain is a new feature called ""Streams"" that is aimed to make it easier for developers to store and retrieve information about when data was written to the blockchain, who wrote the data, and more.  Other top line features highlighted by Greenspan include a simplified process for spinning up a new blockchain and nodes; permissioned credentials for using addresses on the blockchain to represent identities; support for assets being issued, transferred and traded; and, perhaps most importantly, bitcoin compatibility with protocol transaction APIs.  Originally launched into alpha in 2015, earlier versions of MultiChain have already been downloaded 60,000 times, the firm says. MultiChain 1.0 is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS, as well as Microsoft Azure.  Bitcoin fork compatible  Overall, the launch can be seen as a continuing of efforts that began years ago, when the startup sought to launch a ""bitcoin 2.0"" protocol designed for the creation of alternative assets on a public blockchain.  For example, Coin Sciences pioneered an attempt to use colored coins that were customized to represent assets. Called CoinSpark, the product had difficulty gaining traction among a pool of competing protocols that were based on bitcoin and that weren't designed for businesses.  Seeking better traction among potential customers, this offering was evolved into a permissioned blockchain built with the help of Coin Sciences' partner program, a group that after today's announcement now includes 43 members.  As of today, the MultiChain partner program consists of two tracks: one for platform developers who are building applications for third parties on the MultiChain platform, and another for those using it in their own proprietary solutions.  Based on feedback from early partners, Coin Sciences said it responded to requests for new features and was able to observe user behavior to build solutions that weren't specifically requested, but simplified tasks.  Due in part to the customizable design, Greenspan said of yesterday's bitcoin split into two competing cryptocurrencies: ""MultiChain is completely compatible with both.""  ""When you create a blockchain on MultiChain, you can customize that and about 45 other parameters so that the protocol-level limitations are removed based on reconfiguring each blockchain separately,"" he explained.  Making money  Currently, most of Coin Sciences' revenue comes from consulting fees, but, with the launch of MultiChain 1.0, Greenspan hopes that will change.  With VC backing from Mosaic Ventures and investor Zohar Gilon, the Israel-based team of four expects to deploy a number of service-level agreements, though Greenspan wouldn't reveal possible partners.  Going forward, MultiChain 2.0, which is already in development, is expected to include a second set of platform tools that are not included in the open-source ""community"" version, but will be part of a paid software license.  For the time being, Greenspan is keeping details of the future product close to his chest.  He concluded:  ""We’ve got a very clear idea of what those features are going to be, although we're not talking about them with anyone but our partners at this point.""

According to the Strait Times, the lawsuit was recently filed in the Singapore High Court, with B2C2 aiming to regain the 3,084 bitcoins (worth around $8.4 million at press time) from the exchange.  The filings assert that on April 19, B2C2 successfully sold 309 ether for 3,092 bitcoins, creating a profit of $3.7 million. The bitcoin, priced at $1,226 at the time, was worth around 25 times more than the ether tokens, according to CoinDesk Price Index.  However, such profit drew attention from Quoine, which reversed the trades the next day, arguing that they represented a ""huge mark-up over fair global market price."" The exchange says that B2C2 is overreaching in its pursuit of repayment, telling the news source it is ""being opportunistic and seeking to profit from a technical glitch.""  B2C2, on the other hand, alleges the proceeds were ""misappropriated"" by Quoine without authorization. Citing an agreement with the exchange, it further claims the action was ""fraudulent.""

42427665,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2oJh,1501668022,Why a Bitcoin Fork Is Not a 'Stock Split',"If you've been following the bitcoin fork drama this week, you may have heard the term ""stock split"" thrown around in interviews with ""experts.""  Before we get to the problems here, it's true that there are now two publicly traded bitcoin assets, bearing similar names with similar value propositions. They even appear side by side on some major exchanges.  The impulse to use existing terminology as a metaphor to refer to emerging technology is understandable. In fact, it can be incredibly helpful to use existing mental models as a metaphor for things we don't quite have our heads around just yet.  But this comparison, while well intentioned, is misguided: a blockchain fork isn't anything like a stock split.  Here's why:  The drivers  Stock split: The basic motivation behind most stock splits is to lower the price of individual shares of a stock to bring it within the financial reach of retail investors.  One of the best-known examples of a stock split in recent years is the 7-for-1 split of Apple shares in 2014. Prior to the split, when Apple was trading around $700, it was often debated whether the individual stock price was too high. A steep rise in share price in the months that followed seems to have settled the debate. (At least in the case of Apple.)  Bitcoin: The reasons for the split into two cryptocurrencies are complex, but they have nothing to do with ease-of-access for retail investors.  The crux is this: A long-standing debate has divided the bitcoin community on its technical roadmap – specifically, about finding the best way to cope with a growing user base and rising transaction volume.  After the bitcoin fork, bitcoin is still trading at over $2,700, roughly the same price as before. The price of the new asset, Bitcoin Cash, is around $200 to $450 depending on the liquidity of the exchange it's being traded on. In short, the two assets now have two separate values, each derived from their technical roadmap and supporting communities.  Both could end up expensive for investors, but to the extent that one may end up affordable, it may not make it valuable.  Governance  Stock split: In the broadest sense, stock splits and blockchain splits share one thing in common: they must be approved by someone. So who approves them?  Publicly traded companies are owned by their shareholders. Those shareholders then elect a board of directors to act as their proxies in corporate governance issues. The board of directors hires managers to run the company. The board of directors and management, which often overlap, make decisions about matters that are crucial to the functioning of the company. (In theory, this permits companies to behave as rational actors; in practice, less so.)  One of the most important decisions that management and boards of directors make about the public companies they run concerns the makeup of the capital structure, which is the category into which share structure falls.  Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a shared account of value without centralized authority or control. There is no single third party that verifies the accuracy of the value accounted for in the ledger. There is no central governing authority; instead, decisions are made by consensus based on miners (or nodes) signaling their approval for proposals, based on predetermined thresholds for passage that are embedded in the code.  In the event of a split, every actor gets to make decisions in their best interest.  Right now, some exchanges aren't listing Bitcoin Cash, some are. Some miners aren't mining the new blockchain, some are. And some users are trading both, in that both are now digital assets that can be sent seamlessly around the world. Where they go from there will take coordination, but for now, decision-making is isolated and dedicated by self-interest.  Final takeaway  Stock split: A stock split is a corporate action that divides existing shares into more shares without changing the underlying claims on assets that those shares represent. If you double the amount of something, but cut its value in half, you haven't effectively changed the underlying economics at all. (Which is worth more to you: a $20 bill or two $10 bills?)  But here's what really matters about a stock split: no new entity of any kind is created. The same corporate entity that existed before the split still exists afterward.  From an operational standpoint, nothing has been added and nothing has been taken away.  Bitcoin: When Bitcoin Cash split off from the bitcoin blockchain it created an entirely new blockchain unique to Bitcoin Cash. From this point forward, the two currencies will trade under separate symbols. And they will each have their own transaction history after the time of the split, and develop unique values.  Both may fail, both may thrive. That's up to individual actors in the marketplace.  And the ongoing popularity of ethereum and ethereum classic shows just how long it can take for the market to decide – if it will pick one winner at all.

According to several South Korean media outlets, including the Financial News and Seoul Economic Daily, the proposal was put forth this week by Park Yong-Jin, a representative from the Democratic Party who has been at the center of recent regulatory deliberations.  The amendments would seek to define digital currency businesses and classify different parties as digital currency traders, brokers, issuers and managers.  It further mandates businesses hold deposits or provide insurance to hedge against potential cybercrime incidents, and aims to apply a 500 million South Korean won ($450,000) capital reserve threshold for any business that operates cryptocurrency trading service prior to seeking an approval from the authority.  Provisions for preventing market manipulation and money laundering using digital currencies are also included in the changes.

The proposal follows a recent panel hosted by the politician at a public hearing to argue for regulations covering digital currency.  As for a next step, the bill is expected to be presented to the regular session of the National Assembly in September, at which point, it needs the approval of the country's Financial Services Commission.

That might be the biggest takeaway from an audit of ethereum's Serpent compiling language, released last week by blockchain security firm Zeppelin Solutions. The findings point to dozens of problems with the compiler, including eight critical vulnerabilities.  Zeppelin was hired by Augur, an ethereum-based prediction market, to conduct the audit two months ago. With nearly $2 million-worth of its token (REP) sitting in a contract written in Serpent, Augur had good reason to be concerned about the security of the older language.  Augur was one of the earlier ethereum projects, and at the time its token contract was written, Serpent was the main smart contract language available. But soon after, Solidity was introduced and took over as ethereum's flagship smart contract programming language, pushing Serpent to the wayside.  Even so, Augur CEO Joey Krug said there were few public warnings about possible issues that would prevent Serpent from executing code as expected.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Nobody ever said Serpent was insecure or depreciated. It just wasn't as popular [as Solidity].""  While Augur had planned to move to another smart contract language at some point, results of the compiler audit essentially forced the project's hand. As soon as Zeppelin notified Augur of the security issues involved, Augur moved quickly to migrate its REP tokens to a secure ERC-20 token contract written in Solidity.    'Low quality' and 'flawed'        For others wondering if they should follow suit, Zeppelin Solutions has spelled out the full results of its audit in a 36-page report.  In a blog post, Zeppelin called the Serpent project ""low quality"" and ""flawed,"" and cautioned developers to refrain from using the language until its many critical problems were fixed.  The news prompted ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin to send out a tweet, calling the programming language ""outdated tech,"" and warning it lacked adequate ""safety protections.""  As for Augur, the most critical Serpent vulnerability was one that would allow a hacker to change the date in which the REP token contract was created, essentially freezing up the token supply.  ""You could make the contract think it had not actually been officially created yet, so that basically none of the transfers would work,"" said Krug.  If Serpent had only that one problem, Krug said he would have happily fixed the code and continued using the language for the time being. But the number of problems revealed by the audit were simply too overwhelming.  So instead, following an update path outlined by Zeppelin, Augur moved to rewrite its old REP token in Solidity and deploy the new ERC-20 contract on ethereum. It then effectively hacked its own Serpent smart contract, freezing the REP token, before migrating the balance of the frozen REP to the new contract.  In a separate blog post, Zeppelin urged any ethereum projects still using Serpent follow a similar migration path to move their tokens to a more secure Solidity contract.    More eyes needed        The Serpent programming language and compiler were both written by Buterin. But the fact only one person wrote the code may underlie some of Serpent's problems.  Zeppelin wrote in its report:  ""Less eyes on the code means less bugs being noticed.""  Zeppelin also pointed out that Serpent is two years old, with few commits since October 2015. Adding to that, with hardly anyone using Serpent now, there is little possibility of anyone spotting problems in the code or of those problems being fixed.  Solidity, on the other hand, was written by a team of people led by Gavin Wood, one of the founders of ethereum. And because Solidity is more widely used and sees a lot more activity – 30 times the pull requests, 20 times the commits, eight times as many contributors, according to Zeppelin – compared to Serpent, the newer program is less likely to have the same number of issues.  As for what developers should use instead of Serpent, the Zeppelin report suggests Solidity is the best available answer today. However, it also suggest developers consider Viper, a successor to Serpent, stating that Viper ""looks superior"" to Serpent. But in a tweet, Buterin recommended developers hold off until Viper passes an external audit first.  Solidity audit?  But, perhaps one of the more alarming issues brought to light by Zeppelin's Serpent compiler audit is that Solidity itself has not been audited either. And given that millions of dollars-worth of tokens are currently managed by smart contracts written in Solidity, some, including Krug, find that news unsettling.  Adding to concerns about Solidity, the Zeppelin compiler audit comes on the heels of a $30 million hack of the Parity wallet, where a bug in the Parity code essentially allowed the hacker to turn three multi-signature wallets into zero-signature wallets, and drain the funds.  In a blog post following that attack, Parity pointed a finger at Solidity, stating that ""some blame for this bug lies with the Solidity language and, in its current incarnation, the difficulty with which one can understand the execution permissions over functions.""  But an even bigger ethereum theft took place a little more than a year ago, when a hacker took advantage of a loophole in the Solidity code to siphon $50 million in ether from a project called The DAO. The damage was deemed so extensive, the developers behind ethereum implemented a hard fork in the protocol to roll back its transaction history.  Software code audits are a requirement in many critical industries, and Demian Brener, CEO at Zeppelin, thinks the same case should be made for smart contract code.  ""Given the number of vulnerabilities uncovered in Serpent, we believe compiler audits, along with code audits, should become a best practice,"" he wrote in an email to CoinDesk. He added that Zeppelin is currently talking with the Ethereum Foundation to make that happen.  Meanwhile, Krug summed up his own thoughts on the matter by saying:  ""Overall, the message is, more stuff should be audited.""
