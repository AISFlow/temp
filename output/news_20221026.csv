42388777,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSw5T,1666827113,First Mover Asia: Crypto Traders Are Betting on World Cup-Themed Tokens. What’s Driving the Interest?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin rose significantly for a second consecutive day, despite disappointing earnings from the tech sector.  Insights: What's driving crypto traders' interest in World Cup-themed tokens?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,022.42 +38.3 3.9 Bitcoin (BTC) $20,825 +731.6 3.6 Ethereum (ETH) $1,575 +113.5 7.8 S&P 500 daily close  3,830.60 −28.5 0.7 Gold  $1,669 +16.2 1.0 Treasury Yield 10 Years  4.01 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Continues Its High-Flying Ways  By James Rubin  Bitcoin (BTC) continued its recent, mini surge, topping $21,000 at one point after Canada’s central bank raised its main interest rate less robustly than expected, and despite disappointing earnings late Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet and software giant Microsoft.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,800, up more than 3.5% over the past 24 hours amid the Bank of Canada’s approval of a 50 basis point (BPS) hike instead of 75 BPS. The bank noted its concerns about the slowing of the economy. Central bankers globally have been trying to tame inflation without sparking a steep recession. On Tuesday BTC topped $20,000 for the first time since Oct. 5.  ""Economic growth is expected to stall through the end of this year and the first half of next year as the effects of higher interest rates spread through the economy,"" the Bank of Canada said in a statement that noted its progress in cutting inflation to below 7% and underlined its concerns about declining economic growth.  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at $1,575, a nearly 8% gain from Tuesday, same time, tacking onto its more than 11% increase of the following day. The second-largest crypto in market value has reached its highest level since mid-September.  Most major altcoins were well in the green, with popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB recently up more than 14% and 5%, respectively. The former’s rise comes amid the approaching close of billionaire entrepreneur and DOGE enthusiast Elon Musk’s acquisition of social media platform Twitter.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, climbed 3.09% over the past 24 hours.  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks slumped after rising the previous two days as investors mulled over the tech industry’s struggles, which are likely to continue. Embattled social media platform.  Meta Platforms (FB) reported third-quarter revenue of just $285 million for its Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its earnings report released Wednesday. That was short of the consensus of analyst estimates of $406 million, and down from $452 million in the second quarter.  The tech-focused Nasdaq fell by about 2%, while the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, dropped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was roughly flat. Both Microsoft and Alphabet earnings results killed what was becoming a ""not too bad outlook for the economy,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.  In commodities, Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, rose to $94 per barrel, up about 0.27% from the previous day. Three weeks after OPEC announced it was cutting production, investors remain fretful about energy prices. Brent crude is up more than 15% since the start of the year. Safe-haven gold was up 0.7% at $1,664 per ounce.  Housing starts plunged nearly 11% in September, continuing a recent trend that some observers of U.S. monetary policy hope will enable the Federal Reserve to ratchet back its recent monetary hawkishness. The most recent decline comes as mortgage rates top 7%, reaching a two-decade high.  The University of Michigan’s monthly Consumer Sentiment Index on Friday will offer fresh insight into the public’s perceptions about the economy. “Bitcoin is now comfortably above the $20,000 level and now it will try to stabilize here until the [Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee] meeting,” Moya wrote. “If risk appetite remains healthy, bitcoin could grind higher towards $22,500 level.” ​  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE +14.7% Currency Ethereum ETH +7.8% Smart Contract Platform Shiba Inu SHIB +5.5% Currency  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  Why Are Crypto Traders and Degens Interested in World Cup-Themed Tokens?  By Shaurya Malwa  You’d probably think of a sophisticated sports betting platform if someone said they wanted to bet on matches at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.  But crypto schemers are doing one better. Crypto Twitter and niche altcoin Telegram groups are awash with discussions about countless tokens named after participating countries, players, stadiums and even the hosting country itself. The tokens are allowing speculators to weirdly bet on the prices of their favorites.  No licensing  None of these tokens are licensed, or even affiliated, with any World Cup participants. That hasn’t stopped bettors from making big gains. A token called world cup inu surged some 500% in the past week alone, with others like CHAMPS and world cup token gaining at least 200% (before seeing price falls in the past 24 hours).  Not everything is a random scramble, however. As CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported on Tuesday, some fan tokens issued on blockchain-based fan rewards platforms Socios and Bitci allow holders to contribute to merchandising, participate in exclusive meet-and-greet events and earn loyalty rewards.  In the past seven days, fan tokens of the Peruvian national football team (FPFT), Spain's national team (SNFT) and Brazil's national team (BFT) have rallied 29%, 17% and 12%, respectively, according to data source CoinGecko. Fan tokens of Turkish and Argentinian teams have risen by 10% and 9%, as reported.  Availability of capital  What’s driving the latest frenzy? The likes of Wes Hansen, director of trading and operations at crypto fund Arca, blames sidelined capital that’s looking to invest in, well, just about anything with a short-term narrative.  “There is a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting for any opportunity to invest, which is why short-term event trades have been the only way to generate decent returns for a few months now,” Hansen told CoinDesk in a recent chat.  He added: “When those conditions are coupled with a massive month-long event like the World Cup and the love this industry has for meme tokens, there are bound to be some savvy entrepreneurs that launch World Cup-themed tokens (ex. WCI and WILLIE).”  But hopeful investors should still exercise some caution, he noted. “These tokens just become high-velocity trading vehicles that have little to no intrinsic value or functionality and will disappear as soon as the event begins to wear on,” Hansen said, adding that that one of the interesting reasons behind the rise of such tokens was that that they give fans a way to “interact with and support their favorite teams.”  Important events  4:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:15 UTC) European Central Bank Monetary Policy Decision Statement  4:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:30 UTC) United States Durable Goods Orders (Sept)  4:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:30 UTC) United States Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q3)  6:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(10:15 UTC) European Central Bank's President Lagarde Speech  7:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(23:00 UTC) Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Statement  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Crypto Markets Surge, Liquidations, Tech Earnings and Reddit NFTs  ""The Hash"" team hashed out hot topics, including the crypto market surge, with bitcoin challenging $21,000.

42388787,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSwuv,1666819658,Billionaire Quant Trader Donated a Record $1.9M of Bitcoin to a Super PAC,"Jeffrey Yass is the billionaire co-founder of trading giant Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and also a political mega-donor: He and his wife are the 2022 elections’ fifth-biggest contributors, right behind crypto exchange titan Sam Bankman-Fried.  But when it comes to donating in crypto, Yass outranks even the FTX chief. In early July, Yass gave 100 bitcoin (BTC), then worth more than $1.9 million, to Crypto Freedom PAC, a representative for the super PAC confirmed to CoinDesk. It is the largest bitcoin-denominated political donation ever recorded by the Federal Election Commission.  “I think Jeff wanted to signal support” for cryptocurrencies, said David McIntosh, president of Club for Growth Action, which is linked to the Crypto Freedom PAC. He added that the crypto PAC backs candidates who are against government regulation of cryptocurrencies.  A voicemail message seeking a comment from David Pollard, SIG's head of strategic planning and special counsel, wasn't immediately returned.  Yass’ entrance to crypto politics marks a new chapter for a major force in political fundraising. This election cycle he has donated over $30 million (most of it in cash, not crypto) to PACs promoting school choice and conservative candidates, including $6.5 million to the fiscally conservative Club for Growth.  It comes as SIG, a major market maker and quant trading firm, continues to build out its crypto businesses with new jobs in its suburban Philadelphia headquarters and new offices in Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried is also building an offshore crypto business mecca for FTX.  Crypto PACs  Capitol Hill’s increasing spotlight on crypto regulation has spawned a new wave of special interest PACs and pro-industry candidates – and a smattering of small-dollar crypto donations supporting their cause. The result: it’s becoming more common for candidates and PACs to report contributions of bitcoin, ether (ETH) or stablecoins.  But a donation of 100 bitcoin is on another plane entirely. According to federal election disclosure data, Jeff Yass donated $1.94 million of bitcoin to Crypto Freedom PAC on July 1. The PAC later sold the crypto in tranches through River Financial for $2.2 million, the records show.  “There was some argument over whether we should hold on to it to see if it goes back up, but we needed it for our races,” McIntosh said.  He said the PAC supports turning the U.S. into a global home for crypto innovation by limiting government attempts at regulatory overreach. It is backing candidates who share that vision, such as Blake Masters, an Arizona Republican U.S. Senate candidate who is heavily invested in crypto.  CORRECTION (Oct. 27, 2022, 03:13 UTC): The story has been updated to change the identity of the person quoted in the story to Club for Growth Action's David McIntosh from Joe Kildea, the communications lead for Crypto Freedom PAC and Club for Growth Action.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $21,700, up more than 2% over the past 24 hours amid the Bank of Canada’s approval of a 50 basis point (BPS) hike instead of 75 BPS. The bank noted its concerns about the slowing of the economy. Central bankers globally have been trying to tame inflation without sparking a steep recession. On Tuesday BTC topped $20,000 for the first time since Oct. 5.  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands above $1,550, a more than 5% gain from Tuesday, same time, tacking onto its more than 11% increase of the following day. The second-largest crypto in market value has reached its highest level since mid-September.  Most major altcoins were well in the green, with popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB up more than 12% and 4%, respectively. The former’s rise comes amid the approaching close of billionaire entrepreneur and DOGE enthusiast Elon Musk’s acquisition of social media platform Twitter.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, climbed 3.09% over the past 24 hours.  Macro View  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks slumped after rising the previous two days as investors mulled over the tech industry’s struggles, which are likely to continue. Embattled social media platform.  Meta Platforms (FB) reported third-quarter revenue of just $285 million for its Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its earnings report released Wednesday. That was short of the consensus of analyst estimates of $406 million, and down from $452 million in the second quarter.  The tech-focused Nasdaq fell about 2%, while the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, dropped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was roughly flat.  Both Microsoft and Alphabet earnings results killed what was becoming a not too bad outlook for the economy,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.  In commodities, Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, rose to $94 per barrel, up about 0.27% from the previous day. Three weeks after OPEC announced it was cutting production, investors remain fretful about energy prices. Brent crude is up more than 15% since the start of the year. Safe-haven gold was up 0.7% at $1,664 per ounce.  Housing starts plunged nearly 11% in September, continuing a recent trend that some observers of U.S. monetary policy hope will enable the Federal Reserve to ratchet back its recent monetary hawkishness. The most recent decline comes as mortgage rates top 7%, reaching a two-decade high.  The University of Michigan’s monthly Consumer Sentiment Index on Friday will offer fresh insight into the public’s perceptions about the economy. “Bitcoin is now comfortably above the $20,000 level and now it will try to stabilize here until the [Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee] meeting,” Moya wrote. “If risk appetite remains healthy, bitcoin could grind higher towards $22,500 level.” ​  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 1,018.43 +2.9%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $20,723 +3.1%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,551 +5.8%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,830.60 −0.7%        ● Gold: $1,668 per troy ounce +0.9%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 4.01% −0.1        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Technical Take  Bitcoin, Ether Price Surge May Not Last: Crypto Markets Analysis  By Glenn Williams Jr  Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, recently rose 3.3% and 6.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. On Tuesday, BTC crossed $20,000 for the first time since Oct. 5, while ETH topped $1,500 for the first time since the Sept. 15 Merge, the Ethereum blockchain’s technological overhaul. Whether a new longer-range upturn is afoot or BTC and ETH prices are likely to revert to the mean is still unclear.  Technically, both BTC and ETH blew past traditional “overbought” metrics on their hourly charts, and have since retreated. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shot past 90 for both BTC and ETH on their hourly charts.  As those levels fall well outside the range of normal hourly RSI movement, the RSI may cool, at least from an intraday perspective. Current daily RSI levels for BTC and ETH are both approximately 71.

That was well short of the consensus of analyst estimates of $406 million, and down from $452 million in the second quarter.  Overall, FRL accounted for a loss of $3.7 billion in the quarter, up from a loss of $2.8 billion in the second quarter.  The company also said in a press release that it expected FRL's operating losses in 2023 to grow ""significantly"" year over year. ""Beyond 2023, we expect to pace Reality Labs investments such that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income in the long run,"" it said.  On the company's conference call Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remained optimistic about the metaverse, although he acknowledged concerns about Meta's direction. He added it would be a ""mistake"" not to focus on the metaverse and sees it having a strong impact in the future. He was also upbeat about Meta's Quest Pro VR headset, adding that he sees more workers over time being able to get their work done via virtual and mixed reality.  Meta shares fell over 15% in after-hours trading Wednesday. Shares are down more than 60% this year.  Meta has faced investor calls to reduce spending on the metaverse as lower user growth numbers and reduced ad spending have cut into its results. Meta reported a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion for FRL in 2021, and the company has said it is committed to spending even more on the division for the next several years, seeing it as a crucial driver of future growth.  For the company as a whole, Meta reported adjusted quarterly earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.64, missing the analyst consensus estimate of $1.90, according to FactSet, while Meta's overall revenue of $27.7 billion beat estimates of $27.4 billion. It guided for Q4 revenue between $30 billion to $32.5 billion, which at its midpoint of $31.25 billion was short of the consensus estimate of $32.3 billion.  Earlier this week, Bank of America downgraded shares of Meta to neutral from buy, adding that Meta’s huge investment in the metaverse is likely to remain an “overhang” on the stock, noting that analysts are unlikely to back out metaverse spend from earnings per share (EPS) for valuation purposes given the lack of progress with users, potential new competition from Apple and a “higher cost of capital mindset.”  Read more: Meta Downgraded by BofA to Neutral From Buy Partly on Metaverse Concerns  UPDATE (Oct. 26, 20:31 UTC): Adds detail throughout.

At the Nokios conference on Wednesday, the Brønnøysund, Norway’s central register, and Skatteetaten, the nation’s tax authority, announced that they’re partnering with consulting firm Ernst and Young (EY) to establish an office in Decentraland. The goal of the initiative, according to Nokios, is to deliver services to younger, tech-native individuals while establishing their Web3 footprint.  Magnus Jones, Nordic blockchain lead at EY, wrote in a LinkedIn post on Tuesday that he hopes the partnership with Norwegian authorities will help spearhead education in the crypto space by teaching users about taxes related to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The Brønnøysund is also exploring additional Web3 services, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), wallets, smart contracts and more.  “Kudos once again to Norwegian authorities who dare to make moves to bring clarity in a complex landscape,” wrote Jones. “Building further on issuing worlds first guidance on how to tax DeFi and also NFTs, and being a front runner in the crypto space in general.”  Beyond the metaverse, Norway has been slowly integrating crypto services at a national level. In June, the government said it would use Ethereum scaling service Arbitrum to release a capitalization tables platform for unlisted companies. In September, Norway, Israel and Sweden joined forces with the Bank for International Settlements to explore the possibility of introducing a CBDC (central bank digital currency) for cross-border payments.  “We're very intrigued to see what more the world will seek to build atop Ethereum, and we're committed to doing our part to scale Ethereum globally,” said Arbitrum in a Twitter thread.  As the Scandinavian nation delves deeper into the crypto space, other countries are also integrating Web3 tools at a national level. In July, a policy briefing by the Shanghai city government said it plans to bolster its metaverse industry to $52 billion by 2025.

42394034,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buO3kd,1666814378,What a Web3 Hackathon Teaches Us About Diversity in Crypto,"Last week, while taking the stage after finding out her project had won first place at a crypto hackathon, Olivia Drouhaut looked out and counted the number of Black women in the audience. “There were two,” she said, “and one was holding my phone to take a video.”  Drouhaut is a co-founder of EVOLVE, a platform built on Polygon that’s using crypto economics to teach people about investing. The project, just a “minimum viable product” as of yet, Drouhaut said, was conceived and built over the past six months as part of the Web3athon.  “When you learn about the state of financial literacy among African Americans, it’s shocking,” Drouhaut said. She recalled a particular statistic that puts inequality in the U.S. in black and white: The median wealth for women of color is just $1,700. (That’s up from $5 about a decade ago, but obviously distressing when compared to other demographics.)  There’s no simple explanation for contemporary wealth inequality in the wealthiest nation ever – it’s a result of systemic failures and countless injustices over decades. But, Drouhaut said, there could be a simple way to improve the situation: education.  ""We are a community of women and allies committed to creating generational wealth through education, advancing Black and Latinx women-owned businesses and projects, investment in real estate, philanthropic contributions and collective economics to secure our place in Web3,"" Drouhaut said in an email.  The guiding principle of Web3athon, a sort of crypto boot camp announced at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in June and backed by CRADL, was to help Web3 developers projects tackle what it calls “hyperlocal” issues.  “At CRADL, we think of hyperlocal as the counterbalance to ‘mass market.’ A hyperlocal community can be geographically dispersed, but everyone in it shares something unique that keeps them small and connected,” Katherine Paseman, a project lead at CRADL, or the Crypto Research and Design Lab, said in an interview.  More than two dozen projects participated in the hackathon until the end. Many of the participants hadn’t ever coded before, Paseman said. And they were chosen if they had relevant, up-close experience with an issue.  Zooming in on problems that need solving led to some singular hackathon ideas: A team of indigenous coders built a play-to-earn app that would funnel profits into salmon restoration in the Pacific Northwest. Two Kenyan developers designed an app for a traditional African investing pool called a Chama.  These are people that know the issues intimately, Paseman said. Yet, figuring out if and how crypto could help improve the situation took time.  As mentioned, EVOLVE uses “learn-to-earn” incentives paid in its native token to teach people the basics of investing, like compound interest and direct deposits, a bit like Coinbase’s “Earn” product. Drouhaut and her team took it a step further by introducing crypto staking – to eventually allow people to participate in the protocol more fully and get hands-on experience with what they’re learning.  CRADL helped enterprising visionaries pair up coders to build the project, as well as mentoring throughout the process. The effort attracted developers from nearly every continent, building on 17 blockchains including Filecoin, Stellar and Polkadot. (The chief content officer at CoinDesk, Michael Casey, served as a judge.)  “I prefer to have women developers, preferably BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] women to give them access and the opportunity to build in the space,"" Drouhaut said, noting it took time to find the right developer given the general lack of diversity in crypto.  Like most of EVOLVE's members, Drouhaut is a part of Disruptor DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization working on financial literacy issues in Black and Latina communities, which offers opportunities to ""learn by doing"" and careers in Web3.  Drouhaut plans to continue working on the project now that the hackathon is finished, which will eventually be folded into Disruptor DAO as its ""educational arm."" Many of the people who participated in Web3athon are actively looking to raise seed or angel investments.  See also: Web 3 Isn't Dead, Despite What Critics Might Say | Opinion  For Paseman, organizing the six-month hackathon would be worth it even if most of the projects don’t go to market. It was an experience in learning to work across cultural lines and time zones, she said. Moreover, it highlighted the challenges in crypto – what it can change and what needs to change with it.  “The first step is to acknowledge that decentralization does not automatically foster diversity. Our research has shown that while Web3 values decentralization when it comes to technology, the social networks that make up this industry are not necessarily decentralized,” Paseman said.  Hackathons and conferences are some of the easiest ways for underrepresented individuals to accelerate their careers, Drouhaut said, adding that in her experience, ""the [participation] and attendance rate of women of color globally [ranged] from extremely low to completely nonexistent.""  This is what attracted her, and many of the participants, to CRADL's competition, which stressed the democratic and equalizing values in crypto.  ""I want to see more women of color take space, speak, attend these conferences, network and grow professionally so they can see what’s possible for them out there. It’s all about accessibility,"" Drouhaut said.  CoinDesk corresponded with Paseman over email to hear more about running an event like Web3athon, diversity in crypto and whether the next “hyperlocal” issue could be terraforming Mars. (The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.)  What did you want to achieve by putting Web3athon together, and do you think you succeeded?  Web3athon is CoinDesk and CRADL’s attempt to inject optimism and forward momentum into the current messiness of Web3. And wow, do we need that injection.  The bear market has been a sobering comedown from the hype of the bull run. Now that the dust has settled, it’s clear that the industry has some major problems. There are exploits of poorly written protocols, an absence of real use cases (do we really need an [non-fungible token] minted for every step taken during a jog?) and speculation is rampant.  We wanted to show that it’s possible to improve the quality of the products in Web3. Our big bet was that by creating a hackathon that is welcoming for non-technical people, we’d get more well-rounded teams with both the  technical know-how and the domain expertise to build products that help real communities. And we were right.  We partnered with 13 organizations and 17 sponsors to build a cohort of attendees with a huge spread of backgrounds and skill sets. We kicked off at Consensus in June with six hours of programming designed for both technical and non-technical attendees. Over 6,000 participants registered across 17 different time zones. After three months of ideating and building, we emerged with 32 prize winners and 15 Web3athon Standouts, featuring projects doing everything from putting occupational safety data on-chain with OccSaviors to helping war photojournalists manage their work’s rights and revenue through Refound. The volume, range and quality of these projects show that with non-technical domain experts at the table, we really can build a better Web3.  Why use the hackathon format?  One of CRADL’s first research reports found that hackathons are a key way to attract builders to the industry. But while hackathons are great for bringing technical minds together, they don’t typically produce useful products.  One of the biggest reasons for that is hackathons typically attract a homogenous set of participants. Whether it’s the exclusive language often used in tech, the highly technical jargon used in marketing or having submissions that require knowing how to code, there seems to not be space for anyone who isn’t a software engineer.  We believed that if we hosted an event that was intentionally inclusive – bringing in ideas and talent from people who aren’t already in Web3 – it could produce more practical and valuable products.  By teaming up with CoinDesk, who has had a front row seat to the entire industry's development, we knew we'd have the ability to break down these barriers, and the nuance to make a meaningful difference with Web3athon.  How can crypto/Web3 foster a more diverse industry?  The first step is to acknowledge that decentralization does not automatically foster diversity. Our research has shown that while Web3 values decentralization when it comes to technology, the social networks that make up this industry are not necessarily decentralized. It’s a global industry, but conferences seem to be the same teams networking with the same VCs [venture capitalists] in a new city every month. (CRADL will be releasing a report on diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, in Web3 later this year.)  At CRADL, we talk about diversity in terms of representation and power. Who has the power to determine how they are represented in Web3? Who has the agency to decide how new technologies are showing up in their communities? We partnered with organizations – like Black Bitcoin Billionaire, H.E.R. DAO, the Africa Blockchain Institute and IMPAQTO – that also value empowering their communities to engage with Web3.  The presence of those communities is one of the reasons Web3athon was able to produce projects that addressed such a wide variety of problems. Builders were able to meet new types of people, build more well-rounded teams and learn new perspectives that changed how they identified and solved problems.  See also: Nike's Venture into Web3 Isn't About Tech – It's About Culture | Opinion  The Web3athon approach to diversity can be replicated by anyone. If you’re running a conference or an event, you have to dedicate resources to invite people with a wide range of skill sets and backgrounds to participate. If we want Web3 to be different than Web2, we have to prioritize representation.  How did you determine which blockchains to encourage development on?  Sponsors for Web3athon are chains – the protocols that are building the rails of Web3. What baffled our team is that most hackathons only have one sponsor, which leads to attendees trying to retrofit their ideas to fit a certain technology. But the infrastructure we've built in Web3 is so different. Each protocol is specialized for a specific application. Stellar is great for cross-border remittances, Circle is really good for stablecoins and Celo is good for mobile first. It doesn't make sense to create a Web3 hackathon where everyone has to try and fit their project into one technology. It has to be multi-chain.  What did you learn from the first stage of the hackathon, where you had teams focus on understanding the problem?  To try to prevent the low-utility products usually made during weekend hackathons, the first stage of Web3athon was two months entirely focused on ideation. Teams didn’t submit any code or a prototype but instead a description of their project and a pitch deck. This is super uncommon in Web3 hackathons! We wanted teams to deeply understand the problem they were trying to solve through research and talking to people before they identified the best way to build a solution.  Without the pressure to “move fast and break things,” most participants realized that the problem they are trying to solve is complex. As a result, they wanted feedback and asked to be put in touch with mentors and judges as they refined their work.  Because Stage 1 was no-code, participants had to tell compelling stories about their projects. Storytelling isn’t a skill that most people are born with and it’s not a skill that is cultivated in most jobs. We offered example short descriptions and a slide deck template to help them better craft their own pitches and stories. Many of the teams that used these templates ended up winning because the judges easily understood what and why they were building. (If you’re running a hackathon, here is a link to the resources we developed to set attendees up for success.)  What were the unexpected challenges you encountered during the second stage when teams actually built their prototypes?  After ideas were shortlisted by the sponsor chains in Stage 2, it quickly became clear that teams needed support finding devs to help them build. We partnered with HackerEarth, the global leader in Hackathons with a community of over 7 million developers, and encouraged them to find developers there. Once every team had engineering talent, we thought they would be off to the races, but we hadn’t anticipated how hard this technology is to understand. Even seemingly simple questions like “how do you pick which chain to build on” can be difficult. Even experienced Web2 devs aren’t sure what questions they need to ask when making that decision.  What does “hyperlocal” mean?  At CRADL, we think of hyperlocal as the counterbalance to “mass market.” A hyperlocal community can be geographically disbursed, but everyone in it shares something unique that keeps them small and connected. The importance is the size and scope of the problem. It needs to be something that can be deeply understood and the people experiencing it must have voices in solving it.  Even though many attendees knew very little about the technology when they started, they were experts in the communities they were building for. IndigiDAO is a great example of this. It’s a crowdfunding and decentralized governance platform for Indigenous people that uses blockchain to help artisans tokenize their work. The founding team of IndigiDAO is from New Mexico Community Capital, a decades-old organization focused on supporting indigenous entrepreneurs. Clixpesa, too, is a team of Kenyan engineers building culturally relevant financial products for Kenyans. These teams exemplify “hyperlocal” design – deeply understanding the community for which you’re building.  Do you believe Web3 will run into similar issues that seem to plague other ""public goods,"" like the tragedy of the commons, monopolization, spoliation, etc.?  If we don’t do anything to change its current trajectory, yes. If Web2 has taught us anything, it’s that the market prefers centralization out of convenience. Part of the issue here is regulation. I think most developers would follow clear regulation – it needs to be clear but not restrictive. A system that is decentralized at a software level but that centralizes institutional power will destroy us. Web3 is at risk of running headlong into all of this: All systems without checks and balances are susceptible to centralizing power and chaos. It takes constant work – like the work of our dear friends at the Crypto Council for Innovation – to keep it in balance.  What are your favorite Web3 projects outside of the hackathon, and why?  I find that projects led by domain experts rather than blockchain experts bring much-needed nuance to understanding how to actually solve problems. It’s easy to say “we should use blockchain for X.” It requires real expertise to understand how X works today and how new technology would improve it. ReSeed, for instance, is using crypto to measure and verify small farmers’ carbon assets. They then give those farmers a clear path to compensation and revenue for maintaining the carbon assets on their land. Satellite imagery and other data collection sources provide verification, and blockchain tools offer traceability and market participation.  I love this project because there is so much domain expertise required to make this work. You need to understand how the carbon credits market works. You need to build partnerships with farmers to help them navigate this new technology. The ReSeed team has invested in the expertise required to create meaningful partnerships over decades of on-the-ground work.  Another project I’ve been keeping an eye on is called Brightvine. They’re working on bringing fixed asset products like mortgages on-chain. What I love is that even though they have an experienced product-led organization with veterans from Intel and Global Currency Organization, their senior product manager isn’t an Ivy-league educated FAANG alumni, they’re a mortgage underwriter.

Do you think humanity should attempt to inhabit distant planets and galaxies?  No, we’ve got stuff to handle here first. We shouldn’t scale until we’ve resolved the core problems on our own planet. We haven’t figured out how to inhabit the world we’ve been given without systematically destroying it. We need to get that dealt with before we start expanding beyond Earth.  When things here are messy, it’s sometimes easier for people to imagine going to a new space than it is to work on the messiness. It's often the case that deeply privileged people fantasize about starting in a new place and bringing a few of their friends with them. But if they don’t fix what’s wrong with themselves and their world before trying to start a new one, they’ll just end up rebuilding the same inequitable, deeply flawed society on Mars or whatever.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/26/what-a-web3-hackathon-teaches-us-about-diversity-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a914ab7a53b5296b337d0bde1540621041807127-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394165,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXtPD,1666814115,DeFi Must Be Defended,"As the crypto policy world debates the future of stablecoins and the legal culpability of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance voters, don’t sleep on the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA). The bipartisan bill co-sponsored by leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee endeavors to answer a couple of key questions confounding crypto lawyers: when should crypto tokens be treated like commodities as opposed to securities, and how should the exchanges on which these tokens trade be regulated.  While the DCCPA helpfully codifies bitcoin and ether as digital commodities under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), it leaves a great deal of the line drawing between crypto securities and crypto commodities uncertain. In addition, in requiring all platforms for buying, selling, and trading crypto tokens to register with the CFTC and comply with other mandates, the DCCPA poses serious challenges to decentralized finance (DeFi). To defend creative dynamism in DeFi, any registration of decentralized crypto token exchanges (DEX) ought to be strictly voluntary.  Jack Solowey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. Jennifer J. Schulp is the director of financial regulation studies at the CMFA.  Cryptocurrencies are innovative because they allow users to store and send value all over the world without the intermediation of trusted third parties. DeFi takes this innovation a step further, disintermediating not only token transfers but also a variety of other financial transactions – from making and taking out loans to trading different types of crypto tokens to creating novel insurance arrangements.  In lieu of financial middlemen, DeFi uses self-executing smart contracts deployed on cryptocurrency blockchains to deliver financial instruments when specified conditions are met. For example, if a user locks the appropriate collateral in a lending protocol’s smart contract, a crypto token loan will be issued.  See also: Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance | Opinion  DeFi has revolutionary potential because it is permissionless and composable, allowing for projects to be more creatively adapted and recombined. The lending scenario described above is permissionless; instead of requiring a traditional credit score – or an “in” with the right institution to get the loan – the borrower only needs the right collateral.  In addition, DeFi is composable – because the underlying smart contracts are written with open-source code and standards, functions can be built atop one another like interoperable Lego blocks. For example, a Web3 application that requires payment in ether (ETH) can still transact with holders of other cryptocurrencies by leveraging a third-party token swap protocol to perform the conversions.  The DCCPA threatens DeFi’s unique features. Although the law does not once use the word “decentralized,” its broad definition of “digital commodity trading facility” (i.e., that which facilitates the execution of digital commodity sales or trading of digital commodities between persons) very likely brings DEXs within its scope. DEXs would therefore be subject to a slew of compliance mandates, beginning with the requirement to register with the CFTC.  The problem with these mandates is that many of them are aimed at what current CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson aptly referred to in a 2021 law review article as “intermediary risks” – the potential for financial middlemen to mishandle assets and information in their possession. Regulations to address intermediary risks don’t make sense for software designed to achieve disintermediation.  See also: There's No Future for DeFi Without Regulation | Opinion  For example, under the DCCPA, covered platforms would be required to “hold customer property (including digital commodities) in a manner that minimizes the risk of loss.” This is relevant to a centralized, custodial exchange but not to a DEX where users self-custody their tokens.  In addition, trading facilities would be required to “make public timely information on price, trading volume and other trading data,” as required by the CFTC. At best, this requirement is superfluous when applied to DEXs composed of open and auditable smart contracts with transactions settling on public blockchains. At worst, it could require information to be provided in formats achievable only with more active management of DEX projects.  Similarly, under the DCCPA, digital commodity platforms would be required to designate a chief compliance officer. While regulators micromanaging personnel is a problem in any context, adding managers to a project that is otherwise a series of self-executing smart contracts is entirely counterproductive to reducing intermediary risks.  Consider how a mandatory registration regime would impact composability and permissionlessness in the example described above of a Web3 app leveraging a DEX protocol for token conversions. Given the DCCPA’s broad definition of trading facility, the app itself might be treated as a covered digital commodity exchange. If so, interoperability with DEX protocols would be a compliance risk, undermining the benefits of composable code.  But even if the law were interpreted to place the compliance onus primarily on the DEX, the need to negotiate policies and terms outlining the relationship between the app and the DEX would make the ecosystem far less permissionless.  See also: The Era of Easy DeFi Yields Is Over | Opinion  To help preserve the composable and permissionless quality of DeFi, any exchange regulation must ask what separates a decentralized exchange from a centralized exchange and how their risk profiles differ. Decentralization can be defined by relevant technical hallmarks, such as whether no person or group has majority control over governance decisions and whether an exchange is composed of open-source, self-executing and publicly auditable smart contracts.  The law also should differentiate between project teams that interpose themselves and their discretion between users and a DEX protocol and developers that simply let the software, not human agency, be the service. The relevant question is whether there is a provider in the loop making promises to users beyond code.  For example, if a front-end user interface provider makes promises about how its own performance will benefit users, such as through active whitelisting or promotion of what it considers worthwhile tokens, that provider is functioning more like a traditional middleman one expects to act in good faith. Barring such promises, however, it makes little sense to subject bona fide decentralized exchanges that are just basic front ends and public, auditable smart contracts to rules designed to address intermediary risks.  Any law that would impose sweeping obligations on DeFi should at the very least know what it is regulating. Defining what it means to be a decentralized exchange is the right place to start because rules ought to be tailored to specific risks. Anything broader would create undue barriers to entry, reducing the very competition among marketplaces that drives innovation, including in consumer protection.  Passing a law that hampers the creative potential of DeFi by mistaking disintermediated exchanges for their very opposite is a serious risk unto itself.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,"Jennifer J.

The people in between hold.""  Thirteen mins later, an ""I……AM……HODLING!!!"" meme showed up in a reply. And thus, the meme was born.  Today, “hodl” also stands for ""hold on for dear life,"" a core tenet of crypto enthusiasts promoting a long-term approach to cryptocurrency investing. When is the best time to hodl? HODLers would probably say now, always and forever.  Buy the dip  ""Buy the dip"" is a crypto holder mantra that encourages people to buy digital assets once they have dropped in price. The belief is the new low price represents a bargain, where the ""dip"" is only a short-term decline that will end with a price increase.  Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, tweeted earlier this year that the Central American country had ""bought the dip"" several times. The country recently purchased 500 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 2,831 bitcoins. (This was after the country recognized bitcoin as legal tender.)  ""Bitcoin is the future. Thank you for selling cheap,"" Bukele tweeted.  Of course, in a crypto winter, the question becomes: When is the dip finished dipping?  Do you want fries with that?  And when the dip keeps dipping? You may have to take that job at McDonald’s.  Crypto trader life  With no closing bell in crypto, ups and downs can happen at any time. As a result, crypto traders tend not to get a lot of sleep.  Talk about sh**coins. Blink, and you’ll miss what new development is trending on Crypto Twitter.  With crypto always on the mind, it can be a little hard for some to not see bitcoin price charts in the topography of mountains.  “This one touches home for sure,” a trader with the Twitter handle @bitbitcrypto said about the meme above. “[T]he average trader who’s stuck in front of screens all day” could easily relate to it.  Midwit  ""Midwit"" is a popular meme convention that depicts an intelligence distribution bell curve featuring three main groups' opinions about a topic. It utilizes Horseshoe Theory, suggesting that those with very high intelligence (on the right of the curve) and those with low intelligence (on the left of the curve) often agree with each other (for different reasons), while those in the middle with averaged intelligence, also referred to as midwits, usually hold the mainstream opinion.  If you simply find Shiba Inu dogs to be cute or believe that rational analysis is futile, you might find yourself on either side of a midwit meme.  Wojak vs. Chad  Wojak, aka ""Feels Guy,"" is a cartoon line drawing of a bald man with a wistful expression. It is often used as a reaction image to represent sadness or melancholy.  The green-tinted Wojak variation is used to represent an optimistic outlook on the crypto market, while his pink counterpart (bleeding eyes and all) is used to represent someone destroyed by the markets or months of staring at charts.  Chad, on the other hand, is a meme representing the stereotypical alpha male who acts with extreme confidence.  As YouTuber Modern Wojak put it in his video “How Wojak Day Trades vs How Chads Day Trade”: “Wojak is known to lose money while trading bitcoin and stocks and Chad is known to be a baller and make loads of money in whatever he does.” The top comment of this video may be more accurate – “Chads don‘t trade, they sell courses.”  Wassie  There are some memes that crypto traders take from the wider web and make their own. Then there are memes that could only originate in crypto. Wassies, green frog-like creatures with crescent moon symbols on their chests, are the latter.  Born out of the 2018 crypto bear market, Wassies have proliferated across crypto trading social media channels. They’re said to have a two-week lifespan, at which point they die and endlessly respawn. If that sounds like a life of torment, it gets worse: Wassies are the keepers of Crypto Twitter history (and so have to read every tweet).  An anonymous Twitter account called Inversebrah, which has amassed over 205,000 followers, has become the predominant role-playing Wassie. Every day, people tag him in posts about important events and cultural phenomena in crypto. “Smolting” (short for “small thing”), as he’s often called, will take a screenshot and retweet the particularly notable posts.  Decrypt's Ben Munster described Inversebrah as ""a true-blue trader, one of those who is interested in neither holding nor pumping but playing the ups and downs of crypto's volatility.""  So why do crypto traders love him? Is it his famously terrible grammar?  ""He is the all seeing eye of crypto. He is everyone and everyone is @inversebrah,"" Twitter user lampssie said.  He has seen all the memes, and now so have you.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SHIB | TRADING,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/26/crypto-trading-memes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f3a9210fdad83c2ca4cc9460f4beb23ceac81d0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420894,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZU5,1666811348,"Bitcoin, Ether Price Surge May Not Last: Crypto Markets Analysis","Bitcoin and ether spiked on Wednesday, their second consecutive day of significant gains.  The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization recently rose 3.3% and 6.7% over the past 24 hours. On Tuesday, BTC crossed $20,000 for the first time since Oct. 5, while ETH topped $1,500 for the first time since the Sept. 15 Merge, the Ethereum blockchain’s technological overhaul.  Whether a new longer-range upturn is afoot or BTC and ETH prices are likely to revert to the mean is still unclear.  Technically, both BTC and ETH blew past traditional “overbought” metrics on their hourly charts, and have since retreated. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shot past 90 for both BTC and ETH on their hourly charts.  As those levels fall well outside the range of normal hourly RSI movement, the RSI may cool, at least from an intraday perspective  Current daily RSI levels for BTC and ETH are both approximately 71. Traditionally, 70 is used as a benchmark for overbought conditions, so both are close to reaching those levels. Merely breaching a traditional level is not enough to determine if price movement is going to change direction, however. An “overbought” asset can remain that way for extended periods under the right conditions.  Volume will likely play a large role in determining whether Tuesday’s price move marked the beginning of a fourth-quarter push higher, or merely a short-term spike in volatility that will soon cool.  Wednesday’s volume gives early hints of the former as today’s price increases were met with higher activity. Should BTC continue to push higher, the price could elevate towards $21,400. For ETH, the upside appears to be just shy of $1,600.  Targets for mean reversion could be $19,400 and $1,300, in line with both of cryptocurrencies' 20-period moving averages.  Exchange net flow may also indicate market trends. While it’s uncertain whether investors are looking to sell into Tuesday’s rally, they appear positioned to do so if need be. BTC and other cryptos have been moving on to exchanges recently.  This is especially noticeable with bitcoin whales, those investors holding at least 1,000 BTC. Whales have been sending increasing amounts of BTC to exchanges for the last 11 days, which could signal potential selling pressure.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/26/bitcoin-ether-price-surge-may-not-last-crypto-markets-analysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ac05c64837491e2ab468025035f8f9ea75bc186-7684x5763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here&apos;s what on-chain data has to say about it. Bitcoin All Exchanges Netflows Remain Muted Following The Price Rise As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange netflows can help us know whether this short-term uptrend is sustainable or not. The &apos;all exchanges netflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting wallets of all centralized exchanges. The metric&apos;s value is simply calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the indicator has a positive value, it means investors are depositing a net number of coins to exchanges right now.

Just as other current U.S. regulators have argued, the crypto industry echoes certain elements of finance in the runup to the 2008 global meltdown, said Goldsmith Romero, who is the lead commissioner for the agency’s technology advisory committee.  “Cryptocurrency was supposed to break from the traditional financial system, and all of its fragility and vulnerabilities,” said Goldsmith Romero, who occupies one of the Democrat-appointed seats on the five-person commission that oversees derivatives trading. “However, this spring unregulated crypto markets revealed their vulnerabilities to similar financial stability risks as traditional finance, with parallel themes from the 2008 financial crisis.”  While suggesting the U.S. shouldn’t rush regulations, she did offer the CFTC as the answer for dealing with the industry’s risk.  “Congress can address financial stability risks by providing additional authority to the CFTC,” she said, supporting a “same risk, same regulatory outcome” approach to establishing crypto rules that would treat the industry the same as other sectors of the financial system.  The CFTC is gaining momentum in Congress to become the primary regulator for crypto trading in multiple bills that would give CFTC the authority over the spot market – or the markets in which the actual tokens trade between investors.  Goldsmith Romero recently told CoinDesk she’s also working on proposing a new definition for ""retail investors"" in crypto, as the CFTC is poised to potentially start policing a wide swath of digital assets trading.

42388794,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRT3rF,1666803025,What Bloomberg’s Crypto Opus Means for the Next Bull Market,"This week’s Oct. 31 print edition of Bloomberg Businessweek will contain just one story, a 40,000-word piece by columnist Matt Levine titled, with justified hubris, “The Crypto Story.” Its apparent aim is to be a one-stop introduction to everything from the basic principles and technology of cryptocurrency to its most fascinating social manifestations.  The significance of this may be unclear to those not actually in the journalism business. But it’s a major landmark, perhaps even the final inflection point between a decade of mainstream skepticism and a future in which cryptocurrency’s importance is taken for granted.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There are three main reasons this single story matters, and maybe matters a lot. First, because Bloomberg is arguably the most influential and respected mainstream business news outlet on the planet right now. The Wall Street Journal certainly still has its role, but it can’t match the breadth and depth of Bloomberg’s organization and output.  Second, because Matt Levine is arguably the most respected financial writer of the moment, at Bloomberg or anywhere else. Levine was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and an M&A lawyer before joining Bloomberg as a columnist in 2013, so he brings mainstream, blue chip expertise to the role.  But just as importantly, he’s a very accessible writer who fully understands how arcane finance is to the average Jane, and he writes with a lot of self-awareness about how little sense the entire topic sometimes seems to make.  That embrace of absurdity has served Levine as a sort of back door to intellectual openness, a freewheeling “isn’t this crazy” approach that has endeared him to both readers and fellow finance writers. His influence among my ilk is hard to overstate: Matt Levine is up there with “The Big Short” author Michael Lewis in the pantheon of writers proving Finance Isn’t Boring.  The third reason Levine’s big crypto story is so important is because it’s … big, 40,000 words, the rough equivalent of a 160-page book (and you can bet Levine will turn this into an actual book).  Bloomberg has only devoted an issue to a similarly epic work once before. It represents a lot of resources devoted to a topic that a few intellectual laggards still regard as nothing more than a sideshow.  Importance is ... important  O.K., so this new crypto story is by the most important financial writer of the day, writing in probably the most important financial publication, at a length that indicates serious commitment. But what does the story actually say?  Perhaps the most emblematic bit of the piece is an image caption early on which reads simply: “Bitcoin is a Big Thing.” The content as a whole offers the same takeaway as the fact of its publication: that crypto Really Matters – for better or for worse.  Levine brings his usual mix of curiosity and humility to the project, and devotes a lot of space to simply explaining, in approachable normie terms, stuff that crypto professionals take for granted (though I always recommend a refresher).  For instance, Levine writes, “In a sense, the technological accomplishment of Bitcoin is that it invented a decentralized way to create scarcity on computers.” That’s a decade-old insight for many of you reading this.  But having Matt Levine explain that thesis, in detail and with an entirely straight face, will have an entirely new wave of finance professionals taking it seriously. Some portion of those serious types will walk away with a newly formed bull case, particularly around Bitcoin and Ethereum.  That is not to say that Levine affirms any particular argument for why crypto matters, or lays out a clear agenda for what it can accomplish, or even says outright that he believes any of this will last indefinitely. (At the time of writing, Levine said he owned about $100 worth of crypto.)  See also: Should Crypto Journalists Own Crypto? | Opinion  What Levine does say is something both more moderate and more important: Crypto is interesting.  “I don’t have strong feelings either way about the value of crypto,” Levine makes clear. “I like finance. I think it’s interesting. And if you like finance – if you like understanding the structures that people build to organize economic reality – crypto is amazing.”  I don’t think it’s a wild exaggeration to say that those four sentences are pretty much Game Over for a certain breed of hard-line cryptocurrency skeptic. There is no room left in the discourse for blanket denial of crypto’s importance as a technological, financial and social happening.  That’s aside from the fact that Levine is neutral on crypto’s actual value. By his lights, things could either go in the direction of greater openness and freedom that bitcoiners often tout, or towards a global hellscape of unregulated scams and unending speculative instability.  If either of those is possible, it seems inarguable that people serious about finance, and in turn about society, need to be paying attention.  When the smartest guy in the room is trying to sell you something, he’s a) motivated to convince you and b) never actually the smartest guy in the room, trust me. But when the smartest guy in the room finds something fascinating, without having a simple verdict, that’s when you pay attention.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42388793,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRT3YX,1666802949,Kollider Raises $2.4M to Build ‘Lightning-Native’ Financial Products,"Bitcoin derivatives exchange Kollider has closed a $2.35 million seed funding round that was led by Lemniscap, with participation from Castle Island Ventures, Polychain Capital, Alameda Ventures, Pfeffer Capital, Okex and other investors.  The firm intends to use the funds to expand its exchange business and add more Lightning-native financial tools to its existing product lineup. Lightning is a network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that helps make bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper.  Kollider refers to its core product as “the world’s first Lightning-native derivatives exchange.” The company is also working on bitcoin-backed synthetic stablecoins and a Lightning-enabled bitcoin wallet.  “We had to battle-test the exchange. It's an exchange completely built from scratch,” Kollider co-founder Konstantin Wünscher told CoinDesk in an interview. “We improved it, built upon it and added some features that you can't get anywhere else, especially the native Lightning integration.”  Read more: Move Over, Ethereum – Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Has Apps, Too  What’s a 'Lightning-native' derivatives exchange?  Most derivatives exchanges require users to fund their accounts before trading. That process can be fast or slow depending on the asset in question. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin typically require up to six confirmations, which usually takes about an hour.  Kollider seems to have found a way around Bitcoin’s inconvenient wait time – native Lightning integration.  “Kollider Exchange leverages Bitcoin’s Lightning network to allow users to instantly open and close positions directly to and from their Lightning wallets. Users don’t need to make deposits in advance or pre-fund accounts,” the Kollider team stated in a release provided to CoinDesk.  According to Kollider’s website documentation, users who don’t use Lightning can still make on-chain bitcoin deposits the old-fashioned way.  Bitcoin-backed synthetic stablecoins  Historically, bitcoin has exhibited high volatility characterized by wild price fluctuations, making it largely unsuitable for everyday payments (although bitcoin’s volatility is currently at a two-year low). This is where stablecoins come in. A stablecoin is an asset-backed cryptocurrency or token designed to minimize price volatility.  Read more: Bitcoin Flat as Volatility Hits 2-Year Low and Stocks Rise  Synthetic stablecoins are a little more abstract and essentially mimic stablecoins without creating an actual stablecoin token. If a synthetic stablecoin is backed by bitcoin, it achieves stability by simultaneously maintaining a long (buy) and short (sell) position in bitcoin.  “The idea is that when you hold one bitcoin, you’re obviously long. But then you use a futures contract and you go short one bitcoin at the same time,” Wünscher explained. “When the price goes up, the bitcoin you hold will obviously appreciate and the value of the short position will depreciate and they cancel each other out. You basically take a market-neutral position.”  But it doesn’t stop there. Because short positions can be taken in several fiat denominations, Kollider users can subsequently create synthetic stablecoins pegged against a diverse range of currencies.  “So if you go short in the bitcoin euro market, you peg it against the euro. If you go short in the bitcoin USD market, you peg it against U.S. dollars. You can pretty much peg against any fiat currency as long as there is a futures market that allows you to short bitcoin,” Wünscher said.  Another feature of Kollider’s synthetic stablecoin model is no overcollaterization (putting up collateral that’s worth more than the stablecoin itself). Decentralized-finance (DeFi) project MakerDAO is famous for its overcollateralized Ethereum stablecoin, DAI.  MakerDAO’s overcollaterization rate for DAI was 170% this past August. In other words, users would need to post $170,000 of collateral in ether (ETH) to receive the equivalent of $100,000 in DAI.  Read more: How Does MakerDAO Work? Understanding the 'Central Bank of Crypto'  “[With Kollider] you don't have to overcollateralize, you simply put in the base amount that you're going to hold long. You're simultaneously short on that, so your exposure is zero; even if the price moves in either direction,” Myles Snider, Kollider’s head of marketing and business development, explained in an interview with CoinDesk.  Kollider’s synthetic stablecoins are now in “alpha,” meaning users can test them out with small amounts. “We have hard-set limits, but we are still testing and improving,” Snider said.  The Kollider Lightning wallet  Another key product that is yet to be fully unveiled is the Kollider Lightning wallet. The company describes it as a Google Chrome extension that will be fully integrated with Kollider’s stablecoins and other applications in the Kollider ecosystem.  “Users will be able to easily move funds between a BTC balance, a USD balance, and a EUR balance with a clean and easy-to-use interface,” the company told CoinDesk in the release.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/26/kollider-raises-24m-to-build-lightning-native-financial-products,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1353537701869228e3d8510a80f3503c95ee9775-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world&apos;s largest digital token by market cap (BTC-USD) climbed 5.2% to $20.84K at 12:37 p.m. ET but still remains rangebound going back to mid-June. Ethereum (ETH-USD) jumped to its highest since the blockchain transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in mid-September, rising 8.9% to $1.55K.All in all, the global crypto market cap crossed back to over $1T with a 5.4% increase over the last day after spending nearly three months below that threshold, according to CoinMarketCap data. The continued upward pressure within the cryptosphere comes as the outsized level of liquidations in short trades, or wagers on falling prices, could have fueled a short squeeze in token prices. Of note, liquidations take effect when an exchange shuts down a trader&apos;s levered and beaten down position since the trader doesn&apos;t have sufficient funds to meet margin requirements to keep the losing trade running. Looking at data from Coinalyze, Sam Bankman-Fried&apos;s crypto exchange FTX saw the most short liquidations by far, recording $1.02B at the time of writing.

42388800,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRT4JJ,1666801166,"In Topsy-Turvy Market Logic, Positive US GDP Could Be Negative for Crypto","After two quarters of contraction in the U.S. economy, one might think traders would be hoping for green shoots. But in the current good-news-is-bad-news market climate, the opposite is true.  Economists estimate that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 2% in the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to FactSet. GDP contracted by 1.6% in the first quarter and 0.6% in the second quarter, prompting speculation as to whether the economy had entered a recession.  While the positive data might seem encouraging for workers, it could be a negative signal for crypto traders because it would show the Federal Reserve the economy is strong, in turn implying the U.S. central bank needs to keep raising interest rates to cool down inflation. And this year the Fed’s rate hikes have depressed prices for risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies. In other words, a quarter of growing GDP would confirm the economy is in good enough condition to withstand further monetary tightening by the central banks, even if markets are hurting.  “The market wants to see the Fed slowing down with interest rate hikes, and for that to happen the Fed needs to see the economy slowing down to a point where growth slows and inflation looks like it’s trending down,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, said.  Inflation rate  The Fed has been raising interest rates sharply as it attempts to suck money out of the economy to slow down spending; the main U.S. inflation rate was 8.2% in September on a year-over-year basis, still close to the highest levels in four decades.  “I do think the Fed will remain steadfast on their consistent emphasis on inflation reduction over the next quarter and even beyond as they continue to push rates higher next week,” said Howard Greenberg of Prosper Trading Academy.  The monetary tightening has caused suffering in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin (BTC) down more than 70% from last year's all-time high around $69,000. Other crypto assets are performing similarly.  Ready for recession  It seems bizarre to argue, but crypto traders might rather see a recession come on sooner than later.  “For crypto, and the broader markets, a negative GDP will prove bullish in the mid-term until we learn more about the Fed’s perception of the economy,” DiPasquale said.  Fed officials signaled at a meeting last month that, on average, they expect the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% next year, from about 3.5% now. Such an increase would imply the loss of millions of jobs and a significant slackening in the economy – a meaningful deceleration from what appears to be the current pace of activity.  Said Edward Moya, senior markets analyst at foreign exchange Oanda: “A bad miss with GDP could be the catalyst needed to take bitcoin out of its trading range and well above the $20,000 level.”  After likely raising the benchmark interest rate to a range between 3.75% and 4% at its next meeting Nov. 1-2, Fed officials have signaled they might begin to move at a slower pace after that.  San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Thursday that “the time is now to start planning for stepping down.” A positive GDP report, however, could encourage central bankers to keep marching on.  “I think that the Fed remains on path to raising rates until the demon of inflation is slain,” said Scott MacDonald, chief economist at Smith's Research & Gradings. “I expect growth to be around 2.5%, which will not be enough to persuade the Fed to pivot.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/26/in-topsy-turvy-market-logic-positive-gdp-could-be-negative-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62c1774c0d74eddc6ee37f350cae0c14c445f75e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Making the transition from pre-launch community group to a funded, growth-stage entity can come with growing pains.  Origami aims to ease that transition with technological framework and guidance for DAOs, The project has row raised $6.2 million in a funding round led by Bloomberg Beta, the early-stage venture firm backed by Bloomberg, L.P. The capital will help Origami build out its software platform, infrastructure and DAO playbook, Ben Huh, Origami founder and CEO, told CoinDesk during an interview.  Origami supports all aspects of launching and running a DAO, including native token minting or creation, operational software, documents and the smart contracts needed for a project.  “We believe that – foundationally – a community of people-based consensus mechanisms has to exist for crypto to actually work,” said Huh, describing the importance of DAOs to the broader industry. “You and I can reach an agreement about what the protocol or project should do, and the right to actually have that say or control should be clear to all the people who are participating.”  Read more: What Is a DAO?  Other investors included betaworks, Protocol Labs, VC3 DAO, and noted angel investors Dylan Field and Balaji Srinivasan, among others. The round was also backed by Orange DAO, a community of entrepreneurs who invests in funds backing early-stage crypto companies. Huh is a general partner at Orange DAO and recuses himself from any business partnership decisions between the entities.  Origami and Orange DAO are teaming up for a “Power-Up” initiative to provide $20,000 in funding each to pre-launch DAOs to help pave the way to a successful launch. The project will fund a minimum of five projects at this time, but more capital was left on the table and the initiative could back 30 to 40 DAOs next year, said Huh.  “$20,000 is just enough for people to say, ‘Okay, there’s somebody who believes in me, we can actually start creating a company that can raise more money to fund this community.,"" explained Huh.  The seed funding will go to select vetted DAOs that have an active and growing community, provide a clear pitch to Orange DAO and utilize Origami’s DAO framework. The DAOs also need to have a legal structure such as an LLC in place, which will receive the funding.  “We’re looking for founders and builders who are committed to actually building the DAO and committed to decentralization. We don’t want this to be just another word for a startup,” said Huh.  “People need to understand that tokens governing DAOs is really where the crux of all the power is. That distribution has to be outlined and fair and it has to incentivize community participation,” he continued. “In that way, this is totally different than evaluating a startup.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/bloomberg-beta-leads-62m-funding-for-dao-framework-origami,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70ecf46afdb169767304e41b5943f33997b11c08-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points (after a 75-point hike in September and a 100-point move in July), the Bank of Canada instead bumped rates up by just 50 basis points to 3.75%. The bank's accompanying statement showed some concern about economic growth: ""Future rate increases will be influenced by our assessments of how tighter monetary policy is working to slow demand, how supply challenges are resolving,"" it said.  Shortly after the Bank of Canada news, the U.S. Census Bureau reported a 10.9% decline in new home sales in September as buyers continued to pull back in the face of sharply higher interest rates. The weak economic data could help lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to follow the Bank of Canada and throttle back on the pace of monetary tightening – a possible bullish development for bitcoin.  The two items helped bitcoin (BTC) continue its modest rally this week, with the largest crypto by market value up 7.5% over the past 24 hours and earlier climbing above $21,000 for the first time since mid-September. At press time, the price had pulled back to $20,850.  Bitcoin $20K  Bitcoin crossed above $20,000 on Tuesday, breaking through a price point that had effectively served as a ceiling for the past couple weeks.  JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that $20,000 is not a major technical level for bitcoin, but “psychologically, it is a little bit bigger level, and it’s trying to bend the fulcrum point.”  Earlier in the day, the crypto market saw the largest short liquidations (bets against price rises) since July 2021, with traders taking huge losses as the price moved upward.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has had an even larger rally this week, up 15% over the past day to nearly $1,600.  The massive short liquidations could be the catalyst for a long-term rally, according to Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner of STORM Partners.  Ahmed said the rally could be due to “a familiar feeling” that bitcoin was bound to “break out of its current stagnation.”  “BTC never likes to remain in one place too much at a time,"" he said.

Oracles are third-party services that fetch external data to a blockchain. They are necessary as blockchains are typically an immutable store of data but cannot independently verify the authenticity of the inputted data. Oracles are therefore used to ensure that accurate data is being used on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and similar products based on any blockchain. This data might range from pricing information to weather forecasts. Oracles can also be bi-directional, allowing them to ""send"" data to the outside world.  Read more: What Is an Oracle?  ""Using oracles to dramatically increase the smart contract's knowledge of what's going on outside of the blockchain, allowing it to respond to external events with specified actions will be crucial,"" Gwendolyn Regina, investment director at BNB Chain, said in a prepared statement. ""Binance Oracle will emerge as a significant contributor to Web3 by offering a stable, reliable and efficient oracle network with comprehensive accuracy and accessibility features.”  Binance said its oracle service will directly benefit some 1,400 applications running on BNB Chain, with 10 BNB Chain projects already integrated with the Binance Oracle network. The service is, however, chain-agnostic and will eventually support more blockchains as well.  Binance oracles would source price data from several centralized crypto exchanges to ensure data reliability.  The lack of reliable oracle data recently contributed toward a $100 million exploit on Solana-based lending service Mango Markets, and a $10 million exploit on Celo-based Moola. In both cases, the attacker was able to trick the protocols into releasing millions of dollars in tokens after manipulating how the oracle-dependent lending mechanisms worked on both protocols.

Chinh said that he was “impatient that virtual assets are not recognized, yet people continue to trade” them. He was discussing amendments to the country’s anti-money-laundering law, local newspaper VnExpress reported.  Lawmakers have been putting pressure on the prime minister, as well as on the governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, the country's central bank, and the minister of justice to clarify their stance toward virtual assets and blockchain technology.  Last month, Duong Van Phuoc, a delegate in the country's National Assembly, advocated for virtual assets to be included in a draft law, pointing out that large-scale gambling and money-laundering rings use them.  Virtual assets now operate in a regulatory gray zone in Vietnam, with many policy proposals in the works, Huy Nguyen, vice chairman of the Vietnam Blockchain Association (VBA), told CoinDesk.  The VBA is working with the National Assembly to propose a virtual-asset tax as a first step toward recognizing virtual assets as property, Nguyen said. Once that happens, “institutional money will flow in,” he said.  Last year, Vietnam’s government instructed the State Bank of Vietnam to start a crypto pilot program. It also named blockchain as one of the technologies on the priority list of research and development for its fourth Industrial Revolution national strategy.

The Sushi DAO community passed the plan, which was proposed earlier this month, on Wednesday with 100% of the votes in favor of the proposition.  DAOs are entities with no central leadership, although SushiSwap is notable because it has a “head chef” to help run the show.  The proposal came after increased scrutiny over DAOs with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission suing Ooki DAO for alleged violations of U.S. investment laws. Crypto advocates have also come out in support of Ooki DAO.  A Cayman Island-registered foundation will be formed to look over the DAO and in turn the exchange. The foundation will be responsible for maintaining treasury reserves, approving grants and looking after other administrative functions.  A Panama-based foundation will be created to develop the existing Sushi protocol, and another Panama-based firm, which would be a subsidiary of the foundation, will also be created to develop the front end of the platform.

42397007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAZMoiz,1666791166,How South Korea’s National Assembly Got Stood Up by Crypto Industry Reps at Terra Hearing,"South Korean lawmakers want to question the crypto industry about its recent failures – but only two witnesses showed up to a hearing.  Two out of five witnesses from the industry showed up to testify before South Korea’s National Assembly hearings on Monday on the crash of multibillion-dollar enterprise Terraform Labs and other crypto failures.  The hearings ended with lawmakers frustrated by the no-shows, CoinDesk Korea reported.Several lawmakers called for charges to be brought against those who didn’t show up, according to the Korea Times.  Terra’s crash set off one of the worst market downturns in crypto’s history, prompting lawmakers to call for more oversight and Korean authorities to take a tougher line against the industry.  Lawmakers used a series of annual hearings where they could question government agencies and relevant witnesses from businesses about pressing issues as an opportunity to investigate Terra’s collapse.  Unable to force Terra co-founder Do Kwon – who might be an international fugitive now – to appear before the assembly, lawmakers selected representatives from the country’s crypto industry to field questions.  Lee Seok-woo, CEO of Dunamu, which runs South Korea’s largest crypto exchange Upbit, appeared as a witness to speak about an Upbit system failure. He had answered questions about the Terra crash earlier this month at the audit of South Korea’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, according to Chosun Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper.  The no-shows included Lee Jung-hoon and Kang Jong-hyun, former chairman and current shareholder of crypto exchange Bithumb, respectively, along with Simon Kim, CEO of venture-capital firm Hashed, and Chai CEO Daniel Shin, who co-founded the Luna network, which is built on the Terra blockchain.  “The continued absence of representatives such as Daniel Shin, who is most responsible for the LUNA incident, is an act of ignoring the 280,000 victims,” lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun said, according to Chosun Ilbo.  Luna was a digital token related to Terra's stablecoin. It imploded along with the collapse of the Terra network in May.  Shin said that he couldn't attend as a witness and answer questions on the same case that South Korean prosecutors are investigating (meaning the Terra crash), CoinDesk Korea reported.  Lee Jae-won, CEO of Bithumb, attended the hearing in place of Lee Jung-hoon. Lee Jae-won wasn't on the original witness list.  The country’s prosecutors have charged Lee Jung-hoon with stealing $70 million in a business deal. He attended his trial in person on Tuesday. Monday’s hearing also intended to cover suspicions that the ARW coin was subject to price manipulation and questions about the ownership structure of Bithumb, according to CoinDesk Korea.  Lee said that he was suffering from depression and a panic disorder and cited that as his reasons for not attending the hearing on Monday, CoinDesk Korea reported.  Lee and Shin were already no-shows at a previous Terra-related audit by South Korea’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, earlier this month.  Hashed’s Kim likewise cited his mental state for his absence at the hearing.  “I have been suffering from anxiety disorders and panic disorders due to extreme mental stress since the Luna-Terra crash,” Kim said. Hashed was an early investor in Terraform Labs.  Kang also submitted a written reason for his absence. CoinDesk has reached out for comment.  Not appearing at a hearing without justifiable reasons is punishable by imprisonment for up to three years or subject to a fine between 10 million and 30 million won (between $7,000 and $21,000).  Both the ruling and opposition parties agreed in advance to press charges against Lee Jung-hoon if he didn't attend the hearings, CoinDesk Korea reported.  “It seems like that the witnesses didn't attend and didn’t have acceptable reasons,” lawmaker Baek Hye-ryeon said at the hearing. She said that once both parties come to an agreement, they will file a complaint, according to the report.  A source close to the country’s lawmakers told CoinDesk that the “National Assembly hearings are over. But they [the lawmakers] are not done with Terra, Bithumb and Hashed.”  Read more: Do Kwon Denies Report That South Korean Prosecutors Froze $39.6M of His Crypto",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/26/how-south-koreas-national-assembly-got-stood-up-by-crypto-industry-reps-at-terra-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5a532bdabe3101026d94d683abf45a9fd47b01c-5595x4196.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polygon’s Supernets are customizable networks without any operational costs. This gives developers the ability to build their projects quickly on the supernets without any barriers to entry. Supernets ultimately aim to scale blockchains that are used for decentralized applications (dapps) such as gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other entertainment projects.  Read more: What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained  Axelar, which was created by the founding members behind the Algorand blockchain, is a network that gives users tools to connect their digital assets and dapps across multiple blockchains to unlock cross-chain communication. The company’s partnership with Polygon’s supernets will thus offer interoperability with other blockchains.  Polygon’s supernets are fairly new, with Polygon saying it would invest $100 million in them back in April. Avalanche also committed $290 million in March to develop its own version called “subnets.”  Read more: Polygon Commits $100M to ‘Supernets’ as Layer 1s Stand Up Application-Specific Blockchains  The Axelar/Polygon partnership “enables complex operations – for example, cross-chain borrow-lend, using NFTs as collateral,” said Parth Pathak, general manager of supernets at Polygon, in a statement to CoinDesk, referring to non-fungible tokens.  The goal for interoperability projects like Axelar is to “allow developers to build anywhere they want and still be connected to everyone else,” Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov told CoinDesk. “So that's really the opportunity that we’re creating for the supernets and just the broader ecosystem.”  Read more: Blockchain Interoperability Network Axelar Raises $35M at $1B Valuation",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | MATIC,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/26/axelar-and-polygon-supernets-team-up-to-provide-cross-chain-interoperability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e303160de7296f6b6346378b77c80d21f5de8baa-4267x3200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394128,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXsUn,1666789054,Macro Problems Are Clouding Ethereum Merge Advances,"The Merge of the Ethereum network celebrated its one-month anniversary on Oct. 19.  As that historic shift settles in, the picture is not easy to read. Key underlying metrics are moving in the right direction, despite the overarching noise of global markets at a turbulent time for investors.  Simon Peters is a crypto market analyst at social investment network eToro.  The price of ETH hasn't reacted positively in the month since then, but this is under pressure from macroeconomic factors causing broader investment market volatility rather than pessimism from investors about Ethereum’s specific case.  This volatility, as we all know, is caused by a rough confluence of growing inflation, rising interest rates and other investor concerns about market valuations.  In fact, beyond the market movement headlines, some notable changes have already taken place thanks to The Merge. But these don’t feed through to investment performance when everyone in the market is distracted by bigger problems.  See also: The Merge Doesn't Solve Ethereum's 'Atomic Composability' | Opinion  In the same way that a company in this market can post a strong set of results and still see its share price slump, ETH is being dragged along by a market that isn’t interested in paying attention to revolutionary changes.  Deflation and decarbonization  So, what are those key changes? First off, the amount of ETH in circulation has quietly become deflationary since around Oct. 8. With EIP-1559 still in effect, where a portion of transaction gas fees are burnt, more ETH is currently being burned than created via staking and block rewards.  The onset of deflationary economics for the token is still early – too early to appreciate tangible impacts, and too early to reflect in price movement when markets are still heavily gauged toward fear. But the total number of ETH staked just tipped over 14 million. The overall trend is upwards.  Furthermore, and probably more significantly, the staking rate percentage – the balance of the ETH 2.0 deposit contracts divided by the total ETH supply – is at its highest level and continues to climb. Currently, over 11% of the circulating supply is locked in staking.  The Merge has also been successful from an energy and environmental perspective. The move from proof-of work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been estimated to cut the network’s energy consumption by 99.99%, according to the Ethereum Foundation.  Making the network more energy efficient is essential. This has particular importance in the current global macroeconomic circumstances, in which energy prices are high and emission reductions are expedient.  In a world where energy costs, consumption and its effects are being watched carefully by both households and governments, a PR victory here for Ethereum might be significant, in time.  See also: 3 Big Things the Merge Will Change About Ethereum | Opinion  Price distractions  The fall in ETH’s value will be pointed to as evidence of the failure and overhype of The Merge. But like any investment and market, The Merge won’t be judged on a tiny snapshot of performance and is something of a distraction after such a short time span.  The Merge was an inherently long-term change to the way the Ethereum network is governed and how it uses its resources. The promise of overnight miraculous change is anathema to grown-up, long-term, sustainable development and should be treated with caution by investors.  Ethereum is arguably the largest ecosystem within crypto. Thousands of projects and decentralized applications (dapps) rely on the Ethereum blockchain to store data and manage their functions.  As the Ethereum ecosystem has grown, scaling products have been vital to keep dapps fast and cheap to use in terms of gas, or transaction, costs. At its core, this is the main reason for transitioning from PoW to PoS.  Major TradFi institutions such as JPMorgan have already indicated that markets might not be pricing The Merge’s upside potential correctly because of overarching investment market volatility.  In theory, prices should increase when supply drops and demand increases. Whether this will overcome the current bearish macroeconomic climate, only time will tell. Market watchers are furiously looking for a turn – but it won’t arrive overnight. Long-term investors should focus on the long-term investment case.  Investors with a firm conviction in the long-term use cases of tokens such as ETH should ensure they are prepared for more volatility ahead because the economic story doesn’t yet appear to have turned the corner.  But the long-term thesis – which includes the considerations mentioned – for their investment should be a bigger factor in decision-making than pure market movement. That should always be the focus of anyone interested in the future of the Ethereum network, and the crypto sector more widely.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Simon Peters,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/26/macro-problems-are-clouding-ethereum-merge-advances,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97ec31a4a755def6aadd091400e7d12e2e2da3ba-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394126,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXsZv,1666788923,"Technical Analysis Is Dead, Long Live Transaction Analysis","Technical analysis was controversial before crypto trading existed.  For the uninitiated: technical analysis, or TA, tries to predict future price movements based on historical price movements. This is done generally by looking for repeatable patterns in price data.  Miguel Morel is founder and CEO of Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company. This opinion is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  TA bulls believe these chart patterns can be self-fulfilling, given the price reflexivity of traders placing bets based on the same data and analyses. Skeptics say that these patterns are a bunch of nonsense, that TA is astrology for men.  During the 2021 crypto bull run there was a technical analysis craze. Crypto trading circles were full of price charts with lines scrawled over them tracking Fibonacci retracement resistance levels, flags, pennants, cups, triangles and other augurious shapes.  Is technical analysis BS? Not entirely. Of course past price action tells you something about future price action. This is true anywhere: knowling something’s history helps you better predict its future.  But exactly what TA tells you isn’t easy to figure out. And nobody seems to know for sure whether its various geometric predictors can guarantee anything.  More from Trading Week: Black Thursdays: Bitcoin's 5 Worst Crashes | Opinion  Crypto traders have been forced to rely on technical analysis because they don’t have much else to go on – like cash flows, which are used to model stocks. Plus, price data is easily accessible in crypto (that’s the point of a blockchain). But next-generation crypto analytics tools are leading to the rise of a new TA: transaction analysis.  Smarter analysis  In traditional finance transaction data is guarded by exchanges, brokers, banks and regulators. It’s not accessible to everyone and big players pay a fortune for it. In crypto, transaction data is public and on-chain – but it’s not usable by everyone.  Manually making sense of raw blockchain data is practically impossible. The data needs to be processed and analyzed to be made useful. That’s what sophisticated blockchain analytics tools are doing.  The combination of on-chain data and transaction analysis is something that hasn’t been before – in crypto or traditional finance. Getting access to transaction data and tools for searching and analyzing it will unlock a goldmine of potential insight.  People who have been on the inside of projects and see how the sausage is made know that the explanations for price movements are often simple and based on key players buying and selling. When the biggest holders are dumping the price is likely to go down. When a major new buyer takes a position prices are likely to go up.  That’s insight traditional TA cannot provide, because it’s limited to looking at price movements. Transaction data, instead, is the underlying activity that generates prices in crypto.  More from Trading Week: Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto | Opinion  A concrete example: Tesla’s announcement of their purchase of $1.5 billion in BTC caused an immediate 10% jump in the price. Those transactions took place before the announcement and could have been traded on.  Tracking buying and selling by the market’s players is the simplest application of transaction analysis but there are many others. Flows to and from exchanges, institutional positions, historical performance, market maker activity and so on can be used to put together a model of the market that drives trading decisions.  For example, in the days before Celsius froze withdrawals the company deployed hundreds of millions of dollars to its decentralized finance (DeFi) positions in order to prevent liquidation. These deployments were visible on-chain and indicated that Celsius was in a distressed position. That could have been traded on.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ARKM,Miguel Morel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/26/technical-analysis-is-dead-long-live-transaction-analysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d39f16de7a37175201d6b11f4d99c79d04ba284-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speculative assets that focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 have been hit even harder, with several plunging 90% in less than a year.  Andreessen Horowitz has been far less prolific in its investments this year, making just nine crypto investments in the third quarter of this year, compared with 26 deals in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Pitchbook.

(ACDC).  Compass will host about 9,000 Antminer S19 XP and S19j Pro units at the facility on behalf of its clients starting in the fourth quarter of this year, according to a statement. Aspen Creek’s Texas facility has a total of 30MW worth of mining capacity, making Compass the largest hosting client for the start-up miner.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers can store their mining rigs and mine digital assets for a fee. The service has been a popular way for miners to earn bitcoin rewards without having to sink a large amount of capital to build out infrastructure. However, with high power costs and a crypto winter weighing heavily on the industry, miners have been looking for more reliable and cheaper hosting partners.  Read more: Compute North Files for Bankruptcy as Crypto-Mining Data Center Owes up to $500M  “Compass Mining continues to seek out high quality hosting providers such as ACDC that benefit our mining clients uptime and reliability,” co-founder and co-CEO Thomas Heller said in the statement. “ACDC’s pairing of cost effective, renewable energy with mining operational excellence is difficult to find in today’s current market,” he added.  Compass, which allows retail investors to buy small amounts of mining capacity in sites around the world, doesn't own any of the facilities available on its platform.  The move comes after Compass closed two of its Georgia facilities last month, citing higher prices. The Georgia site was hosting about 5,000 machines, or about 15 megawatts (MW), for Compass customers. Compass has had issues with downtime, delays in deployment and mining rigs stuck in Russia, so much so that CEO Whit Gibbs stepped down in June and the new management cut 15% of staff.  Aspen Creek, which was founded in January, recently raised $8 million in a Series A funding, despite the challenging bear market. ACDC was able to distinguish itself from other mining startups by using the “power first” approach, in which the company secured power and infrastructure first for its mining operations before looking to raise money – a contrast to what some other miners have done.  The company’s business model of powering data centers using renewable energy has also garnered the attention of investors as it translates to lower power costs amid the recent spike in power prices for the miners. Its use of cheap and reliable renewable energy as well as its ability to sell excess power back to the grid were key attributes that attracted Polychain Capital, one of the lead investors in Aspen Creek, during its recent fundraise.

42393760,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmJv,1666782900,"Ethereum’s Layer 2 Rollups Reduce Costs, but the Risks Are Underappreciated","It’s no secret that Ethereum can be prohibitively slow and expensive. The blockchain became virtually unusable for most people at the peak of crypto’s most recent hype cycle, when something as simple as swapping one token for another could have cost upwards of $40. There’s a reason why blockchain alternatives like Solana (pitched as an “Ethereum killer”) and then Aptos (a “Solana killer”) debuted.  For those wanting to keep transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem, though, there are layer 2 rollups. They run parallel to Ethereum, augmenting its ledger and delivering lower fees without, in theory, compromising security.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  As they’ve grown in popularity – more than $3 billion in Ethereum user funds have been locked up on Arbitrum and Optimism, the largest rollup networks – what has been underappreciated is that they’re riskier and more centralized than most users recognize. While transacting on these networks will eventually be as safe as transacting on Ethereum’s main network, planting money on Optimism and Arbitrum today means placing a tremendous amount of trust in the integrity of their developer teams and the quality of their code.  Rollups bundle up transactions and then pass them back to Ethereum, where the entire batch of transactions is added to the ledger in one fell swoop. That can cut costs dramatically. Arbitrum and Optimism boast fees around 95% lower than those of Ethereum’s base chain.  Additionally, they are marketed as more secure alternatives to so-called sidechains and commit chains – networks that pass transactions to Ethereum with little more than a “pinky promise” that they reflect real user activity.  Unlike trust-based sidechains, layer 2 rollups have special systems to guarantee that transactions aren’t spoofed or altered before they are passed back to Ethereum's main chain.  That’s the idea, at least. While Ethereum's rollup networks aim to achieve equivalent security to Ethereum itself, virtually all existing rollups currently require that users trust the rollup’s own, centralized operators – rather than Ethereum’s vast network of operators – to know that funds are safe.  “We should get to the point where technology is mature enough that it's completely trustless and we don't need to trust any external third party,” Bartek Kiepuszewski, the founder of layer 2 watchdog site L2BEAT, said in an interview. But, he added, “we still have a long way to get there.""  Optimism and Arbitrum comprise 80% of the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum layer 2s. At their core are “fraud proofs.” If someone notices that transactions from Optimism or Arbitrum look fishy, they have time to submit one of these proofs to prove their case. This cryptographic evidence, if submitted in time, will definitively prove that the rollup has passed botched data to Ethereum.  Trusting Optimism and Arbitrum, in other words, means trusting that anyone can submit a fraud proof to call out incorrect or malicious transactions. But neither system works like this today.  On Arbitrum, only a select group of hand-picked operators are allowed to submit fraud proofs.  Harry Kalodner, the co-founder of Arbitrum builders Offchain Labs, said in an interview the team aims to make it so anyone can submit proofs within the next six months. But for now, Arbitrum users need to trust Arbitrum and its curated group of validators to know their transactions will not be tampered with.  Meanwhile, Optimism, despite having $2 billion locked in its virtual bank vault, has yet to deploy fraud proofs (which it calls “fault” proofs) at all. The network’s proof system is “currently undergoing major redevelopment,” so is currently not active, according to the Optimism website. However, they are said to be planned for a soon-to-arrive update.  Without fully baked, fraud-proof systems, Arbitrum and Optimism cannot claim they “share” Ethereum’s security. Instead, centralized actors – the chains’ builders – technically have the ability to alter how transactions are processed.  And the concerns about centralized control don’t end at Arbitrum and Optimism’s fraud-proof systems. Both also use centralized sequencers – meaning they rely on single parties to bundle up transactions and pass them down to Ethereum’s base chain.  This does not give either platform the ability to alter transactions or steal funds, but it could, potentially anyway, allow them to censor or reorder transactions to extract MEV, should they so choose. (CoinDesk has seen no evidence that either platform has ever done this, though.)  Smart contracts and upgrades  The leading rollups are not as trustless as users may believe, but so long as the teams behind Optimism and Arbitrum act honestly, incomplete fraud-proof systems and centralized sequencers are reasonable to expect so long as the platforms eventually decentralize.  But centralization is not the only reason why Optimism and Arbitrum do not have equivalent security to Ethereum itself.  As with other rollups, another security risk when using Optimism and Arbitrum is that their core codebases – the Ethereum-based smart contracts that allow them to operate – are vulnerable to hacks like any other blockchain-based programs.  Kalodner of Offchain Labs points to “smart contract risk broadly” as the key risk for rollup platforms like Arbitrum.  “I think that there's a reason why we go through a lot of audits on our code. And it's because writing secure code is quite hard. I think I'm quite convinced that our code is secure, but it took a lot of iterations of audits to get back and being confident, essentially, it's hard. You can never be 100% confident on any of this stuff,” he said.  If code is buggy, there needs to be a way for developers to quickly upgrade a rollup’s systems in order to protect users.  Today, Optimism and Arbitrum have systems that grant their teams the ability to quickly upgrade their software to fix unforeseen issues.  But upgradability leads to a sort of Catch-22 for rollup platforms.  “On the one hand, you'd like your contracts to be immutable,” said Kiepuszewski, because updates can be used to “upgrade the contract to something that is either outright malicious or is buggy.”  To explain why upgrades can be dangerous, Kiepuszewski mentioned August’s Nomad bridge attack, where a buggy upgrade enabled the theft of nearly $200 million.  “Upgrades are extremely dangerous,” said Kiepuszewski. “But on the other hand, if there is a bug and you discover it you definitely want to upgrade to a version that does not have a bug. So you've got those two conflicting needs and you have to somehow try to take both into account.”  In the long term, Optimism and Arbitrum both plan to further safeguard and decentralize their upgrade processes. Doing so in a manner that prevents malicious upgrades while still preserving security will prove difficult.  “Living on the cutting edge of technical evolution comes with great advantages in terms of features, but also certainly comes with, you know, some elevated degrees of risk,” Kalodner said.  The rollup race  Optimism and Arbitrum, the largest rollup platforms by far, are by no means the only layer 2 teams that have been forced to make compromises in order to develop safely and quickly.  Moreover, while it is difficult to know whether everyday users are aware of their current risks, the teams behind both projects have been relatively forthcoming when it comes to disclosing risk.  “Some teams are more upfront about the risks. They do inform their users that the system is, so far, not yet decentralized – they've got a lot of training wheels,” said Kiepuszewski.  But not all teams have been so honest, he added. “I'd say that some teams have a different marketing strategy and it's almost like fine print somewhere in the documentation.”  Moreover, said Kiepuszewski, “We’ve found over the years that there's a lot of discrepancy between documentation and actual code.”  As Ethereum’s rollup race heats up, definitions are only becoming blurrier for end users.  Upcoming “zero-knowledge” rollups from Polygon, Scroll and Matter Labs will theoretically offer a large number of benefits over the incumbents, but their added complexity could leave them even more vulnerable to hacks and centralization, at least in the short term.  Precisely what these vulnerabilities are, however, is not always made clear from the outset.  What is clear is that while Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap may finally be taking form, it will be a while before using these platforms will be as safe and decentralized as using Ethereum’s main network.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/26/ethereums-layer-2-rollups-speed-things-up-but-the-risks-are-underappreciated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fcc740e8fb3c6e450a6f3ead708799ac5ef77e6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388797,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRT40b,1666780693,UK Police Have Crypto Experts Stationed Nationwide,"The U.K. National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has stationed crypto tactical advisers in police departments nationwide to help investigate and seize digital assets tied to crime, an official said.  “There are officers now in every force in every regional organized crime unit, trained and equipped to do that,” Andrew Gould, staff officer for NPCC’s cryptocurrency portfolio, said while speaking at a hearing for the new Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency bill on Tuesday.  With the bill, the U.K. government is looking to give law enforcement the power to easily freeze crypto assets with links to criminal activities. But the country’s police agencies have already been boosting their efforts to target criminals that use crypto for money laundering or funding terrorism.  The NPCC has been able to strengthen its crypto capabilities thanks to the extra 100 million pounds sterling it received from the government, Gould said. U.K. police chiefs were lobbying the government for funding to equip and train 250 crypto tactical advisors in 2018, Bloomberg reported.  “So we're in a position where we've actually seized hundreds of millions of pounds worth of cryptocurrency assets within the last year or so,” Gould said.  He added that the police force has procured investigative tools and the ability to store seized crypto at the national level. The NPCC tapped digital asset custodian Komainu in January to provide the police a more ""robust"" means to store cryptocurrencies seized during investigations.  However, Gould still believes that the NPCC cannot keep up with crypto because it is costly.  “The assets themselves are becoming more diverse, more technical, complex, so our officers are kind of in an arms race trying to keep up,” Gould said, adding that the tools they do use can’t accommodate every crypto asset.  “So we need more than one investigative tool to better investigate effectively. That's very expensive,” Gould said.  It’s also difficult for the police to retain staff while having to compete with the glossy pay cheques offered by the private sector, Gould explained.  “One of my sergeants has just been offered 200,000 [pounds] to go to the private sector. We can't compete with that. That's probably the biggest risk we face within this area at the moment,” Gould said. Some police officers in the U.K are paid an annual salary between 28,000 and 100,000 pounds.  The NPCC did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

42388799,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRT4Ed,1666775819,"New NFT Rules Possible if Lawmakers Ask, EU Official Says","Further European Union legislation on non-fungible tokens could be issued if requested by lawmakers, an official from the bloc's executive arm said on Wednesday.  ""The parliament is working on a resolution on NFTs,” said Peter Kerstens, head of the European Commission’s financial technology task force, while speaking of a procedure under which members of the European Parliament choose to set out their wishes on a particular policy issue.  The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA) left the treatment of NFTs, which offer digital proofs of ownership, somewhat ambiguous. But that uncertainty could leave the door open for further policy actions, said Kerstens, who is also a senior adviser at the commission department responsible for financial services.  While, legally, the commission isn’t obliged to comply with lawmakers' wishes, “if there is a strong political indication or wish for an initiative, that may move the Commission into presenting it,” Kerstens said. “If we don't act on it, we'll have a lot of explaining to do, and I think we'll end up having an unhappy parliament. We don’t like an unhappy Parliament.”  Later at the same event, EU lawmaker Eva Kaili confirmed she will be holding the pen on the Parliament’s new report – and she wants to avoid the controversies of MiCA, which focuses on regulating individual entities such as crypto wallet companies.  “We need to rethink the regulatory approach and move towards implementing activity-based regulation … rather than an entity-based one for NFTs,” said Kaili, a Greek left-wing lawmaker, adding that she wouldn’t seek to constrain the sector too much.  “It should not be in just one box of media … it deserves a custom regime ... they can be used in many industries,” she said, adding that the final report would take as long as six months to draft.  MiCA requires crypto companies to register with the authorities and meet consumer protection and financial stability norms. But officials also worry that, although NFTs ostensibly represent articles like artworks, they are prone to the same kind of abusive behavior that plagues more conventional financial markets, such as price manipulation.  While, in principle, MiCA applies only to fungible tokens, there’s a “lot of prose” in the final draft concerning exactly when self-proclaimed NFTs might actually fall under the law – and the framework doesn’t always get it right, Kerstens said.  The legislation “has a very peculiar sentence in there which says that if an NFT is part of a large series or a collection, that’s an indicator that it’s fungible, which is actually incorrect,” Kerstens said.  Whether or not it’s right, there’s great confusion about exactly what NFT creators and exchanges like OpenSea will be expected to do once the law takes effect in 2024.  “We haven't seen a case where existing NFTs in the market would fall into MiCA,"" Gabriel Cumenge, deputy assistant secretary at the French Ministry of Economy, told the same conference hosted by Blockchain for Europe on Tuesday.  Cumenge's view appears likely to be disputed by other crypto experts. Patrick Hansen, previously a venture adviser at Presight Capital and now employed by stablecoin issuer Circle, has previously argued that MiCA could end up covering 95% of the market as NFTs are often issued as collections.

The budget presented Tuesday reiterates June's announcement that bitcoin won't be treated as a foreign currency for tax purposes. It also appeared to clarify that the country won't follow El Salvador's example of allowing the cryptocurrency to be used as legal tender.  “This may be the first time cryptocurrency has been mentioned in the federal budget papers, which is a sign of the rising adoption of cryptocurrency,"" said Michael Bacina, a partner at law firm Piper Alderman.  The statement, which follows consultations by the Board of Taxation, means the current tax treatment of digital currencies remains and that capital gains tax will continue to apply to crypto assets held as investments. It complements an August decision to use token mapping as a framework for regulation in an effort to bring clarity to the largely unregulated sector. Token mapping involves uncovering the characteristics of digital assets to identify how they should be regulated.  ""The decision was expected but it creates further clarity and certainty which will help with trust and further adoption,"" said Holger Arians, CEO of Banxa, an Australia-based fiat-to-crypto exchange.  El Salvador's decision to allow bitcoin as legal tender ""has the potential to create uncertainty about the status of crypto assets such as bitcoin for tax purposes in Australia,"" the budget said. ""This clarification will deliver a consistent tax requirement for crypto asset holders.""  It's important the government recognizes that it shouldn't lump all digital assets ""into one basket, as they are extremely varied,"" said Talis J. Putnins, a crypto researcher at the University of Technology Sydney. ""Legislators need to keep in mind that digitization and tokenization is a technology not an asset class.""  ""The token mapping exercise, coupled with the review of the Board of Taxation has the potential to be instrumental in the development of confidence in our regulatory frameworks,"" said Steve Vallas, the former CEO of Blockchain Australia and a senior technology adviser to investment firm Skafold.

For the first time in three weeks, the price has surpassed $20,000 with the move coming as a surprise to many. Most recently, inflation fears and macroeconomic uncertainties have dominated the crypto market. Fundamental changes in this regard did not occur yesterday. So what was the reason for yesterday&apos;s upswing in the Bitcoin market? Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Shrinks To All-Time Lows - What To Expect What is apparent is that the stock market also rose yesterday, as Microsoft and Google, among others, announced earnings. However, whether this was enough to revive Bitcoin&apos;s volatility is questionable. A better explanation might be the Dollar Index (DXY). When the DXY began to loose its ground between 8 and 10 a.m. EDT, Bitcoin&apos;s price surged shortly thereafter. The DXY dropped from 112.072 to 110.846 points within those two hours. During the same time, the Bitcoin price showed initial strength, which then extended into a further rally. This phenomenon is not new. For much of 2022, Bitcoin and the dollar index were strongly correlated in an inverse relationship, i.e., while the DXY was rising, BTC was falling. While the correlation has declined again in recent weeks, yesterday&apos;s move may suggest a resumption of the correlation.

42415312,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd4jn,1666767865,Singapore Central Bank Proposes Stablecoin Rules to Rein In Crypto Sector,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has proposed a slew of new rules to rein in the local crypto industry – starting with some stringent standards for stablecoin issuers.  The rules include setting capital and reserve requirements for issuers of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that maintain their value against fiat currencies or assets like gold. The measures also seek to ban issuers from engaging in ""other activities that introduce additional risks"" like lending or staking, which lets users lock their crypto and earn interest.  The proposals, which were published on Wednesday, come after a turbulent year for crypto markets. The downturn is particularly frustrating for Singapore regulators, as a number of collapsed multi-billion-dollar crypto enterprises like stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital have ties to the country. The MAS had since promised to tighten regulations for the sector.  In two documents, which are open to public consultation until Dec. 21, the proposed stablecoin rules are accompanied by intentions to limit certain retail investors from accessing crypto markets.  ""MAS is concerned that retail customers may not have the financial wherewithal to withstand large losses that are likely to ensue from speculative trading of markets that they do not fully understand,"" a consultation paper on proposed regulatory measures for digital payment token services said.  Stablecoins  The MAS wants stablecoin issuers (that have previously come under scrutiny over the quality of the reserves that back the assets) to at least match their reserves to the value of the crypto in circulation.  For instance, stablecoin issuer Circle will be required to hold cash (and cash-equivalent) reserves to match the $43.8 billion worth of USD coin in circulation – and must be valued on a daily basis. The reserves must also be in the same currency as the one to which the stablecoin is pegged.  The proposed measures also seek to establish a base capital requirement, which would be the higher of 1 million Singapore dollars (around $709,000) or operating expenses for six months.  To mitigate the risk of overleveraging that, in part, led to the cascading fall of a number of lenders in the space, the MAS also wants to prohibit stablecoin issuers from providing ""other non-issuance services"" like lending, staking, trading – although companies could still engage in these activities through a ""separate related entity in which the issuer does not have a stake.""  Consumer access measures  The MAS is also proposing crypto service providers to set up checks for retail customers, to gauge their financial knowledge. These requirements won't apply to Artificial Intelligence-based trading systems or institutional investors ""who are generally regarded as better able to access professional advice,"" the document said.  In the same document, the MAS proposes that crypto platforms ""establish and implement effective policies and procedures to identify and address conflicts of interests.""  ""For example, an entity may operate a market (trading venue) while at the same time conduct proprietary trading and/or market making services, allowing the entity to potentially front run customers’ orders,"" the document said, adding that the companies must therefore ""disclose to their customers"" of any conflicts of interest along with measures to mitigate them.

42415320,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd4tO,1666767600,Foreign Exchange Transactions Take Center Stage in New BIS CBDC Report,"A six-week pilot project to evaluate whether central bank digital currencies (CBDC) would be useful for foreign exchange transfers successfully had 20 different commercial banks conduct over 160 payments worth around a total of $22 million, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) revealed in a report Wednesday.  Central banks – based in Hong Kong, China, the United Arab Emirates and Thailand – issued over $12 million on the platform, allowing the commercial banks to conduct payment and foreign exchange payment versus payment transactions (PvP), the report said. The pilot was part of BIS's ongoing Project mBridge, a collaboration between the international financial institution and the central banks of those four nations that is studying CBDCs and their possible role in cross-border payments and multi-CBDC transactions.  The group hinted at the trial in a brief LinkedIn post published last month, but only shared full details ahead of next week's Hong Kong Fintech Week conference.  Read more: Landmark International CBDC Test Deemed Success, BIS Says  Liquidity was one key concern for the banks involved, the report said.  ""One important observation is the limited number of FX PvP transactions which were conducted during the pilot compared with one-way payments,"" the report said. ""This reflected in part the relatively short window of time banks had to off-load their foreign CBDCs due to the requirement set by some central banks to clear balances of their CBDCs at the end of the day, along with the limited overlapping RTGS [real-time gross settlement] hours between the four jurisdictions.""  According to the document published Wednesday, one issue the banks found was that the on-bridge transactions lacked ""an efficient FX price-discovery mechanism."" The FX rates were instead determined off-bridge, before the transactions occurred, which led to the banks needing to tap preexisting balances in nostro accounts rather than using mBridge itself.  ""Given the need to rely on existing correspondent banking relationships for liquidity, the real-value nature of transactions and the short time span of the pilot, transactions took place, for the most part, between banks with pre-existing business and service relationships,"" the report said.  The group recommended integrating functions to address liquidity concerns in future tests.  Centralized test  Much of the report delves into how the pilot was actually set up, saying it ""required extensive coordination and engagement both within and among central banks and commercial banks.""  The banks also used a centralized version of the mBridge ledger for the purposes of the pilot, the report said. The group plans to look at ""further distributing the deployment and operations"" in future pilot programs.  The pilot itself occurred in three phases between Aug. 15, 2022 and Sept. 23, adding new jurisdictions in each phase.  Over the course of those six weeks, the banks trialed transacting in the recipient bank's CBDC, issuing and redeeming their own CBDC and swapping from one CBDC to another.  ""On the platform, a commercial bank can transact with any other commercial bank directly in a peer-to-peer manner. Among the 20 participating commercial banks, five from each jurisdiction, this connectivity enabled 150 different bilateral and direct potential connections,"" the report said.  The pilot also incorporated safeguards to prevent excess or insufficient liquidity issues. Looking ahead, the report went on to note the potential implications of allowing commercial banks to engage in foreign CBDC transactions.  During this summer's pilot, a domestic bank had to be involved in at least one part of any given transaction, the report said, except for transactions in a currency foreign to both counterparties.  ""During the pilot, while participating banks were able to directly transact in the CBDCs of other jurisdictions on the platform, foreign banks were limited in terms of how they could move CBDCs on mBridge,"" the report said. ""... This ensures that significant amounts of domestic currency cannot accumulate offshore beyond the central bank’s control, limiting opportunities for the currency to be used for speculative purposes.""  The central bank group plans to focus on liquidity management, FX price discovery, legal frameworks, data privacy, decentralized deployments and other business use cases in further pilot projects over the next two years, the report said.  ""Equipped with the lessons from the pilot and earlier phases of the project, Project mBridge will continue its work,"" the report said. ""This includes the technology-build and testing – including improving on existing functionalities and adding new functionalities to the platform – in an effort to move from the current pilot phase towards MVP and eventually a production-ready system.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/26/foreign-exchange-transactions-take-center-stage-in-new-bis-cbdc-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a26b5a949bdc3662db056a8fdf23abfc9f8b969c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415309,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd4h3,1666766740,Crypto Markets See Largest Short Liquidations in 15 Months; Ether Leads Token Surge,"Crypto markets had over $700 million in liquidations on short trades, or bets against price rises, reaching levels not seen since July 2021.  The liquidations may have contributed to a short squeeze because prices of several tokens jumped in the past 24 hours. Longs, or traders betting on higher prices, saw an additional $100 million in liquidations amid short-term price volatility.  Ether (ETH) jumped 10% to lead the surge among major cryptocurrencies, with Cardano's ADA, Solana's SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) adding some 9% and bitcoin (BTC) adding a tamer 4.3%. The overall market capitalization of the crypto market increased 4% regaining the $1 trillion mark, a level previously seen in August.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Crypto exchange FTX recorded over $519 million in short liquidations, the most among its counterparts, followed by OKX at $71 million and Binance at $46 million. Some on Crypto Twitter remarked the move was unusual.  Bitcoin-tracked futures saw some $368 million in both long and short liquidations, followed by ether futures at $356 million. Among the other majors, ADA futures had $16 million in losses for traders.  Meanwhile, open interest, or the amount of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled, increased by 6.6%, implying traders opened more positions in anticipation of a further price surge.  The moves came amid a rise in broader equity markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Wednesday 2.25% higher and the S&P 500 added 1.63%. Asian markets rose on Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 increasing 0.90% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng adding 0.63% since the open.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/26/crypto-markets-see-largest-short-liquidations-in-15-months-ether-leads-token-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5466997a3ddbf3007ff71193a1aa165afe851d3-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coingecko reports that the token&apos;s value has increased by 0.2% in the last 24 hours. Even on shorter time intervals, like the week or the biweek, the currency rose in value. Nonetheless, these changes have done little to slow the downward trend. Investors and traders in EOS, though, may have reason to be optimistic.

42415324,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBd50F,1666756860,"A Majority of US Voters Want More Crypto Regulation, Poll Shows","The crypto industry may be fretting over tightening regulations and upcoming legislation, but new poll results released Wednesday indicate a majority of voters surveyed believe lawmakers need to turn up the dial on crypto regulation.  A national poll conducted by the Crypto Council for Innovation in October revealed that 52% of the 1,200 voters surveyed want the industry to be more regulated, while a mere 7% said they think the industry should be less regulated. The remaining 41% of respondents were evenly split between thinking the industry was sufficiently regulated already, or not having an opinion.  When developing crypto regulations, the majority of voters (58%) want lawmakers to prioritize market stability and fraud detection.  Former Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who now serves as the Crypto Council for Innovation’s chief political strategist, told CoinDesk that the poll results indicate that voters are starting to recognize the potential of crypto.  “They know what’s there, and they want regulations to create clarity and consistency in the industry to allow the potential to be realized,” Gardner said. “We need safety and soundness and clarity to the rules, and we need that legislative framework in place. It’s nice to see that a majority of people across this country believe the same thing.”  Just how many of those people will turn up at the ballot box during the upcoming midterm elections remains a mystery. Crypto companies like Coinbase and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) have spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress, fundraising for crypto-friendly candidates, and encouraging crypto holders to vote in line with their wallets.  The Crypto Council for Innovation’s poll revealed that 13% of respondents own cryptocurrency. Only 1% of respondents said they owned a non-fungible token (NFT).  However, poll results indicate that crypto is unlikely to be a deciding factor for most voters. Only 6% of all respondents described themselves as being “much more likely” to vote for a politician who supports crypto; 39% of people either described themselves as “somewhat less likely” or “much less likely” to vote for a crypto-friendly candidate. The largest percentage, 42%, said it wouldn’t impact their vote at all.  Among voters who hold crypto, nearly 60% said they were at least somewhat more likely to vote for a crypto-friendly candidate, though more than a third said it wouldn’t factor into their decision.  “The American people are seeing opportunity,” Gardner said. “[Crypto] is in the mix to stay. They’re going to vote for somebody who is supportive of their views on cryptocurrency, and that means during the elections in two weeks, a difference can be made if candidates reach out to the people who are interested in cryptocurrency.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/26/a-majority-of-us-voters-want-more-crypto-regulation-poll-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc38a55a4b09ee592f218b669282a7362663cdfd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the last 24 hours, ADA has appreciated over 7%. This price movement could be termed a rally. ADA had made no progress in the last week. However, it has soared up considerably over the past 24 hours. Technical indicators have sided with the bulls as demand for the altcoin rose. If the current price momentum continues over the next trading sessions, ADA could expect the bulls to regain better control over the market. The demand for the altcoin showed considerable appreciation, which has led to an increase in the number of buyers on the one-day chart. Cardano price has to keep moving upwards to avoid the chance of price volatility. It is, however, implied that the chance of a price pullback always remains after a rally. At the present moment, the Cardano price is trading 87% lower than its all-time high, secured in September, 2021. A move above its immediate resistance mark will provide a clear path for the altcoin. Cardano Price Analysis: One Day Chart ADA was trading at $0.39 at the time of writing. The coin picked up bullish momentum the moment it crossed the $0.36 price mark. The overhead resistance mark stood at $0.41 and a push above that level will help Cardano price to sustain the bullish price action. Moving above the $0.41 resistance mark can push Cardano to $0.44. On the flipside, a pullback can drag Cardano price to $0.36 on the one day chart.
