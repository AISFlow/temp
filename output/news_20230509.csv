42420501,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq3zB,1683673337,Bitcoin Moves Sideways at $27.5K as Investors Await CPI Inflation Reading,"Bitcoin (BTC) moved sideways at around mid-$27,000 on Tuesday as investors awaited the latest U.S. inflation report on Wednesday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $27,560, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  “While the macro backdrop has been mostly unchanged over the past few weeks,” market watchers will be focusing on “Binance and whether people are seriously storing cryptos in cold wallets,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, suggested in a Tuesday note.  “Bitcoin appears to be stuck in a trading range, but if we have a de-risking moment on Wall Street, that will be enough to send cryptos toward the lows seen in mid-March,” Moya wrote.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was off roughly 0.4% on Tuesday to change hands at around $1,844. Among other digital assets, Bitcoin Cash’s BCH jumped over 9% for the day to trade at around $121.29, while Lido's governance token LDO recently rose by 6% to $1.85.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was up roughly a half percentage point for the day.  Equity markets turned mixed ahead of Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI for April. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slid 0.1%.  In bond markets, the note on the 2-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to sit around 4.02%, while the 10-year Treasury yield was almost flat from Monday, same time, to reach 3.52%.  Investors across the board will be watching the CPI for clues about how the U.S. Federal Reserve will act at its next policy meeting in June. The Fed approved a 25 basis points (bps) increase earlier this month to push the Federal Funds rate to its highest level in 16 years.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager 3iQ, held the Fed accountable for the recent banking crisis and called the institution “both arsonist and firefighter by design.""

12488219,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530652,1683673216,Matrixport Report: Here’s What Happens To Bitcoin If Inflation Continues To Fall,"As Bitcoin became a more mainstream asset, its correlation with the stock market rose which meant it has been impacted by world events to a higher degree than it did before. This is evident with the asset’s reaction to the rising inflation and the Fed’s continuous hiking of interest rates. However, there seems to be a reversal in this trend as inflation is starting to ease. This means the Fed could change its stance on interest rates soon. If this happens, what does it mean for Bitcoin? Looking Toward The CPI Data Release In the Matrixport Daily Insights report released on Tuesday, Head of Research Markus Thielen outlines a bullish case for Bitcoin as inflation slows down. He starts out by explaining the expectation that inflation is going to fall further which would be a good thing for risk assets such as BTC. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread The inflation Matrixport forecast for the year 2023 puts it below 2% before year’s end, which would be an over 50% reduction. Such low CPIs would no doubt see the Fed reverse interest rates, dropping them significantly. In fact, the report projects interest rate cuts of up to 100 bps. “Hedge Funds remain massively hedged equities. The CFTC data for S&P500 positions is equivalent to levels only seen during the 2008 financial crisis and the European Debt crisis in 2011,” the report said. “While this does not necessarily mean that Hedge Funds are short, it indicates that hedge funds have sold those contracts and will have to cover them at some point. This buying will squeeze prices higher.” Matrixport predicts sub-2% inflation by end of year | Source: Matrixport If inflation were to fall as low as predicted, then the price of BTC would rally toward the $40,000 level before the end of 2023. As for the current Bitcoin price and how to play the market, the report further adds that “A stop loss of $27,000(-3%) could offer great risk/reward with the macro data being released soon,” pointing to the CPI data being released on Wednesday, May 10. Bitcoin Sellers Hold Market Hostage Ahead Of CPI Release With less than one day left to the CPI data release for May, Bitcoin sellers are currently dominating the market. As a result, the digital asset fell to the mid-$27,000 level where it currently trending. This is also understandable as investors tend to move their holdings into stables leading up to important events like this as it can trigger high volatility in the market. Related Reading: PEPE, WOJAK, TURBO Take A Nosedive As Meme Coin Euphoria Dies Down This decline in price has driven BTC below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA) and puts it dangerously close to its 50-day moving average. If the digital asset were to fall below the latter, it could be disastrous as it would solidify the bears’ hold on the market, further driving down the price. BTC price returns to mid-$27,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Further downside from here could see BTC return to $26,000 where the next significant support level lies. Thus, it is important that the CPI data comes out with a lower inflation rate and the Fed moves from hawkish to dovish. Otherwise, risk assets such as BTC and the total cryptocurrency market could see a rapid decline.

42393587,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj0MSV,1683671610,Previewing Congress's Joint Crypto Regulation Hearing,"Over the past several weeks, Congress – particularly the House Financial Services Committee – has held a number of hearings on crypto and its role in the world. Even a hearing supposedly focused on overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission instead mostly saw questions on crypto and climate issues. Tomorrow, we’ll see another hearing, held with the House Agriculture Committee, specifically discussing crypto regulation.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Congressional action  The narrative  “Regulatory clarity,” the way the crypto industry defines it, can come in one of two ways: Either a federal regulator provides formal guidance and rulemaking addressing one or another concern, or Congress passes a law defining those concerns. Regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have issued some proposed rules (sparking backlash from the industry in some cases), but generally hopes were focused on Congress potentially taking action. We’re going to see another hearing kick off this week that hopes to address the crypto market.  Why it matters  Congress continues to grapple with the idea of crypto regulation. What fresh guidance would look like in practice is still up in the air, but lawmakers are taking another swing at the question on Wednesday.  Breaking it down  We don't know for sure if any actual legislation will move forward this year. The industry’s expectation was that a stablecoin bill would have the greatest chance of success in terms of becoming law. Those expectations were pretty well dashed during a hearing on stablecoins earlier this month when Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that the bill reflected thinking from last October – and that, in her view, the committee needed to “start from scratch.”  Admittedly, it never looked like the Senate Banking Committee was publicly anywhere close to getting involved in the bill, but the fact the House had a bipartisan product suggested there was a chance. That’s dead now.  Despite this, lawmakers appear optimistic about the chances of a bill being signed into law over the next year.  At Consensus 2023 the other week, I asked Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, if he believed there was a path for legislation to become a law this year.  He said “Yes,” and added that a new bill addressing market structure issues would be introduced within two months.  Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), the other lawmaker on stage with me, seemed equally optimistic.  From the House perspective, the next step toward legislation is still Wednesday’s hearing, kicking off at 9:30 a.m. ET and featuring former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair and current Harvard Research Fellow Timothy Massad, Republic Crypto Head Andrew Durgee, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr Partner Matthew Kulkin, Kraken Chief Legal Officer Marco Santori and Web3 Foundation Chief Legal Officer Daniel Schoenberger.  In his written testimony, Massad said one issue is the lack of a federal spot market regulator for non-securities cryptocurrencies, and the debate around how to even classify whether a given crypto is a security or not.  “Chair Gary Gensler of the SEC says most tokens are securities and the problem is a lack of compliance with existing legal requirements. Industry participants complain about a lack of clarity in the rules for resolving this issue and have called for regulators to create a new set of rules specifically for crypto,” he said. “Meanwhile trading and lending platforms claim they are only dealing in tokens that are not securities – thereby avoiding direct federal oversight. As a result, investor protection on crypto trading and lending platforms is woefully inadequate.”  Massad proposed Congress pass a law creating certain principles and standards by which every exchange would have to abide by, regardless of whether the token being listed is a security or a commodity.  Doing so, he argued, would negate the need to expand the definition of securities laws or create a new category system for digital assets while still encompassing the entire crypto market.  The hearing also features a joint proposed resolution saying Congress must provide further guidance for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission on how to bring existing regulatory protections to the crypto sector.

12487595,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530817,1683671431,"Cardano DeFi Steals The Show, Outperforms The Market With Explosive Transaction Growth","Despite the recent market dip, Cardano’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has seen a significant surge in activity, with transactions on Cardano DeFi apps soaring to 250,000 per epoch from 160,000 transactions during the previous epoch. This remarkable 56% increase in transaction volume has been attributed to the launch of new DeFi protocols on the network and the active community of developers and users driving innovation for the protocol. Related Reading: Only 6% Left Until Cardano Hits Max Capacity, What This Means For ADA Cardano DeFi Challenges Market Slump According to Cardano Ambassador Yevhen, the latest hype around meme coins like Snek and Pepeblue has also contributed to the transaction surge. Snek is a crypto asset based on memes of snakes with interior monologue captioning, while Pepeblue is a recently introduced crypto asset on the Cardano network and in its metaverse. Yevhen believes this increased interest in meme coins has brought new users to the network and boosted transaction volume. Aside from the hype around meme coins, several crypto exchanges and liquidity protocols on the Cardano blockchain have reported significant increases in activity in recent weeks. Per Yevhen’s analysis, these include Sundaeswap ($SUNDAE), Minswap ($MIN), MuesliSwap ($MILK), Wingriders ($WRT), and Liqwid Finance ($LQ). These protocols have been lauded for their user-friendly interfaces, low transaction fees, and high liquidity. Sundaeswap, for example, is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade Cardano-based tokens with low slippage and high liquidity. The platform has seen a surge in activity thanks to its user-friendly interface and low transaction fees. Minswap, on the other hand, is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade Cardano-based tokens with zero fees. Furthermore, Liqwid Finance, a decentralized lending protocol on the Cardano network, has already surpassed $50 million in total value locked in just a few months since its launch. This platform allows users to lend and borrow Cardano-based tokens with low fees and high liquidity. The recent surge in Cardano DeFi activity has been attributed to various factors, including the launch of new DeFi protocols, the active community of developers and users on the network, and the hype around meme coins. ADA Follows The Market Trend The recent dip in ADA’s price can be attributed to the broader market downturn affecting the cryptocurrency industry. Over the past few days, several major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced significant price declines, dragging down the entire market. The price of Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, has experienced a significant dip in the past 24 hours, reaching the $0.3586 level. This marks a 40-day low for the cryptocurrency, with the last time it was at this level being April 28th. However, ADA has managed to stall a further decline and has reported a slight gain of 0.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.3630 The decline in Cardano’s native token, ADA, is further compounded by the fact that it has lost its 50 and 200-day moving averages (MA) since the onset of its decline on April 28th. In the event of further drops, ADA must maintain two critical support levels to prevent a potential decline to the $0.2 territories, which it has not visited since January 2023. These levels are the $0.3441 level and the $0.3034 floor. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Falls Under $80, Is It Time To Buy Now?

According to LookOnChain’s recent report, a large investor or whale who purchased a large amount of the token amid its rally has now suffered a huge loss. This loss follows the memecoin ongoing downtrend after the recent rally, which seemed to be never-ending. PEPE experienced a significant spike during its rally, up by more than 3,000% from its all-time low. This spike resulted from the growing interest and hype for the frog-themed token. Taking A Huge Hit On May 7, popular on-chain analyst LookOnChain reported that a notable investor of PEPE, who bought approximately 962.3 billion of $PEPE worth $2.46M at the time, had lost $541,000. According to LookOnChain, the whale bought the token “with 70 $WBTC ($2.07M) and 470 $ETH ($937,000) at an average buying price of $0.000003122.” This purchase was during PEPE’s hype when the token traded in the green. At the time of writing, the token currently trades at $0.00000188, bringing the whale’s total loss to roughly $607,000. Related Reading: PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45% Notably, while some whales recorded losses in their PEPE investment, other investors made huge profits from their purchases. As recently reported by NewsBTC, a PEPE wallet holding 2.5 trillion tokens reportedly turned $27 into over $4 million. It’s crucial to recognize that some investors made a profit while others experienced losses with PEPE. Latecomers suffered losses, while early adopters who bought the token before its widespread popularity profited. Aftermath Of The PEPE Rally It is no more news PEPE recorded huge gains in the past week due to significant hype from the crypto community. Despite the token not having any potential utility, the frog-themed memecoin enjoyed a remarkable spike pushing it to appear among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the crypto market. Related Reading: Discovering The Next PEPE And SHIB: Whales To Keep Track Of Aside from the hype, several other factors, including listing on major crypto exchanges such as Binance, contributed to the token’s massive surge. However, following the spike and the dying down of the hype of the token, PEPE has begun to see a major retracement.

42393573,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj0LdD,1683668041,"SEC Blasted on Custody Proposal by JPMorgan, Crypto Firms and a Fellow Agency","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went too far when it proposed a new rule demanding investment firms safeguard all of their clients’ assets – including crypto – with approved custodians, according to an array of critics not often in alignment.  The securities regulator said the expanded requirement for how registered investment advisers keep customer assets should extend to pretty much everything the firms are in charge of. While the February proposal explicitly folded in cryptocurrency, it also included other assets in a move that drew loud objections from organizations that aren’t always on the same side as the crypto industry – financial giant JPMorgan and the Small Business Administration (SBA) among them.  As the two-month public comment period expired this week the SBA argued the SEC “drastically underestimates potential impacts” from its proposal, according to a letter from senior SBA lawyers who said the cost of the “sweeping changes” could threaten smaller investment advisers and force them to merge with others or get out of the business.  The proposed rule, which can’t be finalized until after the SEC has reviewed all of these outside comments, said any assets entrusted to investment advisers need to be held with “qualified custodians,” which generally means a chartered bank or trust company, a broker-dealer registered with the SEC or a futures commission merchant registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who said the rule “would help ensure that advisers don’t inappropriately use, lose, or abuse investors’ assets,” was quick to point out the crypto platforms that now maintain custody of investors’ assets don’t fit in.  “Based upon how crypto platforms generally operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them as qualified custodians,” Gensler said, suggesting the rule would effectively sever the investment firms from the crypto industry.  From Wall Street, executives at JPMorgan accused the SEC of taking an “overly broad approach” that “would disrupt a significant portion of the operations in the financial markets which have been well-functioning for many years,” according to their comment letter.  The U.S. securities industry’s chief lobbying group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, called it “jurisdictional overreach, resulting in indirect and inappropriate regulation” and argued a number of asset classes – such as repurchase agreements, securities loans, derivatives and annuities – may be fundamentally unable to meet some of the requirements the SEC has in mind.  And from the crypto sector, investment firm a16z said, “We believe this proposed prohibition to be illegal, infeasible, and dangerous.” The letter signed by several executives suggested investment advisers would find the rule almost impossible to comply with, because it “largely failed to consider the logistics of how custody works for many crypto assets, the economics underpinning crypto asset markets, and even the basic statistics and other data that should inform a considered regulatory approach.”  After the SEC first proposed the rule, statements from crypto platforms such as Anchorage Digital Bank and state-chartered trusts including Coinbase’s Custody Trust Co. and BitGo insisted they’d definitely qualify as proper custodians. The state-chartered trust companies in the crypto sector are still eager to find out whether they can get on the list as qualified custodians.  Marc D’Annunzio, the general counsel of Bakkt Holdings Inc., which has a trust subsidiary licensed in New York, said that if the state-chartered firms were excluded, “we fear that consumers and investors will be less protected and will have limited choices for custody services to protect their assets.”  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) also weighed in, pointing out that in the absence of similar federal oversight, its system for regulating trust companies that specialize in crypto is the best way to ensure they’ll be safe custodians.  “Preserving this structure would be in the best interest of consumers, allowing them to maintain existing relationships and current holdings with best-in-class custody providers, who in turn are subject to the industry-leading prudential regulation and supervision of DFS,” wrote the regulator’s general counsel, Peter Dean. Cutting those off “would run the risk of pushing novel activities into unregulated spaces, including offshore.”  The recent drama of some crypto-affiliated banks shutting down and one of the industry’s major platforms – FTX – crashing into the ground may also leave traditional gatekeepers such as banks shy about crypto custody.  “We have serious concerns about the willingness of qualified custodians to custody digital assets – and those that are willing may charge prohibitive fees,” according to a comment submitted by Linklaters LLP. The narrowing choices for custody “will cause customers seeking exposure to digital assets to bear greater risks than they currently do.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/09/sec-blasted-on-custody-proposal-by-jpmorgan-crypto-firms-and-a-fellow-agency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeda127b9b31cd6a7afd3b627d866fc9514f45de-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin appears to be settling into a range, flirting with support levels around the $27,500 mark. The visible range volume profile (VRVP) tool shows high levels of trading activity between 28,000 and 27,400. Those “high volume nodes,” generally represent areas where price moves can stall, as they represent historic areas of agreement between buyers and sellers.  Lower volume nodes between 26,700 and 25,000 represent areas where prices could decline quickly, given the decreased levels of historic agreement.  A decline into this latter range would mean a few things for bitcoin:  The current level of support will have been broken through to the downside.  The lower range of bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands will have been breached, a traditionally bearish sign  The next higher volume node to the downside sits at $23,950, roughly 14% below current prices.  Whether the spread between the upper and lower band increases will be key to watch, as it would indicate increased volatility, and in this case, downside risk. On Wednesday, bitcoin’s Bollinger Band spread increased by 5%, following seven days of declines.  The spread between ether’s Bollinger Bands has been declining over the most recent seven days, declining by 3% most recently. The narrowing volatility coincides with high volume nodes at $1,811, implying that near-term support exists for ETH prices.  Meanwhile, lower profile altcoins Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash were among the few digital assets in positive territory as they recently grained more than 3% and 10%, respectively over the previous 24 hours. The assets’ trading volume also more than doubled their respective 20-day averages.  Trading volume of smart contracts platform Cosmos’ ATOM token and decentralized network Filecoin’s FIL token also spiked.

The growing domestic outrage alleged that Kim liquidated over $4 million worth of crypto assets before the lawmakers would enforce the Financial Action Task Force Travel Rule. Lawmaker Moves Crypto Funds Before Implementation Of Law A report from the news outlet, The Korea Times disclosed the joint investigation by the Korean authorities and the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) on Kim. The investigation is based on the allegation that Kim withdrew 800,000 WEMIX tokens between February and March 2022. Between January and February 2022, Kim of the Democratic Party of Korea reportedly held 6 billion Won in his digital wallet. However, the lawmaker was accused of transferring all his crypto holdings before the authorities could implement the Travel Rule on March 25, 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy As Parabolic SAR Flips Bearish On Daily Chart It is important to note that regulations mandate all crypto service providers to disclose the personal information of investors involved in trades exceeding a value of 1 million Won in digital assets. The FIU of the Financial Services Commission received the report concerning Kim’s withdrawals. The South Korean regulator classified them as suspicious transactions and reported them to the prosecutor’s office accordingly. On his part, Kim Nam-Kuk denied cashing out his digital holdings, stating that he only moved the funds to another crypto exchange. Also, he maintained that he was not obligated to report such transactions by law. The cybercitizens have condemned the act of the lawmaker who had positioned himself as a “poor” politician in the past. The Mayor of Daegu, Hong Joon-Pyo, commented that Kim should resign from his political position. The person expressed disappointment in the legislator’s actions, describing it as a serious moral problem. The Mayor recalled that Kim was among those that delayed crypto taxation through legislative voting. This suggests that the lawmaker used his legislative position to cover personal gains in digital assets. Government To Fix Loopholes In Disclosure For South Korean Public Officials The Korean authorities are still investigating Kim’s alleged crypto holdings. According to The Korea Herald, the outcome of the investigation will play a vital role in deciding if public officials must disclose their crypto assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Drop Further?

Based on Swiss regulations that mandate the use of Aragon’s treasury for its stated social purpose, fiduciary duty compels Aragon Association to secure these funds from those seeking to access them for their own financial gains.

The Middle Eastern partnership comes as in the U.S., the White House is campaigning for a proposed tax advocating crypto miners in the country pay an amount equal to 30% of their energy costs.  The new project will first develop two mining sites with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts (MW) of mining power, according to a press release. The sites will be powered by excess energy in Abu Dhabi, increasing the base load and sustainability of that Middle Eastern capital's power grid, the statement continued. The necessary mining equipment and infrastructure for each site has already been ordered and construction is currently underway.  Zero Two will own 80% of the JV and Marathon 20%, with the initial capital contribution of about $406 million to be split between the two along those proportions.  Digital assets miners primarily use air cooling technology to cool their mining computers. However, in high heat and humidity environments, cooling mining machines with liquid immersion instead of air cooling offer significant advantages for miners with razor-thin profit margins.  The press release noted that the desert climate of Abu Dhabi makes air-cooled digital asset mining infeasible, and an immersion cooling pilot program launched by Marathon and Zero Two showed a sizable reduction in necessary maintenance for ASIC miners to effectively produce hash rate.  ""Our collaboration with Zero Two is a pivotal moment for Marathon,"" said CEO Fred Thiel.

12484541,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530775,1683662429,Bitcoin Bull Run: Higher Time Frames Still Bullish Despite Correction,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has been trading sideways since experiencing a drop of over 5% on Monday. Despite this decline, Bitcoin has found support at $27,200, preventing further drops that could potentially jeopardize the next bull run of the leading cryptocurrency. However, many investors wonder whether Bitcoin will show any signs of recovery shortly. Will the cryptocurrency market see a resurgence of bullish sentiment, or will the current bearish trend continue? Related Reading: AVAX Enters The Green Zone After Losing Gains As Bulls Gain Momentum Bitcoin’s 70-Day Correction, Is May 19th The End Date? Jesse Olson, an experienced cryptocurrency analyst, has recently shared his insights on Bitcoin’s performance since the bottom. According to Olson, Bitcoin has experienced two major breakouts since its lower lows, with the first resulting in a 54% gain and a subsequent correction of 22% that took 70 days from a pivot low to a pivot low. The second breakout has resulted in a 58% gain, followed by a current correction of 13%. However, Olson points out that Bitcoin’s price could reach the third target if the second breakout experiences a -22% correction. He also notes that if it takes 70 days from pivot low to pivot low, this correction will last until May 19th. It’s important to note that these scenarios won’t be the same, but higher time frames are still bullish. Furthermore, if Bitcoin fails to hold its current trading level at $27,400, it risks losing its 50-day moving average. Despite this, the cryptocurrency’s biggest support floor is still thousands of dollars below its current mark, at $24,600, noted by the yellow line below (200dMA). According to Jesse Olson’s analysis, this level would represent one of the three targets if the decline continues. Related Reading: Is the Next Bitcoin Bull Run Tied To The US Presidential Elections? Here’s What History Tells Us Signs Point To Prolonged Volatility Suppression In Bitcoin Market The cryptocurrency market has been characterized by prolonged volatility suppression in recent days. According to the analysis firm King Fisher, this is causing a sense of “pent-up energy” that is expected to be unleashed. Signs show that the market is setting up to hunt x20 leverages, which has caught the attention of the analysis firm. King Fisher’s analysis suggests that the current calm in the Bitcoin market may be the calm before the storm, with a potential surge in volatility looming. Furthermore, per King Fisher’s analysis, the cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a short ratio hovering around 60-70%, indicating a potential short squeeze. In addition, motivated sellers who are in a rush to convert their assets into cash are appearing on the scene, potentially missing out on potential upside gains. One key player in the recent marginal seller in the Bitcoin market could be linked to Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) potential sell-off of some assets to restructure its financial plan to pay to its subsidiary Genesis. Meanwhile, the open interest (OI) in the Bitcoin market remains fairly stable, with many investors waiting for a settlement or locking in synthetic USD. This suggests that many investors are cautious, waiting for more certainty before making any major moves. Despite the uncertainty, many experts remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With increased adoption and institutional investment, the cryptocurrency market will likely continue to play a major role in the global financial landscape for years.

On May 8, Litecoin executed more than 525,000 transactions in a day, coming close to Bitcoin’s 575,000 daily transactions, according to blockchain data from BitInfoCharts. It is five times the average number of transactions on the Litecoin blockchain compared to earlier this year and more than double the previous all-time high near the peak of the bull market in January 2018.  The development comes as the Bitcoin blockchain, the home of bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is experiencing an extreme level of congestion due to a frenzy of new Bitcoin-based BRC-20 tokens. BRC-20 is a token standard that lets users create and transfer tokens on the Ordinals Protocol using the Bitcoin network.  The rising popularity of BRC-20 tokens has pushed Bitcoin transaction fees to the highest level since May 2021, after BTC hit a then-record peak of around $64,000. It also led Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, to temporarily halt withdrawals via Bitcoin early Monday.  Bitcoin’s congestion has sent users scrambling for cheaper alternatives such as stablecoins and the Lightning network to transfer value via blockchain.  Litecoin has garnered a fresh wave of activity, too. Glassnode data shows that on top of a record amount of transactions, the number of active wallet addresses rose to a record high of 718,000 on Monday. Crypto users also created almost 500,000 new Litecoin addresses in a day recently, the Litecoin Foundation tweeted citing Glassnode.

But some validators who withdrew to wallets hosted by the big U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase were treated to an unwelcome surprise: The proper tech support wasn’t in place to receive these deposits, so the funds were stuck.  “Our systems currently do not support deposits to Coinbase ETH addresses from external validators,” a customer support representative told CoinDesk. “Funds may be stuck until we are able to support these transactions.”  A number of users have posted to Reddit their concerns – some 42 comments as of press time – about asset balances not reflecting ether staking withdrawals on Coinbase wallets. CoinDesk’s own Ethereum validator, Zelda, appears to be among those affected, even though blockchain records show that the staked ether became withdrawable on April 25.  McKenna Otterstedt, a product communications senior associate for Coinbase, confirmed that there is a “technical issue” and that the company’s teams “are working on a solution.”  She declined to detail how many users were affected or how much ETH was stuck in limbo.  Coinbase offers its own staking services, including through public validators owned and operated by Coinbase Cloud. According to the blockchain-analysis firm Nansen, Coinbase “currently accounts for the greatest amount of ETH in the withdrawal queue (40% of the total).”  “We do not recommend configuring rewards and unstaking withdrawals from externally staked ETH to your Coinbase ETH wallet until this is fixed,” wrote Coinbase's customer support to CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Sage D.

But a sliver of people who entered crypto during the heady days of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, beginning sometime in mid-2017 and ending a few months later in early 2018, may remember the exchange with the type of arm’s length appreciation stemming from familiarity and necessity.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Crypto class of 2017, of which I consider myself a part, was pampered in many ways. Unlike the bitcoin early adopters who, before the advent of cryptocurrency exchanges, literally had to meet up in person if they wanted to exchange coins, or the saps who only had “enterprise blockchain” to get excited about, much of the infrastructure the industry now takes for granted was already laid out before the first major token mania. I bought my first fraction of a bitcoin using a credit card via Coinbase, easily. And when I wanted to sling around sh*tcoins, I logged into Bittrex (that is, before the exchange was geo-blocked in the State of New York).  See also: CoinDesk Turns 10: How The DAO Hack Changed Ethereum and Crypto  While I’m glad on-chain options like Uniswap exist today, which allow users to trade and list various tokens without intervention or sacrificing custody of their coins, exchanges like Bittrex played an important role in crypto’s history. Binance, one of the bunch, grew to become one of the most valuable crypto companies ever.  While the idea behind centralized exchanges has always been fraught – they’re intermediaries in what’s supposed to be un-mediated finance – they serve an important role as gateways between the world of fiat and crypto. More to the point, at least in the U.S., Bittrex was one of a handful of exchanges ICO traders could trust. It filled the necessary role of listing tokens faster than more lawsuit-averse (at the time) platforms like Coinbase and offshore companies like Binance.  However, between market realities and the regulatory environment, Bittrex today occupies an impossible position. At a time when decentralized finance (DeFi) is only getting easier to use, centralized exchanges that have limited liquidity and token offerings yet more stringent KYC protocols are becoming increasingly irrelevant. Don’t call me bitter either, because I forgot to cash out my 20,000 FUN tokens when the exchange was forced to leave New York state (the funds are “irrecoverable”)! In an interview with CoinDesk, a Bittrex exec cited the “untenable regulatory and economic environment"" in the U.S. for its decision first to withdraw from the country and now to seek Chapter 11 protections.  Bittrex stands as a symbol for the now forgone “sh*tcoin era,” a period of time few remember fondly. Although there are many “traders” who probably lost big on “investments” like FUN (which was supposed to power a blockchain casino), who left crypto entirely or became hard nosed bitcoiners, there are legion who might appreciate the crash course in finance and economics that day trading had to offer. I learned my lesson. And by-and-large, despite the fact that crypto seems locked into endless cycles of irrational market exuberance, the industry itself has matured since then. Seeing exchanges close up shop suddenly, or be forced to geo-block users, likely left a lasting impression of the importance of self-custody.  See also: Initial Coin Offerings Deserve a Rethink | Opinion  The exchange business itself is going through a reckoning. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chairman Gary Gensler, has decided basically all cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin are securities and that crypto exchanges will need to be licensed as securities dealers. Even supposedly regulatory-friendly exchanges like Coinbase have been resistant to these assertions. In an open letter to the SEC, industry lobbyists at the Blockchain Association said a recent proposal to amend the SEC’s custody rule to bar all but “qualified custodians” from handling users’ coins would put a chokehold on the industry. A16z, the major VC firm, said the SEC is “waging war” on crypto, responding to the same SEC proposal.  No doubt Bittrex is a casualty to regulatory uncertainty, to some extent. But at times it seems like the crypto industry is putting a lot of effort into defending bucket shops, rather than coming to terms. The SEC gets a lot of flack for “regulating by enforcement,” and in fact regulates this industry harder than most, but that’s because – and you won’t like the sound of this – the agency’s primary responsibility is setting a bar for disclosures so investors can operate on a relatively-level playing field. There are technical reasons why on-chain KYC is dangerous (the blockchain destroys privacy), and why many tokens may have utility behind being just investment contracts. But by and large there’s no regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. – just private businesses that prefer dealing under a veil of corporate secrecy.  See also: Crypto Gets the Regulation It Deserves | Opinion  It’s unclear what will come from Bittrex’s lawsuit with the SEC, which accused the firm of listing six cryptocurrencies that are securities – DASH, ALGO, OMG, TKN, NGC and IHT – in an argument that worried some crypto lawyers as setting a dangerous precedent. Considering what ended up on Bittrex, things maybe could’ve been worse. The exchange said its global operations, headquartered in Liechtenstein, will remain in business and that its 100,000 U.S. creditors will be made whole after the bankruptcy – including its largest benefactor, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).

The attorney demands that the commission stop protecting Americans by lashing on crypto companies.

On behalf of the American public we ask you to please stop protecting us. — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) May 8, 2023 The SEC has enacted enforcement actions against several crypto entities through its forceful regulatory measures. Some include the Ripple (XRP) blockchain, Paxos (Issuer of BUSD stablecoin), Bittrex, Coinbase, and others. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs and some of its executives over the sale of XRP tokens under the Howey Test, stating that the asset passed the definition of an investment contract. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge Under $28,000 Only Temporary? This Metric Suggests So Attorney Deaton maintained that XRP is not a security but a digital currency, and the lawsuit has been taking several turns and is still ongoing. The activity of the US SEC on crypto firms in the US has evoked a lot of reactions, especially from top firms such as Coinbase. However, the commission has maintained that its actions are measures to protect Americans. Moreover, in a video, last month, the SEC chair maintained that intermediaries for investment contracts should comply with securities laws and register fully with the SEC. He also said that the law only cares about “what something is and not what you call it” As such, digital asset investment firms that list securities must comply with the investor protection obligations like other firms. SEC Pushing Legal Boundaries With Ripple Lawsuit Crypto lawyer John Deaton mentioned earlier that the SEC is pushing legal boundaries by claiming that Ripple violated securities laws. According to a Bloomberg Law publication, Deaton stated that the SEC’s allegation against XRP is beyond legal contemplation and court rulings on securities. The lawyer mentioned that the US Supreme Court in 1946 defined security in its ruling on SEC v. Howey case. So, the ruling could not account for the complex digital assets with encrypted computer code after almost a century.

Lawyers for the 31-year-old former billionaire argued that some of the charges brought against SBF -- as he is known -- breached the terms of his extradition from the Bahamas, where FTX ( FTT-USD ) was based, the Associated Press noted, adding that other charges failed to meet the legal conditions of criminal statutes. The former FTX ( FTT-USD ) CEO was indicted with eight counts in December, including fraud and money laundering, and in February 12 more counts were added , including unlawful political contributions and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. New charges were added to the indictment in March, alleging that he bribed Chinese government officials. SBF pleaded not guilty to the original indictment as well as the latest batch of charges. “In the wake of the ‘crypto winter,’ the Government, in hindsight, may dislike or disapprove of business practices of the cryptocurrency industry, FTX, or even Mr. Bankman-Fried — but this does not give it license to turn them into federal crimes,” his lawyers said Monday.

Bitcoin’s price drop follows network congestion that sent transaction fees over the weekend skyward as demand for bitcoin Ordinals ramped up.  BCH, which is a spinoff of the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to be more scalable and cheaper, seems to have benefited from bitcoin’s backlog of transactions, some market observers are saying.  BCH, which was recently trading over $122, was one of the only digital assets trading in the green on Tuesday.  “Bitcoin cash is a fork of Bitcoin so the market is speculating that there will be some spillover as a result of high fees/congestion,” Arca trader Kyle Doane said in a note to CoinDesk. Doane noted that the uptick for bitcoin cash will most likely be short-lived.  The Bitcoin blockchain's flood of pending transactions over the weekend resulted in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, temporarily pausing bitcoin withdrawals.  Yet Laurent Kssis, crypto advisor at CEC Capital, said that he doubts that the two are related. “I’m not confident BCH’s rise is a result of bitcoin’s network congestion as the move is not that detrimental to btc,”  Kssis added: “Sure BTC is dropping but this has been in the cards for a few days.

At the same time, its native token ADA’s price has struggled for months and has yet to record any significant gains and upside movements in the cryptocurrency markets. Yesterday, a report analysis made by the cofounder of dcSpark and contributor to the Cardano blockchain clearly reflected where the blockchain platform is in terms of transaction load and what it means for users. Cardano Is Currently At 94% Load, Only 6% Left-What To Expect Sebastien Guillemot, the co-founder of dcSpark and Cardano contributor, recently highlighted a concern about the ADA blockchain network ecosystem. Related Reading: Bitcoin Block 788695: The Day Transaction Fees Took The Crown In a tweet yesterday, Guillemot stated that the Cardano blockchain network is currently at a 94% load, with only 6% left until it reaches max capacity. Cardano is currently at 94% load! Only 6% left until Cardano is at max capacity What does that mean, and how can you be prepared 🧵 pic.twitter.com/1TZsIUg10N — Sebastien Guillemot (@SebastienGllmt) May 8, 2023 According to Guillemot, if the load reaches max capacity at 100%, transactions initiated by each user on the blockchain will be queued up alongside other users’ transactions. No “Cardano node implements transaction prioritization,” he said, and as such, each user’s transactions will be processed on a first-come, first-served model. Guillemot further stated that this could mean longer wait times for transactions to show up on-chain, and in extreme cases, user transactions may never make it to the blockchain. The result of this, he said, is caused by light wallet Mempools hitting maximum capacity than it can hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Gas Fees Skyrocket: What Does It Mean For Investors? Another thing users can expect when Cardano hits 100% max capacity is the likelihood of staking pools selling priority access to decentralized applications (dApps) and even to some users. Guillemot urged that when staking pools start selling priority access to select DEXs and dApps, it would be a good time for users to pay attention to how this move impacts one DEX to another and in choosing which DEX is suitable to leverage at any given time. Way Forward To Scalability While Cardano nears max capacity, the dcSpark co-founder has suggested how to scale and reduce load pressure on the blockchain, having touched on what users can expect if it happens. Guillemot had listed several ways to scale the blockchain, including increasing block sizes and migrating more decentralized applications (dApps) to Plutus V2. He also suggested using sidechains and layer 2 blockchains to shoulder traffic off layer 1 and developing a data availability layer to transfer more data off layer 1 so that there is ample room for more blocks.

12481808,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530663,1683653424,"Litecoin (LTC) Falls Under $80, Is It Time To Buy Now?","Litecoin has continued to decline and has now slipped under the $80 level, but if a metric is anything to go by, the coin may be near the bottom. Litecoin Is Now In The MVRV Opportunity Zone According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, some altcoins, including Litecoin, are showing underbought signals after the recent price decline. The “MVRV” (Market Value to Realized Value) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of a given asset and its realized cap. The realized cap here refers to a sort of “true” value model that says the actual value of any token in the circulating supply is the price at which it was last moved on the blockchain, and not whatever the current price of the asset is. The MVRV compares the market cap (that is, the current price) with this realized cap to estimate whether the cryptocurrency is undervalued or overvalued at the moment. When the value of this indicator rises above 1, it means the given coin may be becoming overpriced. On the other hand, a decline below this line implies underbought conditions for the asset. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Price Falls After Bulls Fail To Maintain Momentum Santiment has defined its own “opportunity” and “danger” zones for the MVRV on the respective sides of the 1 mark, after entering which the asset attains a higher probability of bottoming/topping out. Now, here is a chart that shows the divergence of the MVRV indicator from these zones for various cryptocurrencies in the sector: Looks like a lot of these coins are in the green region currently | Source: Santiment on Twitter The way that Santiment has defined the divergence (that is, the distance from the zones) has made it so that a buying signal occurs when an asset’s MVRV divergence crosses 1, while a selling signal takes place below -1 (this orientation is the opposite of what’s usually the case in the MVRV ratio; this flip is done with the intention to make the metric more intuitive). From the chart, it’s visible that most of the assets in the market are in the positive region currently, suggesting that they are close to being underbought. A few of these, like Litecoin, have outright entered into the opportunity zone, meaning that this may be a good time to buy the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price In A Turbulent Week: This Crypto Market Strategist Weighs In Litecoin has entered into this zone as its value has slipped below the $80 mark for the first time since March and has put the average investor into a state of loss. Historically, the more investors have been in a state of loss, the closer the price of the cryptocurrency has come to a bottom. This is the reason why the aforementioned opportunity zone has provided ideal points for buying into the asset. In the case of Litecoin, a bullish narrative in the form of its halving, an event where its mining block rewards will be cut in half, is also right around the corner now, so there is an increased probability that the price could bottom out and rebound soon. It’s uncertain, however, whether the bottom is already here or if there is still some drawdown to go. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading around $79, down 1% in the last week.

OKX has almost no exposure to OKB through its Nansen proof of reserves wallet addresses and a large BTC backing. The token has benefited from the global popularity of OKX and a buyback program that has taken roughly 20% of the supply out of circulation. Since the collapses of companies like Celsius ( CEL-USD ), BlockFi, and FTX ( FTT-USD ) last year, there has been a greater skepticism of centralized crypto custodians and exchanges. Much of that skepticism has probably been justifiably focused on Binance ( BNB-USD ). From where I sit, any exchange that has a native token is one that should be given a little bit of extra scrutiny due to the possibility that these companies can occasionally be over-exposed to their own token supply. In this article, we'll look at a crypto exchange called OKX ( OKB-USD ). We'll explore the makeup of the exchange reserves and assess the tokenomics of the OKB utility coin. What is OKX? OKX is a cryptocurrency company that has been through some changes in recent years. The company was previously based in Beijing, China but has since re-located to Seychelles. In addition to changing headquarters location, the company rebranded to ""OKX"" from ""OKEx"" in 2022. The company operates a centralized exchange and derivatives platform that is usually among the top 10 in 24 hour volume and has 9 million monthly visits according to data from CoinGecko. Beyond spot and derivatives crypto offerings, OKX also operates a crowdfunding product called ""Jumpstart"" that has raised over $283 billion in startup funds through things like IEOs or Initial Exchange Offerings. Notable IEOs that have gone through this process on OKX include Toncoin ( TON-USD ) and the recently launched SUI blockchain (SUI-USD). Like many other centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges, OKX has a native utility coin that essentially serves as a blockchain-based rewards program for users of the exchange. OKB Utility (OKX.com) With OKB, token holders can generate passive income yields as well as discounts on trading fees within the OKX ecosystem. The more OKB that OKX users hold within their accounts, the better the discounts on those fees become. Token Supply & Performance From a supply standpoint, there are 300 million OKB coins with 60 million reportedly in circulation. Roughly 59 million of the original coins have been bought back by OKX through a ""buy back and burn"" program that started in 2019: OKB Burned by Round (OKX) The first round of token burning was in May 2019 and the most recent 19th round finished in February of this year. The buy back and burn wallet address holds roughly 19.5% of the total OKB and it is by far the largest single wallet address holder: OKB Distribution (Etherscan) The next two largest OKB holders are two separate OKX wallets that combined hold only 2.7% of the OKB outstanding. The remaining tokens are very well distributed among over 50k additional ETH wallet addresses. The top 100 token holders control just 22.9% of the OKB outstanding - and again, one of those addresses is the burn address. Coin Price: $44.05 Coin Supply: 300 million Fully Diluted Cap: $13.3 billion Fully Diluted Cap Rank: #8 From a fully diluted market cap standpoint, OKB has quietly become a top 10 crypto coin and has vastly outperformed all other exchange tokens over the last 12 months: 1yr Performance (Seeking Alpha) While other exchange coins have fallen apart, often in response to the exchanges collapsing, OKB is up over 177% over the last year and is only 24% off the coin's all time high price of $58.46. OKX Proof of Reserves By itself, creating an exchange token like OKB isn't what necessarily gets exchanges into trouble. When FTX collapsed last year, a major issue was the fact that a related party was holding so much of FTX's exchange token as collateral. According to proof of reserves data through Nansen, this is not the case with OKX: OKX Proof of Reserves (Nansen) Nansen cites $9.9 billion in proof of reserves assets on known OKX wallets. Of that $9.9 billion, 44.6% is held in Tether ( USDT-USD ), 31% is held in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and over 20% is held in Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). The remaining token allocation is spread out among USD Coin ( USDC-USD ), Arbitrum's governance token ( ARB-USD ), and a handful of other smaller coins. The safety of something like Tether could certainly be debated and has been for years. But beyond that the OKX proof of reserves is very clean. Rank Site BTC Balance 24Hr Change 30D Change 1 Coinbase 486,644.31 -307.82 +3,871.32 2 Binance 395,945.02 -183,580.92 -149,323.24 3 Bitfinex 355,467.69 -1,766.56 +1,925.51 4 OKX 118,903.02 -327.21 -3,432.44 5 Gemini 92,523.71 +215.02 -12,365.24 Source: CoinGlass, as of 5/8/23 OKX has the 4th largest BTC position of any centralized exchange according to CoinGlass and more than half of the company's reserves are held in high quality blue chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Risks As an exchange coin, there are several risks to going long something like OKB. First, holders are incentivized to keep the token in order to receive better rates on products and services. This has a phenomenal positive feedback loop when an exchange is growing its user base and gaining market share. if OKX users churn or if the incentives no longer justify holding the OKB token, the price of the coin could fall very quickly. This is the key issue with the exchange token model and platform incentive structures changing is something that we saw happen with Crypto.com's Cronos ( CRO-USD ) exchange token last year . The value of that coin is down roughly 80% since I wrote about it following the changes to the incentive structure. Summary Exchange tokens in crypto can be fun because buying them is a bit like betting on the success of the exchanges themselves. They sort of work like non-dividend paying growth stocks in that regard. Especially if the token also provides some sort of platform voting rights. While most of these exchange tokens have small variations on what the utility is provided to the user within the platform, the fundamental similarity between all of them is buying them is betting on the success of the platform. In that regard, it's important to assess the sustainability of the platform's growth, the proof of reserves, and the TAM of the business. For OKX, a large portion of the volume comes from the derivatives business. This is not something that US-based crypto buyers currently have access to. This could theoretically be limiting to the future demand of the OKB token. However, the buyback and burn program has clearly helped propel the coin's price upwards. While I don't personally hold OKB, in my view there are worse coins in the crypto ecosystem to go long.",NEUTRAL,BTC | OKB,BTC | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | OKB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601997-okex-exploring-exchange-utility-token?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12481772.jpeg
12481708,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530790,1683653189,PEPE Price Prediction: Can Pepe Coin Flip Dogecoin?,"Pepe is the hottest new meme coin in crypto, based on one of the most popular memes in history and one that has an enormous presence in the cryptocurrency community. Pepe coin has already minted millionaires out of those who only rolled the dice with a few hundred dollars. In recent days, it has done over a 20x return. But that’s now in the past, and what we are focused on is the future. How much will Pepe coin be worth? Read our Pepe price prediction to find out. What Is Pepe Crypto? Pepe, the freshest meme coin in the game, features crypto’s beloved and melancholy frog, Pepe. Leveraging the unstoppable momentum of meme culture, Pepe crypto fuses the secure and transparent features of blockchain technology with the explosive virality of the Pepe the Frog meme, resulting in a truly exceptional experience for its holders. The inception of Pepe coin was born from the viral success of the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. Created by the talented artist, Matt Furie, this image became an instant sensation across numerous online platforms, eventually becoming a prominent symbol of internet culture. Pepe coin encapsulates the very essence of digital communities, harnessing the collective power of internet culture to offer users an immersive and enjoyable digital currency. What Is Pepe Meme Coin Origins? Boy’s Club is a comic series created by artist Matt Furie, featuring a group of anthropomorphic animal characters hanging out and engaging in everyday activities. Pepe the Frog originated from this series as a supporting character, first appearing in a 2005 strip. Over time, Pepe gained popularity on various internet platforms, eventually evolving into a widely-shared internet meme with numerous adaptations and variations, including “Sad Frog” and “Angry Pepe.” Compared to other memes, Pepe is more popularly used in the crypto community and with more variety than other memes. For example, despite the history and popularity of Dogecoin, the meme isn’t used as much in internet culture today. Pepe Coin Tokenonomics: Supply, Utility, and More Pepe coin has a total supply of 420,690,000,000,000 tokens. 93.1% of the supply was sent to the liquidity pools. The remaining 6.9% of the supply is being held in a multi-sig wallet only to be used as tokens for future centralized exchange listings, bridges, and liquidity pools. Eventually Pepe holders will gain access to crypto utilities like Pepe merch, Pepe Academy, and Pepe Tools, whatever those may be. Pepe Success Stories: Feels Good Man Social media, especially Twitter, is filled with Pepe success stories. Some of the largest examples include making more than $4 million with only a $27 purchase in Pepe. However, that story has a sad ending. Others turned $250 into more than a million. And the winnings keep piling up. On the day of Pepe’s Binance listing, it climbed more than 121% alone. The rising star of meme coins has become so huge that it made it over a $1B market cap momentarily. Holders of the token seek to flip Dogecoin, which would be another 20x from current levels. Genius 🤑 https://t.co/aksjlHjZZJ — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) May 9, 2023 Making Money With Meme Coin Mania The emergence and explosion in Pepe crypto popularity has resulted in tons of knock offs and meme coins that are hoping to cash in on the trend. Many of these new coins have nowhere near the same level of meme clout as Pepe, but are still doing well in the current mania. It is important to note that most of these meme coins have very little fundamental value, even Pepe, are rising because investors are hoping to buy the coin early and sell it later at a higher price. During the Dogecoin-led meme mania, most of the knockoffs created then are mostly worthless today. Pepe Price Predictions Few would have guessed that Pepe would rise like it has in ROI. But cryptocurrencies are known to climb by astronomical amounts during their early days and Pepe coin has been no different. Dogecoin is up over 700,000% from its 2015 lows. Ethereum rose more than 370,000% ROI from the time it was released. Even Bitcoin did more than 50,000% during its first ever cycle. The average ROI of these three cryptocurrencies is an astounding 373,333%. This theoretically shows the remarkable potential for growth and profitability that Pepe might offer to investors who are willing to take on the risks associated with this emerging market. Pepe Price Prediction: Will Pepe Flip Dogecoin? The Pepe community hopes to flip Dogecoin in market cap. Using the current Dogecoin market cap of roughly $10B, and the current Pepe market cap as of the time of this writing, which is $770M, this would represent a minimum of a 12x in price. If Dogecoin didn’t grow in value at the same time, Pepe would reach $0.000022116 per coin. However, if Dogecoin also climbed and Pepe still beat it by 12x, Pepe would reach a much higher price per token. If Dogecoin’s market cap was still valued at $88B at its all-time high in 2021, Pepe would be required to increase over 113 times to surpass Dogecoin in market cap. Considering Dogecoin reached this price in the past, Pepecoin could still have a 100x return in its future. Pepe Price Prediction: Will Pepe Flip Ethereum? No, this is highly unlikely. In fact, Ethereum gas fees are skyrocketing due to the meme coin craze that Pepe ignited. Most meme coins, aside from Dogecoin, are available only as ERC-20 tokens built on Ethereum. Due to this design, it costs ETH to trade, transfer, or interact with the tokens. However, this comparison with Ethereum does show Pepe’s potential. Pepe Price Prediction: Will Pepe Flip Bitcoin? No, this is also very unlikely. Not even Ethereum has been able to flip Bitcoin. Bitcoin has first mover advantage, global adoption, regulatory acceptance, and more. Pepe, like other meme coins, offers very little utility. However, this comparison with Bitcoin further shows potential. Pepe Price Prediction: Will Pepe Go to Zero? This is unlikely, but not impossible. Pepe coin is based on the meme created by Matt Furie. In the past, Matt Furie has filed lawsuits against the unlawful use of his creation. There is no telling if somehow Furie is able to take action against the decentralized cryptocurrency.

The open letter escalated a fight already being waged between Aragon, a crypto governance project building tools for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and a tight-knit group of activist investors critical of project leadership and demanding they give disenchanted investors an exit ramp.  Their fight erupted last week when Aragon banned at least half a dozen Discord members, including Woodard, alleging they were rabble-rousers and not actual community members. In his letter Woodard took issue with that characterization and said the questions he was asking over months sought transparency about matters such as treasury, not trouble.  “There is no doubt that community management and governance are hard, but selectively removing the voices of the few tokenholders who want to engage strikes me as a massive step in the wrong direction,” Woodard wrote in the letter.  Arca’s vow to work with “other tokenholders” could add fuel and momentum to the activist effort.

Other Bittrex creditors include a crypto wallet with a claim of $14.5 million. Notably, FinCen is the top 50 creditor with a claim of $3.5 million, while the US SEC has an “undetermined amount of claims.” SEC Lawsuit And Bankruptcy Filing Follows Bittrex Plans To Wind Down Bittrex exchange has had it very rough in 2023. The firm first reduced its workforce in February, laying off 83 employees. According to the trading platform, the market crash and the collapse and bankruptcy of many crypto firms in 2022 affected its operations. Some of the crypto exchanges and lending platforms that were also affected by the market were Celsius, Voyager Digital, and the FTX exchange crash that wreaked havoc in the industry. Later in March, Bittrex announced plans to wind down its US operations by April 30 due to regulatory uncertainty. In the announcement, Bittrex assured customers their funds were safe but advised US customers to withdraw them before the slated date. By April 17, the US SEC filed a lawsuit against the firm, alleging it operated an exchange for buying, selling, and trading crypto asset securities without proper registration. Three weeks after the lawsuit, the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy. Notably, while responding to a Twitter post about the lawsuit, the lawyer representing thousands of XRP holders, John Deaton, blamed the SEC Chair Gary Gensler for Bittrex’s decision. Think of all the investors @GaryGensler just protected. He will go down as quite possibly the worst SEC Chairman in history.

42393579,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj0M7z,1683649510,There's No Such Thing as High Fees on Bitcoin,"Veterans of the blocksize war that raged from 2015 to 2017 in Bitcoin were met with a curious sight this week: Bitcoiners complaining about high fees. If this doesn’t strike you as odd, it’s worth recalling some brief history.  Historically, “small-blockers” – the faction that retained the claim to Bitcoin in the blocksize wars – have supported the existence of fees during times of congestion as a necessary tradeoff to achieve decentralization. Big blockers – the faction that split off into BCH and BSV – were the ones aiming to keep fees low. But this trend has reversed for some Bitcoiners recently.  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  Famously, big-block (and low fee enthusiast) Roger Ver lamented five years ago that “babies [were] dying” because Bitcoin core devs refused to raise the block limit (and alleviate fees). Central to the big blocker talking point was that more block space was required in order to accommodate more transactions. This would in theory drive down fees and make it easier to scale a blockchain to global usage for all manner of small payments.  The small blockers, by contrast, preached the importance of restraint, and sought to keep the blockchain as compact as possible, so that it might remain maximally decentralized and censor resistant. A larger blockchain, the thinking went, would only be maintained by industrial node operators, and could thus be trivially co-opted by state or corporate actors. In the scaling wars, instead of naively increasing block space to ease the fee pressure in the short term, Bitcoiners embraced instead a layered philosophy.  In 2023, it’s 2017 again, except this time many hardcore Bitcoiners have flipped and are now embracing the 'fees should be low' perspective  This is in fact how all payment systems scale: by deferring settlement. You don’t use wire transfers to pay for cigarettes – you use a network like Visa which uses batched, deferred settlement and ultimately settles to partner banks via ACH. You would typically reserve wire payments for larger transactions like down-payments on a house where finality is important.  Indeed, I’ve been sympathetic to the small blocker philosophy, and that’s why I supported Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash, and that’s why I’m generally skeptical of the approach taken by blockchains like EOS or Solana. Accepting smaller blocks means tolerating larger fee spikes when the blockchain gets busy. Historically, large blockers used times of blockchain congestion as evidence in their favor, and Bitcoiners were forced to grit their teeth and resort to more philosophical arguments as to why the convenience wasn’t worth the tradeoff in terms of decentralization. In 2017, Gregory Maxwell, arguably the most influential developer on the small block side of the conflict, “popped the champaign (sic)” when Bitcoin fees topped the block reward for the first time.  In 2023, it’s 2017 again, except this time many hardcore Bitcoiners have flipped and are now embracing the “fees should be low” perspective – one that they (or their antecedents) explicitly fought against during the scaling wars.  The culprit is, ironically, Bitcoin’s own Taproot upgrade, which (perhaps unintentionally) opened up a new design space which permitted users to inscribe arbitrary content on the blockchain. Image NFTs (“Ordinals”) have stolen most of the attention, but the immediate catalyst for this spike was actually the creation of the BRC-20 standard, which relies on an exotic distribution method. BRC-20s are issued with a “proof of burned fee” mechanic, in which users must sacrifice transaction fees in order to create new tokens. This has driven fees in the short term to eye-watering levels, pricing out other sorts of conventional usage. Some Bitcoiners have even taken to calling the usage of the blockchain a deliberate “denial of service” attack or an attack on El Salvador’s Bitcoin mission.  The good news is that fee spikes generally don’t last. If history is any guide, the current mania for minting BRC-20 tokens will likely fade relatively quickly. It looks to me to be an event similar to the Otherside mint on Ethereum rather than anything enduring. However, it’s certainly the case that Ordinals and Inscriptions have unlocked a huge amount of latent demand for Bitcoin blockspace, and entered us into a new, structurally higher fee regime, even if this acute spike will fade in a matter of days.  Bitcoin maximalist ideology has become highly reactive, technologically regressive, and more concerned with ideological purity than intellectual coherence  This I consider to be an unequivocally good thing, as Bitcoin blockspace was a virtual wasteland from summer 2021 through early 2023. Miners need to be paid somehow, and as the miner subsidy further decays, fees will have to compensate for the lost revenue. The lack of sufficient miner revenue from fees has been the primary worry for myself and many other Bitcoiners who acknowledge the long term risks to the protocol. So I have been heartened to see Ordinals and Inscriptions trigger a new form demand for Bitcoin blockspace. I believe these kinds of more creative uses of otherwise-neglected blockspace could represent a path to sustainability for Bitcoin’s block reward.  Though I am sympathetic to the observation that high fees are pricing out individuals used to making smaller transactions on the Bitcoin base layer, especially folks in the global south like El Salvador or Africa, it’s simply mistaken to believe that Bitcoin owes anyone perpetually low fees. Bitcoiners made a very deliberate decision to cap block space to make validation cheap (and indeed – to make validation as inclusive as possible, especially for folks in the global south!). Mechanically, this means that fees must rise when congestion appears. This is an inescapable consequence of the Bitcoin design.  For a set of people who claim intellectual lineage from the Austrian tradition, the characterization of the price of blockspace as “too high” is incoherent. Fees are set by the market, and believing them to be too high is to endorse interventionism and central planning. To believe that the price of blockspace is “high” is to impose a normative view regarding which types of transactions Bitcoin should be reserved for, which is incompatible with a permissionless system.  Read more: Bitcoin’s ‘BRC-20’ Explosion Sends Users Scrambling for Options, Including Lightning  The market price of a commodity can never be “wrong.” Prices simply reflect the aggregate attitudes of all market participants. This logic is akin to saying that oil prices ought to be $20/barrel so that even the poorest in society can afford gas. While that stance may have some populist appeal, someone always has to pay. In the case of Bitcoin, the price of low fees would be unbounded block space (a nonstarter from a decentralization standpoint), not to mention a permanent subsidy (as fees will be the sole driver of miner revenue in the long term). So Bitcoiners who claim that fees are “too high” are effectively demanding that their low fees be subsidized by node operators and, in the long term, by perpetual inflation in the Bitcoin protocol.  Those expressing dismay they can’t onboard newcomers to Bitcoin simply misunderstand the nature of the network. Base layer settlements are a finite commodity and cannot be expected to remain cheap in perpetuity. Instead, the settlement assurances sought should match the nature of the transaction. You don’t need a bank wire level of assurance to buy a coffee, and you don’t need a base layer transaction to settle a $5 test payment to a friend.  If Bitcoiners stymied by fees have any quarrel, it ought to be with the pace of development of L2s in the Bitcoin space. There’s no real excuse for this misconception either: a cursory look at the data shows that fees reached over $50 per transaction at certain points in both 2021 and 2017. This should have surprised nobody. Fees will always reflect the market’s demand for Bitcoin blockspace, and if your desired usage mode is priced out, that simply means that base layer Bitcoin isn’t a suitable network for you.  More puzzling is why former small blockers and self-appointed high priests Giacomo Zucco or Francis Pouliot have taken to complaining about the fee pressure (even if they enlisted on the small blocker side of the scaling wars). The answer is that for them, there are two types of Bitcoin usage: sacred and profane. Ordinals and Inscriptions are generally supported by the moderate “outgroup” and as of right now have primarily been used to issue and trade NFTs, or to speculate on new tokens.  To the hardcore fundamentalist crowd that absolutely disdains the ownership of anything other than Bitcoin, this is profane. Current Bitcoin maximalist doctrine stipulates that Bitcoin ought only be used for monetary transactions – but not those pertaining to non-Bitcoin asset types. Their perverse framework is one in which it’s morally acceptable for North Korea to use Bitcoin for sanctions evasion, but unacceptable for an artist to issue their NFT on the Bitcoin blockspace. If this strikes you as bizarre and inconsistent, it’s because the Bitcoin maximalist ideology has become highly reactive, technologically regressive, and more concerned with ideological purity than intellectual coherence.  The BRC-20 mania, as perplexing as it is to many, is one of the best things that has happened to Bitcoin in some time  For the few small blockers that have remained intellectually consistent from 2017 to today, the new fee pressure ought to be welcomed. It’s a catalyst for the further adoption of established L2 networks like Lightning, and where Lightning falls short, alternative L2 systems. As with all commodities, high prices are the cure for high prices. As a venture capitalist, I’m encouraged by the entrepreneurs I have been meeting lately who have begun designing novel L2s that explore alternative design spaces. In particular, rollups have clear product market fit on Ethereum, and I’m hopeful they can be added to Bitcoin in time.  Lightning is not a panacea, and it is best suited for high frequency, small granularity payments – which certainly doesn’t satisfy all types of Bitcoin transactional demand. There’s more than just one way to move dollars around – we have wires, ACH, credit and debit networks, Fednow, physical cash, remittances, hawala networks, money orders, and fintech apps, among others. More abstractly, these can be divided into “push” and “pull” approaches, real time versus deferred settlement, and gross versus net settlement models. Each has its own set of tradeoffs, and offers different transactional speeds and settlement assurances.  It’s naïve to think that one scaling network alone can satisfy the diverse transactional needs of Bitcoiners. The long term future for Bitcoin is a plurality of scaling approaches. The gist, however, is a move away from the one-baselayer-settlement = one-payment model, towards a more economically dense, one-baselayer-settlement = many-payment model. This is the right way to scale. This is the only way a broadcast system like a blockchain, where every node operator must be aware of every transaction, can scale to global usage.  The burst of activity around inscriptions and resulting high fees is an accelerant towards this more efficient future, and it should be celebrated. The BRC-20 mania, as perplexing as it is to many, is one of the best things that has happened to Bitcoin in some time.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/09/theres-no-such-thing-as-high-fees-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d455ee6a13dcb713161ebb66153af8ed97881160-1885x1060.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ishan Wahi, a former product manager at the U.S.-based crypto exchange, was arrested in July 2022 and charged with wire fraud and insider trading for feeding his brother and another man insider information about upcoming crypto listings. From June 2021 to April 2022, authorities say the men made over $1 million trading on Wahi’s information.  The case is the second crypto-related insider trading case brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ).  A guilty verdict in the first such case, which involved the former head of product at non-fungible token (NFT) platform OpenSea, was reached on May 3. Nate Chastain was convicted of money laundering and wire fraud for using insider knowledge of which NFTs would be listed on OpenSea to make profitable trades. Chastain has not yet been sentenced, but faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.  Wahi’s brother, Nikhil Wahi, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud last September, and in January was sentenced to 10 months in prison. After initially pleading not guilty and attempting to fight the case, Ishan Wahi pleaded guilty in February to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  Wahi’s sentence is longer than his lawyers had hoped for – in court filings from April, Wahi’s lawyers requested Wahi be sentenced to no more than 10 months in prison, like his brother’s sentence.

Whales Show Signs Of Dumping Also, the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) is 35.84, close to the oversold region of 30 and bearish. However, the RSI’s direction is sideways, suggesting that the bears and bulls are even. AVAX’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and shows a negative value confirming the prevalent bearish trend in the market. The current downtrend is similar to the previous trend between February 22 and March 13, 2023. If AVAX’s RSI moves to the oversold region of 30, a retracement to the upside is possible. AVAX encountered stiff resistance at the $17.67 level, sending the asset into a downtrend. Despite trading above the $16.35 resistance level yesterday, the bears pushed its price below the $15.85 support level. Since the $15.85 support could not hold, expect further decline for the asset to the $14.40 support if the bears persist. However, AVAX might rally if it enters into the oversold region. Recent Developments In Avalanche Might Foster Price Reversal The digital technology and intelligence arm of the Alibaba Group, Alibaba Cloud, formed a partnership with Avalanche. The main aim of this partnership is to create a Cloudverse Launchpad. Cloudverse will help users to launch and manage their Metaverse spaces hosted on the Avalanche blockchain. Exclusive: @avax and @alibaba_cloud join forces to help businesses deploy metaverses on its chain ""It’s a great way to get access to 4M potential builders, and when they come through, there will be tons of transactions on the chain,"" @John1wu said.https://t.co/Qbc1zyNS3Q — Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) May 4, 2023 Also, MUA DAO is the third organization included in this innovative partnership. They are the service layer for implementation and integration on Metaverse customization. As a result, Avalanche Subnets can be customized to fit various needs on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy As Parabolic SAR Flips Bearish On Daily Chart The Avalanche network developers believe that this partnership will demystify the creation of Metaverse since it makes the process quick and seamless. Also, developers on the Cloudverse will receive support for visuals, meta-economics, events, interactions, and operations. Notably, Alibaba Cloud and Avalanche partnered earlier in December 2022 to provide the tools and infrastructure for Asian-based users to launch network validators. Alibaba Cloud has around 4 million customers and 10 million developers, increasing Avalanche’s exposure and likely boosting AVAX’s price.

42393568,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj0LNp,1683643884,"Africa Moves to Lightning, Stablecoins as Bitcoin Transaction Fees Soar","Bitcoin (BTC) users in Africa are increasingly moving to the Lightning network and stablecoins as transaction fees have soared to their highest level in about two years.  The Lightning network is a layer built on top of the Bitcoin network to process transactions more quickly.  Many across the continent have already been using these tools, so they weren’t necessarily troubled by spiking fees, but instability has also been noticed even in wallets that use the Lightning network, some said.  As a result of the higher fees there has been a shift of demand from customers who now “prefer moving their transactions through stablecoins like USDT, while folk with low volume transactions now prefer lightning network transactions over the base layer transactions,” said Heritage Falodun, the founder of Africa-focused over-the-counter liquidity provider Digioats.  Read more: Binance Resumes Bitcoin Withdrawals After Second Pause, Says It's Adjusting Fees and Integrating Lightning Network  The dramatic increase in transaction fees is at least in part due to the introduction of ordinals on Bitcoin, a protocol which allows for the creation of non-fungible tokens and BRC-20 tokens, associated with some memecoins, on the Bitcoin network.  The day-to-day users of bitcoin for transactions such as cross-border payments and remittances have been greatly affected, said Lorraine Marcel, a Kenya-based founder of Bitcoin DADA, a project to educate women in Africa on the crypto. The majority of the African population is not familiar with the Lightning network and “most educators prefer onboarding newbies onto the unchain network as it offers self custody,” she said.  While the absolute amounts of transaction fees may seem small to those in the West, to those in African countries with weak economies it’s a significant burden, said Lagos, Nigeria-based Mary Imasuen, host of the Bitcoin Gamer Chat Podcast.  Traders are also affected. “Most exchanges that operate in Africa don’t yet have lightning ... a lot of traders are still waiting for transactions from three days ago to confirm ... [while] some trades are too expensive to settle,” said Kgothatso of Machankura wallet in an interview with CoinDesk.  Those running Lightning nodes are also facing difficulties. “Opening a channel to the node now costs more than before because of the bitcoin fees,” said Imasuen. “From the perspective of those in Africa, where our currency is constantly devaluing, that cost is not small,” she said.  Ultimately this could lead to less decentralization of the network. Fewer “everyday people” will be able to “run effective nodes without using a well funded LSP [lighting service provider],” which could increase centralization on Layer 2, said Nikolai Tjongarero, Bitcoin Educator, founder of EasySats and BTC Mining Namibia.  Lightning hiccups  Even those that are already using the Lightning network have faced difficulties as transactions have been congested or liquidity has run dry across services providers.  “Every Monday for the past year and a half I've paid salaries for 11 people working for Bitcoin Ekasi using lightning, and today was the first time in over a year that the process hasn't gone smooth,” said Hermann Vivier, chairman of South African Bitcoin Ekasi, a startup aiming to create a circular bitcoin economy. “I had to use 4 different lightning wallets as channel liquidity between different wallet providers had dried up.”  Users of the Muun wallet, which utilizes both the bitcoin and lightning layers to process transactions, have been charged high fees, particularly those employing it for payments at South African retail chain Pick N Pay, said Kgothatso. Congestion on the mempool has meant that swaps in the Muun wallet are expensive, with users having to foot the bill, Kgothatso added.  Mempools are essentially waiting rooms for bitcoin transactions. These have been clogged in the last couple of days, with around 400,000 transactions waiting to be processed at certain times. Muun bases its fee estimates on the condition of the mempool, so with more congestion, fees have increased.  The flip side  Despite all these issues, many in Africa see this fee spike as a potentially net benefit for adoption as it supercharges the shift towards Lightning network integration and other solutions.  Marcel is “hopeful” that the fee increase “is just temporary” but added that it is “an eye opener.”  “In a way it's a good thing, as it's forcing people onto lightning … despite the short term inconvenience,” said Vivier.

But like other cryptocurrencies, the price of DASH is subject to volatility, and its value can fluctuate significantly in a short period. Unfortunately, Since February 16, 2023, DASH has witnessed a loss of about 45.45%, bringing the coin down to $40.88. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Drop Further? Whales Show Signs Of Dumping This DASH downtrend has left investors and traders wondering what could be chasing the price down. Bearish Market Sentiment For DASH Pushes Price Downward According to the 24-hour trading chart, the price has steadily decreased since the bears took full control of its market. This is a result of negative market sentiment towards DASH. This report shows DASH’s market sentiment is bearish, while the Fear & Greed Index shows a neutral 51. Notably, data from Dash Explorer has observed that the Blockchain is experiencing more activities lately. This could be a long-term dump as investors fear to hold DASH further as Dash Explorer recorded that it has more output from its blockchain than input. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy As Parabolic SAR Flips Bearish On Daily Chart Today’s DASH price is $41.50, down by -5.89% in 24 hours. It is currently down by 17.00% within the last 7 days. But its 24-hour trading volume has gained 6.3% at $72 million. What Lies Ahead? The crypto asset is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and attempting to form a Death Cross. This is generally considered a bearish sign. As DASH tries to form a Death Cross, it could lead to further selling pressure, as traders and investors may take this as a sign to sell their holdings or to take short positions. The SMA indicator suggests that both the long-term and short-term trend is bearish. The Relative Strength Index confirms the bearish momentum as the high selling pressure is high. The RSI with a reading of 24.50 shows that DASH is currently in the oversold zone indicating a potential selling opportunity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge Under $28,000 Only Temporary? This Metric Suggests So The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is below the signal line, and the histogram is below zero; this indicates a bearish trend. When the MACD line falls below the signal line, it suggests that price trend momentum is slowing down and there’s an increase in selling pressure. In addition, when the histogram is below 0, it confirms that the bearish momentum and the decline may continue. Overall, the combination of the above indicators suggests that the market is currently bearish, and traders should trade with an extreme risk management strategy.

42393584,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj0Mcl,1683641347,CoinDesk Turns 10: 2016 - How The DAO Hack Changed Ethereum and Crypto,"Most of us have heaved a desperate sigh of relief on waking from a terrifying nightmare. On June 17, 2016, Christoph Jentzch instead awoke inside of one.  “I was sleeping. My brother called me, so my wife woke me up. She said, ‘[Your brother] says something is wrong,’” he recalls. “I saw that it was a hack. The withdrawal was regular and repeated.”  “At that moment, I realized immediately: The DAO is over.”  This feature is part of our “CoinDesk Turns 10” series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history. The “DAO Hack” is our choice for the most important story of 2016.  These days, some may be confused by reference to “The DAO,” singular. In 2023, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are everywhere – or at least, the label is. But there is only one “The DAO.”  In 2016, just months after the debut of the smart-contract platform Ethereum, Jentzsch and others launched an ambitious demonstration of what it could accomplish. The DAO would use Ethereum tech to let investors from around the world pool their funds, then vote on how to deploy it. It was likely the first global investment fund in human history open to anyone with a pulse.  On that June morning, though, the dream of The DAO died. The massive hack would go on to drain as much as $60 million worth of Ether, or one-third of the funds contributed by would-be DAO participants. Even after a white-hat counterattack, the stolen funds would ultimately amount to around 5% of all the Ethereum tokens in existence at the time.  As one insider put it, The DAO’s collapse 'created Ethereum as it is today'  This led to what may still be the most controversial decision in Ethereum’s history: a coordinated hard fork. Sometimes wryly referred to as an “irregular state change,” the fork simply took the money back from the hacker by rewriting the Ethereum ledger. Both before and after the fork, this move triggered huge and important debates over so-called “immutability” in blockchains. Some feared it would become a precedent, making the system less trustworthy.  All in all, the episode was a dark one for many in Ethereum. But Jentzch and others close to the situation now see it less as a tragedy than as a formative moment. As one insider put it, The DAO’s collapse “created Ethereum as it is today.” It could be considered a parallel to the impact of the Mt. Gox hack on Bitcoin: a stress test that pushed the community to the brink of destruction, but formed bonds and set precedents that helped create the success we see today.  That includes helping make DAOs a major pillar of Ethereum. Collectives like PleasrDAO now operate on something quite close to that initial investment-fund model, while projects like MakerDAO use similar governance models to accomplish different ends – in Maker’s case, setting monetary policy rather than guiding investments. (And of course, plenty of projects have also adopted the “DAO” designation more because it sounds cool than because of how they actually operate.)  I was around for The DAO hack myself, covering the dire events for Fortune. But in revisiting the episode, insiders pointed out another consequence of The DAO that I’d never thought about before. Its failure forced projects to seek funding through different mechanisms. That led directly to the ICO boom of 2017 and 2018 – and to the plethora of real and fake project tokens traded on exchanges around the world now.  In other words, without The DAO and its failure, much of crypto as we know it today wouldn’t exist.  The DAO's Origins  It all started because the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees development on the blockchain, was running low on funds.  Cristoph Jentzch had been deeply involved in the early development of Ethereum, after discovering the whitepaper in 2014. He quickly joined the Ethereum Foundation and served as a coder and tester for the C++ version of the Ethereum client. Jentzch says he worked in parallel with Vitalik Buterin, then building the Python client.  By the summer of 2015, though, the C++ work was done, while Foundation funding was low. So many of those contributors soon left to pursue related projects. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood split to create Parity (and later Polkadot), while Jentzsch founded a smart-contract developer called Slock.it. Slock.it was partly focused on building “The Universal Sharing Network,” a “sharing economy” on Ether sometimes summarized as “decentralized Uber.”  Jentszch and his team initially conceived of The DAO as a fundraising mechanism specifically for Slock.it. He says now the goal was to raise something like $5 to $10 million from Ethereum users.  But – in a phenomenon that would replay itself during the subsequent ICO era ­– things got out of hand quickly as buzz about The DAO accelerated. The project blew well past its funding goals.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10 – The Legacy of Mt. Gox: Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  That required a fundamental rethink.  “After it raised $20 or 30 million,” says Jentzsch, “everyone was saying, this isn’t just for Slock.it or the USN. The narrative changed from Slock.it funding to … let’s fund every app on Ethereum with it.” Ultimately, the DAO would raise a stunning $150 million.  That, Jentszch says, was far more than he bargained for. Even before the hack, he felt The DAO had attracted too much money, and too much hype.  “Before the hack, this was the only time in my life I was actually totally burned out,” Jentzsch reflects now. “I was just walking in the woods for hours a day. My energy was at minus-10. I was getting worried about the DAO, because I wanted $5-10 million, not $150m and 15% of all ETH. That was crazy… I was giving birth to this project that could get out of my control, and become something really bad in the world.”  The hack  Jentzch wasn’t the only one panicking when the hack started unfolding. The entire DAO team activated.  “Everything started going red, my phone and my computer,” says one member of the DAO support team. He wishes to remain anonymous, so we’ll call him ‘Igor.’  “Griff [Green, later cofounder of Giveth.io] was like, look what’s going on here. He was sending me Etherscan links,” Igor recounts. “I’m not the most technical person, so I was like, ‘Guys, this doesn’t look good, right?’ And they were like, no, it doesn’t look good.”  The attacker, it later became clear, used what’s now known as a “reentrancy attack” that exploited a so-called “fallback” function native to Ethereum’s then-novel coding language, Solidity. Over the course of a few weeks, the hacker would almost entirely drain the $150 million worth of ETH controlled by The DAO.  In response, not just Ethereum leaders, but figures from across the crypto space rallied to look for a solution. Vitalik Buterin himself, who had not been directly involved with The DAO, became part of the bailout effort. Perhaps surprisingly, so did some die-hard Bitcoiners.  It turned out the attack had one saving grace – it worked both ways.  The DAO’s crisis squad included “white hat” Ethereum hackers who “started using the same exploit” against the hacker, Igor recounts. The white hats, who came to be known as the Robin Hood group, “were pulling as much as possible before the hacker got it … And after that they attacked him [back],” says Igor. “They were really geniuses, you know.”  In other words, the white hats found themselves stealing from a bank robber. These tactics were able to recover a large portion of the hacked funds, but far from all of it. And there was a bigger problem: The DAO was (unlike too many of its progeny) truly decentralized. There was no easy way to entirely “pull the plug,” so to speak, meaning funds would be at risk indefinitely.  The DAO was quickly becoming a triple-threat to Ethereum  This, plus the repeatability of the reentrancy attack in both directions, meant that even after the white-hat victories, there was no true end in sight. “The way we saw it back then was that this was going to go on forever – just hacking back and forth,” says Jentzch.  At the same time, The DAO was quickly becoming a triple-threat to Ethereum. There was the money that could be lost, and the reputational damage. But it had also taken over the badly-needed attention of developers trying to move things forward.  “It was two months of attention of the entire Ethereum ecosystem on this,” says Jentzch. “So there was an idea, we need to get past this. A hard fork was just a very clean-cut ending to this phase.”  The Ethereum hard fork  Eventually, a radical solution was proposed: What if the only way to really beat the hacker was to change the rules of the game?  A “Hard Fork” of the entire Ethereum blockchain would not only include a fix for the bug that crippled The DAO, but something much more radical: a so-called “irregular state change.” This is one of the funniest phrases ever coined in crypto, because beneath its stiff abstraction, it means something simple and shocking: the hard fork would take away a user’s money.  Specifically, the proposed hard fork simply took all the hacked funds and returned them, ultimately, to their rightful owners. The fork was like waving a magic wand and teleporting a bank vault from a robber’s hideout back into the bank.  On its face, this sounded fantastic. But the long-term implications were far more complicated – a warning that reached the Ethereum community, in part, through Bitcoiners.  “Initially because most of the people were investors [in the DAO], they were like yeah, ‘I want my money back,’” says Igor. “But later Vitalik came in [to the discussion], and some Bitcoiners. And there were fascinating discussions about [whether the hard fork] was the way to go.”  Soon, in an echo of the block size dispute in Bitcoin, two strongly ideological sides formed on the question of hard forking Ethereum.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  On one side were those who might be termed pragmatists. This included not just investors who wanted their money back, but figures in the Ethereum ecosystem who saw a much broader threat to their long-term goals. Even after the efforts of the Robin Hood team, the hacker still controlled $40 million worth of Ether – which at the time amounted to roughly 5% of the system’s entire market cap. So if the hacker retained control of the hacked funds, they would have a permanent dominant position in the ecosystem. That would have made it hard to ever truly take Ethereum seriously again.  “I think the people from the [Ethereum] Foundation were not happy with what was going on at the DAO, even prior to the hack,” says Igor. “Because they thought it was way too early. And that was one of the main reasons for the rollback – it was very early.” Shockingly early, in fact: The DAO had been proposed, launched, funded, and hacked by June of 2016, less than a year after Ethereum went live.  But, partly under the influence of vocal Bitcoiners, there was a robust opposition to this pragmatic move. To them, the “irregular state change” was not just a kind of cheating, but a deep betrayal of the entire point of a blockchain. Some vocally hewed to the “code is law” ethos still prominent at the time – the idea that blockchains should supersede courts and nation-states as arbiters of fairness. Under some versions of this idea, if you figured out a way to steal money via hacking or exploiting a blockchain, you had earned it fair and square.  But the deeper point was simple trustworthiness. If Ethereum could be patched to take away a user’s funds – even if that user was a hacker – it raised the possibility that the same thing could happen to anyone. Wouldn’t that, hard fork opponents argued, be even more harmful to the integrity of Ethereum than letting a hacker own 5% of the chain?  This “code is law” contingent would demonstrate the full scope of blockchain democracy by choosing to stick with the old chain after the fork. This chain – where the hacker still had much of their hoard – came to be known as Ethereum Classic. ETC enjoyed a lot of support in its early years, and still has adherents today, though it has inevitably lagged behind Ethereum in both market interest and technology.  What came after  Seven years later, the most remarkable thing about the DAO hack is that a similar hard fork has not been on the table since; it seems those worried about the moral hazard of bailout-like hard forks may have been overcautious. Most notably, there was never a serious proposal for a hard-fork fix of the late 2017 Parity wallet incident, when a catastrophic chain of accidents permanently locked around $150 million worth of Ether. Another hard fork could have given that money back, too, but it never happened.  One outcome of The DAO hack was shifting funding models away from collective organizations and towards direct-to-investor ICO sales  Another remarkable fact about the DAO hack is that the culprit has still never been identified. The hack exploited bugs that had been identified by the DAO team; they were in the process of fixing those ahead of the planned distribution of funds. This timing may have contributed to rumors that the hack was an “inside job,” but that’s pure speculation.  Despite the embarrassment of its involvement in the DAO hack, Slock.it remained a relevant player in smart-contract development, until its acquisition by Blockchains.com in mid-2019. Christoph Jentzch is now, among other roles, a venture investor.  One thing hasn’t changed: hacks of major crypto projects and exchanges have remained common in DeFi. But they’ve gotten much bigger than the roughly $60 million successfully drained from the DAO. Examples like last year’s Wormole hack ($325 million) and Ronin exploit ($625 million) spring easily to mind. According to Chainalysis, DeFi hacks accounted for 82% of all hacking thefts in 2022.  The bright side  But without the early cautionary example of The DAO, things might be even worse today. “In hindsight, the whole industry shifted entirely to security after [The DAO],” says Jentszch. “Before that, it was more of a move-fast [environment]… “The whole [blockchain] security industry basically started after The DAO.”  Jentzch believes that one of the worst outcomes of The DAO hack was shifting funding models in crypto away from collective organizations and towards direct-to-investor ICO sales. The DAO had proved you could raise money on-chain, but then it collapsed, leaving fund-seeking projects empty-handed.  “So a lot of projects who planned to raise money from the DAO ended up doing ICOs,” says Jentzch. “The good, the bad and the ugly.”  What was lost in the shift from DAO to ICOs was any sort of expert oversight or vetting, Jentzch argues. “The DAO was kind of a mix of the wisdom of the crowd and these mature investors who were doing due diligence, and know what they’re doing. Something like 50% [of investors] were retail and small holders, and roughly 50% was owned by 51 people. The idea was projects will go to the DAO, and they won’t just get a check, they’ll get a smart contract that sends money over time.”  “So yes, much more wisdom would have gone into it,” Jentzch says. “It would be harder to get money from the DAO than from doing your own ICO.” That might have helped more capital to go to legitimate projects, and less to outright scams, during the subsequent ICO mania.  More broadly, Jentzch laments the decline in the broader ethos that led to The DAO.  “The spirit of Ethereum at the time, the visionary way we viewed the world: it was very much similar to early bitcoiners,” he says now. “We still have some of it, but we’ve lost some. We haven’t followed through with the vision we had back then of building truly decentralized applications. And today we’re in much better shape when it comes to secure smart contracts.”  “We shouldn’t be too shy about trying big things again.”",NEGATIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,David Z.

42393576,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj0LnT,1683640800,Crypto Security Firm Dfns Adds Biometric Support to Wallet Development Toolkit,"Paris-based crypto security firm Dfns has revealed plans to incorporate biometric identification into its wallet-as-a-service toolkit, allowing crypto developers to build out wallets that use Face ID, fingerprint scanners and other biometrics to secure user funds.  Last year's collapse of the FTX exchange and numerous similar incidents reinforced that storing crypto in a personal wallet, rather than entrusting it to an exchange or custodian, is the safest option.  Yet many people continue to store their funds with companies like Coinbase and Binance. The reason? Crypto wallets can be inconvenient to use, often including private keys consisting of long strings of letters and numbers.  According to Clarisse Hagège, CEO of Dfns, which has raised $15 million of funding: ""The first place a new user may start their Web3 journey is by opening a wallet, and if the UX feels foreign, cumbersome, or unfamiliar, the likelihood of conversion and retention drops precipitously.” UX stands for “user interface.”  Dfns is looking to change the dynamic by integrating biometric authentication into its wallet suite, aiming to assist developers in crafting more user-friendly wallets. ""The beauty of using biometrics here is that it is extremely efficient in terms of UX,” Hagège told CoinDesk.  The biometric feature relies on the open-source WebAuthn standard, allowing users to authenticate themselves without directly sharing their biometric data with third parties.  ""Everything is saved on the phone,"" Hagège said.  Adding biometric support to crypto wallets might be a new trend. Coinbase, the exchange and wallet provider, has said it plans to add the feature to its wallet-as-a-service suite.  Hagège argues the Dfns setup fundamentally differs from that of Coinbase and other wallet services. Coinbase and other companies tend to use something called multi-party computation (MPC) to secure private keys – a clever technique that allows wallet providers to manage a user’s private key without having complete access to it.  Dfns uses MPC in combination with a different technique, called ""delegated signing,"" to achieve the same end. This method splits the key across a distributed network of nodes, rather than between a single user and a service provider. According to Hagège, the method makes wallets more secure, less vulnerable to downtime and more regulatory-friendly.  CORRECTION (May 9, 2023 15:20 UTC): The article has been updated to clarify that Dfns uses MPC and delegated signing in combination, not one or the other.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/09/crypto-security-firm-dfns-adds-biometric-support-to-wallet-development-toolkit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/242108ad9bd5a5f54ab565b55d8cbe8f4a8d4128-2121x1193.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He's everywhere, and unlike any other CEO after a comparably colossal unwinding, he's not coming at me indirectly, via journalists searching out his history.  No, this deluge is him. He won't stop. It's as if he can't stop. I want to get the story of FTX down, but how can anyone discern it through all the noise that is him: that is Sam Bankman-Fried? That is SBF: That nasally, excessively informed voice that just won't stop offering his version of events in his extra-qualified statistically tinted mysticism.  These words are coming to you from somewhere around the halfway point of writing this book. It's December 1, 2022. Tonight, as my workday at Axios, the internet-native news site, was ending, I was trying to make some time do a little bit of research on companies that one of his companies, Alameda Research, has backed, but then I got a message on our Slack that SBF, the boy wonder who lost several billion dollars in crypto wealth, was doing a Twitter Spaces. For those blessedly adrift from the gravity of Twitter, Spaces are where a few people can go online and talk with each other, no video, just voice, while dozens or hundreds or thousands of others just listen, interacting only with a few emoji. Spaces has become a big way for big accounts to broadcast. And SBF, since late November and here in early December 2022, was all about broadcasting.  That was after SBF had made a morning show appearance with George Stephanopoulous, which I haven't then watched yet. And after a New York Times internet broadcast with Andrew Ross Sorkin, which I also haven't watched yet. I am the only person I know in the media who hasn't watched. I am too busy writing this book to watch a thing I knew would be that will there when I am ready. I plan to watch it later. But now he is talking again, to some random faux-investigators on Twitter in a wannabe Barbara Walters grilling I just have the misfortune of hearing.  I listened to a little of the Spaces, but it was more aggravation than information. There was too much of him. I'm drowning.  Sam will not stop coming. People say this deluge is the masterpiece of public relations plotted out by warlock-level flaks inducted into issue control dark arts.  But this view comes from witnesses of PR, perhaps its clients. This was not PR. PR is the sandstorm in which I've built my home. It's pointless pellets of banal sameness, a maelstrom in which I heave to inhale a few breaths of trustworthy observations. PR has a taste and a smell of risk aversion. What SBF was doing was not that.  This was him. This torrent sprung from his need. This was all Sam.  So much Sam.  I am drowning in Sam.  – Dec. 1, 2022  Chapter 1: I want to believe  Sam Bankman-Fried offered a story that you wanted to believe. The talkative boy billionaire who would turn the wealth creation engine of cryptocurrency into a robber baron's war chest with which he could fix the world.  He would be like Andrew Carnegie with his libraries, and who doesn't like those libraries? There was one in my tiny little hometown in Southeast Kansas. It's beautiful.  But Andrew Carnegie paid for those libraries in part by – for example – hiring thugs to bust unionized workers trying to negotiate a better contract. Not great stuff, as it goes. Some of our grandparents paid for those libraries in lost wages.  But SBF wouldn't spin up a war chest from anything nasty like air pollution–belching factories and life-threatening working conditions. SBF's war chest would be created off the internet, scratching wealth off like solid gold paint flecks from space money bouncing around something called a blockchain. Far from creating industrial scars in people's backyards, blockchains don't even seem real!  So if a good guy could come along and make his wealth off that and help a whole lot of people with that money, where would that harm be?  See also: Axios Crypto Reporter Brady Dale Discusses New FTX Book  It was an appealing way to see SBF. A lot of got sucked into it. I got sucked into it – I believed that he believed the story he was telling. Bonnie Tyler sang it out in 1984, and we all feel today just as he did then: we're all holding out for a hero.  Let me ask you this question: What if we are all in fact better off for the fact that SBF never got a chance to take a crack at really going to town saving the world?  What if he was the very last hero anyone needed?  What if, in fact, the lesson of SBF is this: the last thing anyone needs is a hero.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | RESEARCH,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/09/why-author-brady-dale-is-drowning-in-sam-bankman-fried,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/538ef38ed7445048208fb6e48ba92f78961d05fa-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12476979,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530569,1683639056,Is the Next Bitcoin Bull Run Tied To The US Presidential Elections? Here’s What History Tells Us,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, has been associated with several bull runs over the years. One of the most notable uptrends occurred in 2012, and financial analyst and cryptocurrency expert Aditya Siddhartha has linked it to the United States of America (USA) Presidential Elections. Related Reading: PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45% Why Does The US Presidential Elections Matter For Bitcoin? According to Siddhartha, the 2012 Bull Run of Bitcoin was preceded by a significant drop in BTC’s price, with a decrease of 52% observed in the market. However, after the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) Bullish Crossover and all major exponential moving average (EMA) Bullish Crossovers, the market started to gain momentum, and the bull run began. In the case of BTC’s 2012 bull market, the MACD and EMA indicators provided positive signals, leading to increased investor confidence and a surge in demand for Bitcoin. This resulted in a post-Presidential Elections bull run, with Bitcoin’s price increasing by 11800%. On the same note, Siddhartha observed that in 2016, BTC’s price experienced a drop of 41% in the run-up to the Presidential Elections. However, after the MACD Bullish Crossover and all major EMA Bullish Crossovers, the market began to gain momentum, and the uptrend started. Following the Presidential Elections, Bitcoin’s price experienced a post-election bull run, with the price increasing by a staggering 2800%. This surge in price was driven by increased demand from investors and a growing awareness of Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and digital asset. In 2020, Bitcoin saw a significant drop of 22% before the presidential elections. This drop was largely due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the elections and the potential impact it could have on the economy and the stock market. However, according to Siddhartha, following the Presidential Elections, Bitcoin’s price experienced a post-election bull trend, with the price increasing by 410%. Furthermore, Siddhartha has suggested that the price of Bitcoin could see a significant pump to $40,000 before the Pre-Presidential Elections in 2024. However, the analyst also anticipates a drop of 25%-30% in the run-up to the elections, similar to previous years. As in previous bull runs, Siddhartha predicts that the MACD Bullish Crossover and all major EMA Bullish Crossovers will provide positive signals, leading to increased investor confidence and demand for Bitcoin. Following the Presidential Elections, Siddhartha expects a post-election Bull Run, with the price of Bitcoin potentially increasing by 450%, resulting in a price range of $180,000-$200,000. At the time of writing, BTC’s price has been on the decline since Saturday. It has lost its previously established range between $28,500 and $29,600 and has once again failed to breach the key level of $30,000. BTC’s Price Drops 4% In 24 Hours At the time of writing, BTC’s price has been on the decline since Saturday, currently trading at $27,7000. It has lost its previously established range between $28,500 and $29,600 and has once again failed to breach the key level of $30,000. This level is important as it serves as a psychological barrier for investors and traders. Currently, BTC is reporting a loss of 4% in the last 24 hours, but, will Bitcoin manage to stop the current trend and attempt another run to surpass the $30,000 level? According to CryptoCon, Bitcoin has been following the Elliott Wave Theory quite well and even used it to determine the bottom in December 2022 at $16,500. CryptoCon explains that, by definition, even wave 3 cannot be over as it would make it shorter than wave 1. This means that there is still room for Bitcoin to experience significant growth in the future, despite any short-term corrections.

Outstanding obligations can take the form of loans, receivables or any payments due between the two entities.

This Metric Suggests So","Bitcoin has now plunged under the $28,000 level, but the data of an on-chain indicator may suggest that this drop could only be temporary. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Dropped Just Under The 1 Level As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current values of the metric have generally served as ideal buying opportunities during rallies in the past. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio,” which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When this indicator has a value greater than 1, it means the profits being realized in the market are currently greater than the losses. On the other hand, values below this threshold suggest a dominance of loss-taking from the holders. The SOPR being exactly equal to 1 naturally corresponds to a neutral state, where the average holder is just breaking even on their investment, as profits are equal to losses here. While the SOPR is generally defined for the entire Bitcoin market, it can also be applied to specific segments of the market. In the context of the current discussion, the “short-term holder” (STH) segment is of interest. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Drop Further? Whales Show Signs Of Dumping The STHs make up a cohort that includes all investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. The STHs who manage to hold beyond this threshold enter into the “long-term holder” (LTH) group. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have seen some decline recently | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR was below the 1 mark during last year’s bear market, suggesting that the average STH had been selling at a loss in this period. This is the typical behavior observed in bearish periods, as the constant price decline makes investors panic and sell at losses. An interesting pattern that is seen during such periods is that the line where SOPR attains a value of 1 starts providing resistance to the asset. The reason this happens is that at this level, the STHs are selling at the price they bought in. During bear markets, they usually go into losses, so whenever they find the opportunity to sell to recoup their original investment, they jump right on it. This is why the level provides resistance and forces the indicator to stay under it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy As Parabolic SAR Flips Bearish On Daily Chart The opposite behavior is seen in price rallies, however, as holders start looking at the break-even level as a profitable entry point, which leads to a large amount of buying taking place at the level. This assures that the indicator quickly returns above the 1 level if it falls below it. From the chart, it’s visible that the rally this year has also seen a similar trend so far, as the Bitcoin STH SOPR has maintained above 1 (besides a temporary drop in March, which ended up resulting in a sharp surge in the price). In the last few days, the indicator has again plunged to this level of much historical significance as the price has slipped under $28,000. If the past pattern is anything to go by, a rebound could become more probable for the BTC price here. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,600, down 1% in the last week.

After being rejected at the 200-day EMA in mid-April (blue line) and breaking the ascending trend line on the 1-day chart to the downside on April 20 (black line), the SHIB price is now in free fall. Yesterday, the SHIB price initially received support at $0.00000839 on the 1-day chart. However, if a trend reversal does not follow soon, the Shiba Inu price could drop towards the local low at $0.00000779 from December 28. This would erase all price advances since the beginning of the year. For now, the RSI on the daily chart is at 24, in oversold territory. For the return of a tentative bullish momentum, the SHIB price needs to break the key resistance at $0.000010. Otherwise, a retest of the December 2022 low seems inevitable. Will Shiba Inu Ever Reach Its All-Time High Again? Even though the Shiba Inu price is extremely bearish at the moment, the meme coin still has one of the strongest communities hoping for better times once Shibarium and SHIB : The Metaverse are live on the mainnet. However, two well-known crypto experts and influencers have expressed their doubts today. According to Mason Versluis, founder of crypto community Gold Squad, and Tony JRNY, founder of NFT project JRNY Club, the chances of SHIB reaching its all-time high of $0.00008845 from October 2021 again are slim. At the current price, that means Shiba Inu would have to rise over 930%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Crash Persists Despite Trillions Of SHIB Tokens Being Bought Up Versluis wrote on Twitter, “I am pretty confident $SHIB will never go past all time high again ($0.00008845) What do y’all think?”. Tony replied that there would have to be “some groundbreaking utility and FOMO” for this to happen. Versluis agreed and added: Absolutely. I feel this with Doge too though and that’s scary because I know people bought very high on that one. It would take some ground breaking utility and FOMO — JRNY Crypto (@JRNYcrypto) May 8, 2023 It is important to note that the utility (more than just a meme coin) mentioned by the two crypto experts is currently being developed with ShibaSwap 2.0, Shibarium and the Metaverse. Moreover, numerous applications will perform token burns on Shibarium, thus accelerating the elimination of the huge circulating amount of SHIB. Related Reading: Study: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is More Of A Successful Memecoin Than PEPE and DOGE However, it is not yet known when the launch of Shibarium and the Metaverse will take place. Shibarium is likely to be released later this year, as teased by lead dev Shytoshi Kusama, and could be the catalyst for a furious upward trend. The price will thus depend on new (groundbreaking) use cases.

The miner, which is undergoing one of the most significant mergers in the industry with U.S. Bitcoin Corp, first announced the issues in March.  ""High energy input levels"" into the machines has been causing ""equipment failures"" at Drumheller, while spikes in energy prices have created ""additional headwinds,"" the firm said. Hut 8 has implemented firmware to decrease the voltage of the power supply, while it is trying to repair machines and hire more staff.  Hut 8 did not respond to CoinDesk's request for additional details on the Drumheller mine.  The Drumheller site likely accounts for as much as 0.9 exahash/second (EH/s) of Hut 8's computing power. Total installed hashrate across its two Alberta sites was at 2.6 EH/s at the end of April. The Medicine Hat site in the Canadian state ""hit an all-time operational high"" of 1.72 EH/s in March, the firm previously said.  Hut 8 also had to stop running 8,000 miners at its third site in North Bay, Ontario due to a dispute with its power provider, in mid-November, and move them to Medicine Hat.

42420508,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq8IX,1683628571,Bitcoin Trades at Nearly $650 Premium on Binance.US,"The gap between bitcoin's price in U.S. dollars (BTC/USD) on prominent digital assets exchanges like Binance and Coinbase and the price on Binance's U.S. arm has widened sharply this month, causing unease among crypto commentators on Twitter.  At 09:26 UTC Tuesday, the BTC/USD pair listed on Binance.US traded at a nearly $650 premium to its Coinbase-listed counterpart and to Binance's bitcoin-tether pair (BTC/USDT) – a significant rise from the premium of around $20 seen at the end of April, data from charting platform TradingView show.  According to pseudonymous Twitter-based analyst @fewseethis, the premium on Binance.US likely results from market makers leaving the exchange in anticipation of regulatory action. Market makers are entities tasked with providing liquidity to the order book.  In February, Binance.US came under the radar of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over trading affiliates. One agency official in March said Binance.US was operating an unregistered securities exchange in the U.S.  ""IF there is some sort of gov action against Binance.US incoming AND market makers who usually do business there know about it, THEN it's possible they left and there isn't enough liquidity & possibilities for arbitraging are diminished,"" @fewseethis tweeted.  Binance.US' order book was skewed in favor of bids – buy orders – at press time, according to data from Cryptowatch. That's a sign of weak market depth and an exodus of market makers, according to Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin.  The chart shows the 2.5% market depth on Binance.US, a collection of pending buy and sell orders within 2.5% of the mid-price. The mid-price is the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices. The green line, representing the number of pending buy orders, is higher than the red line, which shows the sell orders.  ""When the liquidity is sufficient, the depth of buy & sell sides is usually constantly changing, but a dynamic balance is maintained. On Binance.US, the order book is imbalanced with significantly more buy orders than sell orders,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""For a giant exchange, such a depth chart is undoubtedly abnormal. Prime market makers are leaving Binance.US, possibly due to regulatory pressure and renewed compliance requirements.""  Moreover, on Monday, tether, the world's largest stablecoin, surged to $1.3 on Binance.US, deviating from its dollar peg. The stablecoin, which is meant to trade in line with the greenback, continued to be priced at a premium early Tuesday.  The reason for tether's appreciation is unclear. Some in the crypto community have held USDT/USD's surge responsible for Binance.US' BTC/USD pair trading at a premium relative to tether-denominated pairs.  In contrast, others, including popular pseudonymous trader Byzantine General and crypto exchange OPNX's market maker Alice, said the premium signifies fiat withdrawal issues at the exchange.  CoinDesk reached out to Binance.US seeking clarification on the matter and was awaiting a response at press time.  ""This USDT premium should be irrelevant if FIAT withdrawals work properly,"" Byzantine General tweeted, asking, ""Can't people just withdraw from Binance.US."" Alice voiced a similar opinion saying, "" It has to be (at some threshold) either a secret USD fee or USD withdrawals not working.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/09/bitcoin-trades-at-nearly-700-premium-on-binanceus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86383d3b1d9857d516e0b9cd1a70127351268bcb-3172x1528.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420500,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq8CL,1683627692,Ether Staking Deposits Top Withdrawals for First Time Since Shapella Upgrade,"Ether (ETH) holders are rushing to stake their tokens with network validators, pushing deposit activity to the highest level since the Shapella upgrade earlier this year.  More than 200,000 ether have been deposited to the network since the start of the week, data from the on-chain analytics tool Nansen show, marking the first time deposits have outpaced withdrawals since Shapella went live last month. The additions bring the number of ether locked for staking purposes to over 19 million tokens – about 15% of the total circulating supply.  The influx comes as traders flock to meme coins such as pepecoin (PEPE), which has strained the Ethereum network and sent transaction fees to a 12-month high.  Over 6 million staked ethers are held on Lido Finance, a protocol that issues depositors with alternative tokens representing the amount they've locked up. Those alternatives can then be used as liquidity in the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  Shappella – a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that occurred simultaneously on April 12 – gave investors the ability to withdraw their staked ether at will for the first time.  In a proof-of-stake blockchain such as Ethereum, users stake, or lock, cryptocurrency – ether in this case – to help secure and confirm new data blocks. These stakers receive network rewards in the form of tokens, creating a form of passive investing strategy.  Platforms such as Lido pay out 6.6% in annualized yield rewards to stakers. More complex strategies involving staked ether and other tokens can yield up to 21%, data from Defillama shows.",POSITIVE,ETH | PEPE,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/09/ether-staking-deposits-top-withdrawals-for-first-time-since-shapella-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a9b2217a66a48f416269858f5a23709a5383a6f-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gas fees, also known as transaction fees, are payments made to miners on the Ethereum network for processing transactions. These fees have been rising steadily over the past few months, reaching record highs in recent days. The situation has left traders and investors concerned about the long-term viability of the Ethereum network, as high fees could discourage users from utilizing the platform. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Whales Accumulate Yet Price Drops – What’s Going On? High Gas Fees On Ethereum Network Despite Transition To PoS Based on a recent report by crypto analytics provider WhaleAlert, a single transaction on the Ethereum network cost a trader approximately $118,600 in fees, which translates to 64 ETH. 💸 A fee of 64 #ETH (119,121 USD) has just been paid for a single transaction!https://t.co/3w4UD0AZbw — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 8, 2023 While high gas fees are not a new phenomenon on Ethereum, they have become relatively rare since the network’s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol through The Merge. This shift was expected to reduce congestion on the network, but the current high gas fees suggest otherwise. Possible Cause: Meme Coin Hype, Network Congestion The recent spike in network activity is said to be a result of the meme coin craze (see chart below), which has created intense network activity, causing congestion during the weekend. This activity reached its peak when Binance, a popular crypto exchange, listed PEPE tokens and Floki Inu for trading on its platform. Source: CoinChartist/TradingView The resultant congestion, coupled with panic selling by whales, has contributed to the soaring prices and may eventually lead to reduced gains for retail traders. Impact On Ethereum Prices Despite a 0.70% dip in the last 24 hours, Ethereum has maintained a steady seven-day rally of nearly a percent, with its current price at $1,849 according to CoinMarketCap. However, high gas fees on the network may negatively affect Ethereum’s long-term prospects and discourage users from utilizing the platform. Source: CoinMarketCap The high gas fees on the Ethereum network could have a significant impact on ETH prices in the long run. If the network congestion persists, users may start looking for alternatives to Ethereum, leading to reduced demand for the cryptocurrency. This could eventually result in lower prices, affecting investor sentiment and leading to a market sell-off. ETHUSD loses grip on the $1,900 handle. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45% Moreover, the current high gas fees may also hinder the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum. DeFi protocols heavily rely on the Ethereum network to execute transactions and provide liquidity, and high gas fees could limit their growth and adoption. This, in turn, could affect the overall demand for ETH and its price. -Featured image from Freepik",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-skyrocket/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12473008.jpeg

12471783,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530612,1683623146,"PEPE, FLOKI, SHIB: Insiders Spill The Beans On Meme Coin Investing","Meme coins are currently the dominating trend on the crypto market once again due to PEPE. After the furious price rallye of PEPE, investors are feverishly looking for the next meme coin that makes 100x. Whether this trend will continue for much longer or if this marks a top for the crypto market remains to be seen. However, historically, the meme coin hype marked local highs for the Bitcoin price (and thus the rest of the market). Whales Reveal All About Meme Coins Like PEPE In a new Twitter thread, Frank Rotman, co-founder QED Investors, spilled the beans about meme coins. QED Investors is a leading VC in the fintech space and has AUM of $3.2 billion. The company has already invested $662 million in startups. So Rotman is well connected and knows what he’s talking about. In recent days, Rotman has spoken with traders who have put anywhere from $500 to more than $20 million into meme coins and “their views are eye-opening,” the venture capitalist says. The biggest insight was (although not shocking): Memes coins are a game. Related Reading: PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45% The concept of the game, according to Rotman, is to attract as many other participants as possible to the list of game participants. “Your goal is to convince people that being on the list is cool.” Once people are on the list, they are expected to tweet funny images or diagrams to generate FOMO for the game. However, the number on the list matters because members can sell new players as much or as little as they want, with prices fluctuating based on supply and demand. Ultimately, this proves that the founders and previous investors are the biggest profiteers from such a Ponzi scheme. Related Reading: PEPE, WOJAK, TURBO Take A Nosedive As Meme Coin Euphoria Dies Down The answers Rotman has received are extremely revealing. Big investors are aware of the game. One anonymous person said: It’s a damn fun game once you’re in it. You get to act like an idiot, annoy everyone around you and make silly money doing it. If it doesn’t work out then you try again. I know it doesn’t make any sense but it feels great when my money is doubling every day. None of Rotman’s respondents believe that meme coins are a “thing of value.” Rather, they know that meme coins are a Ponzi scheme, which is often dismissed as “movement.” Moreover, as PEPE has shown, larger meme coin investors are out there to make a quick buck. Rotman stated: It was obvious that every person I talked to was looking for quick gains. They wanted the dopamine jolt that comes with quick 50-100% movements. The volatility and the potential to 10X+ their money or lose it all quickly was a feature, not a flaw. WAGMI? According to the QED co-founder, smaller investors see meme coins as a chance to live the “we’ll all gonna make it” ethos while whales laugh at it. The goal of the whale traders is to stand behind a token long enough to drive demand and then use FOMO to provide their exit liquidity. The big traders have well-formed views about where demand comes from, when it will come, and who’s going to be left holding the bag in the end. One direct quote was: “If you don’t know where your exit liquidity is going to come from then you’re someone else’s exit liquidity. Nobody wants to hold these s-t coins forever. If you want a nice car you have to get good at hyping people up while you’re dumping. At press time, PEPE appears to have found its top after the Binance listing. PEPE traded 56% below Friday’s all-time high.

42420493,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq857,1683622800,Binance’s NFT Marketplace Adds Support for Bitcoin NFTs,"Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace said Tuesday it’s planning to add support for Ordinals, or Bitcoin NFTs later in May, though an exact date was not announced.  Binance NFT, which already supports NFTs on Ethereum, Polygon and its native BNB Chain, plans to expand its offerings by allowing traders to purchase Ordinals on the Bitcoin network. Collectors can soon buy and sell inscriptions, or NFTs created on the Bitcoin network, expanding the reach of the nascent Ordinals ecosystem.  See Also: Bitcoin NFTs: What Are Ordinal NFTs and How Do You Mint One?  Additionally, in order to help onboard users to Bitcoin NFTs, Binance will allow traders to purchase Bitcoin-based NFTs with their Binance accounts, simplifying the process for users. Instead of having to set up a taproot-compatible Bitcoin wallet to purchase Ordinals, as collectors wanting to mint NFT giant Yuga Labs’ TwelveFold Ordinals needed to do, Binance aims to make the process simple and secure for new buyers to enter the growing market.  Binance Head of Product Mayur Kamat said in a press release that he sees Bitcoin as “the broadest choice” for NFT collectors as well as a growing market for the exchange to tap into.  “Bitcoin is the OG of crypto,” said Kamat. “We believe things are just getting started here and can’t wait to see what the future holds in this space.”  However, Binance’s relationship with Bitcoin hasn’t all been positive in recent days. On Sunday, the exchange paused Bitcoin withdrawals twice, citing network congestion as the catalyst.  As Ordinals reached 3 million inscriptions last week, the demand for marketplaces to embrace Bitcoin NFTs is only intensifying. In March, NFT marketplace Magic Eden added support for Ordinals, integrating Bitcoin wallets Hiro and Xverse to do so. In April, the marketplace rolled out a creator launchpad to help artists mint their inscriptions before listing on the secondary marketplace.

Participants of the network, which is called the Canton Network, include BNP Paribas (BNP), Deloitte, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), Goldman Sachs (GS), Broadridge (BR), S&P Global, and Microsoft (MSFT), among many others.  “The Canton Network is a powerful answer to industry calls for a solution that harnesses the potential of blockchain while preserving fundamental privacy requirements for institutional finance,” Chris Zuehlke, partner at DRW and global head of Cumberland, another participant, said. “This unique approach, coupled with the ability to execute an atomic transaction across multiple smart contracts, is the building block needed to bring these workflows on chain.”  The network connects applications built with Daml, Digital Asset’s smart-contract language, allowing various systems in financial markets to interoperate and synchronize.  “Such solutions are a key building block for future digital and distributed financial market infrastructures,” Jens Hachmeister, head of Issuer services and new digital markets at Deutsche Börse Group said.

On-chain data shows a trader paid over 64 ether (ETH) in fees on Monday to get 84 ether worth of four (FOUR), a newly-issued meme token on the Ethereum blockchain likely based on the Crypto Twitter meme of “4.”  This means that the trader spent over $120,000 to get $156,000 worth of FOUR tokens. However, some sleuths pointed out that the trader was only the second entity to buy FOUR – and is now sitting on an unrealized profit of nearly $240,000.  Data from DEXTools show FOUR tokens have seen $136 million in trading volumes on the first day of trading and have a market capitalization of $30 million as of Tuesday.  As such, further on-chain data shows the top early FOUR buyers are sitting on profits of $240,000 to $2 million – suggesting why traders were ready to pay outrageously large amounts in fees to purchase the tokens.  The current hot ball of money in crypto is hunting for jokes instead of fundamental plays, which has contributed toward extremely large gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain.

42420491,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUq833,1683601974,FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried Moves to Dismiss Most Criminal Charges Against Him,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed pretrial motions to dismiss a majority of the charges he faces late Monday.  Bankman-Fried, who is set to go on trial this fall, faces over a dozen different charges ranging from wire, securities and commodities fraud allegations to bribery claims. The charges were brought across multiple superseding indictments tied to his conduct as former Chief Executive Officer of the Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX, which collapsed dramatically last November, filing for bankruptcy alongside nearly 100 related firms and subsidiaries.  In his pretrial motions, Bankman-Fried's attorneys moved to dismiss charges of conspiring to commit wire fraud on FTX customers; of wire fraud on FTX customers; of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on Alameda Research lenders; of wire fraud on Alameda Research lenders; and of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, on the grounds that prosecutors did not ""state an offense for failure to allege a valid property right.""  They also moved to dismiss the bank fraud conspiracy, unlicensed money transmitter operation, unlawful political contribution and bribery charges on discovery grounds.  A third motion was also filed to dismiss the fraud charges tied to FTX customers and the unlicensed money transmitter charge ""for failure to state an offense.""  A final motion seeks to dismiss the bribery and political contribution charges.  Bankman-Fried's attorneys did not seek to dismiss charges alleging conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lead attorney, had previously hinted at the motions to dismiss during an arraignment, telling the court that his client ""is not acknowledging that he can be tried"" on the charges brought after the extradition. Bankman-Fried pleaded ""not guilty"" to other charges brought across previous indictments.  In a memorandum of law supporting the motions, Bankman-Fried's attorneys wrote that he had agreed to extradition based on a list of charges which did not include some of the charges later brought against him.  Part of the argument is that under the terms of the extradition treaty between the Bahamas and the U.S., the Bahamas needs to ""consent"" to the charges brought after the extradition, and the Bahamas – where Bankman-Fried resided at the time of his arrest – could not consent without additional information that has not been provided.  Other memoranda of law lay out additional arguments for Bankman-Fried's motions for dismissal, which include claims that FTX did not need to register as a money transmitter and that some of the laws Bankman-Fried is being charged under don't apply as FTX is based outside the U.S.  Another filing asks for additional discovery documents on the basis that FTX ""should be considered part of the 'prosecution team,'"" citing FTX's cooperation with the Department of Justice.  ""The FTX Debtors and their outside counsel continue to make extraordinary efforts to help the prosecution that go far beyond mere cooperation with a criminal investigation,"" the filing said.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/09/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-moves-to-dismiss-most-criminal-charges-against-him,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44e1de1d80b90632a2fe638186d4de6fd808c947-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initiative is among the latest developments among crypto industry firms to provide steady returns during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. It aims to give investors exposure to gold and digital assets, two assets that hold their value.  “This hybrid asset product is a perfect fit for investors that have experience in traditional assets such as gold and are now starting to dip their toes into digital assets,” OrBit Markets said in a press release.  The derivative product, XAUT, is a gold-backed token issued by Tether. At maturity, the product will be settled in either USDT, XAUT or bitcoin as designated by OrBit, the Singapore-based company said.  In its statement, OrBit noted that traditional financial service firms (TradFi) commonly offer hybrid products, including those combining stocks and commodity assets.  The company said that investors “anticipating a sustained rally” in these two “safe haven” assets have risen amid growing concerns about the U.S. central bank’s hawkish monetary policy and resulting turmoil in the banking sector.  “It's a dual option on both BTC and XAUT,” OrBit said, adding that investors could express “various sophisticated views” on bitcoin and the XAU token, including increases or decreases in returns for both, or if returns for one of the assets climbs but fall for the other.  The ""worst-of put option"" allows investors to earn an enhanced yield if both assets appreciate. On the flip side, investors may be ""put"" into the worst performer should either asset fall, the liquidity provider said.  In March, DeFi-focused asset management company MEV Capital used OrBit markets-issued options contracts to hedge liquidity providers’ positions and prevent losses in Uniswap (v3) liquidity pools.  “OrBit aims to offer flexible solutions to our counterparties,” Pulkit Goyal, OrBit Markets VP of Trading adding that “OrBit plans to launch further hybrid products dedicated to institutional investors.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/09/crypto-options-liquidity-provider-orbit-markets-offers-bitcoin-and-gold-hybrid-derivative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ce1c644d94851288dacaddc2dabab8b9cc70a9d-5323x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and Ether prices are down due to BRC-20 meme coins congestion, with a potential solution being a shift of profits to altcoins and Ethereum.

Bitcoin is beginning the East Asia trading day down 2.6% at $27,715, while Ether is down 1.4% to $1,850.  The Bitcoin network’s Ordinal-induced congestion is to blame, which caused Binance to suspend withdrawals twice over the weekend.  ""What's going on right now in bitcoin is, is quite unprecedented. And we haven't really seen this for many, many years,"" 21Co co-founder and CEO Hany Rashwan said during a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV.  Like others, Rashwan blamed BRC-20 meme coins, but also said that we shouldn’t conflate these with altcoins.  ""I wouldn't categorize meme coins in the same league as altcoins like Ethereum or Solana,” he said. “These altcoins are essentially smart contract platforms that facilitate a range of functions, including but not limited to meme coins and NFTs.""  Rashwan sees a way out of the congestion which involves meme coin holders taking profits and moving to altcoins and Ethereum, which in turn could lead to those coins increasing in value as well.  But it will take another large macroeconomic event to kick off this move. And for now, we are stuck with Bitcoin NFTs of PEPE.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −13.8% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA −10.4% Entertainment Decentraland MANA −6.9% Entertainment  Insights  Bitcoin's Not-So Straight Path  The meme pool-spurred congestion on Binance and bitcoin’s hefty decline are “growing pains,” but the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization “will be fine in the long run,” Paul Eisma, head of trading for XBTO Group, told CoinDesk’s “All About Bitcoin” program on Monday.  “It's almost like a deer in headlights for the bitcoin protocol,” Eisma said, linking the latest technical problems to the late 2021 Taproot upgrade, which boosted the bitcoin network’s privacy, among other improvements.  But Eisma said optimistically that bitcoin has remained in a range roughly between $25,000 and $30,000 for much of this year. He said that crypto is still in its formative years, so understandably subject to the same headwinds that have afflicted other early-stage technologies throughout history.  “Like any young and growing, nascent technology that gets upgrades and modifications, this is part of it,” Eisma said. “This is part of the growth and evolution of the network, and the path is not straight.  Eisma said that he will be eyeing Wednesday’s release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) for a sense of the U.S. central bank’s next privacy move. The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates 25 basis points (bps) three consecutive times, but observers of monetary policy, particularly those critical of the Fed, are hoping for a cessation of the bank’s hawkishness.  “What asset markets are looking for is something not too strong or too weak because if something comes in and around, like, I don't know, plus, or minus, you know, some decent, low standard deviation of what's expected, then (it’s) still too early for a pause to rate decreases,” he said. But he added warily that the current inflation rate is still above “the 2% level the Fed is seeking. It's still about the core PCE level that they're seeking as well. So, you know, Powell has been clear that he's going to keep rates at this level for longer than the market is implying.”  Important events.
