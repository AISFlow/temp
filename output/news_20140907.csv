42426014,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhuxh,1410123005,More Companies Are Paying Employees in Bitcoin,"ing bitcoin from exchanges can involve lots of hoop-jumping, as customers navigate complex and tedious registration and transaction processes. Some people are now cutting through the whole tangled mess, and having their employers pay them in bitcoin directly.  Canadian firm Wagepoint has been helping companies do this north of the border. Wagepoint, a startup based in Waterloo and Nova Scotia, Canada, offers Canadian and US companies an easy way to process payroll online.  The firm handles payroll deductions for tax purposes and files all the necessary paperwork electronically. It has processed $120m in payroll payments using traditional fiat currency, but now, a growing percentage of customers are taking advantage of its bitcoin payment services, says CEO Shrad Rao.  Rao explained that the firm was interested in bitcoin and pulled the service together quickly, saying:  “We started it in November 2013. It was a side project.”  “We didn’t imagine we’d get any uptake,” said the CEO, and initially he was right.  Nothing happened during November and December, but then, in January this year, he received his first bitcoin request from a customer, which paid out $2,000 worth of bitcoin in salaries.  Since then, the firm has paid $75,000 in bitcoin on behalf of its customers.  How bitcoin payroll works  Wagepoint makes it as easy as possible for companies to make payments in cryptocurrency. Customers don’t have to handle bitcoin at all. Instead, Wagepoint takes its fiat currency and handles the convergence for them.  In Canada, it uses CAVIRTEX for the exchange. In the US, its deal with Buttercoin now has $1.3m in funding from people including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Buttercoin is still in stealth mode.  Perhaps predictably, tech firms are at the front of the queue when it comes to paying their employees in bitcoin. Structur3D Printing, based in Kitchener, Ontario, produces a system for extruding paste that can be used in 3D printing.  Co-founder and president Charles Mire is targeting everything from cake makers and chocolatiers through to hobbyist ‘makers’ with the product, which can handle everything from silicone to cake icing.  Mire doesn’t take bitcoin payments from the company, but his co-founder and director of research and development Andrew Finkle gets 10% of his salary this way.  He said:  “Andrew was in bitcoin from the beginning, and so Wagepoint’s ability to pay in bitcoin was attractive to my cofounder.”  Taxes  There aren’t many financial benefits to a company paying employees in bitcoin, but there may be recruitment benefits, Mire said. After all, technology employees often have plenty of love for bitcoin, and good skills are hard to find, especially in Mire’s industry sector.  “The more we use it, the more we realise that it’s a nice incentive to recruit people in the tech space,” he said.  For example, the company hired a contractor last summer who handled business development for the firm’s Kickstarter campaign. He also had a mathematics and engineering background, which gave him the specialist skills for the job. Structur3D paid him in bitcoin, too.  “Andrew and I are materials scientists but we have a background in applying that to 3D printing,” he said, explaining that he did his PhD on Australia. “When I came to Canada I was amazed that it wasn’t that widespread.”  Around ten companies including Vancouver-based Bench, and Toronto-based RateHub are using the bitcoin payment option, said Wagepoint staff. 80% of the employees taking the bitcoin payment option collect 100% of their net pay in bitcoin.  Employees who decide to take bitcoin payments will need to be diligent, though. Ryan Lazanis, of Montreal-based Xen Accounting, said that they will probably face capital gains issues.  Xen Accounting specialises in virtual currency tax advice. It numbers Bylls among its clients.  Employee payroll deductions happen in fiat, before the employees are paid their bitcoins, meaning that they will be paid their net salary in bitcoins, Lazanis explained.  The problem is that the Canadian government doesn’t recognise bitcoin as currency. It is an asset, instead, and the little guidance issued by the Canadian Revenue Agency suggests that people account for it as a bartered good.  The tax rules mean that employees will account for bitcoin salary payments as bartered exchange for their services, he explained.  The sticky part is that employees must pay tax on any gains that they make with it, warned Lazanis.  A bitcoin might be worth $500 when a company pays it to an employee, and $600 nine months later, when he or she comes to spend it. That difference is taxable, he suggested – and the most likely tax to be imposed would be capital gains.  Lazanis recommended that employees use a spreadsheet to keep records of their bitcoin value, both at acquisition and when they spend it, saying:  “You need to track your cost base, and most businesses aren’t even doing that. So there are difficulties there.”  Bitcoin may therefore not be the best form of payment for an employees living from pay cheque to pay cheque and using them frequently for transactions. They would have to account for lots of losses and gains throughout a month.  Bitcoin payments would be more workable for employees treating the payment in bitcoin as a longer-term investment.  Mire likened it to payment in stocks, which would sit in an employee’s portfolio for a significant time before he cashed out, saying:  “If you liquidate it it becomes a management burden for personal finances. But as long as you’re not cashing out stocks daily, the overall personal finance maintenance isn’t that high an overhead.”  Will more tech firms flock to bitcoin payments as an option? It’s a delightful thought, but where it does happen, we imagine it’ll be used as an innovative means of making long-term savings, rather than for weekly groceries.

42426011,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhurh,1410118256,It's Time for Bitcoin Companies to Give Back,"In the busy world of bitcoin, commercial development is increasing at an incredible pace. It’s inspiring and encouraging to watch, but something is missing.  As more companies build business on top of this amazing technology, hardly any of them are giving back, or helping to develop the core technology underpinning bitcoin itself.  Right now, we’re in the second stage of bitcoin’s development. The first was the creation of the core protocol, and the technical infrastructure that runs it. Satoshi Nakamoto delivered the core principles underlying bitcoin, and then the core developers honed and refined it. As we speak, they’re rewriting large swathes of it, to make it more robust and reliable.  While they work on that, we’re seeing unprecedented levels of innovation from businesses that are basing services on the bitcoin protocol. We’re seeing everything from basic payroll and bill payment services, through to coloured coins, crowdsale platforms, and even services designed to let you sign documents directly on the block chain.  Building services like these on top of the protocol and network is crucial for the development of a healthy ecosystem. These services are what will make bitcoin a relevant and powerful part of the economy. They increase liquidity, and usability. Without them, it would be little more than an intellectual exercise.  Making a buck from the block chain  These companies may be furthering the crypto currency concept, but nothing happens for free. Cryptocurrency services companies aren’t altruists. They want to make a buck from the block chain, and so do their investors. The bitcoin community is getting richer, as business models and investment opportunities begin to mature. CoinDesk’s latest State of Bitcoin report reveals that the bitcoin market received $200m in venture capital investment in the 12 months to June this year. That compares to just $17.1m in the year before that, meaning that investment has increased 12-fold.  The number of VC-backed start-ups in the bitcoin space stood at 48 in June, up from just seven the year before. Clearly, companies and investors are waking up to the potential for this exciting technology.  Time to give back?  There’s nothing wrong with free enterprise, but what about the team of developers that continue to refine and hone that protocol? For the most part, the core developers are doing this without any help from those companies, even as they use the protocol and the block chain for their own gain. Only a couple of these developers are paid for what they do. Most of them volunteer their spare time, while maintaining other jobs.  Shouldn’t these companies, with their combined millions of dollars in funding, be getting more involved in core protocol development? If each of them gave just a few hours a week of their developers’ valuable expertise, the open source project that lies at the heart of the network’s success would be much better for it. Payments processor BitPay is one of the few that takes on this challenge, employing a core developer on its team.  The problem is that giving back to core development in this way doesn’t create direct financial value for companies, whereas piling development resources into their own applications does. It’s a variation on the tragedy of the commons: if everyone focuses on their own interests, then the community ultimately suffers.  Currently, this may not seem like much of a problem. Sure, the core developers occasionally complain, although the protocol is resilient enough to support the growing bitcoin services sector, for now. Yet, there are already concerns that the development of core bitcoin is slowing, due to a resources bottleneck.  What kind of help is needed?  We’re not necessarily talking about new features here. The developers of the core protocol have traditionally been conservative, unwilling to make too many drastic changes to the bitcoin protocol, and core members of the team tell CoinDesk that they’d be happy in some cases for commercial developments to leapfrog projects traditionally handled by the core team. So perhaps some services are best left to others, who will add them as a layer above the protocol.  Those companies that do help with bitcoin’s development must offer the right kind of help. Simply pitching in to develop a new feature and then dropping out isn’t enough, because this just creates a larger feature base for longer-term members of the development team to support. A cute, fluffy new feature isn’t just for Christmas.  What’s needed is a longer-term commitment from bitcoin services companies as a community, to help with the mundane, difficult tasks faced by the bitcoin protocol developers: software testing and maintenance of existing features. That may not be the sexiest work, and it may not be profit-generating, but it’s good for the protocol, and therefore for the community.  That’s what should happen, in an ideal world, where dirty, real-world considerations such as staffing constraints and urgent customer feature requests don’t get in the way. The question is, do the increasing number of well-funded cryptocurrency companies have the sense of responsibility to step up?  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42426042,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhvLh,1410097533,Mining Roundup: New Viper Tests and Bitmain's Debut Cloud Mining Service,"September is here, bringing cold air to many parts of the world that play home to bitcoin mines on both the hobby and industrial scale. If you’re a home rig operator, you’re no doubt looking forward to the day when you can turn down the air conditioning and let some of that cool fall air inside.  This week’s roundup takes a look at several corners of the mining community, from inside the new rig of a solar power-producing hobbyist to inside Bitmain’s manufacturing facility.  Alpha Technology releases update on Viper  The long-awaited Viper scrypt miner has reportedly moved closer to completion, according to a new development update from Alpha Technology.  According to the 2nd September blog post on the company’s official site, the ASICs are now undergoing thermal tests and simulations. The development team also released diagrams of the updated enclosure, which the company previously said was being reimagined.  The team added that it expects to begin shipping the Viper later this month, saying that it is trying to speed up the process in order to begin making deliveries. The company has come under fire in recent months for the Viper delays, and earlier this summer announced that issues related to PayPal had disrupted development.  The team said in the post:  “We are now mostly just waiting for the ASIC to arrive so that the final testing and assembly can be done; we will be paying extra to have every aspect of this next stage expedited and we expect shipping to commence sometime in the latter half of September.”  The Viper has seen several design changes over the course of its development arc, a process that has been both praised and decried by the mining community. CoinDesk will continue monitoring the Viper’s development and provide an update when a delivery date has been formally set.  Bitmain debuts cloud mining service  China-based mining hardware maker Bitmain has become the latest company to offer a cloud mining service.  As originally reported by Bitell, the company has launched Hashnest.com, a new platform for cloud mining bitcoins. According to the company’s post on the Bitcoin Talk forum, the move is part of a broader effort to support decentralization in the mining network.  The company noted:  “In the future, most of the mining rigs will be deployed in specialized hosting farms, enterprising and professional teams will help to search the low cost energy and maintenance for the rigs. However, we still need to keep decentralization in this centralization trend. It is sure harmful and dangerous to the bitcoin industry and the eco-system if the majority of hashing power are controlled by a handful of people.”  The official website allows users to pay by the gigahash in bitcoin directly, costing roughly 0.00135 BTC, or about $0.63 at today’s prices. This compares favorably to other offerings on the market, which can range as high as $1.50 per gigahash.  Spondoolies Tech to open pre-orders for new miner  Israel-based mining hardware maker Spondoolies Tech is putting a new mining product to market. The SP20 continues a trend seen among many hardware makers: the manufacturing of bigger units better suited for a data center than a home hobby rig.  According to the company, the SP20 will be capable of producing an estimated 1.7 TH/s. Power-wise, it is expected to draw 1,100 watts at the wall. It will be available for pre-order next week, Spondoolies said.  In a recent conversation with CoinDesk, Spondoolies CEO Guy Corem noted that the move to data centers is good for the industry, but that companies need to do their part in contributing to the goal of a truly decentralized network of miners.  Corem said:  “We fight for the small guys. Small, capable miners. That’s what we’re trying to do and we support them.”  A look inside Bitmain’s factory  Ever wanted to see what it looks like inside a state-of-the-art bitcoin manufacturing plant? Chinese-language bitcoin news site BTCSide.com recently published a series of photos from inside Bitmain’s factory, offering a glimpse into one of the busiest manufacturers in the world.  The picture above shows what BTCSide calls the “aging room”, where units are tested and readied for shipment. Other pictures contained in the gallery show the company’s maintenance room where workers take apart, program and reconfigure the hardware.  The power needs of a facility like this are tremendous. As the photos demonstrate, Bitmain’s facility – like every other data center-based bitcoin company – is built to handle copious amounts of energy.  Hobby mining journal debuts  Given the fact that bitcoin mining’s shift toward industrial-scale operations is well underway, it’s not often that you hear about people starting home rigs. But a new hobby journal begun on Bitcoin Talk suggests that the pursuit of bitcoins is still alive and well among entrepreneurial individuals.  Forum user Sakarias-Corporation wrote in a 27th August post that he had invested $1,000 in 10 Antminer S1 units as well as a number of different power source units. The response to the hobby miner’s efforts has been mostly positive, with several users offering advice on how he can maximize his investment.  The owner of the home rig said he and his neighbors operate a small wind and solar farm, selling excess power produced back to their local electric company. Given that cheap resources are required to make any bitcoin mine profitable, the hobbyist was able to remove a key hurdle to getting his project off the ground.  He said:  “I have enough spare power to supply around 800 S1s maybe, and I could always buy a wind turbine. Dispensing heat won't be a problem, I have a whole room which I will design to do one thing and one thing only, to keep all the miners cooled, of course it will cost a lost, but I'm already down to -23C (without all the fans).”  Looking ahead, the hobby miner said that he hopes to buy more S1s or, in the future, a fleet of S3s to build out his mine.

42426039,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhvJh,1410083145,Bitcoin Voucher Startups Aim to Help Africa's Unbanked,"British bitcoin voucher service Azteco and South African startup Xoin have separately launched services designed for one potentially huge emerging market; namely, the unbanked populations of Africa.  Azteco  , which claims it is ""the easiest way to buy bitcoins"", has announced that it is in the final stage of development of its voucher product and is already accepting applications from prospective vendors.  Xoin is also introducing prepaid bitcoin vouchers that allow customers to buy bitcoins with cash.  Both services are designed to appeal to unbanked and underbanked markets, with an emphasis on e-commerce and remittances in Africa.  ""Buying bitcoin is unnecessarily hard,"" saif Azteco founder Akin Fernandez. ""We solve this problem with a simple, fast and elegant solution, that's easy for users and easy for vendors.”  World changer  Azteco's vouchers are bought over the counter for cash and can be redeemed with any bitcoin address. Additionally, they are simple for vendors to dispense, requiring just a computer, web access and a printer, removing the need for any specialised equipment.  ""Bitcoin is set to change the way people send money globally,"" Fernandez continued, ""and this will be especially powerful and transforming for the third-world diaspora, eliminating the financial network access problems that plague the unbanked, helping them to break out of the poverty cycle.""  Fernandez argued that what he calls the “bitcoin wave” started with retailer adoption, and saw many bitcoin users chasing a handful of retailers willing to accept the cryptocurrency. While adoption is increasing, Fernandez said he still sees a problem with bringing bitcoin to the masses, explaining:  ""Currently, getting bitcoin is still hard. Azteco makes it very easy, and it is also very fast. There are no unnecessary interrupting steps in Azteco. Using bitcoin is no more difficult than sending a text message from your mobile phone. Everyone would laugh at the idea of a centralized text messaging service where you have to manually log in to send a text; Azteco goes one step further, removing the need for a mobile phone altogether.""  'Password fatigue'  Fernandez pointed out that many of the world’s 2.2 billion unbanked people do not have a smartphone, yet they need a way to access the latest payments technologies and employ them in e-commerce markets.  People are impatient, he added. Azteco noticed that people were not concerned about not having to sign up and even liked that they don't have to, according to the founder.  ""There is a lot of username and password fatigue out there, and we tap into this animus by not requiring it,"" he said.  He added:  ""Fees are 4%, and we are very fast – 60 seconds on average – and we're getting faster. There is no sign up, no waiting period, and no customer verification. You pay for your voucher and get your bitcoin immediately, just like topping up a 'pay as you go' mobile phone.""  The company, which opened London’s first bitcoin voucher shop last February, said potential vendors can rest assured that they are not exposed to any risk.  ""Our vendors are protected by a three-way agreement where top London law firm Keystone Law holds the vendor bonds securely. These bonds are 100% returnable to the vendor. Rather than spend thousands on an ATM, our vendors can use that money immediately to start selling bitcoin across all their sites, simultaneously, risk free,"" Fernandez said.  African remittances  Xoinis taking a similar approach, making bitcoin available through prepaid vouchers and gift cards, but specifically targetting young South Africans.  “The unbanked markets, especially teenagers with mobile phones in Africa, are entirely excluded from e-commerce,"" Xoin co-founder Helghardt Avenant told Venture Burn. ""Bitcoin makes e-commerce more accessible to these markets, especially when it comes to virtual goods.”  Xoin said that its service was designed for new bitcoin users. The service includes a pre-loaded wallet with the face value of each voucher.  The vouchers can be purchased from merchants using cash. Customers then scan the code using a smartphone and redeem their bitcoins. The service uses the South African BitX exchange and its real-time exchange rate. For the time being, it is web-based only.  Xoin said that its service enables all vendors to become bitcoin ATMs at a much lower cost than currently available ATMs. The team demonstrated the functionality by setting up a doughnut shop in the street.  Avenant told CoinDesk that the Xoin team is trying to solve a glaring problem for bitcoin: limited accessibility for the unbanked population.  He also said the company is not charging any fees for the time being and meets regularly with its merchants for feedback, adding:  ""The local merchants on Stellenbosch campus have agreed to take part in the experimental phase and are currently selling Xoin prepaid bitcoin without earning commission. In the future we will charge a fee of 7%. The reseller earns 4% commission. The exchange takes 1% and Xoin takes 1%. The remaining 1% goes to the actual printing cost.""  The self-funded company was launched by Stellenbosch University postgraduates, and hopes to use the campus to exercise its word-of-mouth marketing.  “Students come from all over the country,"" said Avenant. ""We hope that they do the work to spread the word of Xoin when they return to their homes.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/07/bitcoin-voucher-startups-aim-to-help-africas-unbanked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/157df17614559ab64f99c73866297447f9cc8a1a-1333x825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
