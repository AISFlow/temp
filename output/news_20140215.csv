42425447,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rVh,1392499894,"BitPay Unveils Bitcore, its New Open-Source Project for App Developers","Atlanta, Georgia-based bitcoin processor BitPay has announced the beta launch of Bitcore, a new open-source project that it says will allow app developers to more easily build projects on the bitcoin network.  Bitcore represents a break from BitPay’s processor plugins, as the JavaScript library is designed not for merchants, but to encourage ""more developers to build software that interfaces directly with the real bitcoin network”.  BitPay broke the news via blog post, stating:  “At BitPay, we believe that developers contemplating new Bitcoin projects should not have to resort to using proprietary APIs hosted on services running closed software.”  So far, BitPay suggested that Bitcore is already being used on several projects, but that it should be considered a beta version as it has not completed a third-party code review.  Despite the launch on 14th February, Bitcore is far from new. It has been in use internally at BitPay for the past year, and has already resulted in apps such the block chain explorer Insight.    Launching Bitcore! http://t.co/hBKoNDVcnI Open source that makes it easier to build things that interact w/ the real Bitcoin network.      — BitPay (@bitpay) February 14, 2014    Community feedback  Following the announcement, bitcoin representatives Eric Martindale and Jeff Garzik took to reddit to answer user questions, both technical and strategic, about the launch.  Reaction was generally positive, with many lauding Bitcore as a move that is in keeping with the virtual currency’s decentralized roots.  Reddit user 100acrewood said:  “As a node.js developer, I've been trying to find something this well done for a long time (and was slowly scrapping together my own). My weekend is going to be ruined now since I'll be playing with this non stop, so thanks a lot!”  Technical details  Bitcore is designed to run in two ways, server side on node.js, or client side in a web browser, the blog post said. Further, it was the result of an internal fork of Stefan Thomas’ bitcoinsjs project.  The company explained:  “We’ve decided to open source that fork and put some effort into ensuring that it had sufficient capability out of the box to attract developers to start using it. We felt we needed an initial project that uses the bitcore stack to ensure it was indeed useful for real projects from day one.”  If the reddit response is any indication, the idea appears to be a timely one for the community, as several posts suggested similar projects were currently in the works by different developers.  Martindale seemed open to working with these community members to fight fragmentation, responding to genjix with an invite for further discussion.  Big picture  While BitPay is optimistic about Bitcore, the true test of the platform will be how much interaction it receives from the community. For example, BitPay noted that Bitcore still needs “developer love”, and that users should be vigilant for ways to fix bugs, optimize code and otherwise contribute to a better development platform.  Said the release:  “We have several other bitcore projects already underway, including tools that help you manage key storage, multi-signature workflows, a JavaScript roller for browsers and much more.”  Martindale suggested that Bitcore could have additional implications for the bitcoin community.  In response to one reddit question, Martindale stated that Bitcore would allow the company to develop projects related to escrow services, though he didn’t elaborate on any larger plans.

42425439,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rBh,1392488060,"68% of Mt. Gox Users Still Awaiting Their Funds, Survey Reveals","A CoinDesk poll of nearly 3,000 readers has found that Mt. Gox customers have been waiting months for their withdrawal requests to be fulfilled, despite being ‘verified’ or ‘trusted’ account holders. Poll respondents describe frustration with the exchange’s customer service, calling it slow, opaque and providing “canned responses”.  The poll, launched on 4th Feb, discovered that customer requests were long delayed, whether they were in bitcoin or fiat currency.  One incensed customer was Daniel Smith of Stoke-on-Trent, England. He contacted CoinDesk in December to report his frustration with the exchange’s customer service.  Smith does not have a verified account with the exchange, although he still managed to deposit bitcoin to his account there. Because of this unverified account status, his recent attempts to withdraw his currency have been unsuccessful.  After opening several customer service tickets spanning dozens of messages, Smith’s tickets were eventually merged and closed. At a loss, Smith made a legal statement with Staffordshire police that he said was being passed on to the “fraud division” to deal with the “theft” of his bitcoin.  Smith is also in contact with a lawyer in Japan to explore legal action. In January, he reported that his account had been “blocked” as was his log-in for customer service tickets. “I cannot receive help requests or log into my account […] Essentially they have taken my bitcoin and have told me to fk [sic] off,” he said.  Breakdown of withdrawal stats  Yet, it appears that Smith isn't alone. Of the 1,434 readers who responded to the question of whether they were able to successfully withdraw funds from the exchange, slightly less than a third (31.59%) reported successful withdrawals, while 68% said they were still waiting for their funds.  Customers with successful withdrawals were also likely to receive their money quickly. Of the successful withdrawals, nearly half said they received their funds in under a week. About 46% reported receiving their funds within three months. Very few successful respondents – about 4% – said they received their funds more than three months after making the initial withdrawal request.  But for the customers who still haven’t seen their funds, waiting times could stretch for months. Among respondents who were still waiting for their funds (30% of unsuccessful respondents), the median waiting time was between one to three months. Some 21% had been waiting for three months or more, while about 48% had been waiting for less than a month.  What were the factors that affected successful withdrawal rates? When we filtered the poll results for respondents who had ‘verified’ or ‘trusted’ accounts with Mt. Gox (ie they had submitted identification documents and been approved by the exchange) around 69% were still waiting for their funds.  This is in line with the overall proportion of respondents with unsuccessful withdrawal requests. So, it appears that verification did little to improve their chances.  Respondents trying to withdraw BTC from the exchange appeared to improve their chances of success.  Successful respondents increased by about 6% for BTC withdrawals. But withdrawals in fiat currency (defined here as US dollars, euros, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen) reduced the chances of a successful withdrawal by about 3%.  Some instant withdrawals  However, some respondents did report smooth withdrawal transactions at Mt. Gox.  Some 11 individuals who responded with descriptions of their transactions at the exchange described the withdrawal process as “instant” or completed within days. All these respondents had made bitcoin withdrawals.  Nevertheless, even among this group of successful respondents, there were hiccups. One individual reported withdrawing 100 BTC in early February that arrived in his wallet outside Mt. Gox “instantly”. However, two days later, a withdrawal request for an identical amount of bitcoin did not appear.  Another respondent reported a similar experience, withdrawing 14 BTC in mid-January which was transferred instantly, but then failing to receive a transfer of 1.405 BTC that was withdrawn in the first week of February.  The amount was refunded to his Mt. Gox account four days after a support ticket was created. The respondent then made a withdrawal request again and the amount was instantly transferred outside the exchange.  “Very glad to have got the BTC back and would like a detailed, transparent explanation of the problems they’ve been having,” he wrote.  Support-ticket frustration  Respondents were most frustrated with the way Mt. Gox had handled their support tickets. Several users voiced their suspicion that the exchange was using generic, automated responses to mollify angry customers. One respondent noted:  “Tried to withdraw BTC and failed, never showed up in my wallet. Opened a support ticket, after a week, they send me a message apologising for the long wait times […] they were completely non-responsive to the issue and my questions. I think it was some sort of robot auto-responder designed to make people give up, go away, and abandon their bitcoins at Mt. Gox. Not acceptable!”  Another respondent who tried to withdraw 4.5 BTC complained that his support ticket didn’t get a response from the Tokyo-based exchange. Additionally, he was unable to contact a customer service representative through the exchange’s live chat feature:  “Zero response from Mt. Gox. There is never an available ‘online agent’. I logged a support ticket when I noticed [my transaction] was not in the block chain.”  The 5% queue-cutting fee  Of the 569 respondents who wrote up descriptions of their Mt. Gox experience, eight mentioned that the exchange had offered to speed up the processing of their withdrawal requests for a fee of 5% of the transaction amount. Mt. Gox’s FAQ for withdrawals and deposits does not mention a 5% fee for quicker withdrawals.  One respondent wrote that his experience with Mt. Gox was “completely maddening”, having taken him three months to withdraw fiat currency. According to the respondent, the exchange offered to move him to the head of its transaction queue if he paid a fee of 5% on top of his withdrawal amount. The respondent was attempting to withdraw $200,000.  “Their support responses were full of false promises that the withdrawal would be processed ‘shortly’ due to vague ‘delays’ and ‘issues’.”  Another respondent, who attempted to withdraw $44,000 and 1,951 BTC on two occasions, was also given the option of paying the 5% fee to speed up the withdrawal process:  “Mt. Gox has become a nightmare. To receive timely support requests from them is like performing major surgery on oneself […] they delayed over five weeks on USD withdrawal requests without explanation, only ‘offering’ me to pay a 5% fee to ‘expedite’ the procedure,” the respondent wrote.  Combatting opacity  The major complaint that customers had about the exchange was its transparency, or lack of it.  Many respondents didn't know if their withdrawals were being processed, how long it would take or how much it would cost to ultimately receive their funds. Customer service tickets were routinely closed before problems were resolved, and many people had trouble getting hold of 'live' agents.  In the wake of the recent DDoS attacks and withdrawal delays, the backlash to Mt. Gox has stepped up a gear, with angry customers moving from online forums to live demos and petitions demanding greater transparency from the exchange.  Although Mt. Gox has been confronted several times, the exchange is yet to publicly address the reason behind the long delays.

42425443,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rNh,1392470117,Digital Currencies Gaining Popularity in India's Major Cities,"Last weekend in Mumbai, digital currency enthusiast Vishal Gupta gave out free dogecoin to the 45 participants that showed up to his monthly meet-up.  At least half of the attendees at this event were fresh faces, just getting introduced to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  “The point of giving out free dogecoin is to get people comfortable with the idea of using digital currency,” said Gupta.  This event was organised by BitterCo.in, Gupta’s news and analysis website. It was held at Kolonial, Mumbai’s first restaurant to accept bitcoin.  The restaurant's owner Tarun Thadani was also in attendance. He said he has received about 10 bitcoin payments so far, though all of these had taken place during these meet-ups. Thadani said:  “The bitcoin meet-ups started taking place at my restaurant in the private area in the back. So, I got to know all these people and they are the ones who asked if they could pay in bitcoin for their meals and I started accepting it. But, at the moment, I accept them in my personal wallet and settle with my restaurant later.”  Thadani even makes a special menu for these social events with prices in INR and bitcoin, side by side. However, the next Mumbai meet-up may not fit in his party room as Gupta is expecting over 120 people.  Bangalore leads the bunch  Meanwhile, Bangalore already has two meet-up groups with over 500 active members. One of the groups, the Bangalore Bitcoin Creativity Crew also met last weekend. It was organised by Benson Samuel, an early adopter of bitcoin in India.  “Across India I do believe that we have crossed over 1,000 members who regularly attend the meet-ups,” said Samuel. “Step one in the direction that I am pushing is to start meet-ups in as many cities in India as possible.”  At this particular event, held at the Centre for Internet and Society in Bangalore’s vibrant Indira Nagar neighbourhood, the key speaker was Aaron Koenig. Koenig is a film producer and director who also organises Bitcoin Exchange Berlin. He recognises that a diverse group of people come to these meet-ups, and he has a plan to keep all of them entertained.  Before his presentation, Koenig said:  “I will use some of the films we have produced because many of our customers happen to be bitcoin startups. So I’ll show some films: one’s about mining, one is about coloured coins. I’ll mix the talk so that for the beginners of bitcoin its interesting and also for those who about it on a basic level.”  The other meet-up group in India’s Silicon Valley is organised by Vikram Nikkam and Sathvik Vishwanath. The duo also run Unocoin, India’s bitcoin exchange.  India's individual struggle  Nikkam discusses various problems with initially introducing bitcoin to India, an important one being the fact that India was relatively unaffected by the 2008 financial crisis:  “India did not see the recession. So Indians really don’t understand what happens in terms of monetary systems and how our money is being controlled. In Western countries like the US and the UK, people have seen the recession. Europe has seen the recession big time. So they embrace bitcoin in a different way. They understand that bitcoin is a revolutionary currency.”  Nikkam also spearheaded the first Global Bitcoin Conference held in Bangalore on December 14-15th, 2013. He invited financial bodies, businesses and even the Reserve Bank of India to this meeting.  The organisers felt a need to continue the momentum of the conference. That was one of the reasons why they started the Bitcoin Alliance of India. Natasha Ambrose, a founding member, explains more:  “We wanted to help India as a whole understand the technology [of bitcoin]. We wanted to help the RBI, government officials, politicians understand it because we figured out that if India kind of missed the bandwagon at the moment, it was going to miss it forever. So we wanted to form a body, which is the Bitcoin Alliance of India, to help regulators and financial authorities understand bitcoin and help business around the country set up shop.”  There are two chapters of the Bitcoin Alliance of India at the moment, with the Mumbai group being led by Gupta.  “In India, there is a lot of public energy underground but in India, people are a bit more cautious with their money,” said Gupta. “Also here in India we have a tendency to look to the other guy before we make an investment. So, I think what is really happening is that people really want to do it, but they are looking at each other.”  While it will take some time for most Indians to open up to bitcoin, meet-ups and social events in major cities are helping keep the bitcoin buzz alive for now.

42425438,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rFh,1392462952,Mt. Gox Announces Downtime for Bitcoin Deposits,"Mt. Gox has stopped bitcoin deposits and all internal bitcoin transfers for a short site maintenance update, roughly from 6pm to 12am Japan time on 15th February.  According to a notice posted on Gox's News page, the downtime is part of its implementation of a solution to the 'transaction malleability' issue that has seen the exchange halt all external bitcoin withdrawals and face criticism from some sectors of the bitcoin economy.  The downtime probably won't affect too many users. With Mt. Gox's bitcoin price now hovering around the $342 mark (at least $300 below the CoinDesk BPI) and the exact situation regarding bitcoin withdrawals still unknown, it's not very likely people are trying to move coins into the exchange right now. Internal transfers can probably also wait a short while.  The announcement continued that the 6-hour timeframe was approximate only, and could be shortened or lengthened if required. It also said the new system would need to have ""extensive testing"" before bitcoin withdrawals could begin again, and that a further update would be published on Monday (17th February).  It also mentioned that other exchanges have taken their own steps to address the transaction malleability issue, which CEO Mark Karpeles claims is a serious flaw in the bitcoin protocol. The issue was first noticed in 2011 but was not considered a high priority by bitcoin's core developers - at least until Mt. Gox's current problems began.  ""BlockChain.info have implemented changes to address the malleability issue. Our solution should work in the short term, while a longer-term solution is being discussed with the Bitcoin Core Dev team and the Bitcoin Foundation. We are also discussing this with other exchanges and businesses.""  Other exchanges have posted statements saying they are not affected by transaction malleability, though Bitstamp, one of the world's most popular exchanges, also briefly halted bitcoin withdrawals after a ""massive and concerted"" DDoS attack affected it and numerous others. It has since resumed regular operations.  Image: Mt.

42376906,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gK9b,1392454252,"Roger Ver on Blockchain's Past, Present and Future","Last week, I sat down with Roger Ver for an exclusive, hour-long interview where we discussed his company Blockchain, his team, and his vision for the bitcoin industry.  We first connected after Ver came across a blog post of mine in which I dismissed Blockchain as ""too understaffed and undercapitalized"" to compete with the likes of Coinbase and Circle, long-term.  The man, who many have started to refer to as ""Bitcoin Jesus"", emailed me with some objections and let me know that Blockchain had tripled the size of its team in just over a month while continuing to lead the industry in web traffic, wallet users and bitcoins stored. ""By just about any metric, we are the #1 Bitcoin website in the world,"" he wrote.  When Ver offered to set the record straight in a one-on-one interview, I gladly accepted.  Ryan Galt: You're actually the majority owner of Blockchain, not just a seed investor. How did you come to acquire the company from [Blockchain founder] Ben Reeves?  Roger Ver: In late 2011, I started emailing every bitcoin website that had a half-formed business plan, asking if they needed money to expand operations. I was excited about bitcoin and wanted to help grow the ecosystem.  Ben replied because he knew who I was from [my investment in] BitInstant. He needed additional servers, and told me how much he needed. I asked him how much equity would be fair in return for that investment, and when he set the terms, I sent him the money. Then we didn't really talk for another year or so.  Galt: He was working by himself at that point, and he didn't even talk to you?  Ver: I was available, but he didn't need me. One thing that cannot be emphasized strongly enough is how absolutely amazing Ben is. He created the entire website by himself, the iPhone app by himself, the Android app by himself, and up until nine months ago he was also running a service that allowed people to buy bitcoins through wire transfers and cash deposits in the Eurozone.  He was handling all of that, including customer support, by himself. But then, the powers that be in the banking system shut down his personal bank account, his business bank account and his brother's personal bank account without warning. While he's an amazing developer, he didn't want to have to deal with banks and lawyers and regulators. That's when I got more actively involved.  Galt: What is your role today with Blockchain?  Ver: I still have responsibilities related to some of my other investments, but I am close to full-time at Blockchain now. I've been helping with recruiting and lining up advertising partners. There were implementations that Ben had done for free that now account for over $20k per month. And those customers didn't think twice about paying.  Galt: With Blockchain, everything seems free. BitPay makes money from monthly subscriptions, Coinbase makes fees on its pseudo-exchange, and Circle will likely have a similar model. Does Blockchain make any money outside of ads?  Ver: Right now our goal is to give everything away for free. Later on when the whole market develops a bit more, maybe we'll start charging for tiered levels of access for data we have about the Bitcoin network. But we are, and will continue to be, a great advertising platform first and foremost.  We're the #1 bitcoin website on the internet with more eyeballs viewing our website than anyone else. We already have revenues well into the six figures per month, and we are cash flow positive, so we're in really good position.  Galt: You guys seem radically transparent. Is it good to give away so much?  Ver: I think it's a good thing that all of our client-side code is open-source. Every once in a while, you'll see a reddit post like ""the Blockchain Chrome extension is now closed-source,"" and everyone goes crazy! It's because Ben forgot to push the latest update to Github.  But all these people complaining about our supposed ""closed-source"" update, don't seem to realize that Bitstamp, Coinbase, Mt. Gox and Kraken have been completely closed-source from day one. We're a contrast to that. It's part of the philosophy we're developing at Blockchain: support the community, be open with people and build out Bitcoin.  Galt: How does Blockchain plan to work with regulators? Do you feel you have any responsibility for compliance with anti-money laundering and know your customer laws?  [post-quote]  Ver: We have a world-class legal team working hard to ensure we don't fall under any of those regulations. The way our wallet is designed means we never have access to anybody's bitcoins. We don't have the ability to freeze accounts or block transactions or control anybody's bitcoins.  As the law is written currently, that means we are not a money transmitter or a money services business. From that standpoint, we're probably the best bitcoin business out there because we don't deal with any regulatory craziness.  Galt: You and some of your teammates, especially Andreas Antonopoulos, are outspoken when it comes to the illegitimacy of government regulators. Do you feel bitcoin can be regulated?  Ver: At the end of the day, no, Bitcoin the protocol can't be regulated. Obviously, men with guns wearing costumes are scary, but a gun can't change the mathematics behind Bitcoin.  Our goal with Blockchain is to provide the software tools that everyone on the planet can use to send and receive bitcoins to anyone else on the planet without needing permission.  Galt: But without regulations and integration with the financial system, do you think bitcoin can grow to mass scale?  Ver: I do, but it would certainly be a slower process. To be fair, Coinbase and others like them [that offer these regulated services] are incredibly valuable, and offer an easy user interface to buy and sell bitcoins. There's definitely a need for things like Coinbase in the ecosystem, but at the end of the day I sure wouldn't store my bitcoins in a system like that.  Galt: Why do you say that?  Ver: At some point, because of the way that systems like Coinbase are designed, it's just a matter of time before the regulators come in and say ""freeze this account"" or ""undo this transaction"".  At the instant people realize that their bitcoins can be seized or frozen while stored in a Coinbase wallet, they will flock to a service like Blockchain where accounts can't be frozen. In the long-run, we think that will be the strongest selling point of Blockchain. We can't help you recover your password, but nobody on the planet can take your bitcoins if you use a secure password and don't forget it.  The bad case scenario is for an authority to come along and say ""give me Roger Ver's bitcoins"". But the worst case scenario, which is the scary one, is for someone to come along and say ""give us everyone's bitcoins"". That's a real problem with ""off-blockchain"" systems like Coinbase. We're totally ""on-blockchain"".  Galt: What do you mean by ""off-blockchain"" versus ""on-blockchain""?  Ver: We think the bitcoin industry will be split into two worlds. You'll have ""on-blockchain"" businesses that stay true to the unregulated, decentralized principles of Bitcoin, and ""off-blockchain"" businesses with fiat business models that must comply with all local regulations as a result.  Apple's iOS versus Google's Android is a good analogy: the ""walled garden"" versus the truly open platform. The iOS ecosystem is closed, tidy, and sanitized. The Android ecosystem is disorganized, self-emergent, and messy. The market has room for both.  We'd compare Coinbase and Circle to Apple and Blockchain to Android. We think following ""on-blockchain"" principles is the best way to build a bitcoin business.  Galt: Interesting, but this seems like a niche approach. Do you think mainstream consumers would ever opt for an ""on-blockchain"" model if it meant there was no way to recover passwords, and they were 100% responsible for being their own bank?  Ver: When you say ""niche"", I disagree. Think about the ""other six billion"". Most people outside of the developed world especially would rather be their own banks than have password recovery options from their local bank.  Galt: After speaking with some of your team, it seems you are all aligned in terms of your core bitcoin philosophy. That said, the team is spread across four continents. How do you manage that?  Ver: Obviously, the key is building a culture and finding people who embrace bitcoin's openness and decentralization. I think it's clear Blockchain's is the wallet design that holds truest to Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin.  Logistically speaking, we tend to coalesce around one place and travel as a nomadic tribe. We've congregated in 12 cities across four continents in the past two months.  Galt: So to wrap up, the billion dollar question: why do you think Blockchain will succeed where others may not?  Ver: We have a first -mover advantage and fundamentally our design is better. Coinbase and Circle will always be at the beck and call of every regulator because those companies control their users' deposits.  With Blockchain, we don't have the ability to do anything an authority would ask us to do. That decentralized approach will allow us to continue to dominate the market.

42376893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJvl,1392427129,Equities Research Firm Wedbush Sells Reports for Bitcoins,"J.P. Morgan may be highly skeptical about the prospects for bitcoin, but at least one financial research firm is behind the virtual currency. Institutional brokerage Wedbush Securities has become the first to accept bitcoin payments in the US.  Los Angeles-based Wedbush has thus far published two reports on bitcoin through its Wedbush Equity Research operation. At the start of December, it released ""Bitcoin: Intrinsic Value As Conduit For Disruptive Payment Network Technology"". It followed this up with ""Digitizing Trust: Leveraging the Bitcoin Protocol Beyond the Coin"" a month later.  Gil Luria, managing director of Wedbush Securities, traditionally covers payment systems, and regularly monitors eBay/PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard. He decided to make these reports available for bitcoin to demonstrate his support for the payment protocol, he said.  ""We decided that bitcoin and its associated technologies are a very important trend and will be an important part of the future of how financial services are doing,"" he explained. ""So we wanted to get involved as early as we can, and in as many ways as we can"".  The firm normally sells its services and reports exclusively to institutional clients, which can pay tens of thousands of dollars each year, Luria pointed out. However, individual customers paying in cryptocurrency can purchase these reports for just 0.1 bitcoins.  That's quite the discount. Such a move is unlikely to be entirely altruistic. Luria admits that he is paving the way for other opportunities that may emerge in the bitcoin space. Essentially, he is building a list of useful bitcoin advocates who are interested in investment opportunities. He declined to say what those opportunities might look like, however.  ""We will learn about who's interested enough to buy a report,"" he told CoinDesk.  Swimming against the tide  [post-quote]  Bitcoin may be a young asset class, but Wedbush is an established firm, having started in 1955. It is one of a handful of financial services firms interested in the technology - and its pro-bitcoin stance stands in stark contrast to that of some larger institutional players. Earlier this week, investment bank J.P. Morgan published a scathing report on bitcoin, calling it ""vastly inferior"" to fiat currency.  ""At this point in time, the bigger institutions have a negative knee-jerk reaction. A distinction I would point to is that Bank of America and J.P Morgan had published reports through their currency analysts, and that points to a misunderstanding of what bitcoin actually is,"" he argued. ""It's a payment network faith a series of innovations that are far reaching.""  That attitude is manifest in another bitcoin-focused Wedbush report published today, titled ""Watch the Innovation, Not the Price"". That'll be available for bitcoin customers on Monday. Luria explains that bitcoin's position as an asset class is almost incidental to the value of the decentralized payment network. When you buy bitcoins, you're effectively investing in Satoshi's innovation in creating that decentralized consensual structure, he argued.  That asset class is itself relatively unique, because it isn't pegged to any particular market.  ""It creates this side effect where it looks like a currency and acts like an asset class. Investors have been struggling to find asset classes that are uncorrelated with the market and many are reaching out to gold,"" Luria argued. ""If BTC was to live up to its potential, then it becomes an interesting asset class because it becomes uncorrelated with the market as a whole.""  Wedbush will be taking payments through Coinbase, which will convert the bitcoins instantly to dollars.
