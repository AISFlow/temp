42427154,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoRh,1479147798,Former SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher Joins Symbiont Board,"A former commissioner for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has joined the board of directors for blockchain startup Symbiont.  Dan Gallagher served as a commissioner for the SEC from 2011 to 2015. According to the agency, Gallagher was first hired in 2006, acting as counsel. He went on to become deputy director for its Division of Trading and Markets in 2008, going on to serve as co-director from 2009 to the start of 2010. Prior to being appointed commissioner by the Obama administration, Gallagher worked as a partner for Washington, D.C. law firm WilmerHale, advising on regulatory and compliance issues.  Gallagher is the second high-profile SEC official to transition to work in the bitcoin and blockchain space. Two years ago, startups BitPay and Vaurum announced that former SEC chair Arthur Levitt had joined their respective boards of directors.  Other former government officials have gone on to find work in the space as well. These include Ed Moy, who served as US Mint director under the Bush administration who now advises Bitcoin IRAhttps://bitcoinira.com/about-edmoy, and Jamie Smith, a former White House deputy press secretary and special assistant to President Barack Obama who became global chief communications officer for The BitFury Group.  In addition to Gallagher, Symbiont added to its board Todd Ruppert, a former CEO and president for T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services. The startup said that both additions would help the firm as it looks to grow.  “Dan and Todd bring elements to Symbiont’s DNA that will be critical to our mission of making capital markets safer, fairer and more efficient,” Symbiont CEO Mark Smith said in a statement.

42427146,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoDh,1479143595,Bitcoin Wallet Blockchain to Add Buying Option,"Bitcoin wallet company Blockchain is beta testing a new in-wallet purchase option in partnership with payments startup Coinify.  Announced today, the feature will enable users of the popular wallet service to purchase bitcoin directly. Coinify, based in Denmark, operates in more than 30 countries in the region.  Today’s announcement marks the first step as Blockchain and Coinify will trial the option for customers in Europe on an invite-only basis, and the startups are eyeing a broader European launch within the next few weeks. Feedback collected from the trial will be used to tweak the option in anticipation of a global launch in the months ahead, though when that might take place isn't clear at this time.  The two startups framed the integration as a means to cut friction in the bitcoin buying process.  Blockchain CEO Peter Smith said in a statement:  “This announcement represents a giant step forward in making bitcoin, still a nascent currency, a more compelling and efficient financial solution for new users.”  The feature would mark a notable shift in strategy for Blockchain, which has long emphasized its software-only wallet design (it has not featured a purchase option since it was founded in 2012).  The deal comes months after Coinify raised $4m in a round led by Swedish banking group SEB and early-stage VC fund SEED Capital Denmark, its second funding round to date. Blockchain raised a $30m Series A round in 2014.

The derivatives giant has spent the last month beta testing its CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index in partnership with London-based firm Crypto Facilities. Announced earlier this year, the indexes leverage price data from a suite of global bitcoin exchanges in Asia, Europe and North America.  CME also disclosed the names of the independent advisory committee overseeing the price resources. Members include bitcoin advocate and author Andreas Antonopoulos and Imperial College London Professor William Knottenbelt.  When it first unveiled the price tools, CME said that it was aiming to provide institutional-grade resources for those trading in bitcoin markets. CME will release its reference bitcoin price at 15:00 UTC each day.  ""These products are designed to allow bitcoin traders, companies and other users to rely on a credible reference rate price source,"" Sandra Ro, CME Group executive director, said at the time.

42427150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoJh,1479132448,OCBC Trials Blockchain for Interbank Payments,"One of the five largest banks in Singapore has tested a blockchain-based payment service, with an eye to develop commercial products around the tech.  OCBC Bank used the tech to send funds between its operations in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as transmit money to the Bank of Singapore, a private banking business it owns. The bank said it worked with BCS Information Services, a local payments firm, to develop the prototype.  The test is the latest for Asia’s banking sector, the members of which have spent much of the past two years investigating use cases, investing in startups and pursuing commercial applications.  Praveen Raina, OCBC senior vice president, was quoted as saying:  “We hope this will be a catalyst for more banks to adopt the blockchain technology so that, together, we can achieve efficiency and cost effectiveness while delivering more high-value financial services to our consumers.”  Though the bank announced its move on its official group website, the details of that announcement appear to have been removed at press time.  The move comes as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank, has moved to create a pro-fintech environment within the domestic finance sector. Earlier this month, MAS has forged relationships with regional interests on the tech, coming more than a year after the institution began developing and investing in projects of its own.

42427152,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoNh,1479130710,Zcash and the Art of Security Theater,"The cameras were rolling as Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd set fire to the computer he'd just used to help bring Zcash to life.  Wearing a gas mask he’d purchased at a local shop near Valemount, British Columbia, he burned the components with a propane torch until they turned almost completely black. His intention was to prevent anyone from ever recovering their contents.  Todd then bagged up the torched components, and drove in a rented car from the sparsely populated setting of the ceremony to the small town of Kamloops, better known for its pulp mill than for being one of the birthplaces of a new cryptocurrency.  The burn ceremony was the final step of a weeks-long process to be described in detail in an upcoming post on Todd's blog. (Todd was just one of six people around the world conducting their own unique version of the ceremony).  If the defensive measures do what they were intended to do, they should have prevented anyone from using the keystrokes recorded on the various computers from creating undetectable counterfeit cryptocurrency.  If that and countless other steps seem like unwarranted caution consider this: in the two weeks since Zcash launched its global market cap has grown from zero dollars to $3.2m, or an increase of about $200,000 per day. With a long history of comparisons to cyrptocurrency as a possible global currency, the sky is the limit.  The problem is it doesn't currently appear to be possible to prove the ceremony worked.  With a bit of work perpetrators could surreptitiously ascertain keystrokes using radio signals, traditional cameras, satellites or other methods, according to Todd. If they are able to repeat the events of the ceremony exactly, they would have the almost magical powers to create Zcash out of thin air, and thanks to the zero-knowledge nature of the currency, no one would ever know.  The ceremony is an act of what is called security theater, a term popularized in the late-2000s by the writings of security expert Bruce Schneier who defined it as ""security primarily designed to make you feel more secure.""  But security theater is also a form of deterrence.  Examples range from babies wearing RFID bracelets in hospitals to discourage kidnapping to nations parading war planes and missiles in front of their citizens to make them feel safe.  But the Zcash ceremony highlighted a crucial component of security theater: trust. Do those RFID bracelets actually do anything or are they just plastic strips with pretty shapes printed on them? Do those planes actually have warheads in them or are they little more than empty shells?  As Todd made clear, all this security theater means nothing if the audience doesn't trust the actors.  From the introduction to the unpublished post:  ""Nothing you will read below changes the fact that you're trusting me and five other participants not to collude. Full stop. End of story. It is IMPOSSIBLE for myself and the other participants to prove to a third party that we did not collude to keep the secret key. If you do not believe you can trust me, you should stop reading now.""  Trust and trustlessness  And therein lies the problem. Do you trust Todd? Do you trust Zcash advisor, Andrew Miller, who is another of the public participants in the ceremony. Or Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh? How about Zooko Wilcox, Zcash’s CEO? The identities of two of the other people entrusted to ensure the safety of the system have yet to be revealed.  Though Zcash is built on a trustless protocol, to provide the true anonymity its creators desired, the ceremony reintroduced the element of trust.  ""Even if they executed perfectly, there’s another concern that still, ultimately, the only thing that other people have, the other 7 billion people on this planet have, is to trust six people and assume that what they’re saying is absolutely true, and that nobody was able to compromise them,"" said Greg Slepak, founder of email security firm Tao Effect, and the non-profit okTurtles (which works to ensure decentralized technologies are used for the benefit of society).  Slepak is an early detractor of Zcash's so-called ""trusted setup"" and a vocal skeptic who alleges the security theater designed to discourage attacks may have not actually done what it was designed to do.  In March, Slepak enumerated a series of his concerns about the impending launch of Zcash in a blog post on the okTurtles site. In particular, he called for the Zcash team to be more transparent about the potential risks surrounding the trusted setup prior to the launch.  Then, in September, he published another account of a number of incentives that exist for third-parties to compromise the setup. Specifically, he expressed concern about intelligence agencies from state governments that don’t want to lose the monopoly they have on printing truly fungible currency.  The frustration in Slepak's voice is noticeable when he talks about his concerns. In Zcash, he sees the promise of a financial future void of central banks and their perceived evils — if the ceremony was successful.  But instead of being covered widely in launch articles as he'd hoped, the media largely overlooked his warnings in its coverage.  Slepak said:  ""Basically, a taboo is created and it's that elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about. It's something that's so outrageous and so bad that nobody even wants to look in that direction or bring it up.""  Six shards unite  When speaking with Slepak, it's easy to slip back and forth between being incredibly concerned about the doomsday scenarios he presents if Zcash is widely adopted in its current state and thoughts that this is just another conspiracy theory.  Let's start by giving him the benefit of the doubt. How might this all work?  Zcash is based on a fork of the bitcoin blockchain. But unlike bitcoin, Zcash employs cryptographic tools called zk-SNARKs that let counterparties conduct truly anonymous, or ""zero-knowledge"" transactions.  Not only are the counterparties' identities obscured, but so is the actual transaction value (making it practically impossible to trace or audit without permission granted by the counterparties). But for this to work a degree of randomness must be inserted into the system, which is where the high-priests of the ceremony, the actors in this particular security theater, come into play.  While some aspects of the ceremony were revealed in a Zcash blog leading up to the launch and in an IEEE report following Wilcox’s own actions in Colorado, the full extent of how elaborate was the process wasn't clear until Todd's post.  If we believe Todd, we now know that Wilcox initially contacted him via an unencrypted direct message on Twitter on 26th September when he invited him to be a ""human witness"" and participant in the unique events.  After a series of mishaps that made Todd concerned about potential security vulnerabilities in his communication with Zooko, he received a three-page document called ""Zcash Multi-party Computation Instructions."" Obtained by CoinDesk, the document lists the technical specifications for the hardware required, instructions for downloading the software and further steps for burning the information to a series of DVDs.  The ceremony itself is formally known as a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol. Basically, what happened is the six participants are asked to follow the instructions to create what amounts to a public key for Zcash.  Some of the instructions are in the document while others were presented on a screen based on the document. The result is that each of the six people create a ""shard"" of the public key and what ends up on those DVDs is exactly one-sixth of the private key.  The shards are referred to in Zcash documents as toxic waste.  From the official Zcash description of the ceremony:  ""With the MPC protocol, as long as at least one of the participants successfully deletes their private key shard, then the toxic waste is impossible for anyone to reconstruct. The only way the toxic waste can be reconstructed is if every participant in the protocol were dishonest or compromised.""  In conversation with CoinDesk, Todd estimated between a 50% and 90% chance that he completed the ceremony without being compromised.  ""Keep in mind,"" he added. ""You only need one of the six to succeed"" for the ceremony to work.  A cryptocurrency cold war  But who would want to undermine Zcash?  Of course there are trolls who just want to see the world burn. But according to Slepak, the resources required to surreptitiously ascertain all six of the shards would be immense, and there’s only two likely incentives for those people to act.  The first incentive is to get rich. Assuming that Zcash becomes a widely used cryptocurrency, the ability to create more of it willy-nilly could be lucrative. But Slepak says few private citizens other than the Tony Starks of the world have the resources and the technical ability to pull off the feat.  The real threat he argues is from a national intelligence agency or another branch of a state government.  And there's two reasons a state government might have to wanted to compromise Zcash, according to Slepak. First, if the currency becomes widely adopted it has the potential to undermine that government’s monopoly on printing money. And second, because if a government didn’t compromise the ceremony, another nation might.  This dynamic results in a game-theoretic situation where one country is incentivized to compromise the system before another does, and the other country reacts in a similar way resulting in an almost inevitable likelihood of attack.  ""If it's another nation state that manages to compromise them then that other nation state effectively has a very very powerful digital and financial weapon that they can employ against whatever nation is concerned,"" said Slepak.  The security dilemma  Slepak’s concerns amount to what is called a zero-sum outlook on international security, according to a former senior intelligence analyst who worked with the US Defense Intelligence Agency, Steve Ehrlich. The idea that a gain anywhere in a system must be accompanied by a loss elsewhere.  Now a cryptocurrency specialist at corporate advisory firm Spitzberg Partners, Ehrlich said the concern also reminds him of what is called the security dilemma, when one party accidentally gives of the impression of aggression while taking a defensive posture.  For example, the US deploying anti-missile defense systems in Eastern Europe to protect NATO allies from Iranian missiles, could result in Russia being concerned its own nuclear deterrent might be compromised.  But Ehrlich is dubious about Slepak's misgivings generally speaking. ""All of this is predicated upon the assumption that Zcash becomes a globally significant currency, which I think we can all agree is a very tenuous proposition.""  With an $11bn market cap, even the most valuable cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is only about .01% the global GDP, according to World Bank data. If bitcoin is barely a blip of the total GDP, Zcash's $3.2m market cap is even less so.  Instead of trying to compromise the system Erhlich predicts an interested government would most likely try to learn from it.  He told CoinDesk:  ""My assessment is that governments will study the technology just as they did with bitcoin to evaluate its merits and vulnerabilities and look into ways of safeguarding themselves against actors using them for illicit purposes.""  Not perfect, but…  The potential vulnerabilities have been known since the earliest days of the Zerocash protocol on which Zcash was built.  In February 2016, Wilcox published an article on the Zcash blog about how to generate SNARK parameter security. After describing in very general terms how the ceremony works, Wilcox concluded that ""we think this solution is good enough to move ahead with.""  From the post:  ""Unfortunately, there is no way to confirm, after the fact, that it actually worked.""  The reason that’s the case is the zero-knowledge SNARKS prevent the community from distinguishing between legitimate and counterfeit tokens, a grave concern to Slepak.  ""That is very dangerous,"" he said. ""Because if people are pricing the tokens on the assumption that there's only 21 million of them maximum, then those fake tokens get imbued with that price.""  One of the inventors of the Zerocash protocol acknowledged to CoinDesk there was room for improvement to the Zcash implementation. But unlike Slepak and Todd, Alessandro Chiesa says he's not concerned.  Chiesa and other members of the Zerocash team are currently working on more advanced zk-SNARKs that don’t require trust, not because of a vulnerability but because he says the trusted setup is a ""hassle"" to implement.  As for Todd’s estimation that there was as low as a 50% chance of success preventing a compromise, Chiesa told CoinDesk:  ""If someone had managed to glean the trapdoor from all six parties they could do some bad things. That’s why we did the ceremony. I view it as incredibly unlikely to the point of a vanishing possibility.""  High stakes  Wilcox himself acknowledged reason for ongoing security concerns in a September conversation with CoinDesk in which he described what he called the ""half-life of doubt.""  Simply put, the idea is that the longer the blockchain has been functioning the less doubt will remain that it can or has been compromised.  During that conversation he said that the ""only thing"" that will make him satisfied is ""if years go by with more and more money"" on the blockchain and no hack. A representative of Zcash last week told CoinDesk the team was ""still investigating"" if there there were any signs the system had been compromised.  But Wilcox added:  ""I am very confident that the ceremony succeeded at producing the public keys without allowing the toxic waste key to come into existence.""  To help accelerate the rate that doubt disappears, Zcash is currently preparing to release a video recording of some of the security measures conducted at the Denver incarnation of the ceremony. Chiesa told CoinDesk more will be published with time, and upgrade is planned in the coming year.  But to Slepak, if billions of dollars move to the Zcash blockchain as he thinks might someday happen, anything less than perfection isn’t good enough.  With national intelligence agencies at the top of both his list and Todd’s list of organizations with a potential incentive to compromise Zcash there’s much more potentially at stake than just money.  Slepak argues that the worst case scenario isn’t the collapse of a burgeoning new cryptocurrency, but the continuation of the same centralized monetary supply strategies that exist in the current financial system.  To understand what would happen if a compromised Zcash achieved widespread adoption, Slepak said we need to look no further than what happens in the current system when a small group of people controls the global monetary supply.  He concluded:  ""What happens is they are able to enslave entire nations of people and they are able to channel that money to various projects that create a lot of human suffering. And some of these projects literally involve massive wars between various nations. So the worst that could happen if Zcash is compromised, I can say is wars, people dying. But that's pretty bad.""

42427159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoXh,1479125583,Why the Blockchain Hackathon Economy is Booming,"Once a gateway for aspiring entrepreneurs, even blockchain enthusiasts with successful startups are benefitting from a new wave of hackathons and incubator projects.  While experts in more traditional industries may shy away from such activities, the development highlights how, despite the progress it’s made so far, the blockchain sector is still in its infancy. Now, there are signs this realization may be causing a broader business model shift.  While bitcoin companies may have started out appealing to enthusiasts (hoping to gain enough momentum that they could then garner mainstream attention and adoption), Scott Robinson, founder and vice president of Plug and Play Fintech, thinks this strategy hasn’t worked.  Robinson, who has incubated a number of startups seeking to use the technology to disrupt incumbent industries, told CoinDesk:  ""At the end of the day, typically the channel to capture the end consumer is to go through large financial players.""  Bitcoin and blockchain entrepreneurs have had trouble accessing executives at these institutions and so rely on hackathons – many times hosted by legacy players – to network with potential connections, he said.  For startups, hackathons can be helpful in connecting them to possible legacy institution clients.  Plug and Play’s accelerator provides that service, working with 96 early stage companies since its launch in February 2014, 46 of which had received external funding before entering.  But there’s also benefit for corporates too. Legacy institutions that work with incubators and host hackathons find themselves in a position to connect with new technology that could substantially enhance their business, he said.  And now so, more than ever, corporates of all kinds are taking advantage. For instance, Capital One held a hackathon in San Francisco with Chain in July 2015, for which the bank flew in 70 of their employees to work on blockchain-based solutions with blockchain experts.  Hackathons like this ""reconcile those that are in the [financial services] domain but don’t have a great understanding of blockchain with those that understand blockchain but don’t have a good understanding of finance,"" Robinson said.  Network effect  There are a number of successful (by some measures) bitcoin and blockchain startups that continue to participate in hackathons or have joined accelerators. Blockchain services firm Bitfury Group, for example, raised $90m to provide bitcoin mining services, earning enough to even create its own accelerator, the Blockchain Trust Accelerator.  Yet, even it went into an accelerator backed by Ernst & Young in an effort to take its business forward. Bitfury won ""Best Pitch"" for its blockchain solution for digital rights management last week, and has since partnered with the 'Big Four' firm to take its solutions to enterprise firms.  ""We are very proud of it, we did that competition, built a relationship with senior partners. We quickly understood there was a relationship where Ernst & Young could add value with the large multinational customers using Bitfury's expertise around the blockchain,"" Marc Taverner, the company’s head of business development, told CoinDesk.  Likewise, Darren Tseng, co-founder and vice president of product at Adjoint, a distributed ledger and smart contracts platform for financial services, launched his company in June but continues to participate in hackathons.  ""For general hackathons, I do them for fun and networking,"" Tseng said.  Not that either of those has to do directly with his work at Adjoint (it isn’t a consumer application,"" he said), it’s just about making friends with other developers.  'Raw creativity'  However, fresh ideas and new hires do sometimes arise from hackathons.  ""Hackathons are one of the best breeding grounds for new ideas that I have ever come across,"" said Jeremy Gardner, founder of the Blockchain Education Network and the entrepreneur in residence at Blockchain Capital, a venture fund in San Francisco.  ""Forcing programmers to go from the drawing board to a working demo in 24 to 72 hours spawns a special, raw form of creativity that I have yet to see elsewhere,"" he said.  Gardner has been responsible for helping organize and judge hackathons for several years. Recently, while attending the Distributed Health hackathon, he decided to join blockchain-based medical appointment integrity startup, Saavha, as a co-founder to lead business development.  And he thinks, even with a business, programmers and developers should continue participating in hackathons to be introduced to new concepts, products and potential collaborators.  ""The ROI for participants is clear, but it can also be equally useful to companies that want to have programmers test their offerings for the first time or in new ways,"" said Gardner.  Software struggles  Those who make an impression at hackathons can also open doors through awards.  Tseng also recently participated in the E&Y Startup Challenge, a six-week program that this year focused on blockchain applications. There, he and his team won an award as the ""most investable"" company – which is exciting for Tseng, since being a proficient blockchain software developer is challenging currently.  ""Distributed ledger technology is early in the adoption cycle. Early technologies tend to be less user-friendly and have a higher barrier to entry,"" he said.  Yet, Tseng noted that he believes this will change as technologies backed by major banks and financial institutions like the Linux-led Hyperledger blockchain fabric and R3’s smart contracts platform Corda open up their inner workings and ""bring new entrants into the space.""  Just this week, R3’s chief technology officer Richard Glendal Brown penned a blog post giving more depth to Corda and how it differs from other blockchain solutions, as well as a teaser about more details set to follow in the coming weeks and months.  Even Christian Mate, the 18-year-old founder of blockchain startup Mesh, who already has six years' experience researching blockchain tech, argues ease of use isn’t one of blockchain software’s strong suits.  Mate started mining bitcoin on graphics cards when he was 12 years old and built a couple web-based bitcoin wallet applications. The computer he started mining bitcoin with, he built when he was just nine.  So at a young age, he was ""playing games that weren’t out yet, debugging them and learning how to reproduce those bugs,” Mate said.  But working on video games was one thing. Blockchain is another.  Unlike XBox games and mobile banking apps, there isn’t a solid developer tool kit for blockchain. The infrastructure that would enable the next generation of blockchain apps to be built, doesn’t exist right now, Mate explained. And the blockchain APIs that do exist aren’t very flexible, he added.  Concept showcase  Still, the blockchain's future will continue to progress at the fast pace it has since the launch of bitcoin in 2008, with enthusiasts running businesses and spending their free time at hackathons.  With inroads being made to connect startups and legacy institutions, the industry will catch up with other software-based industries and the so called ""blockchain revolution"" will take off, according to Mate.  And hackathons are the best way to weed out the real use cases from the pie-in-the-sky theories.  Hackathons, incubators and accelerators ""show very quickly if a use case is something that makes sense for large corporations and they paint a pathway to matriculate the technology into the [legacy player’s] tech team,"" said Plug and Play’s Robinson.
