42378423,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i9EX,1448559323,"Bitcoin Price Surges by 12%, Setting Weekly High","The price of bitcoin jumped 12% today, setting a weekly high of $368.51 at 12:30 (UTC).  According to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the digital currency opened the day at $328.98 before increasing $40.  The price has shed about $20 from its intra-day peak, trading around $346 at press time.  Bitcoin's price made the headlines earlier this month as it surged past $450 for the first time this year, nearing the $500 mark.  The price reached $492.40 on 4th November at 00:00 (UTC) and subsequently dropped by a staggering 30.6% on 11th November, when it peaked at $341.32.  Elsewhere, a look at CoinDesk's Bitcoin CNY Price Index told a similar story.  The digital currency opened the today's trading at RMB2,091.28 ($327.09), before rising to RMB2,324.53 ($363.57) around the same time as the US dollar index.  Reasoning behind the rise  Although it is always difficult to determine the factors behind the cryptocurrency's price rise – or decline – various industry incumbents have, in the past, spoken about the influence of positive news in the space.  Colin Kwan, CEO of Magnr, shared his thoughts on the bitcoin's spike today, telling CoinDesk:  ""Financial institutions around the world are jumping on the blockchain bandwagon, looking to take advantage of new technology and reduce costs and improve efficiency ... I believe that ... financial institutions are starting to realise that they need to use bitcoin to make this work. This reinforces the value of the bitcoin blockchain and therefore bitcoin itself.""  Tuur Demeester, editor-in-chief at bitcoin analysis firm Adamant Research, said the price movement could be spurred on by market psychology. Traders could be driving up the price as it fell towards $300 because of a new market belief in the wake of this month's rally that $300 is now a key price-floor for the digital currency.  ""It's what happens when traders act on the belief that $300 is now an important support level,"" he tweeted.

42378407,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i90h,1448553906,Kenyan High Court Hears BitPesa Case Against Safaricom,"A lawsuit filed by bitcoin payments startup BitPesa and its partner against mobile money giant Safaricom was heard in the Kenyan High Court on Tuesday.  The startup says Safaricom ""intimidated"" its gateway partner, Lipisha, forcing it to suspend its services without prior notice, according to Kenyan newspaper the Daily Nation. The stoppage came into effect on 12th November.  As a result, BitPesa and Lipisha are facing significant challenges to maintaining their business. A lawyer for the two firms told the Daily Nation that BitPesa is ""at risk of collapse"" because it's now unable to conduct its business.  The two firms sued Safaricom for infringing on their rights to acquire and own property, fair administration and economic interests.  BitPesa uses Lipisha as a payment gateway to enable transfers and conversions of bitcoin into other currencies, including Kenyan shillings on Safaricom's mobile money platform M-Pesa.  Safaricom argument at hearing  During the hearing on Tuesday, Safaricom argued that the suspension of service to Lipisha was justified because of anti-money laundering rules.  The mobile money operator claimed that Bitpesa had failed to obtain authorisation for bitcoin transfers from Kenya's central bank. As a result, Bitpesa's transactions through Lipisha and its account at Safaricom contravened AML rules.  But a lawyer for the two firms said Safaricom had misunderstood the central bank's requirements.  ""[The central bank] told BitPesa that bitcoins are not regulated in Kenya but Safaricom insists that it produces a licence to that effect,"" the firms' lawyer, Kiragu Kimani, said, according to the Daily Nation.  The court will rule on the case on 14th December, but the service suspension will remain in place in the meantime.  Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO and co-founder of BitPesa, said in a statement to CoinDesk:  ""I do not wish to comment much on a matter in court. BitPesa has been wronged, which is why we have referred the matter to court. I am deeply disappointed that the media continues to publish incorrect information that diverts from the evidence submitted to the court, but we will let the court determine the matter. We remain confident that even a small company like BitPesa will gain a fair trial and look forward to the court's decision.""  Rossiello did not immediately respond when asked to elaborate on what media reports with ""incorrect information"" she was referring to. Neither Kimani nor Safaricom responded to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  A significant case  A ruling favourable to BitPesa and Lipisha could trigger a spike in interest from international digital currency firms, said Michael Kimani, an independent payments analyst in Kenya.  ""This is a significant case. If the ruling seems favourable, you could see other businesses coming here. You would be able to do bitcoin to Airtel Money, to Orange Money. It's M-Pesa that seems to be the contentious one,"" he said.  M-Pesa is the dominant mobile money player in Kenya, accounting for two-thirds of the market, according to the Competition Authority of Kenya. Its competitors are mobile money platforms from carriers Airtel and Orange.  Mobile money is a key channel in Kenya's payment landscape. Mobile money transaction volume was more than double that of payment cards in Kenya in 2013, according to the Kenyan central bank.  BitPesa – which raised $1.1 million from Pantera Capital and others in February – offers bitcoin trading and money transfer services in four African countries.  Lipisha is a payments gateway launched in 2012 with funding from Growth Africa, Village Capital and Met Fund.

42378420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i9DH,1448539256,Where To Spend Your Bitcoin On Black Friday,"UPDATE (27th November 2015 10:50 BST): This article has been updated with the offer from Ledger.      It's that time of the year again.  Get your bitcoin wallets at the ready and prepare yourself for a day of frenzied discounted online shopping. Bitcoin Black Friday is back!  Founded by digital currency entrepreneur Jon Holmquist, the event, which sets out to unite cryptocurrency enthusiasts and retailers for a day of bitcoin-fuelled consumerism will take place tomorrow.  Now in its third iteration, Bitcoin Black Friday is often cited as one of the year's busiest periods in terms of bitcoin transactions.  James Walpole, a marketing associate at bitcoin payment processor BitPay told CoinDesk:  ""The bitcoin user base is growing and the bitcoin payment experience is getting better, so we expect that the spending patterns for this year's Bitcoin Black Friday will be a continuation of last year's trend towards payments for everyday items.""  Back in 2013, Walpole said, most of the items purchased during the shopping extravaganza were bitcoin-related products such as mining equipment.  During last year's event BitPay saw a drop in total transactions but witnessed greater participation from merchants and more diversity in terms of the items purchased by customers, according to Walpole.  ""These Black Friday transactions were oriented toward consumer items like gift cards and personal electronics,"" Walpole said.  As customers paying with bitcoin appear to spend their digital coins across a wider range of items, the real question on everyone's minds as Bitcoin Black Friday rolls around again, is what can they buy with their bitcoin, and what will it cost them?  To that end, CoinDesk has rounded up some the deals out there for bitcoin-paying consumers.  Searching for deals  Bitcoin Black Friday  is a good first stop if you would like to see all sorts of different deals in one place. The only downside is that these will not be available until the day of the event, so you can't plan in advance.  For now, users can subscribe to the service and will receive a reminder on the day.  The website reads:  ""Bitcoin Black Friday is a one day event that brings together bitcoin merchants and bitcoin users. Merchants simply list their bitcoin-exclusive deals, and users can check out all the deals in one place. This year, we're focused on quality merchants that care about the bitcoin community.""  Hotel reservations  Although Spanish online travel agent Destinia is not rolling out any bitcoin specific promotions, Amaia Arteta Arregui, from the company's press department, told CoinDesk that customers paying with the digital currency will be able to enjoy discounts on hotel bookings as part of its general Black Friday campaign.  ""We have a special Black Friday campaign but we are not rolling out anything specific for bitcoin,"" explained Arteta Arregui.  Bitcoin paying customers, she added, should be able to get a discount if they use the #BlackFriday coupon at the point of checkout.  Bees Brothers  The Bees Brothers, dubbed the world's youngest bitcoin entrepreneurs, are offering a 20% discount off all honey-related items to customers paying with the digital currency.  Seventeen-year-old Nathan Huntzinger, who runs the Bees Brothers with his two younger siblings, told CoinDesk:  ""At this [discounted] price we cannot stay in business, but it is a great time to say thanks for all the repeat customers and friends we have made over these past five years since we have been involved in bitcoin. Also, we hope that these prices will gather in a few new friends that might want to try our honey caramels.""  The Huntzingers first participated in Bitcoin Black Friday in 2012 and since then, according to Huntzinger, the shopping weekend continues to be the busiest time of the year for them.  Looking back, the teenager said that the Bitcoin Black Friday in 2013 was the biggest one to date by sales volume.  ""I think it was so big for two reasons. First the price was an at all-time high, over $1,000, and second, at the time there were not a lot of merchants to choose from.""  As the digital currency's price dropped at the beginning of 2014, so did the sales.  ""Our bitcoin sales started decreasing and by the middle of the year, our fiat sales were greater than our bitcoin sales. This is still the case today,"" Huntzinger said.  Bitsoaps  Bitsoaps  is run by a young couple, who according to its website, stumbled upon bitcoin and became fascinated by both its concept and versatility.  Anecdotally, the website notes that the owners came up with the idea to combine their love of environmental mindfulness and digital currency over Thanksgiving dinner in 2013.  The website currently lists six different soaps made at the couples' South California home, some of which feature an emblem of the bitcoin symbol.  The company is offering a 20% discount to bitcoin-paying customers from 26th November until 6th December.  Namecheap  The domain registar first began accepting bitcoin in the summer of 2013 and also participated in Bitcoin Black Friday during the same year.  Although the company did not reveal any specific details, confirmed that it would offer discounts to its customers during Black Friday:    @yessi_kbello We offer discounts for all customers on Black Friday! Over $10 million worth of savings. Stay tuned.        — Namecheap.com (@Namecheap) November 25, 2015    Further details are expected to be released tomorrow.  Gyft  California-based digital gift card platform Gyft partnered with BitPay in 2013 to begin accepting bitcoin payments.  Vinny Lingham, the company's co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk that at the time that bitcoin payments accounted for 90% of the company's sales. PayPal and credit cards made up the remaining 10%.  Although this pattern has now reversed, Lingham recently told CoinDesk that his company would be participating in Bitcoin Black Friday:  ""Yes, we are giving 5% [of Gyft points] back on all bitcoin purchases.""  Ledger Wallet  Ledger Wallet  is offering a 21% discount on all its products.  Customers should use the BBF21 code at checkout.

42378414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i95j,1448537436,SWIFT: Bitcoin Regulation in the EU Won't Happen Soon,"The European Union (EU) is years away from implementing a consistent framework for cryptocurrency regulation, according to a new report by the SWIFT Institute.  The report  notes the lack of convincing arguments to include virtual currencies under the EU's current legal frameworks, set by the revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) and the fourth European anti-money laundering directive (AMLD4).  The PSD2, adopted in the EU in October this year, consists of a new set of consumer payment protection rules, which seek to promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments.  Meanwhile, the AMLD4 has been produced in line with recommendations issued by Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) in 2012 to enhance the EU's AML (Anti Money Laundering) and CTF (Counter-Terrorist Financing) laws.  The report reads:  "" ... recent legislative procedures – such as those for the AMLD4 and PSD2 – have not paid sufficient attention to this development, thus leaving virtual currencies largely untouched. While the AMLD4 could be construed to extend to virtual currencies, the precise degree to which will succeed in deterring their abuse for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes remains to be seen.""  ""Third, future legislation – such as the potential EMD3 – remains a development to be watched closely,"" notes the report, adding:  ""However, in order for a potential new legislative framework regarding e-money to extend to virtual currencies, a more fundamental reconfiguration of the very notion of e-money is needed.""  With multipurpose prepaid cards having lost the field and network-based money services coming closer and closer to being payment services, the original purposes of the e-money framework are quickly losing their relevance, it argues.  ""A reorientation toward virtual currencies could then bring new life to this notion, and extend the legal framework to include recent developments such as cryptocurrencies,"" says the report.  The SWIFT Institute, which was set up by SWIFT to fund independent research, has separately embarked on research campaigns aimed at bitcoin and blockchain technology, launching a grant in July of last year.  The new working paper aims to offer recommendations for financial practitioners and regulators, according to the organization.  International approach  The report then looks at the way in which virtual currency regulation has been approached by stakeholders in the US.  ""[In the US], financial regulators have already undertaken efforts at bringing certain virtual currency service providers – mainly the virtual currency exchanges – under the existing legal frameworks regarding money services business,"" explains the report.  Although these attempts first started at the federal level, the report notes, they are now finding their way to the state-level in New York – which introduced the BitLicense – and California.  Further, the report notes that there is an opportunity for international cooperation to regulate cryptocurrencies:  ""The regulatory approach followed in the US shows a number of clear similarities to the EU's own legal framework on payment services. It could therefore be envisioned that an overhaul of the e-money framework would eventually lead to a similar legal regime for virtual currencies as what is currently proposed in the US.""  ""This approach could also hold potential for other countries that are still struggling to grasp this matter, as can be seen in the Asian markets. Moreover, given then inherent international scope of virtual currencies, a more unified stance on this matter would serve to support international cooperation,"" it continues, concluding:  ""Stronger international cooperation can be held to be imperative in order to successfully impose and enforce AML and CFT [Counter Terrorism Financing] rules for virtual currencies.""
