42377846,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oA1,1417371209,3 Pre-Bitcoin Virtual Currencies That Bit the Dust,"The history of the Internet is filled with examples of individuals or teams trying to bring characteristics of physical currency to the digital realm.  Until bitcoin, nearly all prior attempts either failed or fell pitfall to issues related to centralization and crime, among others. Yet despite their stumbles, the examples outlined below may serve as a reminder that, like bitcoin, other concepts were able to attract significant media attention, a number of users and, in some cases, significant investor capital.  Above all, the efforts demonstrate that the desire to create native currency systems for the digital world are almost as old as the Internet itself.  Flooz  Flooz.com was a poster child of the late 90s tech boom that ultimately soured by 2001. Pitched as a digital tool for merchants accepting payment on the still relatively young Internet, Flooz was compared to coupons or airline miles that could be accumulated either through promotional campaigns or purchased directly from Flooz’s central platform.  During the three years Flooz was in business, the company raised as much as $35m in venture capital, betting on demand among merchants for new and exciting payment mechanisms. Flooz spared no expense on its media campaign, even enlisting comedienne Whoopi Goldberg for a series of TV advertisements.  Despite the momentum, however, Flooz reportedly failed to attract high numbers of users and merchants, and criminal activities taking place on its platform would ultimately prove too much for the company.  By August 2001, a mix of dwindling investor support and allegations of criminal activity on its platform accelerated its downfall. According to a 2001 report from The New York Times, Russian criminal groups are believed to have used stolen credit cards in order to purchase the online currency and launder illicit funds, prompting a federal investigation. A Flooz source told the Times that an estimated $300,000 was stolen.  After failing to find a buyer, Flooz closed down shortly after the fraud claims came to light.  Beenz  Using digital currency as a reward mechanism for online behavior – whether it means clicking a link, reading an article or watching video – has been pitched as a potential use case and has seen activity in this area before.  The concept of using a native online currency for this purpose stretches back to at least the 1990s, when a company called Beenz could be accrued for taking part in the activities listed above, among others, and then spent at merchants taking part in the program.  Beenz notably attracted significant investor attention, raising as much as $80 million. Compared to online loyalty points at the time, Beenz inked a deal in 2000 that connected its network with that of MasterCard’s and seemed primed for success.  Like for many startups at the time, the souring of the tech bubble proved harmful to the company's bottom line. Reports from March 2001 point to rising financial problems for the company, and after a promising start, Beenz began to publicly explore the idea of restructuring.  According to CNET, Beenz was ultimately forced to cut costs in August 2001 and closed down later that year. Final efforts to continue the project included merging the concept with a separate marketing platform, but these initiatives did not prove viable.  DigiCash  A digital currency company from the 1990s called DigiCash came, by all accounts, within close range of achieving a global level of success. However, it fell prey to a mixture of internal strife and lack of ignition that stopped it from becoming a widespread online payment mechanism.  Creator David Chaum is a pioneer for cryptographic protocols, having also invented the ecash system. DigiCash, founded in 1990, supported a digital currency called cyberbucks that provided both anonymity to the users that spent it and security to the merchants that accepted it. According to a 2003 report by The Guardian, DigiCash enjoyed support from libertarians and others who supported an international online currency that could transcend government control.  DigiCash was notable for its facilitation of a wide range of payment size options, especially micropayments. The system utilized an email mailing system for currency trading and reports indicate that off-market exchanges took place between traders.  The reasons for DigiCash’s failure were mixed, according to reports from the time, including a lack of cash flow and friction between the company’s employees and its leadership.  Despite promising high-level conversations with major banks and credit cards, the venture failed to sign a major deal ensuring its survival in an increasingly digitized financial sector. Notable examples include Citibank, which engaged in long-stand negotiations about an integration project, though the bank ended up shifting away to other ventures.  Chaum exited the company in 1996, and the company filed for bankruptcy two years later.

42377859,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oQN,1417366433,The Blockchain Application Stack,"Joel Monegro has been part of the Union Square Ventures Investment Team since July 2014. Previously, he co-founded three startups, ran a boutique software development shop, and studied Computer Science and Economics.  The first thing Brad [Burnham] taught me when I joined Union Square Ventures is that one of the greatest things about working in the venture capital business is that you get to look at markets from a very different vantage point. Every day, we have the privilege to learn what the future is going to look like from the companies and entrepreneurs who are building it. It’s thrilling, especially if you’re technology geeks like we are.  We spend a lot of time looking at everything that’s going on with bitcoin and the blockchain. This involves emailing, tweeting, texting, calling, skyping and meeting with teams all over the world who are building next-generation technologies and applications that leverage the blockchain to undo many of the paradigms that dominate the software business today.  Some are just ideas, some are products already in the market. Some have flopped, and some have gone on to raise millions of dollars in funding. Being exposed to all of these has allowed us to identify certain patterns and trends that are helping us build an image of what’s coming. I’d like to begin sharing with everyone, as well as invite you to help us think through this.  This is what I think the architecture of Internet applications is going to look like in 10 years. This is just a simple illustration and it leaves a lot of important insights and issues out. I’ll try my best to explain the thinking behind it below. To keep things short, we’ll run through every part of the stack from the bottom up, and do a deep dive on each in future posts.  The basic idea is that everything inside the gray rectangles is decentralized and open source. For now I’m calling these the shared data and protocol layers. Nobody controls these parts of the system, and they’re accessible by any person or company. If we use bitcoin as an example, the blockchain is the shared data layer and the bitcoin protocol is a decentralized protocol that’s part of the shared protocol Layer.  You’ll notice that each layer gets thinner the higher up you go. You’ll also notice that the shared data and protocol layers cover about 80% of the entire stack. Internet applications today are built on top of open, decentralized technologies like TCP/IP and HTTP, but if you were to graph the current Internet application stack like above, those open, decentralized protocols would probably only make up about 15% with everything on top being private and centralized.  1. Miners and the blockchain  If you know a little about how bitcoin works, you know what miners are. In a nutshell, miners are the nodes in a network of computers who, together, verify all bitcoin transactions. In exchange, the algorithm rewards them with bitcoin. Because bitcoin has real-world value, the operators of these machines are incentivized to keep them running. If you’d like to learn more about mining, this is a great explanation of how they work.  The blockchain is the public ledger that holds a permanent record of all bitcoin transactions, and is maintained by the miners. It’s not controlled by a single entity and it’s accessible by everyone. You can read more about the blockchain here.  2. Overlay networks  This is where things start to get interesting. Developers are starting to build networks that work in parallel to the bitcoin blockchain to perform tasks that the bitcoin network can’t, but that make use of the bitcoin blockchain to, for instance, timestamp or validate their work.  One example is Counterparty. Another might be sidechains. Whatever form these overlay networks take, the one thing they have in common is their connection to the bitcoin blockchain, and how they benefit from its network effects to achieve liquidity without having to bootstrap their own alternative cryptocurrency and/or blockchain like alternative solutions such as Ethereum require.  3. Decentralized protocols  Thanks to the blockchain, for the first time we can develop open source, decentralized protocols with built-in data (thanks to overlay networks and the blockchain), validation, and transactions that are not controlled by a single entity. This is where the traditional architecture of software businesses begins to break down. The best example of a decentralized protocol on top of a shared data layer is bitcoin, and we’re already well aware of how it’s affecting money and finance.  Companies like eBay, Facebook and Uber are very valuable because they benefit tremendously from the network effects that come from keeping all user information centralized in private silos and taking a cut of all the transactions.  Decentralized protocols on top of the blockchain have the potential to undo every single part of the stacks that make these services valuable to consumers and investors. They can do this by, for example, creating common, decentralized data sets to which any one can plug into, and enabling peer-to-peer transactions powered by bitcoin.  In fact, a number of promising teams have already begun working on the protocols that will disrupt the business models of the companies above. One example is Lazooz, a protocol for real-time ride sharing and another is OpenBazaar, a protocol for free, decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces.  4. Open source and commercial APIs  Protocols are hard for the average developer to build on top of, so there’s an opportunity in making it easy to connect to them. Whether it’s a good business in the long term is up for debate, but I think it’s a very important part of the stack.  Making it quick and easy for developers of any skill set to quickly build an application and experiment on top of these decentralized protocols is paramount to their success.  These will be either commercial services or open source projects. Good examples of this trend are Chain's APIs and Coinbase’s Toshi for bitcoin. They both serve the same purpose, but Chain is a hosted, commercial service, and Toshi is open source.  5. Applications  This is the consumer-facing part of the stack. Applications built atop this architecture will, in most cases, work very similarly to the ones we have today – just like Coinbase works similarly to PayPal.  The big difference to consumers, however, is that because they are built on decentralized protocols, they will be able to talk to each other, just like different email applications and bitcoin wallets can interoperate.  One thing I like about this stack is that it’s growing from the bottom up. First we had miners, the blockchain, and bitcoin, and now we’re building everything else on top. As far as I know, the most significant revolutions in technology have been built this way.  This imposes a very interesting set of challenges for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors as so much of the value in the current Internet stack will be commoditized by this architecture. But the best thing about this stack is that the user is better off thanks to lower or nonexistent take rates, switching costs, individual ownership of data and consumer market power.

42377860,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oSt,1417360587,Too Many Bitcoins: Making Sense of Exaggerated Inventory Claims,"A year ago, Finnish bitcoin entrepreneur Risto Pietilä attempted to compile a list of the top publicly known bitcoin holders.  Assuming his list is accurate (which it probably isn't), if you add up the alleged top-20 largest holders of bitcoin, these individuals control roughly 4.44m BTC.  Yet when coupled with self-identification of organizational wallets (like Bitstamp did last year), plus anecdotal talks at meetups, conferences and parties, it becomes clear that the sum total of bitcoins people and companies claim to own is greater than 21 million – even though only 13.5 million have been mined so far.  How can this be? What explains the exaggerated claims? To answer that we have to look more closely at the ecosystem and track down bitcoin flows.  So where are the bitcoins?  Due to its pseudonymous nature, the bitcoin network itself is, for all intents and purposes, a dark pool. That is to say, the network divvies out its limited trust fund (money supply) to nominally unknown players (miners) in a black box that we are slowly deciphering. Ownership is ephemeral (see Jonathan Levin's new pipe analogy).  While an imperfect facsimile (a bitcoin is not equivalent to equity), one way to think of a real-world financial equivalent would be if Google issued its shares every 10 minutes to a pseudonymous dynamic-membership multi-party signature (DMMS), to use Blockstream's terminology. Or in other words, if Google issued its shares to random strangers on the Internet.  Imagine if two or three years went by and a broker-dealer (or in the bitcoin world, an exchange) was tasked with pooling together all the small batches of Google shares?  Their disparate nature would make tracking down and aggregating funds not only difficult, but potentially impossible. So, if you are trying to build a very large liquidity pool of Google shares, how do you track down funds to a non-identified source? How do you find the people who mined for the first couple of years and have forgotten they had them? Who do you call?  One solution is trusted third parties called 'liquidity providers' or 'brokers' and, sometimes mistakenly 'OTC traders' (OTC stands for 'over-the-counter' and is inaccurately used in the bitcoin world, but we will let that slide for now). In reality, they are inventory dealers; people who know people who know people.  Venture Scanner currently tracks 80 funded bitcoin-related companies that have raised $430m in total. Some of these companies hold inventory (bitcoins), others track the inventory for patterns, still others provide an API to access the inventory and there are even a couple that focus on hiring developers to build apps that interface with the inventory, and so on. Twenty-five of these startups are funded exchanges that have collectively raised $121m.  Why have exchanges raised so much money? In order to use the bitcoin network you need bitcoins and while there are several ways to obtain bitcoins (e.g., mining, acting as a merchant and receiving them for goods and services), exchanges provide another method to obtain bitcoins and are often seen as the easiest option to not only quickly buy or sell coins but also to do so in bulk.  How much activity does this include today? BraveNewCoin (BNC) aggregates and tracks the self-reported figures of bitcoin exchange volume globally. According to BNC, on any given day, from $40m to $200m (100,000 – 500,000 BTC at the time of writing) is said to be trading against 30 other currency pairs.  However, there are a couple of caveats with this number. The first is that the Chinese-based exchanges drastically skew the BNC daily total in part because the largest exchanges effectively double-count certain transactions, allow wash trading to occur and simply have no trading fee.  Not only do the doctored metrics above curtail tracking down accurate inventory of bitcoins, they may also expose some participants to market risks: if it costs you nothing to participate in an activity then there is no draw back to effectively 'spam' the exchange (which incidentally happened to the bitcoin network prior to the imposition of a 'dust limit' – now set at 546 satoshi).  However, increased faux volume is misleading and ultimately shortsighted, as it distorts market information (level of trading interest) for new participants. After all, without transparency, how do new market participants know if their orders will be filled as stated or if it will lead to similar misrepresentations explored by Michael Lewis in “Flash Boys”? If trading fees are zero, there is no accountability for exchanges to show revenues as volumes go up. That means exchanges can fabricate volume without having to show revenues in their income statement.  Even if the fee were some very small percent but positive, an exchange would have to show some revenue associated with the volume numbers they claim.  It is worth bearing in mind that the 0% trading fee is analogous to that applied in the forex markets where it is usually 0%, with traders just paying the spread. A traditional exchange makes money by extracting some small payment for order flow from the market makers.  Perhaps the most recent egregious example involves the futures products: in an effort to be perceived as competitive as their local peers, several of the large Chinese exchanges such as OKCoin and Huobi now offer margin trading with up to 20x leverage.  Yet due to a lack of financial experience operating these (they originally all used the same futures software), a sharp change in volatility can have unforeseen consequences.  For instance, two weeks ago Huobi (owner of the BitVC platform) ended up socializing losses across profitable traders to the tune of 46.1% to cover the losses of a levered 2,500 bitcoin trade. And 796.com (which was the first to allow over 20x) is now purportedly allowing 50x.  In the months leading to its bankruptcy, Bear Stearns reached a 42:1 leverage ratio, thus another large ‘flash crash,’ “mistrade,” or blatant “manipulation” at 20x – not to mention 50x – could not only result in large socialized losses but also investigation from governmental organizations.  Without a full audit, it is difficult to identify which exchanges operate in this manner, inflating their volume numbers, however, the Chinese exchanges are likely not alone, as these types of activities may actually be taking place industry wide.  Self-reporting issues  Another issue with the BNC figure is that these are self-reported figures from public exchanges.  An increasing number of exchanges have chosen to restrict access to qualified investors, for a variety of reasons including compliance issues. This has included Buttercoin, itBit, Mirror (formerly Vaurum) and Coinsetter, though Buttercoin and itBit are now open to the public.  In addition, some exchanges enable their users to effectively trade private keys off-chain, keeping large buy and sell orders from hitting the public market, which in turn masks trading strategies and theoretically prevents 'slippage' from occurring.  It is unknown what quantity of funds are processed daily through these trusted entities, including Sator Square Partners, Xapo, Pantera, Binary Financial and Second Market.  Rumors that CNY-denominated trading now comprises 75-90% of all bitcoin trades is likely incorrect, as BNC is unable to take into account the off-chain inventory trades that are largely denominated in USD or EUR.  Similarly, because BNC uses self-reported volume numbers from Chinese exchanges described above, it is likely that the CNY proportion of volume is heavily skewed and inflated relative to other trading pairs from markets that do not allow wash trading and double-counting.  Where are some of the macro flows of bitcoins?  On the sell side are payment processors such as BitPay, mining manufacturers such as Spondoolies-Tech and mining farms like BitFury. On any given day, miners are rewarded 3,600 BTC a day, most of which are resold to cover production costs. Payment processors collectively handle an additional 5,000–6,000 BTC a day.  On the buy side are family offices, high-net worth individuals (such as Tim Draper) and financial institutions like the private inventory dealers listed above.  And sitting on both sides of the supply and demand fence are bitcoin ATMs, which, while growing (currently around 300 globally), are likely have a only marginal impact on the equilibrium.  Daily on-chain distribution  The chart above comes from John Ratcliff, who measures bitcoin value distribution by age of last use. Dialing into the bottom navy blue-colored 'one day' bracket, we can see that over the course of 2014, roughly 2–4% of all mined bitcoins are moving around daily.  If 'best practices' were being followed, traders would dramatically limit the number of coins that are left on an exchange in order to reduce their counterparty exposure, which has historically been high. Remember, nearly 50% of exchanges have absconded with funds.  That would mean that, based on the self-reported numbers fed into BNC, up to 500,000 BTC would be moving on and off exchanges daily. We know this is not true, simply from the chart above, as well as other metrics (such as bitcoin days destroyed and transaction volume).  In reality, the same coin can be traded several times a day, causing several multiples of the transaction volume. Ratcliff's chart just shows if a coin was used at all during a day.  To counter claims that the vast majority of the aggregate exchange volume is moving on- and off-chain daily, recall also that 500,000 BTC is approximately 3.7% of all mined coins, thus this purported exchange volume alone would equal all daily volume.  In reality, participants are not moving bitcoins out of exchanges for a night, as they would be creating a visible market phenomena. The bottom line is that there simply are not enough liquid bitcoins to actually equalize the amount that exchanges claim to be floating in terms of transactional volume.  So either exchanges as a whole are knowingly misrepresenting their trading volume and/or users are keeping large sums of deposits on exchanges.  Even with multi-signature, both situations are dangerous to the ecosystem. There are two caveats, however: some of the perceived 'bloat' in coins not being used may be sitting in the exchanges' wallets rather than the wallets of consumers. Also, withdrawal time from an exchange is not necessarily related to the price of bitcoin.  What can be done?  Unfortunately, the industry has not been very good at self-regulating. In fact, there is no self-regulatory organization for the exchange space or any kind of framework to promote best practices such as the transparency attributes in the Coinometrics survey.  This lack of transparency not only makes it difficult to identify real versus fake inventory but as all four divisions of power – exchange, broker, settlement and custodial – are often housed within the same organization with limited, or no, segregation of customer deposits, there is enormous potential for abuse and conflict of interest, such as 'front running'.  This has historically also led to counterparty risks explored in a early 2013 study that found 18 of the 40 exchanges it was analyzing closed their doors and absconded with customer funds.  Perhaps as the industry matures, participants will begin incorporating the advice from the Crypto-Economy Working Group 'BitLicense' comment (see 'Technology Solutions') including keyless wallets (such as segregating user wallets as Blockchain does), proof of reserves (like Reservechain from Bitreserve) and a type of Consolidated Audit Trail that the SEC's Rule 613 is promoting within the US securities industry.  These will increase not only transparency but also accountability – as financial controls will be separated within companies, reducing and mitigating the chances of an insider or group of insiders from colluding and abusing customer funds.  None of these solutions are perfect and they each have drawbacks as they impact fulfillment speeds and tracking may be out of sync with actual assets. Yet, as they mature, perhaps then the spate of heists and thefts most recently highlighted by the alleged actions of Alex Green ('Ryan Gentle') could finally taper off as sites like Localbitcoins (where Alex allegedly continues to off-load funds) will be able to prove (with Merkle roots) to the community and law enforcement, where funds originated and exited.  Until then, there is a lot more research to be done.
