Historically, when a particular signal appears on the monthly timeframe, a breakout occurs and sends the coin soaring higher. XRP Trend Strength Rises Above Key Level As Bulls Get Bold XRP is still stuck at the center of a legal battle with the SEC, but technicals are potentially pointing toward a positive outcome in the case. That is according the Average Directional Index, which shows a strengthening bullish trend on weekly timeframe. The ADX was created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. who also developed the Relative Strength Index, Parabolic SAR, and Average True Range. It was designed to gauge trend strength.

The trend is getting stronger by the week | XRPUSD on TradingView.com Getting Directions From The Crypto Market On What’s Ahead The ADX uses two other indicators in its calculation: the positive directional indicator and negative directional indicator. If the +DI is above the -DI then the market is bullish and vice versa. In the image above, the +DI is above the -DI highlighting that bulls are in control on the weekly timeframe. The same is true on monthly timeframes, yet the largest moves in XRP arrive when the +DI rises above the ADX itself.

The token fell to as low as 46.18 cents, its lowest level this month, according to CoinDesk Indices data. XRP’s price hit almost 56 cents on Tuesday, as traders bet that a much-anticipated document release related to an on-going lawsuit between payment firm Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could send XRP higher.  Read more: Why William Hinman’s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price  XRP’s sharp downturn happened as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, lost key price levels Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision. Despite the Fed pausing its rate hike campaign after 14 months, an event most traders thought would be bullish for prices, BTC and ETH dropped below $25,000 and $1,700, respectively, to 3-month lows.  The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 alleging that the firm sold unregistered securities, namely XRP. Ripple, however, historically has distanced itself from the token, which powers some of its products and the XRP Ledger network.  XRP rallied earlier this week amid the release of emails from William Hinman, former director of SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. Optimistic traders bet that Hinman’s speech would underscore SEC flawed reasoning for deeming the token a security, pointing to a favorable outcome for Ripple Labs in its on-going lawsuit between the firm and the SEC.  Speculation about the lawsuit’s end have occasionally spurred enthusiastic XRP price predictions. “Currently, we observe huge speculative narratives around Ripple, which could potentially lead to a significant price increase for XRP in the next three to four months, pushing its value to anywhere between $10 and $30,” crypto hedge fund manager Thomas Kralow said in a note earlier this week.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/14/xrp-tumbles-8-erasing-price-gains-from-hinman-emails-in-ripple-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d58013056b209c2b8a062f0e53c2eabf308cd79-1080x608.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13810854,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537998,1686781838,Arbitrum Airdrop Success: Metrics Soar Higher Across The Board,"Arbitrum, a popular blockchain platform, has shown promising results after its airdrop in March 2023. According to a report by Nansen, a blockchain analytics platform, every activity metric on Arbitrum has gone up compared to pre-airdrop days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds $26,000: Why This Level Could Define Its Fate Arbitrum’s Airdrop Bucks Trend The report notes that since the airdrop, the daily count of transactions and users has remained consistently higher than the chain’s historical averages. On top of that, the value of transactions, transfers, and trades in United States Dollars (USD) has followed a similar pattern. Despite the initial surge in new wallets after the airdrop, the number of new wallets initiating their first transaction on Arbitrum has slowly declined over the two months. However, gas spending on Arbitrum has been on the rise, consistently maintaining higher levels than pre-airdrop. Nansen’s report notes that approximately 71% of the total 17,000 Ethereum (ETH) utilized for transaction fees on Arbitrum in the past 6 months was attributed to Layer 1. This indicates that Arbitrum maintains a significant share of bridging volume from Ethereum. At the same time, smaller entities such as Starkware, zkSync, PulseChain, and Across have gained a noticeable market share from March to May. The report also highlights the number of wallets initiating their first-ever transactions on Arbitrum, a proxy for the rate at which new users enter the ecosystem. The number of new users has consistently remained at higher levels after the airdrop, surpassing Optimism and closely approaching Ethereum. In addition, The report shows that 200,000 distinct wallets have chosen to delegate their voting rights to another 16,000 distinct wallets. The five largest wallets in terms of voting power belong to Treasure, delegate.l2beat.eth, olimpio.eth, PlutusDAO, and Griff Green collectively hold 49.7% of the Arbitrum voting Quorum. The report also tracks the on-chain activity of airdrop recipients on Arbitrum, noting that the proportion of transactions originating from airdrop recipients has decreased after the airdrop. It accounts for approximately 5% to 6% of transactions on both Arbitrum and Optimism. Despite this decline, the report shows that the number of daily active users, transaction count, and on-chain value on Arbitrum has stabilized at a level higher than before the airdrop. The upward trends in gas fee spending and the creation of new wallets also indicate a growing use of the platform. Arbitrum Enables Exclusive Access To Snoop Dogg’s Tour With NFT Pass Variety Magazine has reported that the famous rapper Snoop Dogg is launching an NFT pass on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum, allowing fans to join him virtually on his upcoming concert tour. The Snoop Dogg Passport NFT pass is priced at 0.025 ETH or $43.

SA analysts weigh in,"The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for the first time since its aggressive tightening cycle started in March 2022 but signaled two rate hikes could take hold this year to contain inflation pressures. Introducing Part 1 of our Crypto Roundtable, Seeking Alpha reached out to eight analysts for their opinions on what the implications of the central bank’s hawkish pause are for crypto-market investors. A handful of them, including Kennan Mell and Logan Kane , laid out a bull case for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the largest crypto by market cap, as the Fed’s lingering inflation fight creates an attractive backdrop for inflation hedges. Like other risk assets, prices of digital tokens like bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are sensitive to interest-rate moves in that they generally fare well when monetary authorities cut rates, (e.g. March 2020), whereas rate hikes are typically bearish for cryptos. BTC saw some pressure after the rate decision, dipping 2.8% to $25.1K at about 6:00 p.m. ET. “If investors come to believe that inflation is entrenched and the Fed continues hiking, it could be good for all inflation hedges, including Bitcoin,” Mell said. Conversely, SA’s John Miller said: “Sticky inflation means a hawkish Fed, and a continued headwind for cryptocurrencies as regulatory battles heat up into the fall.” Other SA analysts advised to keep an eye on bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and equities, both of which have shared a negative correlation in recent weeks, with BTC off 6.4% and S&P 500 up 6% from a month ago . “If the rate pause turns out to be a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ event for stocks, we might see BTC and stocks re-correlate – just not in the way we might hope,"" said Mike Fay , Investing Group Leader of ‘BlockChain Reaction.’ David Huston , meantime, contended that “we should expect pressure in both markets because the time horizon for waiting for an official pause has been pushed out to later this year.” Here's the full Q&A Roundtable.

Interest rate hikes are generally bearish for Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum and other altcoins. Rate cuts are typically bullish for cryptos. What will be the impact of a hawkish rate pause? Seeking Alpha reached out to several analysts regarding their predictions. Below is Part 1 of our Crypto Roundtable. The Federal Reserve's decision to pause its interest rate hikes may not have come as a surprise to anyone, but its impact on the markets is less simple to predict. What will be the impact on investors in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptos ? Seeking Alpha reached out to several analysts for their opinions within minutes of the announcement. What will be the impact of the Fed's June 14 rate hike decision on crypto prices? Kennan Mell: Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed during periods of risk-on trading, and these periods are often catalyzed by the Fed pausing or ending a rate hike cycle. This means that the Fed's decision to pause rate hikes should be good for Bitcoin. The Fed also signaled that it may continue hiking rates in the future. However, Bitcoin's scarcity fundamentally justifies its use as a store of value instead of a risk-on asset. Bitcoin's performance since inflation ticked up has been mediocre, but comparable to that of traditional store of value inflation hedges like gold and silver. If investors come to believe that inflation is entrenched and the Fed continues hiking, it could be good for all inflation hedges, including Bitcoin. In short, there's a bull case for Bitcoin, whether or not the Fed pause marks the end of this rate hike cycle. Logan Kane: Today's FOMC meeting shows a broad consensus towards hiking interest rates more, and holding rates high for longer than the market expects. Should the Fed neglect to follow through on this and fail to contain inflation, Bitcoin will serve as a hedge with an asymmetric upside. However, with cash rates expected to top out around 5.75%, I don't see much use for the other 10,000+ altcoins in existence. Mike Fay, BlockChain Reaction: With rates unchanged in a unanimous decision, the question now becomes is the Fed done, or is this just a brief pause while the central bank waits out more data? Markets are whipsawing in response to the news, and I suspect the real direction won't take shape until after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell finishes answering questions. We'll get a better short-term direction indication for Bitcoin and the alts in the days ahead. What I think is worth watching is the correlation between BTC and equities. The asset classes have been negatively correlated for weeks. If the rate pause turns out to be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" event for stocks, we might see BTC and stocks re-correlate - just not in the way we might hope. David Huston: The Nasdaq ( QQQ ) and Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum (ETH-USD), are pretty closely correlated, as you can see from the graph that shows Bitcoin vs. the S&P 500 Futures ( SPX ) and the Nasdaq below. As I've written about previously, the trend is a big driver in crypto and currently Bitcoin is trading below its 23-day moving average, which is bearish. The Fed has instituted a ""hawkish pause"" - and they are focused on monitoring data but signaling to the market that further increases are in the cards. Both crypto and the Nasdaq are sensitive to movements in interest rates, and we should expect pressure in both markets because the time horizon for waiting for an official pause has been pushed out to later this year. Bitcoin versus the SPX and QQQ over a 3-year period shows a strong correlation. (David Huston - StockCharts) Clem Chambers: The market would love to hear the spigot of new money being turned back on. Liquidity is certainly a bullish driver of crypto prices. The Fed is not, however, going to give anyone premature hope. They understand that, if you tell someone something good has happened to them, then say you are joking, that person will hate you. Ironically, if you tell them something terrible has happened to them, then tell them you are joking, they simply laugh and think you are a jolly fellow. Meanwhile, the threat of the SEC to crypto makes anything the Fed does with interest rates seem like a gnat bite. Kevin George: The Fed has paused as expected after 10 rate hikes, but still held a hawkish tone and left the door open for further action. After being caught cold by the surge in inflation, central banks will not want to reverse their actions quickly and get caught in an embarrassing yo-yo scenario, so the obsession with big rate cuts is misguided. Crypto investors are hanging on the words of policymakers, but in reality, nothing has changed. At current rates, investors can get up to 5.65% on CDs, or high-interest savings accounts, fully insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC. Why would any large investor go to a DeFi project where they risk losing it all in a Terra-like (LUNC-USD) blow-up? The latest CPI print showed a drop to 4%, but even if rates are cut to 4%, or even 3%, the same story holds. There is also the big issue of regulation. The recent European MiCA regulations have shown a desire to trace small amounts of only $2,000+ in crypto transactions, making BTC's original architecture obsolete. Investors should also keep an eye on Binance with the recent drop in its BNB (BNB-USD) native token. A sharp drop lower could ignite the collateral issues seen at FTX (FTT-USD). The Terra and FTX issues have caused real harm to the potential for adoption, and given regulators an excuse to take control of the industry. John Miller: Federal Reserve tightening has driven pricing for interest-rate-sensitive names and weighed on the digital asset space since the hiking cycle began last March. On the surface, today's pause in raises to the federal funds rate likely captures headlines and more strongly plants the ""policy pivot"" notion into the crypto markets. But Fed participants' expectations for year-end rates continue to increase with each successive release of their Summary of Economic Projections. The median participant now targets a rate between 5.5% and 5.75%, up substantially from between 5.0% and 5.25% in the March release. And futures traders at the CME now place the highest probability on the federal funds rate rising by the December meeting, a strong swing from trading just yesterday. At its heart, this bearish outlook is still being driven by inflation expectations. The median Fed participant raised their year-end outlook for the important core PCE inflation indicator to between 3.9% and 4.0%. Sticky inflation means a hawkish Fed, and a continued headwind for cryptocurrencies as regulatory battles heat up into the fall. Stony Chambers Asset Research: The Fed chose to not raise, but signaled two more rate hikes going forward. It is maintaining a view that inflation is above target and requires more attention to keep a check on the market. It's important to note that central bankers must anticipate the markets' response and therefore craft their message in a way that creates a desired response. Markets, of course, know this as well, and might call the bluff. The result is clearly a game with unstable equilibria. It's best to monitor how the overall market responds over this next week to glean insights on what will happen to crypto. It is rather nuanced. For one, Bitcoin is starting to separate from the other coins, especially because it is becoming clearer that it is safe from the recent SEC drama. Crypto ex-BTC is rather oversold, and this pause in hikes is potentially bullish for those much more speculative altcoins. If the broader stock market continues to trend up/stay flat over the next week, I think we will largely see a flat/ slightly uptrending market for BTC going forward for a month or two, assuming no crazy things happen over that time. Altcoins will be much more volatile and have the potential for a much better upside. If the S&P 500 ( SPY ) and the Nasdaq ((QQQ)) start selling off in the next week, then altcoins will get destroyed. BTC will fall too, but it shouldn't be as much as altcoins. Currently, I am not buying any crypto except BTC.

42393279,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhODqd,1686779514,ApeCoin DAO Special Council Six-Figure Salaries Sparks Discussion,"ApeCoin (APE) holders have erupted into a debate on Twitter over the six-figure annual salaries awarded to members of the decentralized autonomous organization's (DAO's) leadership and community council.  The Ethereum-based native currency of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem launched in March 2022. The coin is officially governed by the ApeCoin DAO, which is made up of ApeCoin holders.  The ApeCoin DAO is not entirely decentralized and has different roles within its organizational structure that have been put in place to ensure a smooth governance process. According to the ApeCoin website, the Ape Foundation facilitates the governance process of the ApeCoin DAO and is ""responsible for day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project management and other tasks.""  The Ape Foundation is overseen by a Special Council, whose purpose is to ""administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community,"" though what that specifically entails is not laid out. DAO members vote annually on special council members, which at present include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Animoca Brands chairman Yat Siu and three other prominent Bored Ape personalities. Several roles, including Special Council members and governance stewards, were planned to be voted on and filled later this month.  But last week, Twitter users began to question the DAO's leadership compensation after Vulkan, who serves as the ApeCoin secretary, posted an organizational chart of the ApeCoin DAO leadership system. Notably, the tweet also listed monthly salaries for each of the roles, which include: $7,000 for the secretary, $8,000 for governance facilitators, $9,000 for working group stewards, $20,833 for Special Council members and $75,000 for WebSlinger, a Cayman Islands administrator for the Ape Foundation that handles legal and compliance matters.  Users specifically raised concerns about the six-figure annual payments awarded to Special Council members.  ""Nothing of any noticeable value is being created,"" tweeted NFT tech co-founder and Twitter personality Mando. ""The responsibility for $APE success is purely down to Yuga Labs."" Many people agreed with Mando in the replies.  Another user claimed that they were paid significantly less for their role ""with similar responsibilities"" at another DAO.  Meanwhile, some users jumped to defend the salaries as fair compensation, with one calling the payments ""relatively mid-range for high-end roles in tech,"" and another laying out an explanatory thread around why it was not ""charity work.""  Yat Siu tweeted in response to the pushback, highlighting the ways that he and other Special Council members work for the ApeCoin community. In one tweet, he said the compensation aimed to be ""commensurate to the responsibility and liability of the role and the closest example we found at the time was that of public company directors.""  Still, not everyone was convinced. On Monday, one ApeCoin holder brought forward a discussion proposing a re-evaluation of the Special Council salaries structure, suggesting a 50% cut. Another proposed a ""competency check"" and called on only those who ""spent time contributing within the DAO"" to be considered for leadership positions.  Representatives for ApeCoin did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment.  ApeCoin initially exploded upon its release last year, particularly since Bored Ape Yacht Club holders were allowed to claim 10,094 APE for each of their Ape NFTs. In the months since, the ApeCoin DAO has passed notable proposals to expand its ecosystem, including establishing a white-label NFT marketplace and allowing staking of its APE currency. They also approved funding of a 24-hour BAYC news site, The Bored Ape Gazette, which has been publishing profiles of Special Council nominees ahead of the vote.  The coin's market cap has dipped in recent days and currently stands at $746.88 million, down from its April 2022 high of $6.74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",NEGATIVE,APE,MARKET | REGULATION | APE,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/14/apecoin-dao-special-council-six-figure-salaries-sparks-tension,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3483d00c7d65c7d7f39a2f70fc8ae39451e3eb98-2154x1222.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393283,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOE61,1686779132,Bitcoin’s Lack of Layer 2s Is a Blessing in Disguise,"Innovations need assistance. As far back as the wheel, the greatest innovations have only scaled through a catalyst – the additional support needed to solve the initial roadblocks of a technology. Books needed the printing press to make learning accessible, the Ford Motor Company needed factories, Coca-Cola needed supply chains, social media needed the mobile smartphone and now blockchains need layer 2s (L2).  In order to bring more people access to the technology and products that can revolutionize our world, we have to have builders interested in scaling the main technology.  Rena Shah is the head of operations and strategy at Trust Machines, the former head of exchange at Binance.US and an advisor at Tribe Capital.  Crypto's first layer 2 solutions were born out of the need to scale layer 1s properly rather than creating hard forks of the base layer blockchains. And ever since, L2s have typically been marketed as the solution to scaling, faster transactions, lower fees and precursors for mainstream adoption of crypto. However, truly efficient, secure and stable scaling solutions in crypto are hard to come by.  Layer 2s have become more of a redirection from a problem than a solution. For layer 2s to have longevity, they must become complementary resources for the base layer blockchain. Ethereum, Avalanche and others have well-established L2 ecosystems that create temporary fixes to their L1s.  Bitcoin, the unscalable blockchain par excellence, might offer a longer-term solution to this L2 dilemma.  Everybody looks at the results, not the well-oiled machine.  In recent months, Bitcoin has seen a surge of interest in utilizing the original blockchain as a settlement layer for activities beyond merely storing value. Inscribing bitcoin NFTs using Ordinals, creating BRC-20 tokens and other unexpected use cases have resurfaced awareness of the blockchain's Achilles Heel: a lack of layer 2 solutions.  But Bitcoin’s lack of L2s could be a blessing in disguise.  If the original idea behind L2s was to create a pressure release valve for the base layer blockchain, then that is what Bitcoin builders can create. Recent solutions like sBTC have looked at the struggles of other L2s and decided on a path to allow builders to create applications and economies, such as Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), that are directly backed by the security and stability of the Bitcoin base layer.  The base layer is meant to be durable, immutable and changed infrequently, acting as a bedrock foundation allowing for an ecosystem to grow and flourish on the topsoil of L2s.  Why not implement L2 solutions directly to the L1 protocol? Tezos is an example of a blockchain that is tackling scaling in this way by upgrading its L1 frequently through on-chain governance. Even the Tezos builder community will tell you that doing this is still yet another temporary fix. There will be a point when an L2 ecosystem for Tezos is the right move for the chain's success.  See also: Jason Lee: Solving the Blockchain Trilemma | Opinion  A flywheel economy simply cannot be sustained on the Bitcoin base layer, like on other smaller blockchains. Instead, robust ecosystems have to shift the value creation seamlessly between the base layer and L2s to be accessible and flexible enough for the next wave of adoption.  After 10 years of layer 2 development – Omni Layer being the first-of-its-kind in 2013 – Bitcoin has the chance to be the leader in finding a permanent solution to network scalability. At least part of the problem stems L2s that distract and dilute the integrity of the base layer through additional tokens, like Ethereum developers have been recently reckoning with. Similarly, having to bridge assets across L1 and L2 ecosystems can create an increasingly confusing and unsecure environment.  Instead developers need to create complimentary L2s that do not steal a base layer's thunder. In other words, blockchains will solve the scaling problem when users are unable to distinguish between the base and scaling layers.  The solution to the problem with L2s is forgetting why they are needed. And it's the same reason why everyone knows about Diet Coke and only a few know about the Diet Coke supply chain or how Henry Ford got an automobile in everyone's driveway with just a few workers on the moving assembly line. In the next 10 years, we will still know about Bitcoin, Ethereum and others, but we will not know about all the L2 solutions powering their mainstream usage.

42393290,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOEVf,1686778576,AI Crypto Tokens Lose Steam as Post-Nvidia Earnings Hype Wears Off,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-related tokens have lost as much as 25% of their value in June, as hype around the sector wore off after chip-maker Nvidia’s (NVDA) recent blowout quarter.  In 2023, AI cryptos have been on a tear, boosted by the fact that the technology is increasingly reaching the mainstream with the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In late May, after chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) revealed its bullish outlook for AI sales, some AI tokens saw a short-lived boom.  Two weeks later, however, interest has cooled off. The sub-sector has lost 16.7% over the past seven days, compared to a 6.9% contraction in the broader crypto market, according to Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital.  SingularityNE (AGIX), the second-biggest AI token by market capitalization, has lost 19% of its value in the past week, according to data from CoinGecko.  Since the start of June, Fetch.ai (FET) and The Graph (GRT) have both lost almost 25% of their value, according to CoinDesk Indices analysis.  Breaking the Nvidia connection  AI crypto tokens such as Render (RNDR) have been more strongly correlated with Nvidia shares, compared to the wider crypto market, said Harland.  However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase (COIN) threw a wrench in that relationship, said the analyst. The regulation by enforcement has spread worries around the crypto sector that haven’t touched the AI industry, yet.  Nvidia shares have gained about 7% in the past week, according to data from TradingView, while the top ten AI tokens by market cap tracked by information platform CoinGecko have lost about 14% of their value on average.  The Render exception  One of the AI-related tokens that has a “unique case in the AI bucket” is the Render token that has been “picked up as a key project,” said Harland.  The token diverged from other AI-related projects since the start of the second quarter, he said. The Render Network aims to decentralize graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering, a type of computing-intensive image processing that is integral to creative industries, virtual reality and generative AI tools such as Midjourney.  Render’s exceptionalism is “likely” because it shares a connection with Nvidia, in that it is focused on GPU-based computing, similar to the chip firm, said Harland.  “You can think of Nvidia as representing the supply/production layer, Render as the distribution layer, and Midjourney as the application layer,” he said.  There was also speculation around Render being used by consumer hardware giant Apple (AAPL). At an event last week unveiling its virtual reality headset, among other products, Apple mentioned Octane, a rendering tool designed by the team behind Render, which led to speculation that Render will be used in Apple’s VR headset.  The road ahead  The current dip doesn’t mean that all is lost as projects still have time ahead of them to develop use cases.  The fact that the hype has died down is “not to say that projects with real utility won't rise back to the top at some point, though if they do, it's likely to be a slower rise based on real utility rather than hype,” said market trend analyst at AI investment platform Q.ai Jason Mountford.  However, Mountford thinks that AI-related tokens will “continue to struggle for the foreseeable future, barring a major announcement in AI tech more generally,” which could lead to another short-lived boom.",NEGATIVE,GRT | FET,EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | GRT | FET,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/14/ai-crypto-tokens-lose-steam-as-post-nvidia-earnings-hype-wears-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/076d49b1d5e40cd7e9b6b65fb0c47c26e0d487dd-2070x1449.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393292,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOEan,1686778337,"Bitcoin Correlations Continue On-Again, Off-Again Relationship With Traditional Finance","Bitcoin’s pricing relationship with other assets has been fluid  Bitcoin has become less predictable but also less volatile in nature  Onchain data doesn’t indicate that bitcoin holders are bearish at the moment  While bitcoin’s volatility has declined steadily since March, its relationship to traditional financial (TradFi) assets has been unpredictable. This unlikely pairing underscores the asset’s unique nature and a fundamental difference from more traditional assets.  Different narratives  Bitcoin has worn a number of narratives in recent years.  An initial “hedge against dollar inflation” narrative lead to “high beta tech stock” one, which now has morphed into bitcoin as an “uncorrelated financial asset.”  On a day where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left interest rates unchanged, both bitcoin and ether continued to decouple from traditional financial assets. BTC and ETH are down more than 4% and 7%, respectively month-to-date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index have risen 4% and 5% over the identical time period.  The trend represents a change. In prior months, digital and traditional assets moved in near lockstep, with both taking similar cues from macroeconomic data.  Now, with two weeks remaining in June, bitcoin is closing in on posting a second consecutive losing month for 2023. while TradFi assets continue their ascent higher. (Ether has yet to post a losing month this year.)  The shifting correlations between bitcoin and traditional finance have occasionally been dramatic. The correlation coefficient between bitcoin and copper futures was 0.88 on May 27, but now sits at -0.74. Copper, often referred to as “Dr Copper” indicates economic health, given its wide range of uses across multiple sectors.  The correlation between BTC and the U.S. dollar index shifted from -0.80 to 0.63 over the identical time period.  The correlation coefficient typically ranges between 1.0 and -1.0 with the former indicating a direct pricing relationship and the latter indicating an inverse one.  Little change ahead of FOMC decision  A look at hourly correlations shows that little changed intraday ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) interest rate decision.  What likely stands out to traders and investors looking for alpha is the independent nature of bitcoin and its propensity to change stripes.  Its price action has been narrow over the most recent seven days, with its average true range (ATR) contracting by 14%. Bitcoin’s ATR year-to-date has fallen 41% since its year-to-date peak in March, as volatility has waned, despite recent increases in regulatory risk.  Few signs of increasing volatility ahead  A look onchain offers few signs that volatility will increase, as balances of bitcoin on centralized exchanges have declined. Analysts usually view declining coin balances on exchanges as a bullish signal, as they suggest investors are holding onto their assets. Increases often occur in preparation for asset sales.  An easy explanation for the decoupling between bitcoin and TradFi is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuits last week against Binance and Coinbase – part of U.S. regulators’ growing regulatory scrutiny.  Still, the SEC’s actions are specific to the individual entities, not bitcoin itself (technically). Bitcoin’s correlation with Coinbase has fallen close to 50% since April.  Investors will need to monitor bitcoin’s relationship to everything, but anchor its relationship to nothing.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/14/bitcoin-correlations-continue-on-again-off-again-relationship-with-traditional-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cebfad353ffe223c7f63d3f8d65d0afb06fea51-1358x764.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393286,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOEGH,1686777190,Apple Rejects Bitcoin Wallet Zeus a Day After Threatening to Delist Damus,"Apple (AAPL) has rejected the latest version of non-custodial Lightning-enabled bitcoin wallet Zeus, according to a tweet by Zeus founder Evan Kaloudis.  This comes a day after Apple’s spat with another popular Lightning-enabled bitcoin app – Damus, a decentralized social media platform that runs on the Nostr protocol (Nostr is an acronym for “notes and other stuff transmitted by relays”).  According to tweets from Damus, Apple took issue with the Damus’s “zap” feature, which allows users to send small amounts of bitcoin over the Lightning Network to their favorite content creators as a token of their appreciation, much like Twitter’s “tip” feature. Lightning is Bitcoin’s second layer payment network for cheaper and faster transactions.  Apple has now turned its attention to Zeus, asking the wallet’s creator to provide proof of requisite licenses and permissions for approval to facilitate transmission of a virtual currency or face rejection by Apple’s App Store, according to Kaloudis.  Zeus is apparently in violation of Apple’s guidelines which require apps to provide proof of appropriate licenses – such as money transmitter licenses – in order to facilitate the “transmission” of cryptocurrencies.  Many legal experts agree that non-custodial wallets like Zeus that don’t take custody of funds or private keys should not be classified as money transmitters, a classification typically reserved for custodial wallets like those offered by Coinbase and Binance that do assume custody of customer funds.  “Non-custodial wallets should be approved,” tweeted Breez, another non-custodial Bitcoin wallet currently in Apple’s App Store. “There's a specific exception in the same section. There are a lot of wallets in the App Store.”  The prior version of Zeus is still in the App Store. It’s not clear what changes Kaloudis made to the new version. CoinDesk reached out to Kaloudis, Damus founder William Casarin, and Apple, but none had responded at the time of reporting.  Damus has since agreed to remove the zap button from all content sections. Allegedly, Apple considers zaps on posts equivalent to enabling the sale of digital content. The tech behemoth has allowed Damus to maintain zap functionality at the profile level.  It remains to be seen if some form of compromise will also be reached between Zeus and Apple.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/14/apple-rejects-bitcoin-wallet-zeus-a-day-after-threatening-to-delist-damus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cddc42681a5cb9600e27a7d94e1dd2cb2dd5ad0f-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13807798,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537980,1686774605,GRT Soars 13% As The Graph Prepares To Integrate Arbitrum,"Recent reports reveal that the Graph, a platform used for indexing and querying blockchain data, is in the final stages of migrating to Arbitrum, a popular Ethereum layer-2 protocol. Following this announcement, GRT, the native token of the indexer, is up 13% in four days, per the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. The Graph Migrating To Arbitrum The decision to migrate to Arbitrum follows a vote after a proposal was floated to move the indexer to the layer-2 platform. The Graph Improvement Proposal received majority support from the community, necessitating the preparation for the eventual shift to Arbitrum, a layer-2 platform using roll-ups. Like any other off-chain solution, Arbitrum enables high transaction processing, increasing scalability. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bleeds As SEC Pressures Mount, Is It Time To Buy? With better transaction processing capability, transaction costs are lower, allowing high-demand protocols to launch while enjoying high-security levels since all transactions are rolled up and confirmed on the mainnet. According to the development team, the goal is to enhance scalability, boost transaction processing speeds, and, most critically, reduce the costs of data indexing. Tegan Kline, the CEO of one of The Graph’s development teams, Edge & Node, said the community chose Arbitrum due to its speed and affordability: The Graph users have consistently sought solutions to improve gas efficiencies and other aspects of the network. After carefully evaluating available options, the ecosystem chose Arbitrum as the layer-2 scaling solution to provide speed and affordability to protocol developers and network participants. Cheaper Querying Although Ethereum has changed its fee bidding model following the implementation of the EIP-1559, transaction costs are still high, discouraging some users and protocols from using the mainnet. Moreover, as visible by the high network utilization rate, the high demand for the mainnet means users wishing to transact on layer-1 must pay much more to approve their transactions. On Arbitrum, The Graph holders will also delegate GRT tokens more cheaply. Delegated tokens are staked with Indexers, who index and query data. Following this transition, Indexers stand to receive more GRT rewards since transacting on Arbitrum is relatively cheaper. According to L2 Fees, a fee tracker, every transfer on Arbitrum costs $0.08, multiples cheaper than Ethereum, which stands at $1.24. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Records Positive Moves As Majority Of Coins Bleed It is yet to be seen how The Graph will capitalize on “data accessibility,” which Steven Goldfeder, the CEO of Offchain Labs, said Arbitrum offers. However, what’s clear is that The Graph provides a solution for users wishing to query blockchain data more efficiently. Public blockchains such as Ethereum or Bitcoin are designed to store data securely. However, they can make it challenging to retrieve this data reliably. GRT is trading at $0.10, up 13% from this week’s lows when writing on June 14.

13806641,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537974,1686771834,"Bitcoin Holds $26,000: Why This Level Could Define Its Fate","Bitcoin (BTC) remains steady at $26,000 amidst ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency industry. While some investors are concerned about the impact of regulatory changes on the market, others see signs of a new bull run on the horizon. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Records Positive Moves As Majority Of Coins Bleed Why Is $26k A Critical Level For BTC? According to crypto analyst Crypto Con, Bitcoin’s resistance at the 2nd Line on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) at $31,000, followed by its support at the same level, echoes a pattern in 2016. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin could be on the cusp of a new bull run that will surpass previous highs. Crypto Con recently commented on the significance of these trends. “Reaching the mid-top line is an inevitability, just like all the cycles that have come before,” he stated. “Bitcoin has proven its resilience time and time again, and I believe that we are about to witness a new phase of growth in the cryptocurrency market.” That being said, Crypto Con’s analysis is based on historical trends and patterns, which suggest that Bitcoin could be in a favorable position for growth. On the same note, Cryptocurrency trader CJ recently shared his analysis of Bitcoin’s price movements on Twitter, breaking down the key levels to watch. On the weekly chart, CJ notes that Bitcoin has closed below its 200 Moving Average (MA) for the first time in 12 weeks. The price has dipped into a former range, but a close back above this level would be a positive sign. If Bitcoin can reclaim its June open of $27,000, CJ sees the potential for the price to reach $33,000. On the daily chart, CJ points out that the previous week’s high and low remain untapped, as does the daily demand level just below the range high. CJ sees a potential long opportunity if the previous week’s low is swept into the daily demand level and then reclaimed and a short opportunity if the previous week’s high is swept into the June open and then closes back below. Furthermore, on an intraday/1-hour basis, CJ suggests keeping an eye on the mid-point of the weekly range, which is currently capping the price to the upside. Another potential trade opportunity will arise if the local range low is swept and then reclaimed, with a target of the local range high. Federal Reserve Holds Interest Rates Steady, Bitcoin Remains Stable The Federal Reserve has announced that it will not increase interest rates this month, and it is unlikely that there will be any rate cuts in 2023. The Fed’s goal remains a 2% inflation rate, and it has signaled the possibility of rate increases later this year. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bleeds As SEC Pressures Mount, Is It Time To Buy? The Fed has also indicated that it expects two rate hikes, each with a .25bps increase, by the end of the year, which is generally considered a hawkish statement. Despite these developments, Bitcoin has remained relatively stable, unable to move significantly in either direction. This is likely due to several factors, including ongoing regulatory uncertainty.

42393272,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhODLr,1686765847,"Fed Leaves Policy on Hold, Ending Long String of Rate Hikes","The U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark fed funds rate range unchanged at 5.0-5.25% on Wednesday, citing the need for time to assess the impact on the economy of its previous monetary tightening efforts.  The move by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was almost universally anticipated by markets, and the price of bitcoin (BTC) was little-changed in the minutes following the news at just under $26,000.  Looking to tame inflation, which then was running at an annual pace of more than 8%, the Fed began tightening monetary policy in March 2022, eventually hiking rates for 10 consecutive meetings and bringing the fed funds rate from 0-0.25% to the current 5.0-5.25%. Inflation has been gradually slowing over the past year, with Tuesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showing the rate falling to 4% in May, the slowest in two years. Though that pace remains above the central bank's 2% target, the Fed has reminded that monetary policy often works with long lags, and as recent rate hikes work their way through the economic pipeline, inflation is likely to fall further.  ""In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,"" said the Fed in a statement.  The Fed's aggressive series of interest rate increases are among the numerous reasons for the bitcoin bear market – which has seen the crypto's price tumble from an all-time high near $69,000 in late 2021 to the current $26,000 area. That the central bank may be taking its foot off of the monetary brake is among the bull cases for bitcoin in 2023 and beyond.  Alongside the rate decision, the Fed released its latest quarterly economic projections, with members now seeing a terminal fed funds rate of 5.6% in 2023 versus 5.1% expected in March. The terminal fed funds rate for 4.6% at the end of 2024 compares with 4.3% seen in March. The Fed now anticipates headline inflation ending at 3.2% in 2023 and 2.5% next year. That's compared to March's projection of 3.3% in 2023 and 2.5% next year.  The terminal fed funds rate of 5.6% for 2023 suggests more rate hikes are coming this year despite today's pause. Indeed, markets are currently pricing in about a 70% chance of another 25 basis point move higher at the Fed's next meeting in July.  Speaking at his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to bringing inflation down to its 2% target and said nearly all FOMC members – despite today's pause – expect more rates hikes this year. However, he noted, the full effects of the Fed's previous tightening have yet to be felt in the economy. Concerning the chances of rate hikes resuming at the July FOMC meeting, Powell said no decision has yet been made.  The Nasdaq and S&P 500 – both of which fell after the Fed rate decision – have moved back into modest positive territory for the day. Bitcoin remains at just under $26,000.

42393280,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhODvl,1686764746,Gary Gensler’s Catch-22 Vision of ‘Regulated’ Crypto Brokers,"The House Financial Services Committee heard testimony from experts and insiders yesterday on the burning question of the best way to regulate digital asset markets. The discussion was specifically focused on a pair of draft bills on crypto market structure and stablecoin regulation, but also unfolded under the shadow of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions’ (SEC) active lawsuit against the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The final witness on the lineup was Aaron Kaplan, co-founder and CEO of Prometheum, “a FINRA [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] and SEC regulated ATS [alternative trading system] and broker-dealer in digital asset securities” incorporated in 2021 and expected to launch in the third quarter of this year.  Kaplan (in contrast to most other witnesses) essentially echoed SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s position that existing securities laws are fully sufficient to regulate crypto markets. Some lawmakers held Kaplan’s platform out as evidence that Gensler’s repeated offer that exchanges “come in and register” was entirely sincere.  See also: SEC’s Gensler Rebuffs Crypto Complaints, Says Gave Ample Warning Heat Was Coming  But to skeptics, Kaplan and his testimony instead wound up depicting the SEC’s stance as a classic instance of malicious bureaucracy:  An inescapable Catch-22.  You don’t have to be crazy to register with the SEC, but it helps  Novelist Joseph Heller coined the now-common term in his novel of the same name. In Heller’s screwball antiwar tragedy, “Catch 22” was a circular bureaucratic rule, designed by the U.S. government to prevent draftees from leaving the World War II-era military. According to the (fictional) rule, you could only get out of the Army if you could prove you were crazy – but if you wanted to get out of the Army, you were clearly all too sane.  Gary Gensler’s SEC seems to have relied on similar logic when imagining its preferred crypto market structure: You’re free to launch a regulated crypto exchange, as long as it doesn’t actually enable the purchase or sale of crypto.  This point was driven home by the (audibly frustrated) Representative Mike Flood (R-NE), who asked Kaplan a pair of simple questions: Does Prometheum allow users to buy and sell ether (ETH)? What about bitcoin (BTC)?  Kaplan’s answer to each question was a curt, faintly embarrassed no.  Prometheum, in fact, has not yet identified any assets that it plans to offer. While its website depicts an app offering tokens connected to the Flow, Filecoin, The Graph, Compound and Celo protocols, these appear to be merely hypothetical examples.  The path to actually “registering” a blockchain token as a security is not at all clear, suggesting a possible scenario where Prometheum becomes a formally registered digital asset marketplace … that doesn’t actually sell any digital assets. Additionally, Prometheum currently only plans to serve accredited investors, not the general public.  Flood argued that Prometheum’s shortcomings, particularly its exceedingly limited offerings, show the hollowness of the SEC’s claims that existing law provides a path to registration for crypto exchanges. Prometheum’s registration, Flood said, “does not address the core issue: There is not a consistent definition of a digital asset security within current law.”  You can check in anytime you like, but you can never trade  This is the Catch-22 the SEC has attempted to characterize as reasonable regulation: If you want to get properly registered as a crypto exchange, you won’t be able to offer the most popular and important digital assets.  That’s particularly illustrated by the cases of bitcoin and ether, the native token of Ethereum. While bitcoin has been fairly clearly designated a commodity for regulatory purposes, it’s one of many crypto assets that do not have any clear “issuer” or other figure who would even be able to properly register the asset with the SEC. That includes genuinely open-source and community-driven protocols like Dogecoin and Monero.  The hearing, and Prometheum, highlighted another fundamental shortcoming of the SEC’s current approach. Because it will only sell to accredited investors, Prometheum does not represent a viable way to get crypto assets into the hands of actual end users.  Lawyer Coy Garrison, former counsel to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, pointed out that this means the SEC is advocating an utterly incoherent market structure for crypto assets.  “People purchase [digital assets] for a number of reasons,” Garrison said, “but one is to use them on the network … The application of securities laws [to these assets] would be so burdensome as to render the operation of the network moot.”  That is, Prometheum is licensed to sell big blocks of tokens to institutions and whales. But if there’s no legal path to get those assets into the hands of everyday users, the tokens would have no value, because there would be no users.  “If you have to go through a broker dealer to [buy crypto assets], it adds a tremendous amount of friction to the system,” Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith told me this week. The SEC’s approach “ignores that these tokens have a function.”  See also: David Z.

42393276,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhODbF,1686762207,MakerDAO Weighs Ditching $390M of Gemini Dollars from DAI Reserve,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform and stablecoin issuer MakerDAO could soon ditch $390 million of crypto exchange Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin from its reserves.  The protocol’s community is currently voting on a proposal to decrease the maximum amount of GUSD to $110 million from $500 million held in Maker’s DAI stablecoin reserve, called the Peg Stability Module (PSM).  Less than 24 hours before the vote’s end, roughly 94% of those who have already voted are in favor of the proposal to cut GUSD. However, a similar proposal in January saw a late rush of votes in favor of retaining GUSD, pushing that side to a razor-thin 50.85% majority.  The vote is significant for GUSD’s future, as Maker holds roughly 88% of the stablecoin’s $568 million circulating supply. Maker backs the value of the $4.5 billion DAI by holding cryptocurrencies such as Circle’s USDC and GUSD in the reserve, and increasingly by investing in real-world assets like government bonds.  Gemini – the crypto exchange founded and run by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and the issuer of GUSD – pays a 2% annual reward to MakerDAO for using the token as a reserve asset. The proposal, however, argued that the platform could enjoy better revenue opportunities, for example by investing in short-term U.S. Treasuries, which currently offer about a 5% yield.

13802761,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537877,1686762012,"Crypto Market Bleeds As SEC Pressures Mount, Is It Time To Buy?","The crypto market seems to have reached a critical turning point where prices are suffering because of regulatory pressure across the space. This ranges from the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) suing Binance and Coinbase exchanges, as well as the Ripple case heating up. These factors led to a sharp plunge in prices, which could present a unique opportunity to get into the market. Crypto Market Bleeds Red The days following the heightened regulatory scrutiny have not been easy on the crypto market. As such, most of the digital assets in the space are now nursing massive losses. One example is Bitcoin, which is currently the market leader. Related Reading: SUI Defies Bear Market With 15% Rally, Is A Return To $1 Imminent? Bitcoin lost its footing above the $26,000 which had been serving as support for the bulls. However, the sellers maintain control of the market and this sell pressure has continuously mounted over the last week, making any form of recovery impossible. BTC is now back in the $25,000 territory after falling 2.30% in the last week. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap Ethereum has also followed the same trend and is performing even worse than Bitcoin on the weekly chart where it is seeing 6.07% losses. This decline has brought its price below the $1,750 support as bulls scramble to hold on. BNB has been the only token of the top 10 performing reasonably well with 5.12% gains. However, this recovery has sparked questions about whether Binance is dumping its BTC to prop up the price of BNB after it went into freewill following the SEC lawsuit. Others such as XRP, DOGE, TRX, ADA, and MATIC are all nursing losses over the last week as well, with ADA and MATIC performing especially badly with double-digit losses on their 7-day charts. Is It Time To Buy The Blood? ‘Contrarian investing’ is a school of thought that suggests that the best time to get into an asset is when its price is falling and investors are scared to get into the market. This is explained by the popular investing saying that says “Buy when there is blood in the streets.” Total market cap still holding steady above $1 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com Given the current market trend, most assets in the space are in the red, and contrarian investing would suggest that this is the best time to start investing in the market. It is further solidified by the fact that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is moving back into the Fear territory, meaning fewer investors are willing to put money into the market right now.

13802805,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/celebrating-the-12-winners-of-the-2023-cryptodaily-awards,1686762000,Celebrating the 12 winners of the 2023 CryptoDaily™ Awards,"CryptoDaily™ is thrilled to announce the winners of our annual international award for daring Web3 builders and popularizers. Between May 22nd and June 5th, the expert jury reviewed dozens of stars that were shining in the industry throughout the past year, recognizing honorees across 4 categories: Entrepreneurship, Development, Design, and Marketing & PR. Driven by the genuine belief that the community should acknowledge its heroes, we established CryptoDaily™ Awards in 2022 to reward the most outstanding talents based on their merits. They all contributed to the Web3 ecosystem in many ways, from significantly improving its infrastructure and user experience to amplifying the Web3 business sector and promoting decentralized applications to the mass population. While the main goal of CryptoDaily™ Awards remained the same, we brought a couple of novelties to the evaluation process. So, before we proceed with disclosing this year’s results, let us first introduce you to the changes made. Panel of Judges To highlight the Web3’s best and brightest minds of 2023, we invited the Fantastic Four team of subject matter judges, each contributing to the long-term trends in their own focus area throughout a year. We have thoughtfully chosen the jury members among 20 candidates for each category, paying special attention to their in-depth knowledge of the industry, multi-faceted activity, and remarkable individual achievements. Some of them have promoted dozens of new millionaire businesses for the Web3 and blockchain era. Others have traversed the severe crypto market turmoil of 2022 with honor, and still others have proved that they were rightly praised by the previous CryptoDaily™ Awards. So let us dive straight into the list without further ado. Entrepreneurship João Fouad, a disruptive entrepreneur specializing in Web3, finance, investments, and the startup ecosystem; an international speaker and entrepreneurial mentor; CEO and founder of Highline Venture Builder. Development Kirill Arutyunov, a professional software engineer and developer with over 10 years of experience in Web3, fintech, and edtech; a seasoned entrepreneur and C-level executive; CTO of Münzen.

Honorable Jury’s Member Cal Evans, a Managing Associate of Gresham International - the world’s largest Digital Asset only legal service and law firm; headliner of several large events alongside people such as Gary Vee and Nick Spanos. Renewed Methodology This year, the focus of the award was slightly shifted towards showcasing Web3's famous personalities and rising superstars who stood out with brilliant results and dynamic development. Our jury leveraged their professional outlook to make decisions, following a numerical and quantitative methodology with specific weighting given to: Evidence of leading the development and delivery of cutting-edge Web3 projects; Evidence of engagement with the business to drive Web3 adoption; Evidence of skill set growth and personal accomplishments; Evidence of exceptional leadership and excellence in the field; Evidence of results implemented because of the honoree's work; Demonstrable enthusiasm for and creativity in Web3. All judges had two weeks to carefully evaluate more than 50 most ambitious Web3 innovators in their respective categories. Adhering strongly to the award’s criteria, each jury member finally came up with two winners, presenting them as: Jury’s choice – unrivaled gainers whose individual performance is the most worthy by all criteria; Jury’s runner-up pick – those who were one step away from the Jury’s choice but couldn't outperform the winners. In order to prolong the pleasure, CryptoDaily™ decided not to depart from participation in the assessment of nominees.

42393269,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhODGj,1686761373,Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price,"On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.  Here’s why:  Very broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.  Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.  Early analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.  Ahead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.  Critics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.  Ripple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”  Read More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?  To critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.  In any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple's side of the case, XRP's price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.

Some 6.4% of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) supply left exchanges after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase Global ( COIN ) and Binance , accusing the major exchanges of offering unregistered securities. Supply has been pulling back since the 16.0% peak in 2020, the data showed, suggesting that traders feel more comfortable holding their bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) in self-custody wallets, which allow users to store their tokens and act as their own banker instead of relying on off-chain exchanges. ""As long as these #SEC lawsuits loom, this trend should continue,"" Santiment wrote in a Twitter post Tuesday evening. The multibillion-dollar demise of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX ( FTT-USD ) exchange late last year, as well as other high-profile meltdowns, likely helped to boost the popularity of self-custody wallets. Meantime, in its first-quarter financial results published last month, Coinbase ( COIN ) saw its average assets under custody jump 25% to $52.3B from the prior quarter.

This current performance is noteworthy and has triggered the interest of investors and market observers. Its positive performance in challenging market conditions highlights the potential for long-term success. And it may inspire other projects seeking to thrive in a highly volatile market. Maker (MKR) Thrives With Resilience Amid Turbulent Crypto Market Maker is a decentralized organization built on the Ethereum blockchain committed to bringing financial stability and transparency to the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Stored On Exchanges Plummets Amid Regulatory Uncertainties: Santiment According to data from CoinMarketCap, MKR is currently trading at $655.38, representing an increase of 3.25%. MKR has exhibited bullish sentiment since the last 30-day trading period with an increase of 2.96%. The MKR price is still up in the 7-day trading session, representing an increase of 4.14%. The asset exhibiting bullish momentum in its 7-day and 30-day trading periods indicates that MKR demand and buying pressure are growing. And it can be further seen as a positive sign for investors and traders. Both the overall market cap and its 24-hour trading volume are also up today by 3.07% and 24.98%. This represents a value of $639 million and $24 million, accompanied by a circulating supply of 977,631 MKR, which is almost depleted. Notably, as the circulating supply dwindles, the asset becomes scarcer in the market. This limited availability can potentially drive up demand and create a sense of urgency among investors and traders. MKR’s price might surge as demand outpaces the available circulating supply, as buyers will be willing to pay higher prices to acquire MKR. Crypto Market Volume Declines By 30.07% In 24 Hours In the past 24 hours, the total volume of the cryptocurrency market has amounted to $23.64 billion, showing a significant decrease of 30.07%. Within the crypto market, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector volume stands at $1.68 billion, accounting for 7.12% of the total crypto market volume. Furthermore, stablecoins contribute significantly to the overall market volume, with a value of $22.38 billion, representing 94.64% of the total crypto market volume. Regarding market dominance, Bitcoin currently holds a share of 47.65%, experiencing a slight decrease of 0.06% throughout the day. Several Indicators Signal Bullish Sentiment For MKR Amid Declining Market Volume Currently, the asset is trading above the middle band of the Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential uptrend. This indicates that the asset’s price is higher than the average and could signal continued bullish momentum in the near term. Related Reading: XRP And Ethereum Seeing Increased Social Media Talk As Bitcoin Loses Interest MKR’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above the signal line, also confirming the bullish sentiment and a potential buy signal. Lastly, the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 54.8, indicating a moderate bullish momentum. It implies that the asset’s price has seen some positive movement, and there is still potential for further upward price action.

42393294,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOEqB,1686758400,A Crypto Lesson From George Soros Amid Binance and Coinbase Accusations,"One of the more challenging aspects of investing is thinking about events and the expectations of price movements around them. What we saw last week in the crypto market after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action against Binance and Coinbase was a perfect example.  Specifically, how do you explain the broad market sell-off following the new allegations against Binance (the world’s largest exchange) but a rebound following the case filed against Coinbase (the biggest U.S. exchange) soon after?  Part of this puzzle could be potentially solved (or at least untangled) by considering market expectations and related positioning.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Crypto market expectations  Additional regulatory action against Coinbase was probably more certain than against Binance, as the firm had already received a Wells Notice. Juxtapose this with the enforcement action against Binance, a firm with no official physical headquarters, making it less clear how it would be investigated by the SEC. (Answer: via their U.S. entity, Binance.US). If these expectations are somewhat reasonable (caveat for the ex-post analysis), then it could be reasonable to conclude that the difference in market reaction between Binance and Coinbase was related to events that were less and more “priced-in,” respectively.  Positioning  Looking into the regulated futures market positioning data helps us determine what actions investors have taken to align with their market views. Why the positioning data, and why regulated markets? Well, it's good to understand how traders and investors were positioned going into the event, and there have been many allegations of wash trading in unregulated markets.  A good mental model for investor positioning is to think about passengers on a boat. If everyone is spread out across the boat, a specific passenger moving from one side to another does not impact the net balance much. But if everyone is on one side of the boat (and it’s not capsizing) and someone decides to break from the crowd and catch some fresh air on the other side, that contrarian move will have an outsized impact on the net balance of the system. Positioning alongside investor deleveraging dynamics can also help explain relief rallies.  I prefer to look at the data from the perspective of leveraged money managers as opposed to asset managers, swap dealers, or other reportables, as they are more likely to have unhedged positions. I consider the group’s positioning to be a contrarian indicator, as this category of traders is more susceptible to short squeezes.  From digging into the positioning data (see Figure 2), we can see that both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures net positioning for leveraged money managers are net short and are at or near one-year lows, which confirms the relatively bearish expectations for both tokens and, by proxy, the greater crypto market. With positioning at these bearish levels, the market is more resilient to bad-event news and has an increased sensitivity for positive developments to flip short positions to positive.  Both positioning and market expectations dig into a bigger concept of reflexivity within financial markets, as pioneered by George Soros. In short, market reflexivity suggests that investor perceptions and behavior impact market conditions, which, in turn, impact and shape investor beliefs and actions. This circular, self-referential feedback loop leads to non-linear market dynamics as cognitive biases and expectations build on each other to impact market prices and investor positioning. This can explain the emergence of price trends that can become self-fulfilling over the short run and self-correcting over the longer term as traders chase prices until expectations and positioning for continued price moves can only result in a reversal and correction, much to the disappointment of traders who recently started following the trend.  While it’s never a good look for a regulator to target two of the largest exchanges in a single week, last week’s regulatory headlines provided us with a real-world case study in highlighting the importance of market expectations and positioning in providing the setup for event price moves.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  THE END: Just in case the potential stakes aren’t clear, Binance.US (the American arm of Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao’s Binance empire) argued this week that the U.S. government’s request to freeze the company’s funds would “effectively end” its business. CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn explored whether Binance can survive.  IN HALF: The reward for mining bitcoin (BTC) will get cut in half in April 2024 or so, and it’s not too soon to discuss the implications. According to this CoinDesk story, breakeven point for miners’ profitability could shift to a level around where BTC is trading now, meaning either prices need to surge or miners need to figure out how to get more efficient if they want to earn anything. “Historically, the rise in the price of BTC has outpaced the impact of the halving. Time will tell what happens in this cycle,” said Kerri Langlais, chief strategy officer at bitcoin miner TeraWulf.  SHUTTING DOWN: Crypto.com is probably best known for courting retail customers. But it does have a U.S. institutional business, too – or will until June 21. The company announced last week that it will shut that down. It blamed “limited demand” amid the “current market landscape.”  NEW POLYGON: Polygon, the Ethereum-adjacent blockchain where transactions can be offloaded for faster and more efficient processing, just introduced its version 2.0 as it attempts to win an even greater share of decentralized finance (DeFi).",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/14/a-crypto-lesson-from-george-soros-amid-binance-and-coinbase-accusations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea6ce322c18f730eac25574d69c9897dbd0006b8-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393287,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOELP,1686758400,The Graph Migrates its Settlement Layer to Arbitrum from Ethereum,"The Graph – a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data – began on Wednesday the final phase of its migration from Ethereum to the layer 2 scaling solution Arbitrum.  With the migration, The Graph becomes one of the largest Ethereum apps to transition to a layer 2 rollup – a move that one of The Graph developers Edge & Node say will decrease barriers of entry for The Graph’s participants without compromising on security.  The Graph, through its web of “delegators” and “indexers,” allows web3 developers to view blockchain data without trusting centralized intermediaries for the data’s accuracy. Launched initially on Ethereum, its move to layer 2 platform Arbitrum is an effort to decrease gas costs and increase transaction speeds, according to Edge & Node CEO Tegan Kline.  Arbitrum, like other Ethereum layer 2 networks, operates as a separate blockchain that runs alongside Ethereum. To reduce fees for users without losing all of Ethereum’s security guarantees, Arbitrum bundles up large groups of transactions and then passes them back down to Ethereum for all-at-once settlement.  The Graph’s migration involves transferring its “settlement layer” from one network to another – rather than recording and settling activity directly on Ethereum, The Graph will now settle transactions on Arbitrum.  Every time a user performs a transaction on The Graph like delegating and indexing, there is a cost to it. “With this transfer to Artbitrum, those costs are lower. So we expect that there will likely be more indexers that spin up on the network [and] more delegators that get involved because that barrier to entry is lower, the cost isn’t so high,” Kline told CoinDesk.  GRT and ARB, the native tokens for The Graph and Arbitrum, have both remained stable in the past 24 hours amid The Graph’s transition to Arbitrum. GRT has ranged between as high as 9.9 cents and as low as 9.7 cents, while ARB has oscillated between 97 cents and $1.01, per CoinDesk data.  The Graph enables developers to query data from 40 networks and raised $50 million in a 2022 funding round, which saw participation from Tiger Global, Blockwall Digital, Fenbushi Capital, FinTech Collective and Reciprocal Ventures.  CORRECTION (June 14, 2023, 18:23 UTC): Specifies in the piece's first sentence that the final stage of The Graph's migration started Wednesday.

42393293,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOEl3,1686758400,"Ethereum Ecosystem Is Getting Busier, Not Quieter, Amid Layer 2 Shift","From developer and decentralized application (dapp) counts to progress along its roadmap to general public awareness, there are many metrics that may be used to measure Ethereum’s progress over time. One of the most popular is transaction count, which is notable not only due to its correlation with items like adoption and fee generation, but also as it measures actual usage of the protocol itself.  Unfortunately, transactions on Ethereum are now down about 26% from their May 2021 peak, possibly suggesting that Ethereum is, at best, temporarily moving backwards and, at worst, in long-term decline.  However, neither is true.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  To better understand why Ethereum is thriving despite a falling transaction count, one must understand Ethereum’s plans for the future. While Ethereum can directly facilitate all blockchain activities on the mainnet (consensus, execution, data availability and settlement), it is pioneering a more modular approach, enabling certain functionality to be outsourced to separate, optimized protocols for improved performance. Chief among these is execution, with transactions outsourced to layer 2 (L2) rollups for more efficient execution.  Multiple transactions are bundled together and executed in batches on an L2 (i.e., off of the Ethereum mainnet), and then a smaller amount of data is sent back to Ethereum. This practice vastly increases throughput, and, as the state of the rollup can be recreated and verified using the data posted on the Ethereum mainnet, rollups inherit many of the security properties of the mainnet itself. This strategy was a shift in Ethereum’s scaling roadmap proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2020, dubbed the rollup-centric roadmap, which prioritized outsourcing execution to rollups and bolstering Ethereum’s data availability layer to reduce the cost of posting data back to the mainnet. In short, it shifted the focus of the Ethereum mainnet to consensus, settlement and data availability.  With that as background, we can now view Ethereum’s declining mainnet transaction count in a different light. And when adding in L2 transactions, we see that total Ethereum ecosystem transactions, including both those on the mainnet and its associated layer 2s, are up a strong 146% over the last two years. Not only does this show that usage of Ethereum continues to rapidly increase, but also it shows that it continues to progress along its roadmap exactly as intended.  Lastly, we see strong growth and a shift toward off-chain execution continuing for several reasons. First, the Ethereum protocol continues to move in this direction and will particularly do so with its next upgrade, including proto-danksharding, which expands Ethereum’s data availability capabilities. Moreover, not only is the base layer itself improving, but so, too, are the layer 2s, with improved decentralization and new paradigms around interconnectivity and shared security ahead. And these base and secondary layer improvements will come together to enable new use cases and functionality, creating a virtuous cycle. Portended by rising ecosystem transaction counts, Ethereum is perhaps on its way to becoming the world’s settlement layer.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,"Matt Kunke, Brian Rudick",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/14/ethereum-ecosystem-is-getting-busier-not-quieter-amid-layer-2-shift,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/612c5d93be357c00bf7b064e13543d80380c490c-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The documents provide insight into William Hinman’s speech which stated that Ether is not a security. The highly anticipated Hinman documents were unsealed and released to the public earlier this week. The documents contain internal communications within the SEC, which provide much-needed insight into William Hinman’s, the former director of the SEC’s corporate finance division, 2018 speech in which he claimed that Ether (ETH) should not be categorized as a security. Hinman famously said during his speech: Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. In the now publicly available internal communications, Hinman said: Attached please find a draft of the speech I had mentioned, which suggests that we don’t need to see a need to regulate Ether, as it is currently offered, as a security. According to the documents, Hinman also did not regard Bitcoin as a security either: Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. Ripple’s Interest in the Hinman Docs Although the documents do not directly pertain to Ripple, the firm believes they are instrumental in proving its case that XRP is not a security. Ripple has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since 2020, when the agency asserted that Ripple sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP as unregistered securities. Ripple’s argument rests on the speech indicating that the regulator does not believe ETH or BTC to be securities and argues that XRP should also not be deemed a security. The SEC was hesitant to hand over the documents but was ordered to do so by Judge Analisa Torres in September. The agency consequently tried to keep the records sealed by arguing that they were irrelevant to the case but was again denied by Judge Torres, who ruled they should be made available to the public. Legal Experts Weigh In Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, commented on the documents in a recent Twitter thread. Alderoty says the discovery reveal that Hinman ignored multiple warnings from collogues who suggested that the speech could create possible confusion in the market. 2/ We now can all see Hinman ignored multiple warnings that his speech contained made-up analysis with no basis in law, was divorced from the Howey factors, exposed regulatory gaps, and would create not just confusion, but “greater confusion” in the market. — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 13, 2023 Alderoty also questioned why Hinman went ahead with the speech despite numerous warnings. 13/An investigation must be conducted to understand what or who influenced Hinman, why conflicts (or, at the very least, appearances of conflicts) were ignored, and why the SEC touted the speech knowing that it would create “greater confusion.” — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 13, 2023 Crypto lawyer John Deaton further offered insights into the communications. Deaton said in a tweet quoting Coinbase legal officer Paul Grewal that the emails indicate how “hypocritical and reckless the SEC is being.” The Hinman emails help @coinbase, #ETH and @Ripple’s fair notice defense. How much it helps anyone in a courtroom is yet to be seen. But in the Court of Public Opinion and in Congress, the emails should help drive attention to how hypocritical and reckless the SEC is being. https://t.co/kdYOSsh2RX — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 13, 2023 Deaton gave an interview to the news agency Cointelegraph, where he said the documents provide support for not just Ripple but for Coinbase and other entities that have been facing “unjust targeting by regulators.” He further opines that the documents could potentially shape legislative discussions in Congress. Deaton is quoted as saying: “The documents are what I expected in two ways. One, it helps Ripple, Coinbase, and others being unfairly targeted by regulators playing fast and loose with the law they took an oath to uphold. How much it helps in the courtroom is yet to be seen, but it certainly helps in the court of public opinion and in the halls of Congress. Two, it highlights the massive conflicts of interests and gross appearances of impropriety by William Hinman and Jay Clayton.” The document’s release comes at a critical time for the crypto industry.

13800853,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537880,1686756634,"Bitcoin Sentiment On Social Media Now Most Red Since COVID Crash, Bottom Signal?","Data shows the Bitcoin sentiment on social media has turned the most negative since the COVID crash, indicating that the bottom could be near. Bitcoin Weighted Sentiment Has Been Negative Recently As an analyst on Twitter pointed out, BTC’s sentiment is in deep red right now. The relevant indicator here is the “weighted sentiment” metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which, as its name already suggests, hints about the general sentiment among investors in the cryptocurrency market. To understand how this indicator works, two other metrics it’s based on must be looked at first. The first is the “sentiment score,” which analyzes social media posts on the major platforms with a machine learning algorithm to check whether the users are being negative or positive about Bitcoin right now and finds the total market sentiment in a score. Naturally, the green values of this score imply that the net sentiment in the market is positive currently, while red values suggest the dominance of a negative mentality. The other indicator of interest here is the “social volume,” which measures the total amount of discussion around an asset that social media investors participate in. The sentiment is found in the weighted sentiment metric by weighting the sentiment score against this social volume. This means this metric would, for example, only show highly positive values when the market sentiment is positive. At the same time, there are also a large number of discussions happening on social media.

This suggests that many discussions related to BTC are happening on social media platforms, and the average sentiment contained in them is negative. From the chart, it’s also visible that the current red values are more negative than any spike observed since way back during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020. Historically, the Bitcoin price has tended to move in a direction that the crowd isn’t expecting. The probability of such price action increases the more the general investors lean towards one particular side.

The cryptocurrency also followed this pattern during the COVID-19 crash, where the deep plunge in the sentiment became a bottom signal for the price. It now remains to be seen whether a similar pattern will also repeat this time as well and Bitcoin will form a bottom off the back of this poor market sentiment or not.

42410419,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKVoc,1686756600,‘Distributed Validator Technology’ Marks Last Key Milestone in Ethereum’s Current Era,"Decentralization is a pillar of the blockchain ethos, and Ethereum developers are now prioritizing a new design feature that could take the precept to the next level.  The push is for “distributed validator technology,” or DVT. The Ethereum blockchain depends on 606,947 validators to confirm transactions made on the network, per BeaconScan, but each of those individually might be seen as a point of failure.  What’s more, the validators themselves can be subject to stiff financial penalties known as “slashing” when they go offline for extended periods. So the validators also have an incentive to increase their own resiliency.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  So the idea is that the validators themselves can become decentralized.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has listed distributed validators among the blockchain’s top priorities since at least 2021, when he wished the Beacon Chain happy birthday and provided an updated roadmap for the second largest blockchain by market capitalization, notable for its smart contracts.  DVT has attracted more discussion and development focus in recent months among entrepreneurs and crypto analysts at firms including Messari, Coin Metrics, Bankless, Wu Blockchain and Pantera Capital.  Under the technology, a validator’s private key – used to sign on-chain operations like block proposals and attestations – can be split across several node operators. As a result, the duties and responsibilities of a validator can be distributed and shared across a cluster of node operators, instead of a single node.  Distributed validator technology “allows you to have multiple parties running a single validator,” said staking service provider P2P’s head of Research Steven Quinn to CoinDesk. “From a technical perspective, what that means is you can geographically distribute the machines.”  The 2021 roadmap, while not entirely complete, shows Ethereum’s trajectory of where it’s been and where it’s going, delineating different eras of current and future development.  Currently, Ethereum is still in the first era, titled, “The Merge,” even though Ethereum has successfully shifted to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, completely overhauling its system for processing transactions.  What’s left among the key milestones in the current era is the deployment of distributed validators, which is on its way thanks to two open-source networks: Obol and SSV.  Obol Network is “responsible for fostering the adoption of multi-operator validation as a use case for Distributed Validator Technology,” as stated on its homepage, and SSV.Network “enables the distributed operation of an Ethereum validator across varying operators,” according to a blog post.  Currently, each Ethereum validator runs on a single node, and both Obol and SSV see this as a single point of failure in the validation process. If a node operator goes offline and becomes unavailable for whatever reason like an infrastructure bug in the validator’s client, then the validator wouldn’t be able to conduct its responsibilities, such as proposing blocks and attesting.  As a result, the validator would incur a slashing penalty for their staked ether. Obol and SSV are attempting to remove this single point of failure in the validation process.  In regards to DVT, Messari research analyst Stephanie Dunbar told CoinDesk, “What I’m most excited about is the idea of increasing resiliency on Ethereum and in the future, potentially on other blockchains as well.”  DVT’s importance lies in making the Ethereum blockchain more resilient, defined as Ethereum being able to “withstand external and internal disturbances - this can be from geopolitics, regulation, markets or even less intuitive disruptions like fires or earthquakes,” Walter Smith from technology-driven investment firm Galaxy to CoinDesk over email.  With more clients and node operators in different geographical areas running a single validator, even if several node operators experience downtime as a result of a malicious actor or a bug in the codebase, the entire validator wouldn’t go down since a significant portion of the network is using distributed validator technology.  “Should <33% of the participating nodes in a DV cluster go offline, the remaining active nodes can still come to consensus on what to sign and can produce valid signatures for their staking duties,” per Obol docs.  Distributed validator technology represents the last critical development in Ethereum’s Merge era before “The Surge,” as Obol and SSV have been gearing up to bring distributed validators to Ethereum mainnet.  SSV is in its last step before its mainnet launch, with the introduction of its public testnet Jato in March, and Obol had started deploying distributed validators on Ethereum mainnet in April.  DVT “makes the heart of the crypto universe - Ethereum - more robust, more decentralized and more credibly neutral, opening its protocols and uses to all in a more stable manner,” according to Smith.",POSITIVE,SSV,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | SSV,Sage D.

Worried investors are looking for alternatives options, and after the dip of Binance coin and OKB they have turned their attention to decentralized exchanges like Tradecurve. Today, we will uncover what this project does right in order to appeal to so many investors, as its price has already surged by 50%. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Binance Coin’s Price Outlook After Recent Fall Binance Coin has been on a downward trend since it reached its all-time high of $686.31 on May 10, 2021. As of June 9, 2023, BNB is trading at $260.17. In the past 30 days, Binance Coin decreased in value by 16.5%, and in the last week alone, its value saw a dip of 15.4%; it is clear that XRP is falling into the red zone. Some of the factors that have contributed to Binance Coin's recent downward trend include the broader sell-off of the crypto market, regulatory scrutiny, the SEC suing the Binance exchange, and the overall pessimism investors have towards its future. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, however, Binance is well-positioned to benefit from increased demand for its products and services, but at this point in time, Binance Coin is still a tough altcoin to buy as it's decreased significantly. Binance Coin is not the only cryptocurrency to dip, as so did OKB. OKB Enters the Red Zone OKB, the utility token behind the global cryptocurrency exchange OKX, has also fallen in regard to its value. As of June 9, 2023, OKB trades at $45.01. In the last week, it has been down 2.3%. OKB is far down from its all-time high point of value, where on February 18, 2023, it reached $58.66. This downward trend is an indication that investors are moving away from centralized exchanges and looking at decentralized alternatives, and OKB's performance will affect their perception of the future of the OKX exchange as well. Tradecurve’s Price Surges By 50% TCRV is the utility token behind the Tradecurve platform, it has seen an exponential level of growth, beating out many CEX-related tokens by showcasing a growth of 50%. This can be attributed to the vast level of utility TCRV brings to the Tradecurve hybrid exchange. Token holders are able to get discounts on trading fees, and users are able to use their tokens to get discounts on subscription fees for signal and AI trading bots. Users can stake their tokens to get access to passive income, and the funds will also be used to provide liquidity to the exchange. Token holders can also access exclusive rewards and bonuses on their trading account and can even use the tokens to level up their account to various VIP statuses, which will provide them with benefits. Tradecurve does not require KYC, and users need to deposit crypto that will be used as collateral to trade cryptocurrencies and any other derivative. During Stage 3, one TCRV token is worth $0.015, and a jump of 100x in value is expected by analysts when the project launches.

It has emerged as a transformative project in the blockchain world, capturing attention with its disruptive vision and groundbreaking approach. Due to the recent surge in demand for WERX tokens, analysts and investors closely examine Uwerx's potential to rival established projects like Filecoin (FIL) and Cosmos Hub (ATOM). This article will highlight why Uwerx's presale is a force to be reckoned with. Uwerx (WERX) Prepares for Beta Version Uwerx stands out for several key reasons. Firstly, its clear vision and focused target market allow it to tailor its platform specifically to the needs of its community, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. The recently launched Alpha version of the project is drawing increased signups. It includes a Landing Page and a Signup page for users to explore while awaiting other project components. The team will deliver the remaining parts weekly/bi-weekly, taking their time to ensure a smooth deployment process without rushing. The rest of the project will include the User Dashboard, Login Page, Setting functionality, and the Job Posting and Hunting sections. After a while, the team will introduce the Beta version of the project. The Beta version is designed to be a testing ground where users can explore the project’s full functionalities. It will also absorb the Alpha version and all its features. Through a dedicated email address, feedback@uwerx.network, users can leave comments and feedback on their experience using the platform. Its agile methodology approach will ensure smooth deployment. The project has introduced another feature, Vault. This Vault will include storage and reward functionalities. The team is pleased to announce that the developers’ liquidity tokens have been locked. The team devised the token lock, a 25-year insurance policy to safeguard the project from rug pulls and whaling. Although it was initially scheduled to happen after the presale, 82.8% of the community thought it would be best if the team brought the plan closer. Later, the team will announce the process and its entirety. The team will also announce a date for the Uwerx airdrop. The decision for an airdrop was reached by 98.2% of the community through a poll. The airdrop will include all holders on the platform and enable the validation of users receiving wallet addresses. By obtaining audit approvals from SolidProof and interFi, Uwerx aims to continue its journey toward legitimacy and transparency. The developers will give up their smart contract’s right to the project as an act of generosity and maintain a 7% interest. Uwerx wants to provide full community participation for its users and will stop at nothing to offer it. The 15% purchase bonus, benefiting new members, will soon transition to a referral-based reward. Act quickly to secure the bonus and purchase Uwerx at the current price of $0.041. Analysts predict Uwerx to reach $1.672 by Q4 2023 and $2.010 by Q2 2024. Filecoin (FIL) Remains Bearish Filecoin (FIL) is a decentralized protocol that secures data for its users through other users. The network allows users to pay other users to store their data. The network runs two market protocols for effective data transactions. The storage rigs are public and easily verifiable, allowing users to choose their units and customize them based on speed, size, and compatibility. When users offer to store other users' data, they are rewarded with FIL tokens which can be sold on exchanges. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) Could Experience an Upward Trend Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is a decentralized project that aims to create a network where blockchain protocols can interact and share information to increase transaction time and improve scalability. The network’s ecosystem uses the BFT and Tendermint consensus protocols to manage each blockchain correctly. The Hub aims to provide smooth interchain transactions, exchanges, and security. Each blockchain on the Cosmos Hub (ATOM) network maintains its sovereignty and is highly scalable and sustainable. The project’s native token, ATOM, aids the network's staking, governance, and security functions. As Uwerx's presale gains momentum, it seeks to establish itself as a prominent player in the freelance market, challenging the dominance of Filecoin (FIL) and Cosmos Hub (ATOM).

13799051,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537908,1686751871,Bitcoin (BTC) Stored On Exchanges Plummets Amid Regulatory Uncertainties: Santiment,"So far, the supply of Bitcoin (BTC) held on exchanges has recently seen a significant decrease, reaching levels last observed in February 2018. This trend underscores a developing pattern in the crypto market – traders and investors preferring to secure their digital assets outside of these platforms. Data from the blockchain intelligence firm, Santiment, confirms this trend, as reported in a recent tweet. It revealed that the decline in Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges could be attributed to the prevailing uncertainty associated with the legal actions taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against cryptocurrency giants, Binance and Coinbase. Regulatory Tensions Drive Bitcoin Off Exchanges According to Santiment, the ongoing SEC lawsuits against major exchange platforms have prompted a shift in the dynamics of Bitcoin storage. The firm maintains that as long as these lawsuits persist, Bitcoin holders will continue to seek safer self-custody options, minimizing their reliance on exchange platforms. As Santiment pointed out: Bitcoin’s exchange supply has now fallen to its lowest level since February 2018. Traders continue moving BTC to self-custody during the uncertainty surrounding Binance and Coinbase. As long as these SEC lawsuits loom, this trend should continue. Notably, the latest reports reveal that Amy Berman Jackson, a District Judge in the United States, has instructed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance.US to find common ground concerning the original order to freeze the exchange’s assets. Related Reading: Data Reveals Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Refuse To Sell Despite SEC Crackdown Highlighting the broader implications of an outright shutdown, Jackson noted in a hearing on June 13: A total shutdown would yield considerable repercussions, not only for the firm but also for the overall digital asset market. Thus far, it appears both parties are willing to collaborate on a plan that could enable the exchange to evade the comprehensive freezing of its assets. Market Reactions Amid Ongoing Litigation While the legal issues unfold, the crypto market has not remained untouched. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $25,990, marking a modest drop of 0.5% in the last 24 hours and a further plunge of 3.1% in the past seven days. Bitcoin’s trading volume has also recorded a significant plunge from $23.6 billion last Wednesday to $9.1 billion in the past 24 hours indicating less trading activity. The asset’s market capitalization has seen a more than $10 billion loss in the past week, causing BTC’s market cap has plummeted from $518 billion last Wednesday to $503 billion as of today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $26,000, Triggers Over $300 Million In Liquidations Furthermore, the litigation cloud hanging over the crypto giants represents more than a fleeting problem for the crypto industry. It introduces a level of uncertainty that could disrupt the usual flow of operations and, as it is being witnessed, influence the way Bitcoin is stored. Nonetheless, despite these challenges, the tenacity of Bitcoin holders in securing their assets exhibits the resilience of the cryptocurrency industry. As the market navigates the ever-evolving regulatory landscape, market dynamics such as these provide crucial insights into the coping mechanisms adopted by traders and investors.

According to Alchemy, the tool was trained on over 1000 Alchemy docs and other crypto resources to help Web3 developers build software more quickly, and with fewer headaches.  “With AI assistance, web3 developers can tap into a vast array of predefined code snippets, templates, and best practices, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks,” Alchemy said in a blog post.  Elan Halpern, a product manager at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that developers will be able to treat ChatWeb3 like a pair programming partner, “and say, like, ‘Hey, I'm experiencing this weird error on chain, can you help me debug it?’”  In addition to its in-app AI assistant, Alchemy built out a standalone plugin for ChatGPT that can be accessed via OpenAI’s Plugin Marketplace. “Alchemy’s plugin allows developers and non-developers alike to get real-time blockchain information through natural language using Alchemy API endpoints,” Alchemy wrote in its blog post.  This plugin can currently pull information from several different blockchains, including Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon and Optimism.

While the SEC alleged in its suit that the Binance entities sold unregistered securities in violation of U.S. laws and later moved to obtain a temporary restraining order to freeze Binance.US' assets, D.C. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said during a Tuesday hearing that there was ""absolutely no need"" for such an order if the parties could agree on limits.  Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, Binance.US said freezing the company's assets would ""effectively end"" the business. Negotiating limits would in the interim allow the firm to continue operations.  Judge Jackson during the hearing showed concern that a requirement to set up another hearing within two weeks did not give the court enough time to go through the thousands of pages in documents and exhibits received by the parties involved.  ""What I'm looking for is some variation of what we already have.

Gensler said the following at a recent Fintech conference, leaving no doubt on his views on crypto: “hucksters, fraudsters, scam artists, Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court”. Tim Draper remarked in reply to the above in a Fox Business interview: “Weak regulators spread fear, and strong regulators spread opportunity.” Draper said that the problem was that the SEC was spreading fear, and that the innovative projects in crypto were leaving the country. He said that the SEC’s regulation by enforcement was causing a tech flight out of the country, and that it was far better that all the innovation that crypto projects were providing should stay in the United States. The entrepreneur remarked that the tech was fleeing abroad to Dubai, Singapore, Northern Europe, South America and other jurisdictions across the world. His view is that one of the main reasons for the flight is the impact that the Howey test has on classifying cryptocurrencies as securities. He believes that this test is too old to have relevance in the crypto industry, and that it needs to be regulated “in a new way”. Draper accused the US regulatory agencies of spreading fear on new technologies such as crypto and AI, saying: “What’s America going to look like in 40 years? It’s going to be a total wasteland. There’s going to be no technology. Look, crypto is coming. AI is coming. What is this spreading fear about these new technologies? They’re great for us.” On both crypto and AI Draper stated that crypto is disrupting banking, insurance, real estate, government, and much more. He suggests that AI will transform how people are educated, and will carry out all the mundane tasks. He says that all this cannot be regulated out of the country so that the US loses all this innovation. At the end of the interview, Draper made the following comment which spells out his opposition to heavy-handed regulation: “If you have a command and control government that tells everybody what to do, that shrinks the growth rate to almost zero.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

""We are working hard to prepare our business to be fully compliant with MiCA when it is implemented in the next 18 months,"" a Binance spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk.

A hearing took place on Tuesday in which two bills were discussed pertaining to obtaining clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and for stablecoins. Representatives from the crypto industry were present and testified at the hearing. These included: Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, Dr Emin Gün Sirer, CEO of Ava Labs, Aaron Kaplan, Co-CEO of Prometheum, Inc., and Coy Garrison, former counsel to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. Digital Asset Market Structure The memorandum for the hearing posited that the determination of whether a digital asset fell under the definition of a security or a commodity was a “difficult” question in the US. The oft quoted Howey test needs to see all four of its characteristics met in order for any particular digital asset to be constituted as an investment contract, and consequently classified as a security. It is argued that one or more of these characteristics may not apply to certain digital assets. It was put forward how both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) tended to act through enforcement rather than dialogue. “Generally, the SEC and CFTC have attempted to resolve the legal question of whether a digital asset is a security or a commodity through enforcement actions.” It was further added that these agencies do not always agree on which digital assets fall under either of their purviews. The example was given whereby Chairman Gensler of the SEC has said that he considers all digital assets to be securities with the only exception of Bitcoin. On the other hand, the CFTC recently brought an enforcement action against Binance, asserting that Bitcoin, BUSD, Litecoin, and Ethereum were commodities. These inconsistencies were stated to be a good reason for the “urgency of congressional action”. Stablecoins It was laid down that there are four classifications for stablecoins. These include: fiat-collateralised stablecoins, crypto-collateralised stablecoins, commodity-collateralised stablecoins, and non-collateralised stablecoins. It was also stated that there are currently more than 200 different types of stablecoins with a collective value of more than $130 billion. Tether has the biggest market capitalisation with $82.5 billion, followed by USDC with $30.1 billion. Adding complexity to the situation, each state has its own regulatory framework for stablecoins, and various stablecoins could fall under the jurisdiction of different regulators. Vote on bill for clarity According to Patrick McHenry, US House Financial Services Committee Chairman, a digital asset bill will be voted on as soon as lawmakers return from their recess in early July.

Bitcoin Social Volume Shows Drop, Traders Shift Focus Towards XRP & Ethereum According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC’s social volume has decreased since its surge in March. The “social volume” here refers to a metric that tells us about the degree of discussion around a given cryptocurrency that social media users are participating in currently. The indicator measures this in terms of the total number of text documents (that, is the posts on various social media platforms like Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter) that are making mentions of the asset in question. Something to keep in mind is that the social volume doesn’t put any weight on the actual amount of discussion taking place inside any post; what this means is that even if a text document mentions the term several times, its contribution towards the metric’s value would still remain just one unit. The benefit of this restriction is that it provides a better picture of the amount of talk that the coin is receiving from the general user. If the limitation didn’t exist, then a long, isolated post with a large number of references to the cryptocurrency could possibly skew the indicator on its own.

Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the social volumes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin over the past year: How the social volume of the various assets in the sector has changed in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin social volume observed a huge surge in March as the asset’s value first observed a hard plunge and then recovered with a spectacular rally. Related Reading: XRP Smothered In Red Despite Massive Whale Accumulation, Hinman Docs Release Sharp price action like this always brings attention to any cryptocurrency, so it makes sense that social media users started participating in huge amounts of discussion around the coin. Since topping out in April, however, the asset’s price has been in an overall downtrend. The social volume has also been going in a downward trajectory alongside it, although the indicator has observed a small rise during the recent volatile event. The high volatility had come as the US SEC had sued Binance and Coinbase, back to back, leading to widespread panic in the market. As mentioned before, it’s not particularly uncommon to see the social volume jump during such rapid swings in price. Ethereum, XRP, and Binance Coin also saw a spike in discussions related to them during this event, surpassing the levels they have seen during the last few months. While the volatility obviously has a part to play in this rise, it’s also possible that the slowdown in discussions related to Bitcoin has also contributed to it. It would appear that investors have been gradually losing interest in BTC, and are now shifting their focus towards altcoins such as XRP. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.5, down 4% in the last week.

42410421,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKVvE,1686745644,Bitcoin Price 'Throwback' Suggests Potential for Rally to $37K: Valkyrie Investments,"A price pattern called ""throwback"" has emerged on bitcoin's daily chart that could recharge bulls' engines for a rally toward $37,000, according to Valkyrie Investments.  In technical analysis, a throwback is a price drop to a former breakout level or resistance-turned-support. After a breakout, prices rally for some days before losing upward momentum and returning to the breakout point. More often than not, prices surge after the throwback is completed, as Thomas Bulkowski detailed in his book ""Visual Guide to Chart Patterns.""  Bitcoin recently fell to around $25,000, revisiting a former inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) neckline resistance that was breached and flipped into support in March. The 19% pullback from the mid-April high of $31,000 to a former breakout point is a classic throwback pattern, according to Joshua Olszewicz, head of research at Valkyrie Investments.  ""Typically, but not always, prices will break above the neckline [resistance] and then return to that level, currently between $24,000 [and] $25,000,"" Olszewicz said in a weekly market update. ""This behavior is described as a ‘throwback,’ which in this case also includes a nearly three-month bullish reversal falling wedge chart pattern.""  ""Positive resolution of the throwback measures as potentially a pivot-to-pivot trade setup from $25,000 to $37,000,"" Olszewicz suggested.  The chart shows bitcoin recently re-testing the green support zone, completing the throwback. Some technical analysis textbooks say throwbacks take ten days at most, although the time limit is often treated as arbitrary.  The throwback has taken the shape of a falling wedge, a pattern characterized by descending converging trendlines. A falling wedge is also a bullish reversal pattern.  The throwback and the wedge will be invalidated if prices drop to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $23,690, per Olszewicz.  ""Extended price activity below the 200DMA would suggest a chart pattern failure and further range bound activity between $15,000 to $25,000,"" Olszewicz noted.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/14/bitcoins-price-throwback-suggests-potential-for-rally-to-37k-valkyrie-investments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5145eaa7790ede15067a1051bdbd66a91f3f8e03-1280x720.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) traders are taking a defensive stance ahead of Wednesday's meeting of U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) meeting, with most expecting a “hawkish” pause, i.e., the central bank leaving interest rates unchanged while keeping the door open for future increases. The Fed is set to announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC). Puts – or bearish bets – tied to bitcoin are trading pricier than bullish calls heading into the Fed meeting, according to options risk reversals data tracked by Singapore-based crypto trading giant QCP Capital. Traders often consider put bias as showing a nervous mood in the market. Bitcoin is little-changed over the past 24 hours at around $25,900. Top performers amongst digital assets on Wednesday were Binance’s BNB token, which gained 5%, and Chainlink (LINK) which was up almost 3% on the day.  The federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) case against Binance and Binance.US declined to approve a temporary restraining order freezing the U.S. trading platform's assets. The decision allows Binance.US to continue doing business while hashing out restrictions with the regulator. If the two sides can agree on limits, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the D.C. District Court said “there’s absolutely no need” for a restraining order. In the meantime, the judge ordered Binance.US to provide a list of its business expenses to the court, and ordered the parties to continue negotiating. A status update is due by close of business Thursday.  Bitcoin supply on crypto exchanges has slipped to its lowest levels since February 2018, data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment shows. The decline has been particularly considerable since the SEC’s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance earlier this month, with 6.4% of supply leaving exchanges in the past week. Supply has been steadily falling since 2020, when it peaked in the depths of the then-bear market, the data shows. This action suggests traders and investors have been continually taking their bitcoin off exchanges in favor of self-custody, said Santiment.  Chart of The Day  Charts show the spread between the Federal Reserve's benchmark fed funds rate and inflation metrics – the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the core CPI. (edited)  The spreads have recently turned positive.  In other words, the fed funds rate adjusted for inflation has turned positive, denting the appeal of zero-yielding assets like gold and bitcoin, according to Singapore-based QCP Capital.

Switzerland-based Block Green has built a marketplace where liquidity providers looking for bitcoin-native investments can buy future hashrate, or computing power, over a specified period of time. The liquidity platform includes “know-your-miner” information about the miner's financials and operations.  The Crusoe transaction is the largest to date on the platform, while another one for 7.5 BTC of Merkle Standard's hashrate closed this week.  Under the deal, Crusoe will direct bitcoin rewards from 220 petahash/second (PH/s) of mining over 90 days to Swissborg, a Switzerland-based crypto exchange.  Block Green focused on ""offering attractive and scalable yields to bitcoin holders,"" which has ""triggered a lot of demand from institutions holding bitcoin"" given that bitcoin yields offered elsewhere remain low, said Sebastien Hess, CEO and co-founder.  ""The biggest challenge with hashpower sales has been finding natural buyers,"" and Block Green has ""prioritized finding holders of bitcoin who are looking to find a way to generate a yield,"" said Chase Lochmiller, CEO and co-founder of Crusoe.  The platform currently hosts 40% of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners and is onboarding more every week, said Hess. It is also working on a sustainability evaluation framework for miners' operations. There is a ""growing demand for green BTC among LPs, who are even willing to pay a premium for it,"" said Hess.

The US SEC said in a June 13 letter to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that it requires an additional four months, or 120 days, to respond to Coinbase’s request for it to provide clarity regarding the cryptocurrency industry. The SEC filed the letter in response to an order made on June 6 which asked the agency to address Coinbase’s call for clarity or if it needs more time to formulate a response. The SEC’s latest comments come after a string of court filings from both the agency and Coinbase’s part. Coinbase filed a writ of mandamus against the SEC after the regulator said it was in no hurry to respond to the exchange’s demands for regulatory clarity. In its filing, Coinbase accused the agency of purposefully ignoring its petitions for adopting clear rules for the crypto industry. The exchange filed the petition after the SEC said it would not entertain Coinbase’s request for immediate clarity of cryptocurrency regulations. On May 15, the SEC filed a response to a previous petition by Coinbase and said it was not prepared to give into the exchange’s demands. The agency further stated it is not obligated to meet the requirements set out in Coinbase’s petition. It said the exchange requested complex rulemaking in an unreasonably short amount of time. Coinbase Demands Regulatory Clarity The SEC’s May 15 refusal was in response to a narrow action file by Coinbase in April compelling the agency to give a ‘yes or no’ answer to a petition filed in July 2022. The 2022 petition outlines a list of questions seeking clarity on the nature of securities and how the SEC determines whether an asset is a security. Coinbase filed a previous petition on March 20 requesting the agency exclude staking from its list of securities. New Regulations Are Urgently Needed: The SEC Disagrees In its refusal to give into Coinbase’s request for regulatory clarity, the SEC argued new regulations are necessary as it deems digital assets securities. The agency said: The rulemaking petition as to which Coinbase seeks an immediate determination asks the Commission to take a series of discretionary actions to replace existing applicable securities laws and regulations with a comprehensive new regulatory regime for the trading of crypto assets that are securities. The SEC’s reluctance to provide the US with a more precise and comprehensive regulatory regime is particularly concerning at the moment. The agency launched severe action against Coinbase and its rival Binance, accusing both of alleged securities violations. The move caused panic across the board, highlighting the need for clarity.

However, on June 10, the downward trajectory of DOT’s value showed signs of easing, giving the asset a chance to reverse some of its recent losses. Despite this glimmer of hope, the road to recovery remains challenging for Polkadot. As of now, DOT continues to face a considerable setback, with a seven-day decline of 9.31%. CoinMarketCap reports DOT’s current price at $4.65. This substantial decrease in value has raised questions about the asset’s ability to regain its previous strength. DOT 7-day price movement.

Bitcoin’s Potential Impact On DOT Price: A Glimmer Of Hope? Meanwhile, Bitcoin has long held the power to sway the prices of other digital assets. As the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s movements often have a ripple effect on the broader market. This correlation raises the possibility of a potential lifeline for DOT amidst its recent struggles. DOT market cap currently at $5.5 billion.

On the other hand, HUT's mining capacity has remained constant since 2021 while competitors expanded aggressively. Reliance on mergers (external growth) to solve energy woes and capacity growth does not instill investor confidence in HUT's ability to meet guidance and expectations. HUT's pre-merger attraction diminishes along with the merger by being one of the smallest (by capacity) to join the billion-dollar valuation club. CLSK remains the most attractive Bitcoin mining company when compared to RIOT, MARA, and post-merger HUT (even under optimistic expectations). Introduction The theme of our past 4 theses on Hut 8 Mining Corp. ( HUT ) has been about cost inefficiencies. 3 quarters after our last coverage, our theses remained intact as HUT continued to suffer even more operating setbacks since then. In light of HUT's recent potential all-stock merger with US Bitcoin Corp, we aim to revisit our HUT investment thesis to prepare for the potential 2024 Bitcoin bull market. HUT's Reliance on Unpredictable External Growth HUT's expansion plans faced a major setback in 2022. In Q2 2022, HUT guided investors that it will have 6 EH/s mining capacity by the end of 2022 (Figure). In Q3 2022, HUT's projected end-of-2022 capacity was revised lower from 6 EH/s to 3.5 EH/s . In Q4, HUT was silent on its expansion plans. It is not until HUT announced an all-stock merger with US Bitcoin Corp that HUT can provide proper guidance on year-end capacity (7.02 EH/s post-merger) in 2023Q1. To us, this series of events isn't particularly reassuring of HUT's ability to meet guidance and expectations. Other Bitcoin mining companies such as Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) provide clear-cut projections and demonstrate commitment and the means to realize their projections through predictable internal growth rather than unpredictable external growth (e.g. merger). For instance, CLSK exceeded its 6 EH/s projected 2022 capacity and is on track to 16 EH/s by the end of 2023. We showed that CLSK is likely going to raise an additional $100mil capital through 24% shareholder dilution (equity offerings) to fund its expansion. It remains to be seen how HUT will expand through internal growth post-merger. Figure 1. HUT's Failed To Achieve Its 2022 Guided Milestone (HUT) The Energy Crisis We Warned About In addition to operation expansion, HUT's existing mining operation also suffered major setbacks. In 2022Q4, Bitcoin production dropped 40% due to energy disruption at its North Bay facility. HUT has filed a lawsuit against its energy provider, Validus, alleging that the provider failed to meet contracted energy delivery. However, Validus denied HUT's allegations alleging HUT failed to make related payments. There is no telling how long before this issue can be addressed. Even without third-party unsystematic risks, HUT also suffered from systematic risks derived from higher energy prices. In 2023Q1, Bitcoin production dropped another 32% due to electrical issues at its Drumheller Facility. HUT explained : The electrical issues at the Drumheller site have been compounded by high energy rates which further increased curtailment at the site. This statement aligns with the Canadian Electric Power Selling Price Index (Figure 2) where energy costs peaked in 2023Q1. Figure 2. Canadian Electric Power Selling Price Index (Statistics Canada) HUT's Energy issues weren't new. In 2022Q2, we published a piece where we warned our readership saying: HUT's operating cost per BTC (excluding depreciation) in Q2 is $20,200, up from Q1's $13,800. This implies that HUT was operating at a loss when Bitcoin traded below $20,000. Hence, there is significant risk of halting operation should operating loss (mainly cash expenses) eat into its cash position faster than cash raised through issuing new shares (dilution). During the quarter, HUT's operating cost increased by 50% QoQ which HUT attributed the operating cost increase to higher energy prices. Therefore, It is no surprise that HUT had to halt certain operations in 2023Q1 considering energy prices had been increasing since 2022Q2 (Figure 2). Should energy prices stay elevated, HUT will risk more operation disruption in HUT's mining operations. According to Coindesk , the US Bitcoin Corp merger will provide HUT with access to cheap energy. It also remains to be seen whether it is sufficient to solve HUT's energy woes. Valuation HUT is currently valued at about $1bn post-merger with 7 EH/s capacity. Prior to HUT's operation disruption in 2022Q4 and 2023Q1, HUT's total mining cost per BTC is about $40,000 (Table 1). Assuming a $1bn valuation, 7 EH/s projected mining capacity, 9,233 Bitcoin reserves valued at $27,000 per Bitcoin, a 5x earnings multiple, and optimistic cost improvements, our model suggests that Bitcoin has to trade above $62,000 to justify HUT's $1bn valuation post-merger. Post-merger, HUT will join RIOT and MARA in the billion-dollar valuation club. However, HUT will also become a Bitcoin mining company with one of the least mining capacities to do so. RIOT and MARA are projected to have 12.5 EH/s and 23 EH/s mining capacities respectively by the end of 2023 while HUT will only have 7.05 EH/s. On the other hand, CLSK is on-track to 16 EH/s capacity by the end of 2023, more than double HUT's 7 EH/s. At the same time, CLSK is priced at only $428mil, less than half of HUT's $1bn valuation. In comparison, Bitcoin has to trade above $67,915 and $50,737 to justify RIOT's and MARA's current valuation respectively. This implies that HUT could have more upside than RIOT if HUT can solve its energy woes through the merger. On the other hand, CLSK is already undervalued at $27,000 per Bitcoin as CLSK is already trading below adjusted net asset value. Therefore, CLSK appears to be the most attractive among the 4 mining Bitcoin companies while our model views HUT as only more attractive than MARA under optimistic expectations. Table 1. HUT's Historical Total Mining Cost Per Bitcoin QR((CY)) Total Mining Cost per Bitcoin 2023Q1 70,900 2022Q4 59,900 2022Q3 44,800 2022Q2 49,500 2022Q1 40,748 2021Q4 40,168 2021Q3 27,709 2021Q2 34,659 2021Q1 38,604 Source: Author Verdict In this article, we discussed HUT's energy woes and worrisome growth trajectory. HUT's merger with US Bitcoin Corp does provide a slither of hope to address these issues. Assuming this merge can address HUT's energy woes, HUT is better valued than RIOT. Even so, MARA and CLSK are both better valued than an optimistic HUT. HUT's pre-merger primary attraction was derived from its massive Bitcoin reserves. Unfortunately, this attraction will be diminished because HUT will no longer trade below adjusted net asset value post-merger.

The bot took advantage of MakerDAO's 'DssFlash' contract, which permits users to borrow any amount of DAI without incurring fees, according to crypto data provider Arkham Intelligence.  A flash loan is a type of loan that is received and paid back within a single block without any upfront collateral. In this instance, the bot borrowed 200 million DAI tokens and supplied them to the Aave DAI market, borrowing $2,300 worth of wrapped ether (WETH) against it.  That WETH was used to buy Threshold Network (T) on Curve before it was sold on Balancer in a myriad of single-block transactions.  The total profit before fees was $33, however, it incurred almost $30 in transaction and protocol fees, leaving a net profit of $3.24.

13795225,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537847,1686740438,What Bitcoin And Crypto Traders Can Expect From Today’s FOMC Meeting,"The Bitcoin and crypto market faces the most important event of this week and probably the entire month of June today with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) at 2:00 pm EST (release of the interest rate decision) and the following press conference at 2:30 pm EST. For the first time since the Fed started its rate hike cycle in March 2022, an overwhelming majority expect a pause. The CME FedWatch tool currently indicates a 95.3% probability that there will be no change at today’s meeting. A breather, in other words, keeping interest rates at current levels, would give the central bank more time to observe the effects of its fight against inflation. And big banks agree with these expectations. As macro analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) shows, only one of nine major banks, namely Citi, expects another 25 basis point rate hike. All other major banks such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley expect a pause. Most important, therefore, will be the new “dot plot”, the Fed members’ projection of future interest rate path. Any correction to the upside will likely drive equities down and the dollar index (DXY) up, according to the analyst. Bitcoin and crypto are likely to follow this trend. Happy hawkish pause day! The market gives a 96% probability that the Fed pause today after hiking rates at every meeting since March 2022. Major banks agree. Most important, will be the new ‘dot plot’ —> any revisions higher would spook equities lower and the dollar higher. pic.twitter.com/M8UQkmXoZG — tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) June 14, 2023 The US bond market is currently pricing in another rate hike by the Federal Reserve and a rate cut by the end of 2023, as Walter Bloomberg reported today. However, it is likely to be more binary, says Michael Contopoulos, director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein Advisors, in a note. Related Reading: FUD Or Real: Is Binance Selling Bitcoin To Prop Up BNB? Either the Fed does not cut, or growth falls off so hard it is cutting a lot,” Contopoulos says. His guess is the former. “Higher than expected CPI could very well tilt them to a hike. Otherwise, I think they will pause,” he says. The bond market is pricing in 200 basis points of rate cuts in 2024, the expert says, adding that this would mean the recession won’t hit until next year. “I tend to agree with that”. However, it is not inconceivable that the Fed could hike further after a pause. As the Bank of Canada (BoC) shows, this is entirely possible. The BoC raised rates again by 25 basis points (to 475 bps) in June after a two-month pause. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Looks Set To Start Recovery Toward $27K, Here’s Why And the probability of another quarter-point rate hike in July is 63%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. In this respect, the dot plot could be the trend-setting indicator today to gauge whether equities as well as Bitcoin and crypto are falling or rising. If the dot plot sees any downward revisions, BTC and crypto are likely to start a new upward push. Otherwise, any upward revisions (“higher for longer”) of the projections would be rather bearish. And as on-chain analyst Ali Martinez noted today, the Bitcoin price is on thin ice: Notice the most important support zone is between $22,785 and $23,595 where 1.34 million wallets hold 450,000 $BTC. On the flip side, #BTC faces stiff resistance between $26,000 and $28,250 where 5.18 million wallets bought 2.1 million BTC. At press time, the Bitcoin price remained relatively calm ahead of today’s interest rate decision. In the 1-hour chart, BTC shows a good chance of a breakout from the current mini range (coincides with the $26,250 resistance to the upside of Ali) around the FOMC meeting, which should trigger another round of volatility.

Salesforce will use the technology in its Web3-related customer relationship management (CRM) products.  The funding comes during an extended crypto bear market that has increased the focus on infrastructure projects that could bring more Web2 users into Web3 technologies. AI-related technologies have also had a recent surge of popularity in crypto, including the $43 million fundraise for Gensyn, a provider of blockchain-based computing resources for AI, in a round led by noted investment firm Andreessen Horowitz.  “Our aim is to empower organizations to thrive in Web3 by providing them with a holistic view of how customers interact with their brand across traditional and emerging digital channels,” Max Comparetto, co-founder of Salesforces’ Web3 Studio, said in a statement. “With the integration of Mnemonic's insights into Salesforce Web3, we can help customers make better data-driven decisions on critical aspects such as partner selection, Web3 product pricing and audience targeting for airdrops.”  San Francisco-based Mnemonic offers application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide NFT data, analytics and insights to help developers and enterprises create Web3 products and experiences in a faster, more reliable way. The data includes real-time advanced sales price data, marketplace activity, and NFT trait details for filtering and personalized recommendations. Mnemonic also includes spam detection to remove noise and help protect users from less reputable NFT collections.  “We initially started with the idea of just enabling developers, enterprises and businesses to build with comprehensive, real-time, high-quality data that is derived from the blockchain because it’s very difficult to index and process that data.” Andrii Yasinetsky, Mnemonic co-founder and CEO, said in an interview with CoinDesk. Yasinetsky, a veteran of Google and Uber who holds several patents related to self-driving vehicle technology, co-founded Mnemonic with Chief AI Officer Elena Ikonomovska (a former Reddit data scientist) and Ben Metcalfe, who is not involved in the startup’s day-to-day operations.  The company has since evolved to focus on business use cases and hurdles in Web3, said Yasinetsky. That includes improving engagement, personalization, transparency and discovering new revenue streams – all powered by the Mnemonic-provided data and analytics.  The new funding will help Mnemonic build out its use cases, deepen the analytics offered, expand its market reach and strengthen its partner ecosystem. The company currently supports the testnet of Base, a layer 2 incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase.

Industry body, Blockchain Australia, called out restrictions and said it wants to tackle the issue ""head-on by using real data,"" in a Wednesday announcement.  Recently, Australia has seen a string of instances in which banking partners have blocked payments to cryptocurrency exchanges. Last week, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) applied partial restrictions citing ""scams and the amount of money lost by customers."" And earlier this month, Binance Australia halted Australian dollar (AUD) deposits and withdrawals by bank transfer ""due to a decision made"" by a third-party payment service provider.  “The recent decision by banking institutions to restrict millions of their customers from making payments to cryptocurrency exchanges represents a profound curtailment of economic freedom in Australia,"" said Jackson Zeng, director of Blockchain Australia. ""Every individual has the inherent right ... to make decisions on how and where to use their finances ... The principal role of banks is to facilitate these decisions, not to impose restrictions upon them.”  The industry body has decided to host a roundtable discussion on June 27, during Blockchain Week in Australia, to discuss the issue with policymakers, potentially including Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.  ""Blockchain Australia considers that blanket restrictions have very costly side effects, not only limiting consumer’s use of their own money, but also shifting the behavior of those at risk of scams or fraud into another type of scam or fraud which may be harder to detect,"" the announcement said.  The body plans to start an education program for consumers on crypto and its benefits – including how to identify scams and recognize good actors in the space – and seek acknowledgement of those practices by the banks.  Getting ""banks to provide opt-in protection and education to users, or provide targeted approaches to specific categories of at-risk customers with appropriate education and notification,"" may be a ""more effective"" solution to reducing crypto-related scams without payment restrictions, the announcement added.

With a current market valuation of $83.37 billion, USDT is by far the most valuable stablecoin in existence. Stablecoin use has soared over the last few years, and Tether has been working hard to diversify its reserve holdings in response to the growing need for trust in the network.

After 12pm UTC today, #Binance will be swapping 750M USDT-TRX for USDT-ETH directly with the Tether team to ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains for our users.

This token swap will involve Tron, the ninth largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $6.3 billion, and Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $210 billion, after Bitcoin. By exchanging bitcoin from one blockchain to another, or “swapping chains,” investors can get access to all of the blockchains that back the digital money they possess. Their digital assets can be used on other blockchains that support them. Related Reading: Solana Price Plunges Below March Low – Could It Drop Further? The move to rebalance the liquidity base of USDT on Ethereum by shifting from the region of surplus to the region of scarcity remains the most reasonable explanation of the various theories being put forward as to why the USDT is being switched.

Tether re-minted $1 billion in USDT on the Ethereum blockchain on Monday, prompting the swap. Tether’s CTO Paolo Ardoino tweeted that the recent $1 billion mint was part of the company’s effort to restock its Ethereum Network storage.

Even with the potential end of Fed rate hikes in 2023, North American investors have been pulling funds from crypto investment products. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has been negative since mid-May. However, history shows BTC rallies when the hiking stops. With the backdrop of a US Securities and Exchange Commission that has been dropping bombs throughout the cryptocurrency industry via lawsuits with Binance (BNB-USD) and Coinbase (COIN), the altcoin market has dealt with a substantial amount of selling pressure in the month of June. Much of that pressure is in reaction to accusations by the SEC that several major cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities. Bitcoin Dominance Is Growing In the SEC's lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the agency has added language that claims top altcoins like Cardano (ADA-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), and Polygon (MATIC-USD) are all unregistered securities. Since those designations, the performance of those coins has been abysmal with some of them declining by as much as 20% in just a 15 minute period in early morning trading on June 10th. Data by YCharts With the SEC wielding its sword in the altcoin market, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dominance is at a two year high of 48%. The chart below shows Bitcoin's dominance against the full crypto market and includes the top stablecoins like Tether (USDT-USD) and USD Coin (USDC-USD): Bitcoin Dominance (CoinMarketCap) On its own, Bitcoin's resiliency against other coins in the crypto market this year is notable. In my view, it gets even more impressive when we look at Bitcoin's dominance against just the other proof of work coins in the market like Litecoin (LTC-USD), Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD), and ZCash (ZEC-USD): Bitcoin Dominance (Bitbo.io) There we see Bitcoin at a 95.7% dominance figure. This is also a 2 year high Proof of Work coin dominance figure and not far from a six year high of 96.4% from February 2017. At that time, the price of BTC was closer to $1,000 per coin. I suspect that this resurgence in broad dominance can continue given the regulatory environment for the rest of the crypto market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has insinuated in the past that BTC is the only coin in the crypto market that isn't an unregistered security. To be clear, dominance doesn't mean BTC's price can't go down. But there are potential macro catalysts that could push BTC higher even as other coins move lower given the regulatory environment. Fed Pivot? There has been a lot of anticipation for the Federal Reserve's June rate hike decision both from crypto market participants and from the broader financial markets. Following the release of May CPI on June 13th, the target rate probability for ""unchanged"" at the June 14th Fed meeting jumped to over 94%: Target Rate Probability (CME FedWatch) With the prospect of no hike, the equity markets have been rallying for most of June. As of article submission, that month to date rallies in both the S&P and the Nasdaq are approaching 5%. Given Bitcoin's previous correlation with the equity markets, one might expect to see the same price move in BTC. However, since Mid-May bitcoin has been more correlated to Gold and negatively correlated to equities: BTC Correlations (The Block/Crypto Compare) As of June 12th, BTC's 30 day correlation with the Nasdaq is minus 0.69 while the correlation with metal is 0.7. Though it should be noted that the last time the correlation with equities was this negative, there was a dramatic reversal one month later. If history repeats, this could be an indication that either BTC is set to rally or stocks could soon roll over. What we don't know is whether or not any halt in rate hikes in June would indeed be the end of this hike cycle. But if one takes the view that it is the end of the cycle and looks to 2019 as a comparison, it is possible that Bitcoin's bottom is either already in or is not too far away: FRED In the chart above, I'm showing the month end level for the effective federal funds rate overlayed with the monthly price change in BTC. We observe a 62% increase in the price of BTC in May 2019. This would have been 5 months after the rate level increases were essentially over. Of course, this may not be a perfect analog for our current situation because of the vastly different regulatory climate. Beyond that, the institutional demand for BTC and other cryptos appears to be waning. Fund Flows CoinShares publishes a weekly report that tracks the flow of funds in many of the major digital asset investment products globally. These products include funds from Grayscale, ProShares, and numerous others. As of the June 12th report, CoinShares notes 8 consecutive weeks of crypto fund outflows totaling $417 million: Digital asset fund flows (CoinShares) Looking at the flows from a year to date standpoint, the biggest contributor to the outflow globally has been Canada at -$286 million. However, in the report CoinShares stated that the firm believes the outflows are monetary policy related and indicative of investor caution regarding the hiking cycle. If that is true, the digital asset fund outflow problem could be coming to an end soon. I'm not willing to say I agree with that concerning all crypto assets, but it is a possibility to consider for BTC specifically. 10 BTC Holders (LookIntoBitcoin) I think it is also fair to wonder if some of the investment fund outflow is explained by repositioning to self-custody. At a little over 156k unique wallet addresses, the amount of on-chain holders with at least 10 BTC has been slowly grinding up near the all-time high of 157k over the last several months. BTC Exchange Balances (CoinGlass) Furthermore, the long term trend in exchange balance is trending lower. Currently there are just 1.89 million BTC on exchanges. This is down from over 2.1 million leading up to the collapse of FTX last year according to data from CoinGlass. Summary None of this means the price of Bitcoin has to go up. In fact, I suspect we may even see a short term decline in the price of BTC as the markets digest the Fed's June meeting. Even though the end of the hiking would likely be very good for BTC's price, headwinds remain. There doesn't seem to be much doubt the US federal government is in the ""fight them"" phase of its crypto journey. Despite that, the US government still controls over 205k BTC from Bitfinex and Silk Road seizures: BTC Holdings (Dune Analytics/21Shares) That Bitcoin is valued at over $5.3 billion at current market prices. In the investment world, fund flows have been negative year to date yet BTC is up over 50%. BTC is coming off exchanges and large wallet holders are rising judging by the 10 BTC minimum and whole-coiner growth metrics. Bitcoin has been battling a tough rate hike cycle that could be coming to an end shortly. It's not up against the same regulatory pressure as competing cryptocurrencies. Short term direction is anyone's guess. But medium to long, I think BTC ends up higher from here. In the world of the coins, BTC is still the king.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611405-bitcoin-still-the-king-of-the-coins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13793688.jpeg
13793553,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/puma-launches-second-digital-experience-with-black-station-2,1686735900,Puma Launches Second Digital Experience With Black Station 2,"German footwear giant Puma has launched its new 3D metaverse experience titled Black Station. The experience is for everyone, but Puma pass holders will be eligible for exclusive perks. Puma has called Black Station an experimental home for product drops, which will give unrestricted access to Puma Pass NFT holders. Expanding On Initial Launch Black Station is Puma’s second foray into the world of Web3, following the launch of its first Web3 project, Black Station 1. Black Station 1 was launched in September during the New York Fashion Week as part of the Futrograde fashion show. According to the firm, the latest Web3 experience from the brand can be explored by everyone. However, only users that possess RB tokens airdropped to Puma Pass holders can purchase a digital “Rulebreaker” sneaker and claim two digital wearables. A developer working on the program stated, “If you do not own an RB token, there is still so much to explore. Unkai, our city in the clouds, and Unter, our exhilarating club below, both are filled with mysteries to explore and collect.” RB token holders can burn the token on Black Station between the 13th and 20th of June and gain access to product drops in the metaverse. The Black Station roadmap also details several general events and NFT drops scheduled for later this year. Furthermore, events scheduled for 2024 are also in the pipeline. An Immersive Environment Black Station allows users to access a highly immersive environment created in collaboration with Unreal Engine. Users can shop for limited-edition digital and physical sneakers. The second edition of Black Station builds on this, expanding into two more digital worlds, each having a unique sneaker tied to it. Head of emerging marketing tech and Web3 at Puma, Ivan Dashkov, stated, “As we move forward into this second launch, we want to target a broader audience and let anyone come in, experience it and play with it. We’ll iterate from there and continue to broaden our approach.” Users can access the world through blackstation.puma.com and walk to a Puma elevator. From there, users can choose to go to the Unkai, inspired by Shibuya, or to Unter, inspired by Berlin’s nightlife. Users in Unkai can float between Lego-like blocks in the sky. It also features the Super Puma mascot and giant Puma shoes. In Unter, users can experience an underground red-lit cave and follow neon green footsteps into a Puma rave room or see a giant Fast-RB Puma shoe. Additionally, there are also hidden easter eggs. Dashkov added, “The two spaces are fun because they’re so different. There are also a couple of easter eggs we’ve hidden throughout the space related to our other NFT project, Super Puma PFP, in both the visuals and the story.” The launch comes as other competitors such as Nike released its first ever drop on the .Swoosh Web3 community platform. The collection, called “Our Force 1” pays homage to the legendary Nike Air Force 1 sneakers which were launched 41 years ago. Sticking With Ethereum The experience will remain open until the 23rd of June. Additionally, Puma had stated that it was also exploring the possibility of alternative chains. However, it eventually decided to stay with Ethereum. It was reported back in February 2022 that Puma had registered an Ethereum Name Service domain. It also changed its Twitter name to Puma.eth. The company had also invested in several feline-inspired NFTs such as Gutter Cat Gang, CatBlox, Lazy Lions, and Cool Cats NFT. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410422,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKVyX,1686735715,Fed Preview: Bitcoin Market Skews Bearish as Analysts Anticipate 'Hawkish Rate-Hike Pause',"Bitcoin (BTC) traders are taking a defensive stance ahead of Wednesday's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, with the central bank seen likely to leave interest rates unchanged while keeping the door open for future increases in a move some observers described as a ""hawkish pause.""  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to announce the interest rate decision on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC). Half an hour later, Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a press conference.  Fed fund futures show interest-rate traders expect the central bank to hold the benchmark borrowing cost steady in the 5%-5.25% range, having raised by 500 basis points (5 percentage points) since March 2022. The steep rate-increase cycle, coupled with the balance sheet shrinkage, destabilized risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, last year.  The central bank, however, is expected to indicate a potential for continued tightening over the coming months. At press time, Fed funds futures showed just over a 50% probability of the Fed raising rates by another 25 basis points in July. Implied rate cuts from the year-end have been priced out of the forward rates curve.  Puts – or bearish bets – tied to bitcoin are trading pricier than bullish calls heading into the Fed meeting, according to options risk reversals data tracked by Singapore-based crypto trading giant QCP Capital. The put bias shows a nervous mood in the market.  ""For the FOMC meeting, we think the risk is that they do a 'hawkish skip' – implying they pause at this meeting, but raise their median dot [interest rate] projection to show a continued hiking bias to appease the committee hawks,"" QCP Capital's market insights team said in an update published Tuesday, adding that ""risk-reward balance this week favors being long BTC and ether puts.""  The U.S. headline consumer price index (CPI) slipped to a two-year low of 4% in May, falling below the current Fed funds rate. That has created room for the Fed to hold rates steady at Wednesday's meeting, according to QCP.  However, both headline CPI and the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core PCE at 4.7%, remain well above the central bank's long-held target of 2%, leaving the Fed less room to end the tightening cycle.  Besides, positive inflation-adjusted interest rates, also known as real rates, often weigh over zero-yielding assets like gold and bitcoin.  ""Positive real rates generally are bad for zero-yielding assets, and generally, BTC has been negatively correlated with real yields,"" QCP added.  Historically, some crypto traders have looked to post-Fed moves in the U.S. stock markets to decide on their plans. That strategy may not work this time, given the recent weakening of the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq equity indexes.  ""A Fed rate hike skip is likely to be celebrated by equity bulls who have already helped fuel the S&P 500 to new yearly highs,"" Joshua Olszewicz, the head of research at alternative asset management firm Valkyrie Investment, said in a weekly market review published Monday. ""Bitcoin and Ethereum have not benefited from a risk-on-equity environment over the past few weeks, potentially hinting at the unease regarding pending regulatory actions.""  According to David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, the consensus for a hawkish skip means Powell may struggle to out-hawk the market, allowing a recovery in risk assets.  ""The consensus is for the hawkish skip, so the bar might be quite high for Jerome Powell to out-hawk the market,"" Brickell told CoinDesk. From a communication perspective, I think it’s difficult to sound too hawkish when you’re taking a pause, so my bias would be that it’s interpreted as more dovish relative to expectations Rates [yields] then, I think, drift lower and BTC rallies, but I’m not expecting it to trigger a big move.""

""MicroStrategy's views since 2020 have been that the only institutional grade asset is bitcoin,"" said Saylor in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. ""It's pretty clear that the regulators don't see a legitimate path forward for cryptocurrencies ... And so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin-focused industry with maybe half a dozen to a dozen other proof of work tokens.""  Last week, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the two largest crypto exchanges by market cap. A total of 19 tokens have been mentioned in the filings. Bitcoin isn't one of them. Previously, SEC chair Gary Gensler has said that bitcoin (BTC) is a commodity.  Saylor's MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin in 2020 while calling the cryptocurrency a million times better store of value than gold. The company now holds approximately 140,000 bitcoin worth about $4 billion. In March 2023, Saylor lost a bid to dismiss claims that he failed to pay personal income taxes, interest and penalties due for Washington, D.C. However, the court dismissed claims that Saylor and MicroStrategy had conspired to violate the law.  Saylor said that since 25,000 other cryptocurrencies (approximately) have been angling to position themselves as bitcoin or a better bitcoin, the public now understands that bitcoin is the next bitcoin. He said the ""next logical step"" is for bitcoin to multiply 10 times in value to $250,000.  ""Eventually, I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realising that bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space, and their business models are fine when bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10,"" Saylor said.

13792471,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/terra-classic-community-unanimously-passes-parity-upgrade,1686732840,Terra Classic Community Unanimously Passes Parity Upgrade,"A group of Terra Classic Core developers, the Joint L1 Task Force (L1TF), has announced that it is ready for the Parity Upgrade, set for the 14th of June, 2023. The Terra Classic Community unanimously voted in favor of Proposal 11561, paving the way for the critical update to be implemented. The Parity Upgrade With the Terra Classic community passing the proposal, the Join L1 Task Force will initiate the upgrade on the 14th of June, bringing a host of significant changes to Terra Classic. The primary change will see the upgrade bring Terra Classic to parity with other blockchains, such as Terra 2.0 and other Cosmos chains. This will allow developers and projects to start building once again on the Terra Classic chain. The Parity upgrade is considered one of the most significant upgrades since the Terra community took control of the project following the Do Kwon-led Terra-Luna fiasco in May 2022. Do Kwon now faces multiple charges, and was arrested in Montenegro. Terra Classic will undergo the Parity upgrade at block height 13215800 and will be initiated at 14:00 UTC on the 14th of June. However, the block height and upgrade time could be changed. Validators and nodes must install the V2.1.1 release before the upgrade. The upgrade primarily consists of features such as a minimum 5% commission for validators, CosmWasm V1.1.x, and two security upgrades. Other significant changes included in the upgrade are WasmVM upgrade to V1.1.2, WASMd upgrades for multi-chain capability, IBC go v4.3.1, along with bug fixes. Unprecedented Support Proposal 11501 upgrade to V2.1.0 received unprecedented support, with 99.99% votes in favor of the proposal. The proposal received a minuscule 0.01% “No” votes. It also received almost no “abstain” and “no with veto” votes, indicating the strong level of support for it within the Terra Classic community. Several prominent validators supported the proposal, including Orion, Coinpayu, Allnodes, Interstake One, StakeBin, and others. Developers Urged To Reach Out The main goal of the Parity upgrade is to put Terra Classic at par with other Cosmos chains, such as Terra 2.0. This would allow developers and projects to create and upload their applications on the Terra Classic network. Joint L1 Task Force member LuncBurnArmy stated on Twitter, “As I believe everyone in the #LUNC community is aware, this upcoming Wednesday, the 14th of June, is a milestone upgrade for the blockchain, as we will be at parity with other Cosmos blockchains, providing dApp developers with a much easier process of bringing their dApps over.” Decentralized applications (dApp) and smart contract providers were urged to update the codebase of their projects to CosmWasm v2.1.0 and upload it. The Joint L1 Task Force announced that it would be helping dApps with several crucial requirements for the upgrade. Owners of decentralized applications with sealed smart contracts were urged to contact developer Fragwuerdig if they require help with the CosmWasm parity upgrade. Name Changed To V2.1.1 Joint L1 Task Force members also made crucial changes to the original V2.1.0 upgrade and changed the name to V2.1.1. According to GigHub, developers made around 19 additions and 9 deletions to files in the upgrade. This includes changing logs and fixing missing labels in the Wasm client. A Historic Milestone Terra Luna Classic staking also achieved a significant milestone as the upgrade looms, reaching 1 trillion LUNC staked. Furthermore, the community has burned an additional 63 billion LUNC. As a result, the staking ratio has reached a record high of 14.61%. Currently, out of 6.84 trillion LUNC tokens, around 5.8 trillion are in circulation. “BREAKING: #LunaClassic officially has 1 TRILLION $LUNC staked! Congratulations to the community for this historic achievement! Let’s go for 2 TRILLION next! Send it!” Furthermore, the price of the LUNC token has seen a sustained rally following the news of the upgrade. The token was also the only cryptocurrency to remain positive last week, while all others were in the red. The asset’s price has seen a jump of over 11.50%, rising to $0.000097, and could increase further following the Parity upgrade. The trading volume has also seen a considerable increase, rising by 120% in the last 24 hours. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The exchange filed for bankruptcy in May, and its legal bid to let customers once again access holdings faced opposition from the U.S government, which says it’s still owed millions for sanctions violations.  In his Tuesday ruling, Judge Brendan Shannon authorized Bittrex U.S. and its affiliates “to permit their customers holding undisputed, noncontingent, and liquidated claims to withdraw cryptocurrency assets and fiat currency from the Debtors’ trading platform to the extent of such claims.”  The judgment doesn’t determine who legally owns those assets, or whether customer claims are favored over the government’s, the ruling added, and there could be clawbacks in future.  Patty Tomasco, a partner at law firm Quinn Emmanuel who's representing Bittrex, told CoinDesk in an email that “the platform will be up and running for withdrawals on Thursday, June 15.”  The exchange experienced millions of dollars of withdrawals after saying in March it planned to close U.S. operations the following month. The unit filed for bankruptcy May 8. As of May 10 the company said it held $300 million in customer cash and crypto in the U.S. arm. While bankruptcy proceedings normally include a freeze on transactions, the company argued it wanted customers to be able to access their money without protracted litigation.

13791598,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537822,1686730249,FUD Or True: Is Binance Selling Bitcoin To Prop Up BNB?,"Despite the recent flood of major news in the crypto sector, one topic is more hotly debated than any other at the moment: Is Binance selling Bitcoin on the spot market to prop up the Binance Coin (BNB)? NewsBTC already reported yesterday that the rumor emerged after crypto trader “JW” drew attention to eye-catching data. However, the rumor stands on shaky legs and data. Still, there are a few data points that experts are calling striking. Popular trader @52Skew stated that he can confirm that “it looks like BTC is being sold for USDT reserves”. Via Twitter, the crypto trader shared the chart below and explained that USDT reserves have been aggressively pumped into BNB since May 27th. Moreover, BNB is supposedly being sold to BUSD in order to suppress the volatility of BTC: BUSD is pumped into BTC to suppress downside volatility so BTC can be swapped out for USDT. This is technically market manipulation, Binance is definitely up to something here to prevent BNB from crashing as well as BTC. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao aka “CZ” felt compelled to respond to the allegations a few hours ago. Via Twitter, CZ called the trader’s allegations “FUD” and questioned the data. Related Reading: Binance CEO Controversial Move: Selling Bitcoin To Save BNB? “4. Binance has not sold BTC or BNB. We even still have a bag of FTT. It is amazing they can know exactly who sold based on just a price chart involving millions of traders. FUD,” writes Zhao, who also accuses the trader of self-serving intentions: “Maybe they are shorting… who knows.” Renewed Binance FUD Or Real? However, the voices about unusual price action on Binance are increasing. Joe Consorti, market analyst at The Bitcoin Layer, states that there is a lot of selling pressure on Bitcoin on Binance that is not present on other exchanges: More cannon fodder that they may be selling spot BTC to prop up BNB. The $220 level is being staunchly defended – may be a liquidation level for a BNB collateralized loan. As reported by NewsBTC, BNB is facing a potentially disastrous situation following an exploit on Binance Smart Chain’s Binance Bridge. The exploiter could be liquidated for $200 million on Venus Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) if BNB’s price falls below $220. Related Reading: BNB Price Prediction: Recovery Could Fade Above $260 In light of this, “Binance critics” suspect that the exchange wants to keep BNB above $220 at all costs to prevent a “liquidation waterfall”. However, the CVD data is not really capable of proving this rumor true. The cumulative volume delta (CVD) shows the cumulative volume changes based on the trading volume of aggressive sellers versus aggressive buyers. This allows a judgment to be made on the volume of an asset, but not on the source of the volume. Therefore, until further evidence is presented, the rumor must be dismissed as just that: a rumor. Even if the CVD data shows an anomaly, this may be due to exceptional market activity on the world’s largest crypto exchange. At press time, the BNB price is up 5.4% in the last 24 hours, trading at $248. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is slightly down -0.8% in the same time period.

13791397,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/uniswap-unveils-plans-for-v4-invites-community-feedback,1686729540,"Uniswap Unveils Plans For V4, Invites Community Feedback","The largest decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap has unveiled plans for Uniswap v4, the next iteration of the hugely popular crypto platform. The exchange has also open-sourced the draft code, enabling the community to build on it. Uniswap v4 Uniswap v4 brings with it several customizable features. Furthermore, for the first time ever, Uniswap Labs, the entity behind the DeFi platform, is inviting community feedback on Uniswap v4 before its eventual public launch. Speaking about the upgrade, lead smart contract engineer at Uniswap Labs, Sara Reynolds, stated that the possibilities are endless and open-sourcing the source code could allow the community to “take it anywhere.” Uniswap noted in a blog post, “We’re thrilled to introduce our vision for Uniswap v4, which we believe will open up a world of possibilities for how liquidity is created and how tokens are traded on-chain. We are releasing the draft code now so that v4 can be built in public, with open feedback and meaningful community contribution.” According to Uniswap, the idea behind incorporating community feedback before the public launch of its latest iteration is to underscore the protocol’s dedication to decentralization. Decentralization is a key difference that separates traditional centralized exchanges (CEX), such as Coinbase and Binance, from decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap. Both Coinbase and Binance are facing lawsuits filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Expanding Its Capabilities Uniswap is widely known for popularizing AMMs (Automated Market Makers), which is a type of smart contract. Automated Market Makers facilitate trades between different cryptocurrencies without requiring any intermediaries. The protocol’s current v3 version debuted in 2021 on the Ethereum blockchain and made waves with the introduction of the above-mentioned Automated Market Makers, along with multiple fee tiers and on-chain price oracles. Currently, Uniswap v3 is the largest decentralized exchange in terms of trading volume and has processed over $1 trillion in transactions since its introduction, according to data from DeFiLlama. The v4 upgrade looks to expand the protocol’s coin-swapping capabilities, introducing a new type of smart contract called “hooks” and custom liquidity pools. Hayden Adams, Uniswap Labs CEO, described hooks as plugins that allow the customization of how pools, swaps, fees, and liquidity provider positions interact. This allows developers to expand on already existing liquidity pools. New Features And Performance Improvements Adams also stated that the new functionalities in v4 could pave the way for added features such as dynamic fees and on-chain limit orders. These features are typically available on traditional platforms but are more difficult to implement on blockchains that do not feature intermediaries or centralized order books. Adams also added that v4 would introduce several performance improvements and fee reductions. Anyone will be able to create pools thanks to Uniswap’s permissionless nature and facilitate the purchase and sale of crypto. Furthermore, the Uniswap Labs CEO added that network gas fees which are required to list new pools, will be reduced by 99% in v4. The protocol is also releasing its plans for Uniswap v4 to the public to gauge their feedback, although Adams stated that it could take several months for v4 to go public. “It’s really here as an initial implementation of this protocol and a vision for what it will be, but it’s not finished. There’s time for people to give feedback, time for people to find improvements and optimizations, time for people to also start preparing to build on top of it.” Moving Towards Increased Decentralization With community feedback, Uniswap is adopting an even more decentralized approach. This comes against the backdrop of stringent regulatory action by US regulators against centralized exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, both of whom are facing lawsuits. Currently, it remains to be seen how the Securities and Exchange Commission could initiate action against decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. However, it has clarified that it intends to increase its oversight of the decentralized finance ecosystem. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bankman-Fried has been under the legal spotlight after the collapse of his crypto exchange in November. After originally seeking his extradition based on charges of wire fraud and money laundering, U.S. prosecutors have subsequently asked for more charges to be added including bank fraud and bribery.  Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has moved to dismiss many of them – in particular arguing that he should have the right to mount a legal challenge before the Bahamas agrees to add extras to the charge sheet.  “Leave is granted to the claimant to commence proceedings for judicial review,” Bahamas Supreme Court Judge Loren Klein said on Tuesday. Klein's comments favor Bankman-Fried's bid to contest the position taken by the Bahamas minister and Attorney General. “All of the grounds advanced by the claimants disclose arguable claims with a real prospect of success.”  Klein said that the Bahamas government cannot add the additional offenses until that legal process has finished. The Bahamas government had previously argued the issue of consenting to the U.S. request was a mere matter between sovereign states. Klein also added that the review should take place “in an expedited manner,” though said he didn’t want to pre-empt its findings.  A subsequent Tuesday filing, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, Mark Cohen said he “intends to file an application for judicial review as directed by the Supreme Court and to continue pursuing his legal rights in The Bahamas.”  Cohen has previously warned that legal measures in the Bahamas could take “months or years,” pushing them beyond the planned October U.S. trial date, or meaning he doesn’t have enough time to prepare a defense to the extra charges.

This development carries significant implications for the future of the cryptocurrency market. During an address in 2018, former head of the SEC’s finance division William Hinman essentially declared that Ether (ETH) was not a security since it had become “sufficiently decentralized.” The documents in question pertain to this speech. Related Reading: Solana Price Plunges Below March Low – Could It Drop Further? On Tuesday morning, as soon as media outlets had obtained copies of the Hinman speech materials, the price of XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, soared to $0.56, a 2023 high. XRP Soaked In Crimson Amid Hinman Papers Disclosure Now, red was the dominant color for XRP at the time this article was written. CoinMarketCap data shows that XRP has traded at $0.51, down 2.31% in the previous 24 hours. Among the hubbub around the release of the Hinman documents, the token also suffered a hit in the weekly timeframe, falling by 2.18%. Source: CoinMarketCap According to early reports, the freshly disclosed Hinman records have far-reaching consequences, suggesting a positive outcome for Ripple (XRP) in their lengthy legal struggle against the US regulator. As stated by Hinman in his talk: “Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.” Many news organizations have recently expressed optimism that the information contained inside the Hinman documents could be decisive in Ripple’s ongoing legal showdown with the SEC. However, at the moment, such optimism doesn’t mean much in terms of XRP’s price movements, as seen in the graph below: XRP price trajectory retreating in the red zone in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Whales Scoop Up More Of The Crypto As new details unfurl, on-chain data reveals that crypto whales had spent an additional $170 million in XRP in the days leading up to the release of the Hinman speech papers. Below is a chart from Santiment showing the 310 million new XRP that crypto whales with 1–100 million in their holdings bought between June 10–13. XRP price climbing as per whales' wallet balances. Source: Santiment If the fresh investment made by whale investors is valued at the market price of $0.51, then their total accumulation is worth around $158 million. As XRP finds itself painted in crimson, the anticipation of a favorable rally in price in the midst of the drama portrayed in the SEC versus Ripple legal tussle grows. When whales spend so much on a particular cryptocurrency, and in this case XRP, it usually means they expect the price to rise, and this indicates confidence in the broader crypto market. But, the question is – will this huge appetite by whales enough to pump new vigor into the crypto? XRP market cap currently at $26 billion. Chart: TradingView.com A Climb To $0.60, Or A Drop Below $0.51? Meanwhile, the recent market integration of XRP’s latest developments raises questions about the influence of major XRP holders, and their potential efforts to drive the price up to $0.60. These influential entities possess substantial amounts of XRP and may utilize their holdings to exert upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s value. Related Reading: XRP Could Be Set For A Breakout As Investment Inflows Continue However, there is also a possibility that XRP may experience a decline, falling below its important support level of $0.51. Factors such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and broader economic conditions could contribute to a potential decrease in XRP’s value. Ultimately, the interplay of various market forces and the sentiment among XRP holders will determine whether the cryptocurrency will rally towards $0.60 or retreat below the critical threshold of $0.51.

Banq, a former subsidiary of embattled crypto custodian Prime Trust, has filed for bankruptcy in a U.S. bankruptcy court in the district of Nevada.  In the bankruptcy filing, the company cited approximately $17.72 million in assets against $5.4 million in liabilities.  This comes as Banq’s former parent, Prime Trust, works to close an acquisition deal with BitGo after facing a financial crisis as a result of the Celsius bankruptcy.  Meanwhile, TrueUSD, which has a banking relationship with Prime Trust, said that its pause in stablecoin mints and redemptions has to do with “Prime Trust's bandwidth issues”.  South Korean crypto yield firm Haru Invest also engaged in an operational pause citing difficulties with an unnamed service provider, which is thought to be Banq or Prime Trust.  Banq’s internal issues  The company also notes in its filing that $17.5 million in assets were taken in an “unauthorized transfer” by former officers consisting of trade secrets, as well as proprietary information and technology, to Fortress NFT Group.  Fortress NFT Group was founded by Banq’s former CEO, CTO, and CPO. Banq has sued Fortress for allegedly stealing trade secret information to launch rival NFT platforms Fortress NFT and Planet NFT. It further alleges they engaged in fraudulent activities to cover up their misconduct.  Banq said in a suit against the trio that Scott Purcell, its former CEO, attempted to pivot Banq towards NFTs. Facing pushback from its board and shareholders, Purcell founded Fortress NFT and then sold Banq’s computers, intellectual property, and corporate infrastructure to the new company.  “Their theft of Banq’s corporate assets even included taking the company’s seat licenses for Las Vegas Raiders’ games at Allegiant Stadium, all without Board approval or knowledge. Specifically, Defendant Purcell transferred the seat licenses owned by Banq to himself,” the suit reads.  In early 2023 a Judge ordered the case to go to arbitration as Purcell and the other defendants in the case signed arbitration clauses.  Banq has been referred to as a subsidiary of Prime Trust in a May 2022 court filing, though Prime Trust currently says it only owns a marginal stake in the company, and referring to it as a subsidiary is inaccurate.",NEGATIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY | TUSD,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/14/prime-trust-unit-banq-files-for-bankruptcy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cceeeb214a5eb4b8cd9d05b2d0f7214871099e75-5180x3453.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Is it decentralized enough? While the industry figures itself out, it is now or never for an ETHUSD rally, or there is heightened risk of a catastrophic breakdown in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Will Carnage Across Crypto Cause Ethereum To Collapse? Ethereum and most other altcoins have taken a brutal beating lately, brought on by enforcement actions taken by the US SEC against top crypto exchanges. While Ether hasn’t been caught up in the list of cryptocurrencies labeled securities, the market is skeptical that it wont also find itself among the SEC’s list. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Weekly Golden Cross, But Is It Enough To Save Crypto? Ethereum isn’t quite as “safe” as Bitcoin from regulatory scrutiny due to its recent change to proof-of-stake. However, it is arguably decentralized enough, which could turn out to be a key measure of what does or doesn’t make a security, according to the recent Hinman docs. The drop from here looks treacherous | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Why ETHUSD Is At A Critical Inflection Point A technical price bounce in ETHUSD is necessary at this point, or else it could find itself at risk of total collapse. That is if the long term rising wedge pattern breaks down from this level. In contrast, if the level holds, the top trend line of the wedge is located at roughly $10,000 per token. From a risk versus reward standpoint, the stakes are high — stratospheric new all-time highs at some point, or unprecedented new lows and the worst bear market in Ethereum’s history. And it all comes down to this pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Throwback” Could Trigger Flawless Technical Bottom Formation With such little liquidity in crypto, a clouded regulatory climate, and economic turmoil everywhere, a negative ruling in the loosely related XRP case could ultimately push Ether off the cliff it’s hanging from. Meanwhile, returning risk appetite and a pause in interest rate hikes combined with a positive ruling in the XRP case or elsewhere in the SEC drama, could save Ethereum from certain doom. #Ethereum team blue 🔵 or team red 🔴 Reply with why you picked your color ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/UTygTqQqWE — Tony “The Bull” (@tonythebullBTC) June 14, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

Edward Moya, a Senior Market Analyst with OANDA, sees the likely possibility of the Fed skipping a rate hike on Wednesday (prediction markets are giving it a 96% chance of happening) and increased regulatory scrutiny of altcoins as fuel for bitcoin’s support.  ""Cooling inflation report is fueling this bull market as the Fed should have no problem skipping a rate hike on Wednesday. Wall Street is becoming a little bit hopeful here that an FOMC June skip could eventually become a July pause,"" Moya said in a note. “Bitcoin remains stable around the $26,000 level as investors consider reducing altcoin exposure and increasing Bitcoin holdings.”  Driven by falling car wholesale prices and weaker consumer support, disinflation, alongside the likely rate hike skip, is causing a decrease in the dollar's value, Moya observes, and a steady demand for used vehicles, and clothing among other necessities; China's stimulus package and expected Saudi oil price cuts have uplifted crude oil prices, and while low inflation initially boosted gold, continued stock growth may limit its rise.  At the same time, one key bitcoin technical analysis indicator, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), has flipped bearish, signaling a possible extended price slide, despite Bitcoin maintaining support at $25K. In CoinDesk’s coverage of this, however, analysts noted U.S. inflation figures and the Fed’s possible rate hike skip could also impact Bitcoin's price performance.

After all, Hong Kong is in the process of making rules for crypto. In the U.S., Coinbase has to sue to try and compel the SEC to make rules for it to operate.  So on paper Coinbase making a move to another jurisdiction would make sense, and Hong Kong, with its rulebook and traditional position as a fast-moving market hub in Asia, would be a logical place to move to.  In theory.  But the reality on the ground is that Hong Kong’s rulebook itself isn’t all that attractive to crypto exchanges.  First, the number of tokens available to trade will be limited compared to what users can expect from established exchanges.  Per rules from the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong’s securities watchdog, there needs to be a 12-month cooling off between token launch and listing. Stablecoins are banned, as are crypto derivatives, earn or lend programs and likely staking services too. Airdrops are a huge no-no.  “Hong Kong's framework as it exists today is highly unattractive. The market is small and unproven, banking partnerships are non-existent, and products are highly restricted,” Leo Weese, co-founder and President of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, told CoinDesk.  Weese says that the Asian markets are “fundamentally different” from their Western counterparts, and Coinbase would not automatically succeed in Hong Kong, even if they were willing to give up their current customer base.  “What makes Hong Kong potentially attractive is that many tokens are not deemed securities, and those that are do not need to be registered like in the United States, making it possible to offer trading for tokens that are deemed unregistered securities elsewhere, such as decentralized protocols,” he said.  At the same time, Weese notes, moving to Hong Kong will not automatically shield Coinbase from U.S. regulation or the arm of the SEC.  BitMex, which calls Hong Kong home, got ensnared in U.S. regulatory regime despite its tenuous ties to the United States. And so did Binance – its mothership and founder squarely offshore.  So even if Coinbase were to make the move, it wouldn’t be a very productive decision.

13781443,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537779,1686700801,"XRP SEC Case Could Be A Boon For Ethereum, Here’s Why","Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a sharp decline since Saturday, dropping from the $1,838 line down to the current level of $1,738 while XRP traded sideways. This has caused concern among investors and traders in the Ethereum market. However, experts and analysts believe the recent disclosure of the Hinman documents on June 13th could mark a relief wave for Ethereum’s price. The Hinman documents refer to a series of emails and memos from the former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, recently released to the public. The Hinman documents include a series of emails and memos from the former director of the SEC, who declared in 2018 that Ethereum’s native token, Ether, is not a security. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market At Decision Point: Will This On-Chain Retest Be Successful? Ethereum Traders Should Keep An Eye On The XRP Case Recently, the release of emails from former SEC official William Hinman regarding Ethereum has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community. While some have claimed that the documents are a smoking gun for the cryptocurrency, others have downplayed their significance. However, analyst Adam Cochran has argued that the documents are a nuance that puts current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in a corner. The Hinman speech attempted to clarify the SEC’s position on digital assets, such as ETH and XRP, and their relation to security regulations. In his speech, Hinman went beyond the scope of the Howey test and attempted to understand the nuanced intent of users vs. investors. He also questioned the concept of morphing, or whether something can be a security and then later not a security. The feedback comment from SEC staff specifically noted to him that they wanted to pivot to the discussion of “what is a security” rather than the idea of morphing. And that their concerns came from implication differences between the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Hinman specifically drew attention to the idea that “promoters” have a very specific legal analysis point – and that even a coordinated group of actors working on something wouldn’t rise to the level of being deemed the promoter if their efforts weren’t essential. The draft on Ethereum, which came after meeting with Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder, and his lawyers, noted that Ethereum was not at such time a security and that secondary sales didn’t raise Securities Act concerns – only Exchange Act and Commodities Act concerns. According to Cochran, that footnote is of incredible importance as it notes that the SEC internally viewed secondary sales not as sales of the promoter at the time. Furthermore, Cochran believes the documents are damning for Gensler’s position because they acknowledge the idea of ‘reverse-morphing’ of an asset becoming a security. Suppose the SEC wanted to argue that Ethereum is a security today. In that case, they must acknowledge the idea of ‘morphing’, prove the burden of a promoter being liable for all secondary sales of an asset ever, and break every precedent of horizontal and vertical commonality. Cochran further claimed: For Gary to conclude that proof-of-stake Ethereum is a security, he would both need to fight a landslide of precedent on the most litigated part of Howey analysis – and admit to the idea that securities status can change over time with decentralization.

Overall, many market analysts believe that disclosing the Hinman documents could boost Ethereum’s price in the short term. This is because it removes some of the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and could increase investor confidence in the cryptocurrency.
