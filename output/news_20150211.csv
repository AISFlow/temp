42426283,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhrh,1423689324,New York City Councilman Proposes Bitcoin Payments for Fines and Fees,"New York City Councilman Mark Levine has announced he will introduce a bill tomorrow that, if adopted, would move the municipality to accept bitcoin as payment for fines and fees.  The full bill would give New York City the ability to “enter into agreements” with financing agencies to allow it to accept bitcoin. Parking tickets and court fees would be among the items that would then be payable in bitcoin.  Levine  , a democrat representing the 7th District in Northern Manhattan, is particularly passionate about developments in the bitcoin community, citing its popularity among younger demographics in statements to The New York Post.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “This is a really exciting bill. We really want to engage with the bitcoin community, which is growing by leaps and bounds.”  A Harvard graduate with a BA in physics, Levine is a member of the city's finance, education, housing and buildings, government operations, and rules committees.  The New York City Council is a 51-member group that serves as the city's main lawmaking body and is solely responsible for its budget.  Added fees may apply  Also present in the text is language that would enable New York City to collect “reasonable and uniform fees” for accepting bitcoin.  “Such fee shall not exceed the cost incurred by the agency or department in connection with such bitcoin transaction,” the bill reads.  The spokesperson was not able to provide further details of the steps the bill will need to go through to become law. However, the text notes that the bill would take effect 180 days after its enactment.  The introduction of the bill follows news that the city’s finance department was conducting research as to whether bitcoin should be accepted for parking violations.  New York City is not the first municipality to consider accepting bitcoin for government payments, following the city of Pittsburgh in its considerations.

42426286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLhth,1423681230,"Bitcoin Transactions Will Double By 2017, Research Finds","A new report from Juniper Research forecasts that the number of bitcoin and altcoin transactions will more than double by 2017 to 56 million, up from 24.7 million in 2014 and 18 million in 2013.  The finding is part of a new report from the market intelligence firm that analyzes the volume and value of transactions in the cryptocurrency markets and predicts the value of all bitcoin and altcoin transactions will fall by 58% in 2015, to just over $30bn.  Still, Dr Windsor Holden, head of consultancy and forecasting at Juniper, suggested that those who read the report should scrutinize its more positive conclusions, as he believes bitcoin is unlikely to gain significant transaction as a means of payment.  In particular, Holden voiced his belief that transaction volumes are not rising at a pace that would be on par with a technology reaching mass adoption.  Holden told CoinDesk:  “I think the challenges are so great that bitcoin will struggle as an actual payment mechanism. It will struggle to go over a fairly core audience who are the very techy and the libertarians, and those who partake in nefarious activities.”  Still, Holden sees potential for cryptocurrency to help improve the payments ecosystem. For example, he cited the decentralized payment system developed by Ripple Labs, which uses a native currency for settlement, as one that could become part of the financial infrastructure.  The findings are part of what Holden said is likely to be an annual report on the digital currency industry from the Juniper team.  For the report, Juniper used publicly available data to determine the volume and value of bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and auroracoin on a month-over-month basis throughout 2014.  Volume to rise, while value falls  Holden indicated that while the total value of bitcoin and altcoin transactions is likely to continue to fall, this is indicative of the recent decline in the bitcoin price.  While volumes will likely rise, Holden suggested, this increase won’t be enough to offset the total decline in value, which resulted in 58% decline projection.  He projected a “reasonable increase” in transaction volumes in 2015, but noted that much of this activity is taking place on exchanges, and is therefore not correlated to spending.  Further, he cautioned readers not to “believe the hype” surrounding the industry, stating that he believes the total user base for bitcoin to be smaller than advertised.  “When you look at the actual number of wallets and people who regularly make transactions, rather than just store half a bitcoin, you’re talking about a couple million max,” he added.  He also sought to debunk the idea that merchant adoption would lead to an increase in consumer use, adding: “It doesn’t necessarily follow that the more retailers that deploy it, the more people will use it.”  Steep education process  In his explanation, Holden compared bitcoin to another relatively new payment method, near-field communication (NFC) in the face of changing consumer behavior.  “I’ve argued that the issues facing NFC are nothing compared to the difficulties facing bitcoin from a trust and customer perception,” he said.  To this point, he cited the continued reports of scams in the bitcoin industry, mentioning Hong Kong’s MyCoin, which was recently revealed to have potentially absconded with roughly $8.12m in customer funds.  The full paper, titled The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin & Altcoin Impact & Opportunities 2015-2019, is now available on the company’s website.

The CCB reports that 43 investors between the ages of 21 and 71 years old lost anywhere between HK$50,000 to HK$15m each when the exchange ceased operations. Such estimates would place the total consumer loss at HK$63m, or $8.12m at press time.  Local media reported Monday that the total losses could have been as high as $387m, however, these figures were based on the exchange's own estimates of its business volume.  Hong Kong lawmakers are now urging the government to impose a ban on bitcoin. In total, more than 25 customers in a MyCoin fraud case approached the police with their statements against the bitcoin exchange.  Former customers who spoke to the police were reportedly accompanied by lawmakers Leung Yiu-Chung and James To.  ""The government should not just stand aside,"" Leung said. ""It's simply not enough to just ask people to exercise caution when investing ... It has to ban the circulation of such virtual currency in the market.""

42426255,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLehh,1423662523,Mycelium's Bitcoin Wallet Suspended from Google Play Store,"UPDATE (13 February 15:30 GMT): Mycelium's bitcoin wallet app has been re-instated into the Google Play store, following the removal of its 'donation button'.      Mycelium's bitcoin wallet app has been removed from the Google Play store as of yesterday, the company has confirmed.  The wallet provider, which currently has ""between 50,000 and 100,000 users"" announced the news via a Reddit post.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Jan Dreske, a Mycelium developer, said:  ""We received an email from Google yesterday evening after uploading a new beta version for our testers, and the app was suspended at the same time.""  Dreske explains that the email cited ""violation of the paid and free provision of the Content Policy and section 3.5 of the Developer Distribution Agreement"" and referred Mycelium to a Third Party Payments help centre article.  The Content Policy states that developers are exempt from using Google Play's in-app billing service as a method of payment ""where the payment is for digital contents or goods that may be consumed outside of the app itself"".  The developer added that the team could not find any direct contradiction to the Terms of Service, saying that they ""explicitly allowed to collect money for goods used outside the app"".  Transaction fees  The decision to remove the app from the Google Play store has not gone unnoticed by commentators.  A Reddit user, who goes by the name of 'bgrnbrg', suggested that the ""small percentage"" charged to small traders may have resulted in the removal of the app.  This potential cause of the app's removal is outlined in Section 3.5, which notes: ""If the product is free, you will not be charged a transaction fee. You may not start charging a user for a product that was initially free unless the charge correlates with an alternative version of the product. The Payment processor must process all fees a developer receives for any version of a product distributed via the store.""  No impact to 'current users'  Dreske said that they are ""currently unable to push updates through the Google Play store, which will turn into a problem if this situation does not get resolved"".  However, ""current users will not experience any problems"", as already installed apps ""work fine"", he said.  Dreske confirmed that a complaint explaining why Mycelium feels ""the app was removed in error"" has been filed with Google.  CoinDesk contacted Google about the matter, but the company declined to comment.

The Medic Mobile project, Lighthouse's demo campaign, has now been reset to allow for an additional fundraising round to begin.  The news comes via a blog post, in which Mike Hearn, the app's developer, offers some updates and long-term plans.  Not all targets reached  Despite this success, however, not all projects reached their set fundraising targets.  Richard Myers, a developer at Bitsquare, revealed that its crowdfunding campaign had ended without reaching the funding goal.  In his blog post, Myers says:  ""We are disappointed, but also proud and encouraged by the amount of support we did receive.""  The campaign raised around 54 BTC – 45% of its 120 BTC goal with donations from 55 supporters over the course of 20 days.  Hearn described Bitsquare as ""an ambitious attempt to build a fully peer-to-peer, decentralised bitcoin exchange that operates in a similar way to localbitcoins.com"".  Myers remained positive, saying that the team would ""continue to move forward with renewed focus on development without the distraction of money"".  What's next?  Alex Waters, a prominent member of the bitcoin community, is trying to raise $5,000 to launch BitcoinTesting.org.

Users are currently being asked to pledge a dollar-specified amount via the the Vinumeris Crypto Projects Gallery.  Once sufficient interest has been expressed via the former, the crowdfund will be launched on Lighthouse.

Perhaps most notably, Coinbase will be directing the 10,000 users its service has enrolled to ChangeTip in a bid of industry collaboration.  The company’s blog post reads:  “ChangeTip is an excellent example of a company which uses our APIs, and we’d like to support them instead of competing with them.”  Launched in November, Coinbase's feature was enabled by blogs written by television personality Adam Carolla and bitcoin VC Fred Wilson.  At the time, CEO Brian Armstrong sought to position the tool as one that would help empower content creators and position Coinbase at the forefront of enabling bitcoin micropayments.  Speaking to CoinDesk, ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan expressed his appreciation for Coinbase's decision to direct users to its service.  ""We're excited to continue building out our tipping product with features and experiences that create delight and joy for our users,"" Sullivan said.

Lee went on to indicate that the company was not aware of ChangeTip and its service when it started building the feature.  ""The tip button came into existent because we kept trying to find new and novel use cases for bitcoin,"" Lee explained.
