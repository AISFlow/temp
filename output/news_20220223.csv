42416634,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWJeN,1645658954,"First Mover Asia: China CBDC Is No Government Version of Bitcoin; Terra's Luna, Other Altcoins Jump","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Markets: Bitcoin started the day promisingly before dropping, but altcoins Terra, Avalanche and Shiba Inu rose.  Insights: Canadian crypto sanctions show how crypto and CBDCs diverge.  Technician's take: Bitcoin tested the $40,000 resistance level on Wednesday before declining.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $37,306 -1.8%  Ether (ETH): $2,594 -1.1%  Bitcoin spurted ahead through much of Wednesday morning, mirroring the performance of equity markets that, for the first time in days, seemed oblivious to the mushrooming tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border.  But by midday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had declined into red territory after Ukraine declared a state of emergency and urged its citizens living in Russia to depart. U.S. intelligence said that a Russian invasion was imminent.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading below $37,500, down about 2% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands below $2,600, down about 1% during the same period. A number of altcoins had a good day with Terra's luna up about 10%, and avalanche and shiba inu registering healthy gains. Cardano and Solana also rose for the day.  ""The altcoins in the past 24 hours are having a very early spring,"" said Marc Lopresti, the managing director of asset manager, The Strategic Funds, on CoinDesk TV. ""We're going to see continued strength in the altcoins, particularly those that are part of the metaverse,"" he added.  Top Gainers  Top Losers  Markets  S&P 500: 4,225 -1.8%  DJIA: 33,131 -1.3%  Nasdaq: 13,037 -2.5%  Gold: $1,908 +0.5%  Insights  Canadian Crypto Sanctions Show How Crypto and CBDCs Diverge  Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are often equated to bitcoin. Some go as far as to say the eCNY, China’s CBDC, is a “government version of bitcoin.”  But the Ottawa trucker convoy has proven this to be anything but.  As CoinDesk reported Wednesday, the 34 crypto wallets sanctioned by the Canadian government are now mostly empty.  The protestors’ funds are safu. Some of the bitcoin landed on exchanges but at least $500,000 went to another wallet – maybe on a non-Canadian exchange, or maybe a self-custodied one – and was then sent further afield.  Money tied up in fiat currency, however, suffered a different fate because it was frozen in a dragnet to suffocate the protest. The thaw of accounts has already begun and the protest is over.  Civil liberties associations in Canada are concerned at the speed of the freeze and the lack of transparency around the process. Usually lists of designated nationals are public documents; the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control publishes a database that you can peruse to find Russian officials and oligarchs, Iranian hackers and Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam.  Civil liberties groups are challenging the constitutionality of the court order over fears that it could happen again. For now, bitcoin fixes this. But CBDCs? They are problematic. Where the comparison between bitcoin and CBDCs like the eCNY falls short is that bitcoin is decentralized and with no central issuing authority. CBDCs are a digital version of cash issued by a central bank.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use a decentralized ledger but CBDCs are a digital version of cash issued on a digital ledger. CBDC’s digital ledger is similar to a permissioned blockchain, which is likely where the erroneous comparison originates.  One of the key tenets of China’s CBDC is control of the yuan. Control of the supply of the money – WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s digitization of fiat for use on their payment rails annoys the Central Bank – ensures that money can be cancelled.  Should you become too politically noisy, your wallet can be disabled.  During last year’s CoinDesk Consensus conference, Yaya Fanusie, a Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, and former CIA counterterrorism financing analyst, highlighted that China’s CBDC efforts were all about control using the example of H&Ms disappearance in-country over its support for a measure to remove Xinjiang Cotton from its supply chain.  “This is really about data. The key thing here is that the central bank is, I think, inserting itself more into the payment architecture,” he said during Consensus 2021. “You’re creating architecture that gives the government a little bit more insight into transactions.”  The truckers’ evasion of government sanctions by using crypto shows that bitcoin has nothing to do with CBDCs. You can’t ‘’cancel’’ a bitcoin transaction like you can with a CBDC, and the only thing you can freeze are the fiat ramps in Canada.  Granted, an American CBDC or one made by a European country would have more privacy safeguards built into it than one from the People’s Bank of China. But Canadian banks are also subject to privacy law and usually require court orders to freeze accounts.  Regardless of your opinion of the truckers, let’s hope Ottawa’s is the exception, not the norm, and that we do not have to prove if a CBDC would be easier to control than bitcoin.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Bounce Fades; Minor Support at $30K-$36K  Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to re-test the $40,000 resistance level on Wednesday, although the price bounce was short-lived. The cryptocurrency could find support at $36,000 on intraday charts, although stronger support is seen at $30,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is neutral, which means the price could remain within the $36,000-$40,000 range into the Asia trading day. On the hourly chart, however, the RSI is declining from overbought levels. That means sellers could remain active over the short term.  Momentum signals are still negative, which is one reason why price bounces have been brief over the past few months. For now, upside appears to be limited beyond $46,000.

42410910,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtG7p,1645657335,Why White Hat Hackers Are Vital to the Crypto Ecosystem,"This past weekend at ETHDenver, Jay Freeman took the stage to highlight his nearly billion-dollar bug discovery within the core code of Optimism, Boba and Metis, which he dubbed ""Unbridled Optimism.""  Freeman has a history of software development and hacking, notably playing a critical role in the development of software for jailbreaking iOS. His experience has proven to be priceless within the Wild West, open-source crypto industry. Just two weeks ago a smart contract vulnerability left the Wormhole bridge with a $350 million hole to repair – and that wasn't even the largest exploit in recent history. However, Freeman mentioned that bridge exploits are often found quickly as they are used often and watched over constantly by the teams responsible for maintaining them.  Read More: Jump Trading Backstops Wormhole’s $320 Million Exploit Loss  During the first week of February, Freeman discovered a critical bug within Optimism’s virtual machine – one that developers might not have been ready to patch quite as quickly. The bug was rooted in Optimism’s selfdestruct function that allows contracts to be destroyed and sends any remaining ether balance to a designated address.  It sounds dangerous, so why do blockchains contain the selfdestruct function? The function allows for obsolete or dangerous contracts to be removed from the chain while returning the ether balance to the rightful owner.  Unless there is a bug, of course.  Optimism’s selfdestruct function returned the ether balance to the designated address without ever burning the balance within a contract. According to Freeman, “This means that, when a contract self-destructs its balance is BOTH given to the beneficiary AND ALSO KEPT.” If attackers were able to successfully call the contract, they could create a loop that doubles their OETH balance until noticed and patched by Optimism developers.  Freeman noted that he was not the first person to find the bug after scanning previous selfdestruct calls on Optimism and tracking one wallet back to an employee of Etherscan. The employee had found and tested the bug, but apparently hadn’t understood the severity of the situation and let it be. The vulnerability had gotten worse over time as more funds were bridged to Optimism and other layer 2 systems copied the code Optimism had put in place. Layer 2s are companion networks connected but functionally separate from the base layer.  Consequently, Freeman noted, had he not found the bug, a minting vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to double their funds every time the selfdestruct function was called on Boba and Metis as well.  White Hats and DeFi  Even if the Optimism team had noticed and temporarily paused bridge transactions via the sequencerhttps://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/sequencing/ during a theoretical attack, an attacker could have still wreaked havoc on layer 2 decentralized finance (DeFi). Using the falsely minted OETH, any attacker would be able to drain decentralized exchanges and exploit lending platforms with useless collateral. The exploit would have likely caused irreparable damage within the Ethereum ecosystem and layer 2 users could have had all of their funds rendered useless, with no assets left on the other end of the bridge. Combined, Optimism, Boba and Metis had around $750 million locked in DeFi the day the vulnerability was reported, almost all of which was at risk.  The need for friendly adversarialism  Decentralized finance continues to be a vulnerable industry with anonymous founders, open-source code and billions of dollars looking to take on risk. This enormous amount of capital has created an incentive system aligned with teams that build fast and release tokens.  Read More: Wonderland (and DeFi’s) Anonymity Problem  Conversely, caution and professionalism are a lot less exciting to traders and investors. The world economy has seen over and over again the effect of incessant risk taking, even though the market eventually punishes shortcuts. There is no reason to think this same outcome won’t continue to play out in crypto and decentralized finance, with only the most meticulous protocols coming out alive in the end.  Freeman has also contemplated where the middle ground between “Code is Law” and third-party trust falls. He raised the point that bug bounties are essential in incentivizing good actors to seek out and find vulnerabilities. By setting the reward for being a good actor on a similar scale as the payout for being a bad actor, that scale suddenly tilts the incentives toward white hatting.  As Freedman put it, this sort of “friendly adversarialism” can encourage ecosystem participants to be more open, honest and even pessimistic about new ideas.  That pessimism is key. Today, the environment is perhaps overly optimistic, getting investors and DeFi users excited about protocols that could never work or might even be dangerous. This lack of oversight, combined with the nature of open-source code, creates the perfect environment for hackers and scammers, an issue much of the crypto industry does not seem ready to admit.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Edward Oosterbaan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/23/why-white-hat-hackers-are-vital-to-the-crypto-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a98707f8d7c3e8493df351e5ce352030b3d890cb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421197,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIgf,1645655109,The Metaverse Opportunity for Artists,"When the digital artist known as Beeple sold his Everydays piece for $69.3 million in March 2021, the discussion around non-fungible token (NFT) art was catapulted from relative obscurity into the mainstream.  By the end of the year, total sales of digital art minted on Ethereum had swelled to exceed more than $41 billion, according to a report by Chainalysis. Had the value of digital collectibles minted on other blockchains been included in that figure, the total value of the NFT art market may have equaled the traditional art sector which raked in around $50 billion in the same year.  The boom has benefited artists all around the world, allowing them to access lucrative new opportunities via a distributed global audience, while bypassing the traditional gatekeepers of the commercial art world to build a direct relationship with their collectors instead. Additionally, the ability to mint their creations as NFTs has provided unprecedented digital property rights to artists, with blockchain-enabled smart contracts enabling them to collect a pre-programmed and automated royalty on all future sales of their work via secondary markets.  Crypto State by CoinDesk, our virtual community event tour, stops in Southeast Asia on Feb. 24. The discussion will explore the metaverse and its implications. The tour is in partnership with Luno, like CoinDesk owned by Digital Currency Group. Register for ""Metaverse: Gimmick or Distributed Innovation?"" here.  NFTs have delivered huge benefits to creators, but there is a hurdle to get in. It can be particularly difficult in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, where the value of local currencies pale against the dollar, and the cost of an Ethereum transaction is sometimes on par with the monthly average wage. The gas fees required to get started are simply unaffordable for many creators.  Enter the First Mint Fund, which has a mission to help aspiring artists from and currently living in Southeast Asia to mint their first NFT by providing them with ETH to cover the gas fees. The idea is that once the artist has been able to sell and collect revenue from that first NFT, they will be able to reinvest their earnings to cover future transaction fees and ultimately progress toward earning a sustainable living through their art.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Launched in March 2021, the fund was initially only for Filipino artists. But with the goal to make the space more inclusive, soon the initiative was extended to include creators of all types – artists, graphic designers, illustrators, animators, motion designers, musicians and more. It was also extended to the furthest corners of Southeast Asia including Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam.  Established by prominent NFT art collectors, Gabby Dizon and Colin Goltra, the two initially seeded $2,000 to the First Mint Fund through Narra Gallery, an NFT art gallery in Decentraland, which the duo also co-founded together. Dizon is the co-founder of decentralized gaming guild Yield Guild Games (YGG), and Goltra is the former director of growth at Binance Southeast Asia and current chief operating officer of YGG. To date, the First Mint Fund has raised 15.065 ETH and funded the gas fees to launch a total of 95 artists from the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.  Read more: CoinGecko's Bobby Ong on the Metaverse  One notable contributor to the fund was the Filipino-American rapper, Allan Pineda Lindo, better known as apl.de.ap of the Black Eyed Peas, who donated a portion of the proceeds from his first NFT drop.

AJ Dimarucot, who manages the First Mint Fund in a volunteer capacity, shared his thoughts on this project and the NFT scene in Southeast Asia.  Where do you see most of the funding applications coming from?  There’s no formal call out for artists, but we get several applications per week. In the early months, we saw a stream of artists from Indonesia and Singapore apply. Late last year and this year, we’ve seen a deluge of applications from people here in the Philippines.  Read more: How Brands Can Co-Create in a Metaverse  The artists come from non-traditional and non-established backgrounds, and the NFT scene has embraced them. The scene here is widely inclusive, where you can find a child, an elderly man as well as female artists that have immediately made a mark in the space.  Can you share a few examples of artists have you funded?  SeviLovesArt is a 9-year-old boy with autism from the Philippines who is doing amazing work with his paintings. He began painting at age five when he commenced art therapy. There’s also Diela from Indonesia, who has established herself on OpenSeahttps://opensea.io/collection/diela-maharanie-1.. Then there’s Rociel from Malaysia who is now building her PFP collection with other Southeast Asian artists.  What opportunities can the metaverse offer to creators in Southeast Asia that they may not have otherwise had access to?  I’ve been an advocate for online work since 2008, and the metaverse has just added an exponential layer on top of that. It feels like the early days of the internet when people were jumping to work in dot-com projects; there are a lot of people being hired here to work on building metaverse games. And that’s just one aspect, staying independent and building your own NFT project is something where people are finding success too.  Read more: Into the Metaverse With CyBall’s Tin Tran  There are no boundaries in the metaverse, so there’s so much space to carve your own niche. We now have metaverse Filipino workers instead of Overseas Filipino Workers. The opportunities are abundant, not only in the Philippines but the whole region. Beyond high gas fees, what other adoption challenges do creators in Southeast Asia face when getting started with NFTs and beginning to navigate the crypto space? Our experience is that they have issues using MetaMask for the first time and using that as a single login for multiple websites. It’s the concept of decentralization and permissionless access that sort of throws them off initially. There’s also the issue of using off-ramp services to convert NFT earnings back into fiat.  I used to help artists in the beginning by teaching them how to open a MetaMask account and copying their addresses, and also actually minting them on OpenSea or Foundation, which are the two sites we commonly use. Lately, it's been better when the artists already have a MetaMask address and a collection uploaded on OpenSea. And all we have to do is check the current gas fee and send that amount to them.  Beyond supporting artists for their first mint, what else is in store for First Mint Fund? We’ve started to do First Mint Fund “minting parties” to onboard artists simultaneously. For the minting party, after they've already created their MetaMask addresses, we let the artists share their screens and we go through the process together. We just finished our first party via CryptoARTPH’s Discord, where we donated nearly 1 ETH to help 13 artists mint their first NFT. This will be the first of many more to come.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/23/the-metaverse-opportunity-for-artists,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c6e70c9dfb47fc5e2b8c2944db6ec40df7e0b9a-2821x2796.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416626,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWJHu,1645652960,Ukraine's Wealthy Finding It Hard to Buy Crypto Amid Geopolitical Tension,"Wealthy Ukrainians, at least those who have not fled the country, are looking to cryptocurrencies as a safe haven for their assets as the Russian-Ukraine conflict heats up. However, there's a limited supply of Tether's USDT dollar-linked stablecoins, and that limit has pushed up the exchange rate to a sizable premium.  That's the perspective of Michael Chobanian, founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna, who was interviewed on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Wednesday. He talked about the difficulties of buying crypto, the uncertain future of the local economy and possibilities for using blockchain amid the current geopolitical turmoil.  On Feb. 18 U.S. President Joe Biden said he was “convinced” Russia had would invade Ukraine in the coming days or weeks, targeting the capital Kyiv. The Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency Wednesday for the next 30 days, in response to the threat of a Russian invasion.  “In terms of financial panic, yes, there is a panic” among Ukrainians, Chobanian said in the interview. “They want to get rid of cash.”  He explained that most people who want to hedge with cryptocurrencies exchange cash for USDT, and then convert that to other coins such as bitcoin or ether. The problem is, the USDT supply is limited locally so buyers can’t even purchase it at a 4% premium, he said.  The situation is worsened by Ukraine’s local currency devaluation. The hryvnia has lost 6% of its value since Feb. 16, reflecting the current unstable situation.  “There is nothing you can do with the cash right now in here,” Chobanian said about Ukraine. “We don't trust the government. We don't trust the banking system. We don't trust the local currency.”  In the worst-case scenario, the internet and the whole banking system could break down in Ukraine, and crypto could be a safe haven, he said.  'Millions of Dollars of Cash'  “The majority of people have nothing else to choose apart from crypto,” he said. Those who are already in the crypto world are on the safe side, and many are trying their best to get in, with difficulty, he said.  “We're talking about millions of dollars of cash that wants to go into crypto,” he said, “but we can't find people who are willing to do the opposite, sell it.”  Speaking of the future prospects of the crypto sector during this crisis, Chobanian said he is worried about a lack of investment in the country and a gloomy economic prospect in the near future. However, there is also an opportunity for new systems to come into Ukraine such as blockchain companies.  He said Kuna's biggest problem is the exchange operates in the local Ukrainian currency and ""no one would want to integrate the Ukrainian banking system right now considering we are on the brink of war.""  “We are a bit trapped,” Chobanian said.  Kuna has around 400,000 active accounts, of which 90% are from Ukraine.  Speaking from a car, where he said he was conducting his business when not being interviewed, Chobanian said the streets are definitely quieter than a few days ago. He believes many wealthy people as well as ""business people and the crypto guys"" have left Ukraine, but many people he knows have sent their families out of the country and are staying in Ukraine to protect their homeland.  “That’s what we have to do right now,” he said.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | USDT,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/23/ukraines-wealthy-finding-it-hard-to-buy-crypto-amid-geopolitical-tension,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/543928dd50ac89e8b940e05aeb0196e3b2fabf8b-2686x1252.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, the rise in stablecoins could indicate a flight to safety among traders who are seeking protection from market volatility.  Equities also declined on Wednesday, while traditional safe haven assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar rose. That could mean investors are still concerned about macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. On Wednesday, Ukraine declared a state of emergency and urged its citizens to leave Russia immediately as tensions between the two nations escalated.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Monitoring selling pressure  Blockchain data shows a majority of short-term bitcoin holders have a cost basis of between $42,000 and $50,000. Therefore, recent fluctuations in prices below $50,000 could cause some anxiety among traders as losses add up.  Glassnode, a crypto data firm, estimates that more than a quarter of all Bitcoin network entities are now underwater on their position.  ""If the market fails to establish a sustainable uptrend, these users are statistically the most likely to become yet another source of sell-side pressure, specially if price trades below their cost basis."" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  The firm also noticed short-term holders purchasing bitcoin in recent weeks, with an average cost basis of $33,500 to $44,600. Still, for now, buying volume remains low, which means recent bids from short-term holders aren't enough to trigger a sustained upswing in price.

LUNA's leadership perhaps stems from a decision by Singapore-based nonprofit organization Luna Foundation Guard's (LFG) to create a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for UST – Terra's decentralized stablecoin, whose value is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, according to CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.

42417113,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4wyD,1645645759,4 Crypto Tax Myths You Need to Know,"Myth 1: You are only taxed when cashing out to fiat.  Our first myth about crypto taxes is far and away the most popular misconception. Some people believe the only taxable transaction is cashing out from crypto to fiat (U.S. dollars, or USD).  This is very far from the truth – many different types of crypto transactions are taxable, not just cashing out to fiat currency. Crypto-to-crypto swaps (including non-fungible tokens), staking rewards, mining and airdrops are all examples of taxable events within the crypto ecosystem that don't involve cashing out to fiat.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  Let's take a look at an example to understand this concept better:  In early 2021, Timmy bought ether (ETH) on Coinbase. He sent this ETH to his MetaMask wallet, and started using decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, staking some ETH on Lido and buying/selling NFTs on OpenSea. By December 2021, Timmy made some solid profits and pulled out the majority of his cryptocurrency by selling for USD on Coinbase.  If Timmy is in the group believing only that final transaction into USD was taxable, he’d be incorrect – many of the transactions he made, such as making swaps on Uniswap and buying/selling NFTs, are all individually taxable transactions. Knowing what types of transactions are taxable, and which aren't, can better help you put funds aside to be prepared for tax season.  Myth 2: The blockchain is ’anonymous’ and the IRS can’t trace transactions.  A common theme we see in the crypto community is anonymity. Although anonymity is very possible in crypto, and is a pillar to decentralization, it only lasts as long as the government/Internal Revenue Service wants it. Meaning, you can think your wallets are anonymous and untraceable but in reality that is not the case.  In its simplest terms, the blockchain is a public ledger where every transaction is verified in a decentralized manner, making all the transactions public domain (outside of a few exceptions). If you go to etherscan.io you can look at any wallet, any transaction, any contract and see the exact details of what is transpiring on the Ethereum blockchain.  Because of this public transparency, it is very easy for the IRS to link “anonymous” wallets to people. This is because at the beginning of nearly every person's transaction history is an on-ramp via know-your-customer (KYC) rules that exchanges like Coinbase are required to follow. These exchanges are required to report customers’ activity to the IRS, which gives the agency information about users. From this on-ramp, if the assets are sent to a decentralized wallet provider or non KYC’d exchange, the IRS can follow these transactions and easily associate each new wallet with the person who funded it. If you buy ETH on Coinbase, send to Metamask then bridge to Avalanche, the IRS will associate the Metamask and Avalanche wallet with the KYC’d Coinbase account that funded the wallets, thus revealing the wallets’ owners.  The blockchain is quite easily traceable as is. With the IRS investing billions of dollars into blockchain tracking technology, it will continue to be able to have visibility on-chain.  Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Myth 3: There's no way to lower taxes once transactions are made for profit.  Many people believe that as you take profits the total gains only go up and you end up having to pay this inflated amount come tax season. Although this is partially true there are some things to know about how taxes are calculated, and the strategies to lower them.  First, you need to understand what capital gains are: profits generated from selling a cryptocurrency – or any other asset, for that matter. When you sell a digital asset like crypto for more than you bought it, you must report that capital gain to the IRS on your taxes. Many people think this is where taxes end.  Fortunately, at the end of each year, the IRS allows you to match your capital gains and losses to determine your net capital gain or loss. You can use up to $3,000 in net capital losses to offset your other taxable income, and any additional losses can be carried forward into future years to offset either capital gains or up to $3,000 per year in ordinary income.  For example, Timmy buys 2x APE NFTs at $50 each. They dip initially and he sells one for a loss at $40, but then they pump and he sells the second one for $70. Although Timmy profited $20 on the second sale, the $10 loss from the first sale will offset these gains and he will only have to pay taxes on the net $10 profit.  Now that you understand capital gains, here are the ways to deliberately lower taxes once transactions are locked in for profit:  Tax loss harvesting: If you hold assets that are worth less than what you paid, you can sell to realize these losses in order to offset cap gains! Because there is no wash-sale rule for digital assets (yet), you can buy them back immediately after selling. (Check out ZenLedger’s ’’Tax Loss Harvesting Guide’’ and tool for more details on how to execute these savings.)  Another way to lower taxes once profits are locked in is via donations. Donations of appreciated assets/charitable donations are tax-deductible for taxpayers who itemize deductions. For 2021, the IRS also provides a tax deduction of up to $3,000 for people using the standard deduction. Learn more about crypto donations here.  Read more: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  Myth 4: You only need to import data for the year of taxes you’re filing.  When importing wallets and organizing transactions in a crypto tax software like ZenLedger, people are often only calculating their taxes for one year but don't realize that all transaction data prior to the reporting year need to be imported as well.  To get your current year taxes correct, the software actually needs to look at the transactions from previous years so it can find your correct cost basis including gains, losses and transaction fees. So if you only want your 2021 tax reports but have been trading crypto since 2016, we would still need all of your transactions from the very first trade to get all of your reports as accurate as possible.  For example: Timmy bought 1 bitcoin in 2017 for $10,000 then sold it in 2021 for $50,000. Timmy knows he needs to pay taxes on profit, but if he only imports his 2021 transactions the software will be unable to see how much he paid for the bitcoin in 2017, and therefore unable to calculate the profits/tax liability accurately. Once he imports all his historical data, the software will see that he held the bitcoin for four years and had a gain of $40,000, and apply the necessary tax implications.  Large numbers of transactions and little guidance from the IRS can make doing your crypto taxes a very daunting task. It is important to keep in mind the basics mentioned above so you can better manage your portfolio and be prepared for tax season.

42394283,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCyr,1645644711,"Canada, Russia and Crypto's Place in the World","Monday was a holiday, so you’re getting this week’s edition of the newsletter a day late. But it was a pretty eventful day. We may be on the cusp of seeing the effect that widely coordinated, government-imposed sanctions have on digital currencies (and currencies’ ability to bypass this type of financial censorship).  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Sanctions  The narrative  Two real-world events over the past week have interesting implications for crypto: Canada’s “freedom convoy” and that government’s efforts to shut this border blockade down; and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Why it matters  Financial sanctions could prove bitcoin (and the broader cryptocurrency industry)’s value proposition. Even putting the crypto-specific implications aside, we’re going to be discussing sanctions and governments’ ability to impact how people transact more broadly for some time to come.  Breaking it down  Governments are about to test the limits of sanctioning crypto wallets. Last week, Canada’s federal government put 34 wallet addresses on a list, warning crypto exchanges and financial firms not to facilitate any transactions with them. That hasn’t stopped the owners of these addresses from immediately moving their funds into other wallets or crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Crypto.com.  The crypto industry saw last week’s action as proof that bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) is necessary, even gaining agreement from traditionally skeptical voices.  The Canadian government’s action is separate and distinct from a Mareva injunction filed by a group of private locals affected by the protests. I think this distinction has been somewhat lost in the discourse but it’s an important one: The federal government froze bank accounts and crypto wallets outside of a judicial review process, while the Mareva injunction was granted by a court. The court in the private action is also giving wallet owners or operators a chance to respond.  The question now, to me at least, is whether this proves bitcoin’s value proposition. Regulators outside of Canada are undoubtedly looking at how the industry reacts and whether protestors receiving bitcoin are able to cash out or otherwise utilize their cryptocurrency.  Separately, I think we’re going to see a new test case in the international sanctions package that is about to be rolled out against Russia.  A quick primer: Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two regions of Ukraine as being independent and deployed military forces inside these regions as “peacekeepers,” confirming U.S. and NATO fears that Russia would invade the European nation. U.S. President Joe Biden announced an initial slate of sanctions on Monday evening, with an additional tranche on Tuesday.  The European Union is similarly planning to impose sanctions, while Canada and Japan have already announced their own.  These sanctions so far are limited to certain entities, oligarchs, vessels and financial institutions, as well as businesses in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two Ukrainian regions at the heart of Russia's recent incursion.  To be clear: In no way do I want to minimize the potential harm and suffering I suspect we’re about to see in Ukraine. However, for the purposes of this newsletter, I’ll be focusing on the crypto-specific implications, mainly through these sanctions.  The U.S. sanctions regime is predicated on the idea that the dollar is the world’s reserve currency and/or the U.S. has the ability to influence the financial institutions that sanctioned entities with which might otherwise interact.  Among the most severe tools in the U.S. and NATO’s arsenal would be cutting Russia off from SWIFT, the financial communications network underpinning transactions worldwide. Over the past few years, we’ve been hearing more and more that some countries – namely, Russia and China – are looking to either create or work with a financial system independent of the U.S.  Central bank digital currencies like China’s digital yuan are one possibile tool to create this system. Former U.S. officials and academics even wargamed a scenario where China’s digital yuan was used to bypass U.S. influence.  An official at the Bank of Russia spoke to the possibility that the country could create a digital ruble as part of sanctions mitigation effort two years ago. It does not look like the country has put any serious thought or investment into a CBDC at this time, but this does go to show that, if nothing else, it’s on their minds.  The Bank of Russia announced a pilot stage for a digital ruble last week, though officials haven’t explicitly said whether they hope to bypass sanctions with it.  Of course, the idea that bitcoin or a CBDC or some other cryptocurrency can be used to bypass sanctions depends on that asset actually being picked up for widespread use. Canadian truckers have had difficulty using bitcoin to actually pay for anything, and digitizing the yuan or ruble as a sanctions-avoidance tool depends on the premise that the underlying yuan or ruble can secure a reserve currency-like status.  The technical fundamentals of these assets won’t be as big a factor here as the soft power efforts of encouraging adoption and making adoption feasible will be. And that’s a whole different kettle of fish.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Fed Chair Pro Tempore Jerome Powell will testify before the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees next week. We’re still awaiting a vote on Powell and the other four Fed board nominees after Senate Banking Republicans walked out of a confirmation markup last week. Ranking member Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) said he would like to ask nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin some further questions. Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) called this a “political stunt.”  Elsewhere:  Tether Slashes Commercial Paper Holdings by 21%: Tether published its latest attestation report, saying its commercial paper holdings fell by $6.2 billion over the last quarter of 2021.  CoinDesk Tax Week: Did you trade crypto in the 2021 calendar year? Congrats you probably owe taxes. CoinDesk has a host of articles this week on how to best deal with them.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) Alison Parker was a TV news reporter who was killed live on air. Her father, Andy Parker, has spent the last seven years trying to remove the footage from the internet with limited success. He has now minted an NFT of the video in an effort to use copyright law as a tool to require platforms to automatically take the video down. Minting an NFT doesn’t automatically confer copyright protections and the actual footage’s copyright appears to be owned by a television company, so I’m not sure whether Parker has a case here. But I can understand the desperation. This is really tragic.

42393986,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQNWX,1645642802,BUIDLing Among the Chaos: What Devs Discussed at ETHDenver,"The 10-day ETHDenver conference wrapped up Sunday afternoon with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin donning a furry buffalo-unicorn costume on stage as he judged the conference’s hackathon finalists.  This year, ETHDenver drew thousands of developers – known as “BUIDLers” in cryptoland – to the Mile High City, despite ETH prices that dipped and dipped some more over the course of the week.  While the usual crypto conference debauchery occurred in Denver, this year’s conference stood out due to the sheer amount of actual building that occurred. Legions of T-shirt clad engineers were littered about hotel conference rooms, word-of-mouth hacker houses or the oversized bean bag chairs scattered throughout The Castle, an antiquated Chrysler showroom turned event space that hosted the majority of the show.  “ETHDenver is one of my favorite conferences because it’s super developer-focused,” said jacobc.eth, an operations lead at crypto wallet firm MetaMask and a guest judge for the ETHDenver hackathon. “Most crypto conferences are just people shilling their project’s token.” This one was for the hackers.  In this context, the term “hacking” means coding, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the word’s more internet-native definition: “exercising skill to the limit,” as hackathon projects are typically churned out in a span of mere hours or days.  “The culture at ETHDenver is around people building in an open source way that is really fun and celebratory,” jacobc.eth told CoinDesk in an interview at the conference.  CoinDesk spoke to a variety of attendees ranging from protocol founders to high school students, from Web 2 defectors to female code-shippers.  Full of starry-eyed optimism for the future of Web 3 and crypto, simply put, they came to Denver to BUIDL.  Meet the BUIDLers  It’s been over two years since Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of the $5.5 billion Near Protocol, says he’s seen his co-founder, Alex Skidanov, in person. The two finally crossed paths last week at ETHDenver and spent a few hours hacking together, just like old times.  “It brought us back to the days when we started Near in a room with a whiteboard,” Polosukhin told CoinDesk.  Polosukhin wasn’t the only prominent founder in attendance – Ethereum’s own Vitalik Buterin was spotted aiding developer teams, visiting hacker houses and even voicing his view on the Canadian trucker fiasco. (His fashion also made headlines.)  “I got to speak with Vitalik,” said Byeongjun Moon, a high school hacker and founder of PadawanDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that sponsors budding crypto enthusiasts (who must be under 25 years old) to attend blockchain conferences.  “We sent about 70 young people to ETHDenver this year,” Moon, 16, told CoinDesk. The conference helped him “realize the importance of diverse perspectives in moving Ethereum forward.” Moon says he’s been involved with Ethereum since 2014, when he was just 9 years old.  Another developer, Konrad Gnat, came to ETHDenver seeking a new challenge after working for years in Web 2. He says this is the 10th Ethereum-related hackathon (including virtual ones) he’s attended since May 2021.  “I’ve built up a skill set in Web 2 already where now I feel confident building whatever I want,” he told CoinDesk at the post-conference ski retreat in Breckenridge. “In Web 3, you’re only limited by your imagination. It’s about skating to where the puck will be, not where it is.”  In-person networking  With February also marking the two-year anniversary of the coronavirus pandemic, the conference also marked the first time many project contributors have met their virtual collaborators in real life.  “Remote work has its benefits, but the iteration is slower,” said Near’s Polosukhin. “These types of events are important. It brings a bunch of creative people together.”  In addition to in-person collaboration, many attendees touted the importance of face-to-face networking. Despite the jam-packed days of panels and workshops, many attendees made time to attend a myriad of side events.  “ETH Denver was like next-level networking and bonding,” said Thy-Diep “Yip” Ta, co-founder of Unit Network, who participated in the hackathon as a delegate from the all-women H.E.R. DAO and also received a sponsorship from the team behind the Harmony blockchain.  The events are typically co-hosted by crypto exchanges, blockchain projects, DAOs, protocols or venture capital firms, and vary in scope from unassuming cocktail parties to nightclub raves featuring artists such as Tiesto (sponsored this year, somewhat improbably, by Bacon Coin).  Ta’s hackathon submission, Proof of Meditation, is a decentralized application (dapp) that takes a user’s heart rate during meditation sessions to generate unique pixel art NFTs. It won a prize in the “Impact” category.  She says she started each day with either a morning swim at 6:15 a.m. or a yoga meditation session at the H.E.R. DAO hacker house.  “The well-being sessions were super vital to keep the calm amidst the chaos,” Ta told CoinDesk.  Big incentives  Sponsorship recipients like Ta typically receive free airfare and accommodations from the sponsoring entity (typically a well-capitalized layer 1 blockchain) to attend the conference.  Skale, an Ethereum scaling solution, announced a $100 million ecosystem fund last Friday, a testament to the big incentives blockchain projects use to lure developers into building projects in their ecosystems.  “Our hackers are grinding,” Skale co-founder Jack O’Holleran told CoinDesk in an interview during the conference. “So far, they’ve made over 20 submissions on Skale.”  Last Thursday, data-querying project The Graph announced a similar $205 million ecosystem fund to support dapp development using its technology.  One day later, the Algorand Foundation announced it would award $20 million to developers building Ethereum-compatibility solutions or developer tooling for Algorand.  “The job of the foundation is to build good fertile ground for people to get involved with Algorand,” said Staci Warden, CEO of the Algorand Foundation. “That means grant-giving and providing assistance, including technical assistance.”  That’s up to folks like Ryan Fox, a member of Algorand’s developer relations, or “DevRel,” team. They’re more-extroverted builders (“developers who also like to talk to people,” per Near’s Polosukhin) who crucially serve as a project’s brand evangelists, fielding technical questions at booths or providing on-site technical assistance to builders during the hackathon.  “We had incredible engagement with devs using Reach to design and deploy their smart contracts to both Algorand and Ethereum simultaneously,” Fox told CoinDesk. “Beyond Web 3, the buzz focused on interoperability.”  Reach is a programming language that allows developers to use a few lines of JavaScript code to write Solidity smart contracts, the technical underpinnings of everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized exchanges.  Near launched its new Web 3 startup platform Pagoda on Sunday. Pagoda is a set of tools to help developers more easily develop applications for Near.  “With Pagoda, we’re opening Near up to JavaScript developers,” said Marieke Flament, CEO of the Near Foundation. “We believe that’s what opens the door to be mainstream and increase the overall pool of talent.”  A ‘growth flywheel’  Many prominent developers compared the energy of the conference to the early days of Web 2, a term that refers to the reigning tech giants such as Google, Facebook or Amazon.  For many projects, that meant new product launches aimed at integrations or tools that streamlined the development process for engineers.  Jacobc.eth said MetaMask’s new Snaps system was inspired by a strategy used by Google Chrome, which he claimed provided the best developer tools to build websites during the rise of Web 2. As a result, many of today’s most popular websites were built on Chrome.  “It just created a growth flywheel,” he told CoinDesk.  Launched last week, MetaMask Snaps, available only on the developer build of MetaMask, allows third-party projects, such as Solana or Cosmos, to create their own application programming interfaces (APIs) for for the popular Ethereum wallet.  “There are a lot of teams here building using Snaps,” said jacobc.eth. “Some are being built by third-party teams, some by anonymous devs, some are being built in-house by our own team.”  On Tuesday, Ethereum sidechain Polygon announced the launch of Finity, a user interface (UI) development tool that offers Polygon developers a suite of “tried-and-tested assets, elements, and templates, with a focus on 3D design,” according to a press release.  “It’s wild right now,” said Skale’s O’Holleran. “There’s so many people building in Web 3 – everyone from the brilliant hackers in a college dorm room to the largest corporations.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/23/buidling-among-the-chaos-what-devs-discussed-at-ethdenver,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6158ef3f07e5b19cefcff432376279cdc4fa411f-4000x2666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394278,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCeL,1645637851,"Trudeau Proved Bitcoin's Value, so Why Is It Trading Sideways?","The past week has been a dramatic showcase of the value of an uncensorable global payment, settlement and value-storage network. In Canada, a liberal-democratic government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has frozen its own citizens’ bank accounts to break up an unpopular and damaging blockade – which participants argue is nonetheless legitimate political activism. Yesterday, the U.S. and Europe announced new financial sanctions on a handful of wealthy Russians, who as a group hold a huge portion of their wealth outside Russia, where it is vulnerable to seizure.  Yet even as the world pumps out unintentional advertisements for bitcoin, the bombproof orange coin has been bleeding, dropping more than 12% against the dollar over the past seven days. Why?  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At the highest level, immediate financial headwinds are simply offsetting the longer-term benefit of these object lessons in crypto’s usefulness. An imminent rise in U.S. interest rates could suck air out of speculative assets. The U.S. tax season is also just around the corner, and there are signs that frantic 2021 crypto day traders are waking up to huge tax bills and may be liquidating assets to pay them.  Bitcoin is also still undergoing a slow reversion to the mean after peaking at $68,000 in early November. Essentially, financial gravity is drawing down a dramatic speculative bull run – bitcon reached $36,000 for the first time ever just over one year ago. Meanwhile, though rising inflation is also a theoretical case for bitcoin, that thesis has yet to prove itself in practice.  While the current balance of forces might be just slightly net negative for bitcoin prices, the moment should be viewed in the broader context of crypto adoption and educational cycles. The increasing visibility of financial censorship is earning some unexpected crypto converts, and even if they’re not putting their life savings in bitcoin right away, that bodes very well for BTC longer term.  Recent developments follow a series of prominent exercises of top-down financial control, mostly courtesy of America. Last summer, in what could be plausibly characterized as a crime against humanity, the U.S. simply seized $9.5 billion in Afghani national reserves, setting the stage for the current immiseration, and imminent mass starvation, in that country. Also last summer, the U.S. Treasury department lobbied for new mass surveillance of Americans’ bank accounts, suggesting just how far authorities would like to push their financial power.  But for many, the moves by Canada have been a game-changing catalyst. One emblematic turnaround has come from Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson. Hansson, who has a huge social media footprint, has opposed cryptocurrency on multiple grounds for years. But on Monday, he published a full-throated mea culpa titled simply “I was wrong – we need crypto,” focused largely on his shock at Canada’s actions against protesting truckers.  As technologist Anil Dash points out, this is a revealing moment to embrace crypto. If you didn’t see the value of uncensorable money for sex workers or African activists, but you suddenly get it when it’s useful for white North Americans, what does that say about your own biases?  See also: Why We Need Uncensorable Marketplaces | Marc Hochstein  Regardless, Canada’s willingness to go fully mask-off has helped reinforce and spread bitcoin’s most important value proposition. Slightly more puzzling is the fact that new sanctions against Russian billionaires, issued yesterday in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, haven’t triggered a meaningful rush into crypto. Russia’s notorious “oligarchs” hold much of their wealth, largely embezzled from the Russian people with help from Russian President Vladimir Putin, in foreign banks.  They may in fact be converting wealth into less easily seized bitcoin in amounts too small to affect the market (Russia’s entire economy is only roughly the size of Texas’). They may be avoiding bitcoin because they see its downward price trend as a bigger risk than bank seizures (gold prices, by contrast, are peaking). They may be betting on Europe’s dependence on Russian oil to protect most of their assets. Or they may be betting that influential Western billionaires will discourage their governments from setting an uncomfortable precedent by seizing rich people’s ill-gotten wealth.  But the larger lesson is, again, undoubtedly being learned. Whether it comes to internal political conflicts or international aggression, mainstream, SWIFT-based banking has become a political weapon of convenience. It’s clear who controls that weapon – and now that the Rubicon has been crossed, there’s no turning back.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

When demand is high, the price of a priority position can rocket.  According to Ethereum, ""gas"" refers to the computing power required to verify transactions in a proof-of-work consensus protocol. This computing power is the resource that fuels the network and all the applications built on it. Because of this, a base gas fee must be paid to cover this computing cost.  Read more: What are Ethereum Gas Fees?  On the Ethereum network, those seeking to complete transactions faster can offer a ""priority tip"" to validators, to incentivize the validators to include their transaction in the upcoming block earlier than others. The user can set this tip as they wish, which is then added to the base gas fee.  If there are a lot of transactions awaiting validation and users are nervous about missing an opportunity, they might offer significantly more than the base gas fee amount.  A gas war will not typically happen over regular payments, though. It is more likely when a non-fungible token (NFT) is put up for sale, for example, and there are a limited number available. If buyers lose the gas war, they may lose the opportunity to buy the NFT at the offered price altogether. This creates tension among users and often initiates a bidding war.  Read more: Buying NFTs During Presales and Public Mints: What to Know  Sometimes, the gas war pulls in more money than the actual asset being sold. When Time magazine sold a limited number of NFTs for 0.1 ETH each in September 2021, some buyers reportedly spent four times as much on gas as they did on the tokens just to secure them.  A side effect of the gas war is that a few rich buyers can sometimes squeeze out others who cannot afford gas fees so easily, cornering the market for the asset.  This doesn’t just impact those trying to buy assets in a particular sale. Everyone trying to complete transactions on the network at that time has to pay those fees or else wait and complete their transaction later – causing a knock-on effect throughout the wider Ethereum ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-crypto-gas-wars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/662465e7174a86b323d52f736c79088f4a537404-1641x1230.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421850,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSSb,1645632379,Is an All-Crypto Lifestyle Possible?,"So you’ve made your first bitcoin purchase, you’ve learned how to buy goods and services with cryptocurrency, you finally have a MetaMask wallet – and now you want to know if an all-crypto lifestyle is possible.  Like Alice in Wonderland, prepare to go down the rabbit hole. But first, let’s take the trip intellectually, looking before we leap and considering exactly how a person would have to switch their bank accounts to live a 100% cryptocurrency lifestyle.  Determining your investment thesis  The first step to every financial decision is recognizing the reasoning, or thesis, behind it.  An all-crypto future seems natural, or even inevitable, for members of Gen Z or younger consumers.  “I grew up through digital communication like emails, text messages, FaceTime, Skype calls,” Randi Hipper, an 18-year-old influencer known as Miss Teen Crypto, told CoinDesk in late 2021.  “Now we're here with Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, you know, like everything,"" she said. ""So with the whole concept of communicating over the internet, why wouldn't we transact over the internet and use the money of the internet?”  For others, the decision to go all-in with crypto is about inflation: “Bitcoin’s purchasing power increases every day,” said Brian Harrington, product marketing manager at Choice App, a platform that provides self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for bitcoin investors. “The U.S. dollar is losing to goods and services. It was down 7% in December,” he said, referencing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which cites a 7.5% increase in the price index for all categories from December 2020 to December 2021.  Read more: 4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment  To start, decide if you want to go all-in on bitcoin or use a variety of altcoins. Bitcoin, like a vast majority of the other 17,000+ cryptocurrencies currently available in the market, is a highly volatile asset. And while many assets often move in the same direction, there are outliers that tend to rise and fall independently – particularly those strongly linked to decentralized applications and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Diversifying across a mixture of coins is usually advisable.  Then, like choosing the right credit card, you should think about whether you want to use a crypto rewards card or prepaid crypto debit cards to make your everyday purchases – and the tax implications for each.  Factors like your age, circumstance and financial obligations may determine whether it’s worth the hassle to set up bill payments – including rent, car payments, health insurance and more – using a crypto credit or debit card.  Younger consumers like Hipper, who lives with her father in New York City, might see the value in learning about these new payment methods from the start, as opposed to those who are already in the full swing of adulthood and have active mortgages and car payments being automatically debited from their checking accounts each month. It’s arguably easier to start from scratch than to transition over to crypto bill by bill.  “I don't own a car yet. I don't pay taxes yet,” Hipper said in December – but the teen influencer, who began buying crypto and launched her Twitter account in April 2020 when bitcoin was at $7,700, plans to structure her future purchases and lifestyle costs around her crypto bullishness.  Harrington, on the other hand, waited to transition until it was convenient: “I'm comfortable having a foot in both worlds,” he said. After finalizing a mortgage last year, Harrington decided to make 2022 the year for switching his family’s finances over to a bitcoin-only approach.  Everyday purchases and bills  More than one-third of small businesses now accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the U.S., but that doesn’t mean buying coffee, groceries and gasoline with bitcoin is totally straightforward.  A small handful of bills – think utilities, mortgages and other payments to traditional financial institutions – require communication through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network. Others accept credit card and/or debit payments, for which you can use a crypto rewards card (though normal processing fees may apply).  “Anywhere that takes bitcoin … I'll pay in bitcoin,” Harrington said. ""But for the majority of places that don't, then I use a credit card and pay off the credit card from my bitcoin checking account. There are now multiple bitcoin apps that have connections to the ACH network.”  Read more: What You Can Buy With Bitcoin?  Should you convert your savings into crypto?  Crypto as an asset class is notoriously volatile, but thanks to its long-term uptrend, an increasing number of crypto believers feel it’s OK or even preferable to put their savings into bitcoin, according to Harrington.  “Bitcoin Twitter'' – aka the online community who shares information about their transition from fiat currency to crypto – first came to the consensus that it made sense to keep one’s checking account in U.S. dollars, since budgeting is tough when a currency’s price fluctuates so wildly from day to day.  But now that inflation is on the rise, more and more people say it’s preferable to put both your checking and savings in bitcoin. The long-term projections rival any interest you might get on a high-yield savings account at a traditional bank, Harrington argues.  “The increased amount of having bitcoin as your total base of money even overcomes capital gains taxes. You end the year wealthier than if you only had bitcoin as your savings and U.S. dollars as your checking,” Harrington said.  But most financial planners would never advise this strategy in case of a crypto market crash or, at the very least, massive crypto hacks: “Don't pay attention to everything that is in the news that is so sensational,” said Washington, D.C.-based certified financial planner, Marguerita Cheng. “If you start to follow that you're going to get caught up in fads, not trends.”  While bitcoin and the future of crypto aren’t, according to Cheng, a fad, the market is still relatively new and we have limited data to make calculated projections.  “There's a difference between investing, saving and speculation,” Cheng said. “We need to learn how to save so that we can invest, and we need to invest to build wealth. Cryptocurrency is very volatile.”  Nonetheless, you can still put a portion of your money that you’re willing to risk in exchange for potentially high returns in a crypto savings account. After all, the road to a 100% crypto lifestyle is paved with baby steps, especially while we wait to see how things unfold.  For traditional savings accounts, FDIC insurance covers certain losses due to the bank’s collapse, but Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insurance doesn’t cover loss or theft. The bank’s insurance policy will cover thefts, while fraud is covered under federal law when the victim reports in a timely manner.  There are no fraud protections for crypto, and there’s no such thing as getting your money back on a blockchain. (Without a centralized institution, who would order the transfer?) However, an increasing number of crypto products now offer private theft insurance up to similar limits as FDIC insurance (around $250,000). As they say on Crypto Twitter, do your research and ask thorough questions before moving your money over.  Read More: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Investing for your future using crypto  Apart from buying and selling crypto directly, new platforms are beginning to sprout up and give consumers familiar-looking options to add crypto to their retirement portfolios.  Choice App is one such example. The new investment platform operates under Kingdom Trust, which, according to its website, is an independent qualified custodian under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Through the platform’s self-directed IRA, investors can transfer or roll over old IRAs and 401(k)s and connect their bank account through financial data aggregator Plaid to make future transfers.  Blockmint also offers crypto retirement products, along with the U.S.-based crypto-asset adviser, Digital Asset Investment Management (DAIM). Look into these and other options to buy bitcoin and/or other digital assets through your brokerage and tax-advantaged retirement accounts – and always be sure to check fees for both transferring and managing funds.  Reduce your debt  If you’re in debt, you should decide on a payoff plan before you put your money in bitcoin. It’s not impossible to prioritize both at the same time, but you should at least have an idea of how fast any investments (crypto or otherwise) will compound returns compared to the interest fees accruing on your debt.  While bitcoin is speculated to have a favorable outlook long term, debt incurs interest steadily every month and fees that likely compound over time. Crypto investments are based on possibility, while your debt undoubtedly costs you every day. Financial planners suggest paying off high-interest debt such as credit cards and personal loans before allocating more of your monthly budget to a speculative asset.  Similarly, you might not want to transition to an all-crypto lifestyle today if you plan on taking out significant debt in the near future, such as a mortgage. While financial institutions are beginning to experiment with using digital assets as collateral, most lenders still require cash down payments for mortgages and evaluate your assets in fiat currency, whether you hold bitcoin or not.  Harrington bought two houses prior to switching over his money to bitcoin. To prepare, he stopped staking bitcoin and reduced his crypto allocations for a period of time leading up to his mortgage application. Doing this accomplishes two things: It frees up more fiat assets that could be useful to cover move-in and closing costs, and it demonstrates a more stable (i.e. predictable) financial situation compared to crypto assets, which go up and down with the market’s volatility.  “I got the deal done and then went back to what I was doing,” he said. “That's why 2022 was the perfect year for me to start this new phase.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/is-an-all-crypto-lifestyle-possible,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bed7d93c3591c40854b0a07296d1e580cad1f181-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It works by using a Virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM). Traders can trade directly with vAMMs without the need for counterparties just like Uniswap. The vAMMs offer guaranteed on-chain liquidity and predictable pricing based on product curves that are always the same. The vAMMs are also designed to be fully collateralized and market neutral. Features of Perpetual Protocol Users can go long or short on many assets, including BTC, ETH, DOT, SNX, YFI and more. You can trade with up to 10x leverage on these assets. Due to xDAI, low trading fees have to be paid. All trading is 100% on-chain and non-custodial. How does it work? The protocol&apos;s primary goal is to build a universal trade protocol for perpetual contracts. Thanks to the revolutionary vAMM-based exchange, you can trade with strong liquidity and low slippage. In comparison to other Ethereum-based exchanges, Perpetual uses a scaling technique called xDai to boost trades&apos; speed and offer zero gas fees on all deals. As all trades on Perpetual Protocol are settled in USDC, the exchange&apos;s collateral is also in USDC. Perpetual Protocol employs a simplified approach that allows traders to profit from xDai scaling without setting up a wallet.

On Wednesday, Ren Labs, the creators of popular bridge Ren, announced the fundraising with participation from Amber Group, Multicoin Capital, BlockTower Capital, Cumberland DRW, GBV Capital, Chiron, Fisher8 Capital, LedgerPrime, Bixin and PetRock Capital, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  The funds will be used to advance the development of Catalog, a new AMM and the first application to be built on the forthcoming Ren blockchain.  Catalog has been in the works since at least October 2021, when Ren announced the formation of Ren Labs with the goal of expanding the protocol’s functionality to build a new, interoperability-focused chain.  Read more: Interoperability Project Ren 'Joining' Alameda Research  In an interview with CoinDesk, Ren Labs co-founder Susruth Nadimpalli said that the goal of the new platform was to simplify the AMM experience for users – even for users of chains that may not have smart-contract functionality.  “What we want to do [with Catalog] is bring DeFi to blockchains that do not have DeFi,” he said.  Features  At launch, Catalog will boast a number of unusual features.  According to Nadimpalli, Catalog will attempt to mitigate impermanent loss with single-sided staking, where users deposit assets that are then managed by a market maker, earning interest on the asset they deposit. Impermanent loss refers to when the quantity of an asset locked into an AMM pool changes due to trades placed against the liquidity, such that the user faces an unrealized loss relative to having just held the asset on its own.  Additionally, an impermanent loss protection insurance pool will be baked into the functionality of a forthcoming Catalog token.  Additionally, Catalog will be able to interact directly with users’ bank accounts for “easy deposits and withdrawals,” according to a press release. No details for how this would be accomplished were provided.  The goal of the design is to strip down user experience to simple components, abstracting away the “extreme complexity on the back end,” Nadimpalli said.  The team is currently targeting an April launch for Catalog, and a full Ren chain launch in “Q3 or Q4,” though the full launch is dependent on a number of outstanding technical and integration-based milestones baked into Catalog’s development.  From there, Ren has its sights set on expanding to a suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) products.  “Once we solve these problems for Catalog, then we’ll be able to solve them for all of Ren chain, and then other people will be able to build on Ren chain as well,” Nadimpalli said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/23/ren-labs-raises-75m-for-catalog-cross-chain-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e1dac952cb5635203ce0d6e4ca2a8781f997129-3648x2606.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

StarkNet uses zero knowledge (ZK) rollup technology to solve Ethereum’s scaling problem.  Ethereum’s high transaction costs, or gas fees, have encouraged a Cambrian explosion of alternatives. Some are new blockchains such as Solana, while others look for efficiencies in the Ethereum blockchain to make it more competitive.  While layer 1 platforms like Solana have made significant progress in the past year, they are still plagued with growing pains. StarkNet’s use of ZK rollups seeks to marry the security of Ethereum with the need for lower fees.  ZK rollups involve bunching together hundreds of transactions into one, which is then written to the Ethereum blockchain. The process is computationally intensive, but because it involves writing one, not hundreds, of transactions to the blockchain it reduces gas fees by a lot.  The underlying technology used in StarkNet has also been deployed on dYdX, a market for cryptocurrency derivatives that runs on Ethereum without the usual fees associated with it.  In a press release, Tel Aviv, Israel-based StarkWare said that by the end of 2022 StarkNet is expected to achieve one order of magnitude higher transactions per second than Ethereum at a cost that is at least two orders of magnitude lower.

42415781,ZC3JxkpHqXjrHiKmfGZ3iP,1645626600,FIFO or Specific Identification: Choosing the Best Way to Calculate Cost Basis on Crypto,"The tax calculations required for cryptocurrency investments heighten your return’s complexity, and often lead taxpayers to make mistakes during the filing process.  For crypto users who use multiple exchanges or wallets, understanding how the IRS treats cost basis assignment is important. Things can get confusing quickly.  Miles Fuller is head of government solutions for TaxBit, a provider of tax and accounting services focused on digital assets.  How is crypto taxed?  The IRS classifies cryptocurrency as virtual currency, which is property for tax purposes. This classification means the agency treats crypto as a capital asset in almost all cases. Taxes on capital assets are straightforward.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week  When you sell a capital asset for fiat currency or exchange it for other property or for services, you take the amount received for that transaction and reduce it by the amount you paid for the asset. Your original purchase price is known as cost basis.  If the proceeds of a crypto transaction exceed the cost, you have a capital gain. Likewise, if the inverse is true, you have a capital loss.  If you hold the asset for under 12 months, it will be treated as a short-term capital gain; if you hold the asset for over 12 months, it will be treated as a long-term capital gain.  How is cost basis calculated?  A common question that arises during a crypto transaction – whether involving a single asset or multiple assets – is “How do I calculate the cost basis?” When you sell property, existing tax regulations require you to apply the cost basis of that specific property against the proceeds received to calculate your gain or loss. However, this isn’t possible for fungible property like crypto because it lacks a specific identifier for each unit specifically tracking when the unit was purchased and when that same unit was sold.  In October 2019, the IRS posted FAQs on its website that explain how to approach cost basis calculations for cryptocurrency. FAQs 39, 40 and 41 address cryptocurrency cost basis.  The IRS takes a similar approach to cryptocurrency cost basis as traditional equities and allows two methods for calculating cost basis when disposing of virtual currency:  First-in, First-Out (FIFO)  Specific Identification  What is FIFO?  First-in, First-out (FIFO) is a method of assigning the cost basis where the oldest unit of crypto you own is sold or disposed of first.  What are the potential benefits of FIFO?  FIFO currently allows universal pooling of assets, which makes this an easier method to apply than Specific Identification.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  The IRS FAQs don’t specifically address what method is required for FIFO, so a taxpayer can use either approach – pool all their accounts together or prepare separate FIFO calculations for each wallet or account.  You can weigh your options, but if the exchange issued a Form 1099 to you, then it probably used a by-exchange approach. The same approach is likely easiest when completing your personal tax forms and could also reduce the chance of an audit because your return will match the information that the exchange provided to the IRS.  In November 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, commonly referred to as the Infrastructure Bill, which requires crypto information reporting on transactions to be conducted by brokers.  This new legislation will likely result in IRS regulations that mirror current rules for stocks. Each crypto exchange will be reporting proceeds and basis for sales on its own platform. The FIFO approach is likely to shift toward a by-exchange basis because that’s the information that will be provided.  What are the potential cons of FIFO?  While FIFO may be easier to apply, it doesn’t always provide the best tax result. The oldest units you own may have lower cost basis, which could result in larger capital gains.  What is specific identification?  Specific Identification permits a taxpayer to identify which units of crypto are being sold in a particular transaction. Under Specific Identification, a taxpayer can elect to dispose of higher cost basis assets first, which allows for greater tax optimization, but the IRS imposes additional requirements to use this method.  Note that IRS FAQ 40 explicitly requires a taxpayer using Specific Identification to have ""records showing the transaction information for all units of a specific virtual currency … held in a single account, wallet, or address.”  You can’t use Specific Identification with cost basis and sale proceeds for crypto from different wallets or exchanges. You can only use Specific Identification with transactions from the same wallet or exchange.  Additionally, to use Specific Identification, you must have complete records including the:  Date and time each unit was acquired  Cost basis and value of each unit when it was acquired  Date and time each unit was sold or disposed of  Value of each unit when it was sold or disposed of  What are the potential benefits of specific identification?  While FIFO may be the default by some providers, Specific Identification offers many possible tax advantages to the taxpayer. Most importantly, it provides flexibility that can help minimize taxes in both the current year and long term.  Assume the purchase price of your longest-held units of a particular cryptocurrency is much lower than units you just acquired. If you applied FIFO to a sale of these units, you would likely report a gain for tax purposes.  Conversely, if you use Specific Identification on a by-exchange basis, you could select and sell the units with the highest cost basis regardless of acquisition date, which could reduce the gain or even result in a loss.  Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  For example, let's say a taxpayer sells BTC for $10,000. You can see the difference when FIFO and Specification Identification methods are applied to the transaction:  Under FIFO, the cost basis is $3,000 and results in a $7,000 capital gain.  Under Specific Identification – using Highest In, First Out (HIFO) by exchange – the cost basis is $12,000 and results in a $2,000 capital loss.  What are the potential cons of specific identification?  Because Specific Identification is an election, failure to do the proper calculation or maintain complete records could result in an IRS audit where you’ll potentially need to redo the calculation using FIFO.  If you’re considering using Specific Identification to achieve tax optimization, you should ensure that whoever is doing the tax calculation – you, your preparer or any software provider – is applying Specific Identification on a per account or wallet basis.  How do you make a specific identification election?  Unlike the regulations governing stocks, the IRS Cryptocurrency FAQs don’t provide specific instructions on when to elect Specific Identification or how to do it. Unlike equities, some exchanges don’t even allow a Specific Identification election within their platform.  If the exchange doesn’t allow the election, you’ll need to complete it manually or use crypto tax software. TaxBit allows for the proper use of Specific Identification by using a by-exchange approach and properly identifying assets that were transferred between platforms.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Miles Fuller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/taxweek/2022/02/23/fifo-or-specific-identification-choosing-the-best-way-to-calculate-cost-basis-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fa53a0154a2d422ff7ae7a731a39e871b29b91f-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407266,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVQy5C,1645626146,Crypto Tax Prep Business Booms as Trading Surges and IRS Tightens Screws,"Crypto tax preparation is big business in the U.S. as cryptocurrency investing has mushroomed into a $1.9 trillion global market.  Startups that help Americans calculate their crypto gains and resulting tax bills have been raising hundreds of millions and achieving billion-dollar valuations. Even traditional tax-prep services have been rolling out offerings for this blooming niche. And perhaps not a moment too soon, with valuations near last year’s all-time highs, a proliferation of novel ways to profit on digital assets and the IRS on the hunt for crypto tax cheats.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week  It’s hard to gauge the size of this niche. ""If I were to put out an estimate, I'd estimate that the U.S. crypto tax prep market is currently worth $400 million, but that number is growing exponentially year-over-year as regulators clamp down."" said David Kemmerer, co-founder and CEO of CryptoTrader.Tax.  The IRS started looking into cryptocurrency closely in the summer of 2019, when it sent thousands of letters to taxpayers whom the agency suspected of not reporting their crypto-related taxes properly.  “What I've seen in the past few years was consumers started to realize they have to pay taxes, but it was so overwhelming that they just ignored it,” said Michelle O’Connor, vice president of marketing at TaxBit. But then they started receiving “scary IRS letters.”  In October 2019, the IRS published its first detailed guidance on how taxpayers should declare crypto-related income. The same year, the agency included a question about cryptocurrency transactions in the Schedule A of individual 1040 forms. In 2020, the question became obligatory for all U.S. taxpayers.  Investors are getting the message, tax pros say.  “We will see the highest compliance rates among consumers and enterprises filing their crypto taxes for 2021 and expect to see the compliance rates grow exponentially year-on-year moving forward,” said Dan Hannum, chief operating officer of ZenLedger.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Down the road, technology will become increasingly complex, with decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) gaining adoption, and with the taxman looking over their shoulders, more people will need help managing their tax liabilities.  The IRS differentiates between various kinds of transactions, so cryptocurrency accounting might be tricky, and the safest way for consumers often appears to be asking for professional help – or using specialized software.  Hard to measure  Estimates of the crypto tax prep market’s size vary.  “We believe that due to the massive uptake in crypto last year especially, that the crypto user base could be sitting close to 16% of the U.S. population, bringing us to 53 million potential crypto taxpayers,” said Robin Singh, founder of Koinly, citing last year’s Pew Research report about crypto adoption in the U.S.  Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, the country’s second-largest tax prep firm with storefront offices nationwide, cited a more modest estimate by the consulting firm Chappuis Halder: about 15.3 million account holders, or about 9% of taxpayers in the U.S., and 35 million to 68 million globally.  The available official numbers are not that impressive, points out Shehan Chandrasekera, head of strategy at CoinTracker: the IRS has so far released stats for the 2019 tax season, and according to the report, only about 928,000 taxpayers said they did crypto transactions during the 2019 fiscal year (fresher data is not available yet).  However, this is likely to change.  “Based on trends and market insights, we believe at least half of the U.S. tax-filing population (~75 million) has something to do with crypto,” Chandrasekera said.  “Some may have taxable transactions where they have to file forms with the IRS. Some may be HODLers with no reporting requirement until they sell assets,” he added, using crypto slang for long-term holders.  The tax-prep companies wouldn’t share their client numbers. But they’ve been attracting significant investment.  Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  Last August, TaxBit, which calculates crypto taxes both for consumers and the IRS, ​​raised $300 million in a Series B round at a $1.33 billion valuation. CoinTracker raised $100 million in January and is now valued at $1.3 billion. The company also announced an exclusive deal with Coinbase to help the Nasdaq-listed exchange’s users to properly report their crypto taxes.  Koinly, another firm in this category, is “seeing a significant uptick in our user numbers,” said Singh. The reason underscores the relative immaturity of the crypto industry.  The uptick “is fueled by the 1099 forms that exchanges are sending out to their users,” Singh said. “These forms are completely inaccurate in most cases since crypto traders have a number of wallets and exchange accounts, and no one exchange can produce an accurate report of the entire crypto activity.”  This problem is also what led two years ago to the “scary IRS letters” O’Connor mentioned. Cryptocurrency exchanges sent generated tax reports for their users, but those forms turned out to be incorrect, she said: Data about users’ transactions and gains was not balanced by the information on their initial purchases, making the IRS think they underreported their taxes.  Niches within niches  In this vast market, companies are picking different spots. Some catered to retail consumers first, some focused on enterprises and others also chose to provide technology to regulators.  TaxBit is concentrating on catering to crypto enterprises first of all: According to O’Connor, the initial mess with the tax forms mistakenly sent out by exchanges made her company’s founder think of how the situation can be fixed at its core. So in TaxBit’s model, exchanges using TaxBit’s service, or just joining its TaxBit Network, can offer free tax accounting for all of their users.  As for retail clients, O’Connor declined to reveal any concrete numbers but said that last year TaxBit generated “millions of tax forms” for consumers. “This year, we’re on pace to do 10x what we did last year,” she said.  TaxBit offers its service free to users of its enterprise clients. CoinTracker charges $59 for ""hobbyists"" (under 100 transactions per year), $199 for ""premium"" customers (under $1,000) and customizes pricing for bigger clients.  ZenLedger is a smaller competitor to TaxBit and CoinTracker and raised $6 million in a Series A last August. It chose an opposite approach: focus on retail users and create as many different blockchain integrations as they demand – and the enterprises will follow, said Hannum.  This year, ZenLedger is looking to serve 400,000 customers, which would represent 8x growth from the previous year, Hannum told CoinDesk. In terms of revenue, the company grew 12x – all of it driven by retail.  With the infrastructure bill passed by the Congress last year, stipulating that the U.S. will collect $30 billion in cryptocurrency-related taxes over the next 10 years, the IRS is now busy ramping up its technological and human resources, Hannum said. Over the next 10 years, the IRS is getting $80 billion of federal funding to invest in tech and people – “a large percentage of that will be used for cryptocurrency,” Hannum said.  Read More: Your Staking Rewards Are Still Taxable  That’s another opportunity for crypto accounting companies: to provide forensic solutions to government agencies to help them find crypto traders failing to report their taxes properly. ZenLedger has been providing this kind of technology to the IRS, as well as to the state governments and other countries’ authorities, too, according to Hannum. This global market for taxation regulatory technology is a “multibillion dollar industry,” growing exponentially, he said.  Retail users don’t need to worry about the IRS contract, Hannum says: “ZenLedger and our government contracting arm are two separate entities. ZenLedger will never give customers' information to the IRS. Instead, the IRS provides our government entity data completely independent from ZenLedger's client base. Our customers use our software to report their own activity directly to the IRS.”  Household names enter  Mainstream tax filing companies, like software provider TurboTax or storefront chain H&R Block, will likely acquire startups specializing in crypto rather than build their own tech from scratch, Hannum predicted.  ZenLedger is getting acquisition offers, he claimed, but for now, his company sees “a big green field ahead” and would rather keep building than sell.  However, some incumbents are building rather than buying: “At Jackson Hewitt, we train our tax pros on tax preparation using our internally sourced training materials (which includes what cryptocurrency is and how to handle it on a tax return) and create our own tax software that can handle cryptocurrency, whether it is payment for a business, payment to a client or investing,” Steber said. The company does not have “an account management or crypto support for portfolio issues,” he said.  TurboTax’s parent company Intuit did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment. But TurboTax is definitely looking to get a piece of the crypto tax pie, with its recent ad targeting cryptocurrency traders.  H&R Block, another household name in the tax filing industry, said it “has prioritized enhancing and expanding the cryptocurrency guidance” this year. “H&R Block is also engaging with leading crypto tax calculator providers to identify solutions that may help our clients navigate the complexities of reporting crypto transactions,” the firm’s media representative said.  Lots of luck, says Kemmerer of CryptoTrader.Tax.  “Traditional tax companies like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt are going to have extremely difficult times keeping up with the demand for crypto tax services in the future because this is a fundamentally new asset class that requires a completely different tech stack to effectively serve clients (blockchains, wallets, etc.),” he said.  Just as mainstream stock exchanges like Nasdaq and NYSE haven’t built competitors to Coinbase and Gemini, old-school tax accounting firms are struggling to keep up with the nascent market, Kemmerer said. “As history shows, building brand new technologies from the ground up is extremely difficult for large incumbents who don't have expertise in the space.”  As more jurisdictions adopt cryptocurrency-specific taxation rules, the U.S.-based startups are looking to expand overseas. TaxBit is looking to serve taxpayers in the U.K., Canada and “most likely, Australia,” O’Connor said, adding the company is talking to potential enterprise clients in Europe and Latin America.  CoinTracker supports clients in the U.K., Canada and Australia, Chandrasekera said, and “planning to expand services into more countries as well.”  ZenLedger is eyeing Canada, Australia and various countries in Europe and Asia, Hannum said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/23/crypto-tax-prep-business-booms-as-trading-surges-and-irs-tightens-screws,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51a062477c3f92c860ab0f09714d52fbde9df8b0-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407268,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVQxya,1645626095,Form 1099-B Is Not the Solution to Your Cryptocurrency Tax Problems,"With the passage of the U.S. infrastructure bill in November, “crypto brokers” (i.e., cryptocurrency exchanges and other third parties that facilitate the transfer of digital assets) will be required to report customers’ cryptocurrency transactions to the Internal Revenue Service via Form 1099-B.  Form 1099-B is being framed as a “solution” to your crypto tax problems by regulators and financially incentivized market participants.  Unfortunately, this couldn’t be further from the truth.  David Kemmerer is the CEO and Co-founder of CryptoTrader.Tax, a crypto tax software startup.  The rollout of Form 1099-B among America’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges will create one of the biggest tax headaches for cryptocurrency users you’ve ever seen.  What is form 1099-B?  The 1099 information reporting has existed for a long time in the ‘‘traditional‘’ financial world. All 1099 reporting serves the same general purpose: to report non-employment related income to the IRS, i.e., income earned outside of a W2 form.  1099-B is a specific type of 1099 that reports capital gains and losses from securities or property involved in a transaction handled by a broker.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  Some examples of brokers you may know from the traditional finance world include eTrade, Charles Schwab and Robinhood. These securities brokers are required to send you and the IRS a copy of your 1099-B at the end of each year reporting your cost basis, proceeds and associated gains or losses from each of your transactions that occurred on the broker’s platform. (“Cost basis” refers to the original value of an asset or investment for tax purposes.)  You as the taxpayer use this 1099-B to report your capital gains or losses on your taxes, and the IRS uses it to verify that you reported the correct amount of income.  Why are things different for crypto brokers?  At first glance, it makes sense for regulators to want the same 1099 requirements for Coinbase and Kraken as forCharles Schwab and Robinhood. Both platforms broker the sale or exchange of capital assets that result in capital gain income.  But from a technical perspective cryptocurrency and digital assets operate completely differently from equities. It’s this fundamental difference that makes 1099-B a poor solution for crypto transaction reporting, and it’s this difference that is going to lead to immense pain for taxpayers as 1099-B reporting gets rolled out across all major U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges in the years to come.  Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Digital assets and cryptocurrencies are interoperable  Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies and digital assets are built to be interoperable. This is fundamental to the technology underpinning them – blockchains.  The interoperability enabled by blockchains is what enables a crypto user to freely send digital assets from one wallet to another, without the need for a third party to “validate” or “facilitate” the transaction.  This is one of the huge technological breakthroughs of blockchains. The cost associated with running third-party entities to be middlemen for “transferring value” can now be removed, and those economic resources can be deployed more efficiently across the economy.  Peer-to-peer interoperability is a massive technical breakthrough.  Unfortunately, it’s this interoperability that makes 1099-B a terrible solution for tax information reporting for cryptocurrency exchanges.  Cryptocurrency exchanges don’t have cost basis information  Because you can send cryptocurrencies and digital assets freely into or out of your cryptocurrency exchange from any wallet, exchanges won’t always have the cost basis information for your digital assets held on their platform.  Remember, digital assets like bitcoin know no physical boundaries. You can freely send your bitcoin or ether from a wallet that you self-custody into your exchange of choice, without friction.  These wallet-wallet digital asset transfers happen millions of times every single day.  As a result, when you transfer your cryptocurrency assets into your exchange of choice, your exchange typically does not know the original cost basis for that cryptocurrency .  This is critical to understand. If your cryptocurrency exchange accepts wallet transfers into its platform, your exchange will not always be able to fully complete a 1099-B for you because it’s missing a critical component for reporting: cost basis.  An example  Say you buy 1 bitcoin for $20,000 from Cryptocurrency Exchange A. Immediately after the purchase, you send it to your self-custodied wallet for safekeeping. Months later, after bitcoin has skyrocketed in price, you decide it’s time to sell so you send your bitcoin from your self-custodied wallet to your other exchange, Cryptocurrency Exchange B, and sell it for $50,000.  In this simplistic example, Cryptocurrency Exchange B has no idea that your cost basis for your 1 bitcoin is $20,000. Cryptocurrency Exchange B only sees a transfer of 1 bitcoin into its platform from a third-party wallet and a sale of this BTC for $50,000.  With the passage of the infrastructure bill, Cryptocurrency Exchange B will be required to report this disposal of BTC on a 1099-B to the IRS. However, it will be reported with a blank, or null, cost basis field:  Proceeds: $50,000  Cost basis: UNKNOWN  Gain: …. $50,000 ?  When the IRS receives a copy of this 1099-B, it will see that you sold $50,000 of bitcoin on Cryptocurrency Exchange B. However, it will not be able to see that your true capital gains for this transaction were actually only $30,000. It will be up to you to prove your cost basis was indeed $20,000. If you can’t prove it, you could be stuck with a zero-dollar cost basis and face a $50,000 capital gain tax bill.  This, of course, is going to happen at scale, for millions of taxpayers, with millions of 1099-Bs, all with blank or unknown cost basis fields.  Read more: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  Cost basis transfer reporting  I know what you’re thinking.  “We should just require exchanges to report cost basis information to each other whenever customers transfer digital assets to and from their platform! That’s how it works for equity brokers!”  Naturally, this is exactly how the regulators see the issue, and this is why a component of this new legislation for cryptocurrency brokers requires exactly that: cryptocurrency brokers to report cost basis information to each other.  However, this approach does not solve the fundamental problem.  Remember, at their core, cryptocurrencies and digital assets operate in a completely decentralized fashion – very different from equities. They don’t depend on centralized third-party companies to exist or operate. Yes, many centralized companies (crypto exchanges) have popped up to make it easier for users to interact with blockchains themselves, but these centralized exchanges are not the only players in this market.  The ecosystem consists of thousands of decentralized wallets, protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and other applications that enable users to interact with these same blockchains – whether using a centralized third party or not.  For 1099-B reporting to be truly effective (in the way that it is effective for traditional equities brokers), cryptocurrency brokers would have to operate in a siloed, walled-garden fashion. They wouldn’t be able to allow transfers into or out of their platforms if the counterparty couldn’t pass along or store sensitive customer data for them. If they did, they wouldn’t be able to accurately report cost basis and thus gains/losses to users.  Is Coinbase going to shut down the ability of its users to accept wallet deposits from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, self-custodied wallets, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and other decentralized market participants that don’t have the ability to report a user’s cost basis, name, address and Social Security number upon a transfer into a Coinbase custodied wallet?  Given its mission of enabling an open financial system, I hope not.  Next steps  The 1099-B is not the solution for cryptocurrency tax reporting.  Financially incentivized market participants that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital will try to convince you that it is but alas, it is not.  Digital assets will continue to operate in an open and decentralized fashion whether or not regulators force the hand of America’s largest cryptocurrency brokers. The genie is out of the bottle, and decentralized applications used by millions of people all over the world are only going to become more developed in the years ahead.  So, instead of enforcing 1099 reporting that was developed for a completely different asset class, what if we came up with new, more sensible rules? (We have some ideas!)  If we don’t come together to create new, thoughtful regulation for this fundamentally new asset class, we risk forcing one of the largest technology shifts of our time to be developed outside of the United States.  I encourage all regulators and stakeholders to get in touch with myself and my team directly if these matters are meaningful to you, or if you simply have questions. We would love to chat.

42407269,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVQy1t,1645626034,Crypto Tax Compliance Remains Minefield as IRS Leaves Key Questions Unresolved,"The old saw about taxes being one of life’s two certainties is only partially true for crypto investors in the United States.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week series.  While there’s little argument that gains and losses associated with cryptocurrency transactions are taxable, there is little certainty about which taxes apply to different kinds of transactions and when.  Rob Garver is a longtime Washington, D.C., journalist who has written for American Banker, the Fiscal Times, Voice of America and ProPublica.  While some U.S. regulators, such as the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have tried to be proactive in providing guidance to the industry about how they plan to treat crypto assets, the Internal Revenue Service has, so far, offered relatively little guidance on some of the most pressing issues facing investors and traders.  “Tax policy is, by far, the area of U.S. policy that's the furthest behind, as far as having sensible, easy-to-follow rules for people in the space,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at industry lobbying group Coin Center. “We saw much earlier guidance from FinCEN on anti-money laundering policy, much earlier guidance from the SEC on [initial coin offerings]. The IRS, when it has issued guidance, it has been perennially late. And that guidance has generally been more confusing than helpful.”  The IRS did not respond to a request for comment for this story.  Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, put it a tad more diplomatically.  “This is a very fast-moving space, and the IRS and Treasury Department have been trying to wrap their heads around it,” she said.  The agency was actually ahead of other regulators when, in 2014, it offered guidance that classified “convertible virtual currency” (the Beltway term for what most people call “crypto”) as property. However, progress has stalled since then, and the issues have begun piling up.  Smith said the industry generally thinks the IRS is operating in good faith, if more slowly than most would prefer.  “These are obviously people that don't have deep crypto backgrounds,” she said. “But I think they've taken a lot of effort to try to understand this space.”  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Congress gets involved in taxing crypto  If the IRS is moving slowly out of an abundance of caution (or, at worst, bureaucratic inertia), that may be preferable to the alternative, as evidenced by what happened when members of Congress pushed crypto-related language into the bipartisan infrastructure bill that became law in November.  In an effort to bring in more tax revenue from crypto traders, lawmakers created a requirement that cryptocurrency “brokers” report their clients’ trading activity to the IRS. Unfortunately, the legislative language was drafted quickly and with little input from the industry, leading to a definition of broker that is so broad that industry representatives warn it could encompass wallet software developers and even cryptocurrency miners.  The Treasury Department will have to draft implementing regulations before the law goes into effect in 2024, and in doing so it could narrow the range of entities that qualify as a broker. In a letter to lawmakers made public Feb. 11, the agency appeared to signal that crypto miners and stakers, at least, will not be considered brokers under the pending rule.  “I don't think that the intention of the law and the IRS is to capture miners, for example, or stakers,” said Omri Marian, a professor of law and the academic director of the Graduate Tax Program at the University of California, Irvine School of Law.  However, he said, it would be a useful sign of “goodwill” for the IRS to reach out to the crypto community during the rulemaking process. “I think that mostly what is needed there is to lower the tension a bit and explain who is and isn't the broker for reporting purposes.”  Some members of Congress have signaled they understand the industry’s concerns and are open to passing new legislation that would limit the definition of broker to an actual cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates transactions. However, given the deep divisions in Congress, it is unclear what the chances really are of such a bill passing.  Wait, crypto is cash now?  The same infrastructure bill that created the broker reporting requirement added another twist to the government’s tax treatment of cryptocurrencies. After years of being told their bitcoin and ether are property and not currency, the new law created an exception.  Under existing law, any person engaged in “trade or business” who receives $10,000 or more in cash in exchange for goods or services is obligated to report that transaction. The report, which includes identifying information about the individual who made the payment, goes to the IRS and FinCEN. The new law classifies cryptocurrencies as cash for purposes of that reporting requirement.  Because of the way the law is drafted, reports on crypto transactions of more than $10,000 would only need to go to the IRS, but that hasn’t made industry participants any less concerned about the effect it could have on some sectors of the crypto space.  The problem is that, in many cases, cryptocurrency transactions are functionally anonymous, meaning the individual on the receiving end of a transaction may not have access to the kinds of personal identifiable information about the sender the IRS wants to collect (or vice versa).  Additionally, many crypto transactions take place under circumstances that make it very difficult to assess who would be responsible for reporting. If a smart contract running on a decentralized exchange accepts $10,000 worth of bitcoin, who would file that report?  Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  The cup of coffee exemption  One of the perennial frustrations of people who would like to use cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange is the tax treatment of virtual currency as property means that virtually every transaction, no matter how small, amounts to a taxable event.  When someone holding bitcoin uses it to make a purchase, the IRS views the transfer of bitcoin from the buyer to the seller as the disposition of an investment, triggering capital gains taxes. Even the mining fees incurred when transferring bitcoin between two wallets held by the same individual are, technically, taxable.  Some, like Kirk Phillips, a certified public accountant and managing director of Global Crypto Advisors, say the administrative burden of tracking even the tiniest of transactions are standing in the way of cryptocurrencies becoming a more widely used medium of exchange.  “There are definitely people who have changed their behavior based on how it ends up getting taxed and having to go through the compliance gauntlet,” he said. “It's a major headache.”  There is a bill before Congress that would create what's known as a de minimis exemption for small transactions. The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act, sponsored by Rep. Suzan Delbene of Washington state, a Democrat, would exempt from capital gains taxes all crypto transactions in which the capital gain realized is under $200.  However, despite the fact the bill has broad support in the crypto community and has bipartisan backing in the House of Representatives, its chances of enactment are unclear. This is the third Congress in which the bill has been introduced and, to date, there is no similar legislation pending in the Senate,  Taxation and staking rewards  One of the more pressing issues facing the industry, given the increasing preference for proof-of-stake mining, is how staking rewards ought to be taxed.  The basic question is whether the cryptocurrency that a validator receives as a reward for appending a block to a proof-of-stake blockchain is taxable as income when it is received, or whether there is no taxable event until the validator disposes of the currency.  In a lawsuit filed in Tennessee, Joshua and Jessica Jarrett, a couple who run a validator on the Tezos blockchain, sued the IRS over taxes paid on staking rewards earned in 2019. The Jarretts argued that his receipt of the rewards ought not to have been considered a taxable event.  Rather than fight the case in court, the IRS offered, early this month, to refund the taxes the couple had paid, though without offering any clarity on how it would treat staking rewards in the future. The Jarretts rejected the offer, in a move aimed at forcing the courts to resolve the question of how to treat staking rewards.  The resulting situation is representative of much of the tax treatment of crypto transactions. In the absence of clear rules from the IRS, individuals are having to make their best guesses about how they think the agency will treat different transactions.  “I am only dealing with a limited number of taxpayers, but I don't know of anybody that's actually withholding on staking rewards,” said Lisa Zarlenga, a partner in the Washington office of the law firm Steptoe & Johnson. “If the IRS’ position is that they should be subject to withholding, I don't think it's happening.”  She said that, in general, taxpayers she works with are making a good faith effort to comply with tax laws by reporting income, when they believe it makes sense to report it.  “This could all hit the fan if the IRS starts auditing these transactions and taking positions that are different from what taxpayers are taking,” she said. “Then it could have a stifling effect.”  However, she said that as a practical matter it seems unlikely the IRS would implement some sort of retroactive crackdown that would penalize people who report income in a way the agency subsequently determined to be incorrect.  “I would be surprised if they started imposing penalties on people because they didn't comply, because there were no rules to comply with,” she said. “What they're more concerned about are non-reporters, people who aren't reporting their income from crypto transactions at all.”  Read More: Your Staking Rewards Are Still Taxable  Below the radar  While there may not be much clarity on the tax treatment of staking rewards, at least the crypto community can feel confident the issue is on the IRS’ radar. The same can’t be said for multiple other issues.  Consider, for example, the market for non-fungible tokens (NFT), which reached more than $44 billion in sales in 2021, according to the blockchain data firm Chainalysis. A large segment of that market is made up of pieces of digital art, or the bragging rights thereof.  While new collectors may be content, for the time being, to stare at their digital galleries of Bored Apes and Hashmasks, eventually many are going to want to sell their NFTs. When that happens, how the IRS will treat any profit they realize is an open question.  Regular long-term capital gains taxes in the U.S., which apply to the sale of investments held for more than one year, max out at 20%. But there is a special carve-out for property classified as “collectibles,” a category that includes fine art, that tops out at 28%.  To date, the IRS has been silent on the question of whether NFTs ought to be treated as collectibles, creating the disconcerting possibility that the question of whether NFTs constitute real art might be determined in tax court.  Another area where existing rules are creating confusion is around the tax status of individuals who trade cryptocurrencies for a living. Under the law, an individual who buys and sells stocks and securities can claim “trader status” when they file their taxes, allowing them to deduct business expenses from their trading gains, and offering a number of other benefits.  The problem, said Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at Cointracker.io, a portfolio and tax management service, is the statutory language appears to limit trader status to individuals who sell stocks and securities – not property, as crypto is classified.  “For people who are legitimately day-trading cryptocurrencies, the question is whether they should rely on those code sections that are written for stocks and securities to get those tax benefits,” he said. “Because if you can get that trader status, that's going to save you so much money in taxes. They struggle because it's only applicable to stocks and securities, but at the same time, it's unfair for them to not get that treatment, because they're actual traders of cryptocurrencies.”  This neither-here-nor-there status for crypto traders is analogous to the tax treatment of crypto assets more broadly. It’s a situation that frustrates advocates pushing for more clarity from the government, especially because it contributes to the impression the crypto space is a sort of Wild West, where the normal rules don’t apply.  “There's this myth that ‘crypto people just don't want to pay taxes,’” Coin Center’s Van Valkenburgh said. “I think the vast majority of people in crypto, just like the vast majority of Americans, just want clear rules to know what their tax obligations are so that every April isn't a nightmare. Then they'd be happy – as happy as anyone ever is – to pay their taxes.”     Further Reading on CoinDesk's Tax Week  The Automatic Tax Man Cometh  Crypto won’t save you from taxes, but it may eventually make them easier to pay, says futurist Dan Jeffries.

42416651,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWWu3,1645624800,1Password Adds 1-Click Credential Storage for Solana-Based Phantom Wallet Users,"Every year people lose access to their digital wallets due to poor key management. Now, 1Password, a popular secure password management platform, has teamed up with crypto wallet provider Phantom to help prevent this sort of loss.  Phantom wallet allows users to securely access cryptocurrencies, digital assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more that are built on the Solana blockchain. Following today’s application programming interface (API) integration, Phantom wallet users can now store all their wallet passwords and keys to 1Password.  Read more: Blockchain Is Secure, but You Are Not  Human error meets human-centric security  Many don’t realize how important it is to safeguard their login credentials to their crypto wallets, or they don't understand how to do so safely, securely and privately.  People who lose their credentials by not saving their seed phrase, a series of words unique to one’s specific cryptocurrency wallet, find themselves unable to access their funds or to reset credentials and restore access to their digital wallets.  Whether it is not understanding the technology, pure indifference or simple security fatigue brought on by the constant need to set up and remember login credentials, this “human element” is the cause of 85% of data breaches, according to Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach Investigations.  According to Matt O’Leary, 1Password’s vice president of partnerships, we are often too tired or busy to take the necessary steps and follow best security practices.  To enhance user experience safety and to hedge against this human error, 1Password takes a “human centric” security approach.  Read more: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  “We want people to be able to store their life securely in 1Password, wherever they are. And increasingly that is in the world of crypto,” said O’Leary, in a conversation with CoinDesk.  The intention, he added, is to “make the secure choice the easy choice.”  ""1Password shares our commitment to help bring Web 3 mainstream by making the user experience safe and easy-to-use,"" said Brandon Millman, CEO of Phantom, in a statement. ""Together with 1Password, we will provide an industry-leading approach to key management, so our users can focus on using their crypto wallet, instead of protecting it.""  Both 1Password and Phantom wallet can be accessed via browser extensions. A personal 1Password account starts at $2.99 per month, with plans available for families and business as well.  Read more: Meet the Technician Who Unlocks Your Forgotten Crypto Wallets  Any Phantom wallet user who has signed up for 1Password and downloaded the extension can simply click the “Save in 1Password” button to save their private key, public key and password for their wallet in their 1Password vault, just as they might already be using it to store their Bank of America or Amazon account logins.  Future integrations  For now, the Solana-based Phantom wallet is the only crypto wallet integration available on 1Password, although O’Leary hinted that there might be more in the works.  “When we built this API, the 'Save in 1Password' API, the idea was that it would be the basis for a number of different partnerships,” he said, although he was unable to provide further details.  O’Leary did acknowledge it would be “a really good idea” to integrate with an Ethereum-based wallet, given the magnitude of users and NFTs native to the Ethereum blockchain.  “I think we're uniquely positioned to help as a password manager. We're available on every platform; people store their lives in our product,” said O’Leary. “This is actually just an extension of what we do, what we built our business on, which is helping people to store private information.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | SOL,Sage D.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Terra's LUNA leads recovery in the crypto market.

And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests:  Marc LoPresti, managing director, The Strategic Funds  Michael Chobanian, founder, KUNA Exchange  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin was better bid while heading into the American trading hours, with traditional markets pointing to continued risk reset. At press time, the Aussie dollar and the New Zealand dollar were trading higher against the greenback, and the futures tied to the S&P 500 pointed to a positive open with a 0.4% gain.  ""The market appears to be judging the initial salvo of sanctions against Russia for formally recognizing the separatist regions in Ukraine as modest at best and has preceded to take on more risk,"" Bannockburn Global Forex's Marc Chandler said in a blog post.  Terra's LUNA token, Cardano's ADA and Avalanche's AVAX led the recovery in the broader crypto market with double-digit gains on a 24-hour basis. LUNA's strength perhaps stemmed from Singapore-based nonprofit organization Luna Foundation Guard's (LFG) decision to create a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for UST – Terra's decentralized stablecoin.  LDO, the governance token of liquid staking protocol Lido, dipped to $1.60, trimming Tuesday's 37% spike from $1.36 to $1.87 despite continued inflows into the protocol. ""Yesterday, someone staked 28,000 ETH ($75m) with Lido in a single transaction. That's the 5th largest staking transaction into Lido so far. And today, another 22,500 ETH was staked (7th largest),"" analytics firm Nansen's CEO Alex Svanevik tweeted.

The annualized rolling three-month futures premium continues to trend south in major exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Binance, indicating pessimism among both institutional and retail traders.  The CME futures traded at a premium of 2% at press time, while offshore futures traded at a premium of over 3%, according to data provided by Skew.  ""The futures basis still experience a steady decline as the bears show no signs of stopping,"" Arcane Research said in a weekly note published Tuesday. Basis refers to the spread between prices in futures and spot markets.  The options market continued to show a put bias with one-, three- and six-month put-call skews returning positive values. A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market.  From a technical analysis perspective, $44,000 appears to be the resistance to beat for the bitcoin bulls. The cryptocurrency recently failed to establish a foothold above that level, as evident from the long upper wicks attached to the previous two weekly candles.  Bull Market in Stablecoins  By Omkar Godbole  The supply of stablecoins or cryptocurrencies with values pegged to external references like the U.S. dollar continues to grow even as the broader crypto market remains depressed.  Coingecko data showsthe market capitalization of stablecoins has risen above $180 billion, marking a 32% jump from the tally of $141 billion observed before the crypto market peaked in mid-November.  ""Tether (USDT) is the biggest stablecoin with a 44% market share, followed by USD Coin (USDC) with 29%, and Binance USD (BUSD) with 20%. USDC grew extremely fast in 2021 and has continued its strong growth in 2022 with a 20% growth,"" Arcane Research noted. ""Since the summer of 2021, USDT's growth has stagnated, and it has only grown 1% so far in 2022.""  The popular narrative says that the surge in stablecoin supply represents ""dry powder,"" which can be used to snap up cryptocurrencies at cheap prices.  However, that's not necessarily true, and investors could be simply seeking refuge in the stablecoins offering protection from market volatility.  Besides, prospects of higher interest rates in the U.S. could be powering demand for these dollar-pegged currencies.",NEUTRAL,ADA | LUNA,ADA | BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Parikshit Mishra",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/23/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-may-not-be-out-of-the-woods-yet-stablecoins-bull-market-continues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f99ab56e73abfa19bdb6f2eedad2cdf5144d81e3-600x234.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416647,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWWe0,1645624218,Coinbase’s Q4 Trading Volumes Set to Increase but Outlook Could Get Gloomy Amid Volatility,"Coinbase Global (COIN) is set to report a rise in its overall crypto trading volumes in the fourth quarter when it releases earnings on Thursday after the market close. But a volatile start to the year could create some uncertainty in the crypto exchange’s outlook.  Mizuho Securities equity research analyst Dan Dolev expects the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange to post trading volume of $525 billion for its fourth quarter, up 61% from its third quarter total of $327 billion. Over at Needham & Co., analyst John Todaro, who has a buy rating on Coinbase, expects volume of $465 billion, which he increased from his previous estimate of $355 billion, citing higher retail trading earlier in the quarter in October, along with an increase in app downloads during that time.  Coinbase said during its latest earnings release in November that “while we entered Q3 with softer crypto market conditions, driven by low volatility and declining crypto asset prices, market conditions improved meaningfully later in the quarter which we have continued to see into early Q4.” Since then, crypto prices including bitcoin and ether have remained especially volatile amid what some refer to as a “crypto winter.” The broader technology and growth stock categories have also retreated as Wall Street braces for higher interest rates.  Still, Mizuho’s Dolev thinks the first quarter could bring more headwinds for Coinbase. “The relatively sluggish start to 2022 may impact management’s guide for the full year” with respect to overall company revenue, he told clients in a note, maintaining a neutral rating on the stock.  On Tuesday, D.A. Davidson's Christopher Brendler, who has a buy rating on Coinbase, said that he was raising his Q4 estimates but lowering its estimates for 2022-2024. ""Publicly available exchange data suggests COIN had a much better-than-expected 4Q21 but 1Q22 activity has slowed dramatically,"" Brendler wrote.  Others are sticking with Coinbase and continuing to recommend it for clients despite its near-term volatility. “While we acknowledge that recent declines in crypto prices have negative implications for near term earnings, we continue to believe that 2022 could bring with it new opportunities for new revenue streams and new products,” Goldman Sachs’ Will Nance told clients in a Jan. 26 note and maintained its buy recommendation on the shares, though it did cut its price target on shares from $352 to $288. Goldman cited new businesses such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) and derivatives as ways in which Coinbase can diversify its revenue streams.  Read more: Coinbase Tries to Catch Up to Foreign-Based Rivals With Move Into Derivatives  Overall, analysts are expecting Coinbase to report $2.0 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to FactSet, compared to $1.3 billion in the third quarter and $585 million in the year ago quarter, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.94, versus $1.62 in the third quarter. Shares are down about 30% this year, and nearly 50% since debuting on the Nasdaq in April of last year.  As for the first quarter, Coinbase may get a boost from its much-talked-about Super Bowl LVI ad that featured a color-changing QR code bouncing around a blank screen for a full minute. When scanned, the code brought users to a sign-up page for Coinbase. The resulting traffic was so large that the site went down for a period of time.  “This marketing strategy worked, and the implication is Coinbase could have just signed up enormous new users in 1Q22, at a reasonable cost,” according to Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau. Lau, who maintains an outperform recommendation on the stock, said in a note to clients that this may lead to a jump in Coinbase’s total users for the first quarter.

42390172,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bWOZ7P,1645622100,A Healthy US Bitcoin Mining Industry Could Generate Significant Tax Revenue,"Crypto supporters were taken aback this past July when the infrastructure bill brought to the U.S. Congress claimed it could raise $28 billion from crypto investors by applying new information-reporting requirements to exchanges and other parties. This projection ended up getting beat down on the internet as the dollar amount seemed to be plucked out of thin air. In reality, figuring out how much taxes crypto investors owe based on their capital gains is incredibly difficult to estimate.  Theoretically, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could look through every transaction on every blockchain to see profits and losses in each wallet or account. From there, the IRS could figure out the amount of on-chain gains it could tax. However, that raises the issue of whether those assets were sent from one wallet to another with the same owner, something that may not make it a taxable event. On top of that, there’s the difficulty of getting good information from exchanges to figure out the amount of off-chain gains the IRS could tax. In practice, this collection and estimation process is a mess.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  If the U.S. government wants to raise money through taxation on crypto, it could consider encouraging bitcoin miners to set up shop. Doing so could bring in tax revenue inflows from the companies that set up mining operations.  For Tax Week, we wanted to estimate the amount of revenue the U.S. government could stand to gain from bitcoin mining companies. While the result of this exercise is subject to the assumptions underpinning the model, they are worth the look. The fact that this exercise is even possible is a testament to bitcoin mining’s transparency and simplicity.  The framework  We built a relatively simple estimate of bitcoin mining profitability using an open-sourced model developed by Galaxy Digital to approximate the cost of mining a bitcoin (the report the model came from is available here), applying simplifying assumptions to represent the entire bitcoin market.  A few caveats before we dive into a brief overview of the methodology are worth mentioning: Right now, there are several publicly traded bitcoin mining companies (which is sometimes referred to as CHARM for Core Scientific, Hut 8, Argo Blockchain, Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital). Public companies are required to share financial information and those reports show that bitcoin mining companies are, by and large, not paying very many taxes.  In fact, some of the companies book income statement losses and are paying no taxes at all. Start-ups – which bitcoin miners are – are generally unprofitable as they look to spend money building up operations. Our model strips out the business decisions that young companies must make when they are growing, meaning that it only works in a world with a more mature bitcoin mining industry.  Read more: 8 Trends That Will Shape Bitcoin Mining in 2022  We also wanted to normalize for accounting methods allowing companies to minimize tax burdens, mostly through non-cash charges like share-based compensation and some types of depreciation. Doing so makes a company look less profitable on paper than it is in reality.  The last simplifying assumption we make is a big one, in that bitcoin mining profitability will not trend to zero. There is a solid theoretical argument that bitcoin mining economic profit margins will approach zero as new entrants join the relatively low barrier-to-entry market. (The CoinDesk report ""Does Bitcoin Have an Energy Problem?"" suggests that “bitcoin mining [profit] margins are relatively capped.”) In reality, businesses need to make money over the long term in order to stay open, so we assume that bitcoin miners won’t lose all profitability for at least the near- to medium-term.  The model  Our work relied on the model done by Galaxy Digital for a simple reason. We know roughly how much revenue miners will collect annually in bitcoin terms. The Bitcoin protocol is designed in a way so that a block is mined roughly every 10 minutes, so we can say with confidence that the amount of revenue miners will make annually is 328,500 bitcoin plus transaction fees, which nominally make up about 3% of the current block reward.  As such, the main focus for determining profitability should be on estimating costs. The three main expenses we looked to estimate were cost of revenue (mainly electricity costs for mining); selling, general and administrative expenses (general costs like marketing and rent); and depreciation (a non-cash but real expense that represents the wear and tear on machines used for mining).  In plain English, we looked to estimate the cost of the electricity it takes to power mining rigs and the cost of “keeping the lights on.”  The main cost driver for bitcoin mining is a function of electricity use and price. Galaxy’s model calculates the cost of bitcoin production based on the specifications and performance of 18 different models of ASIC mining machines. These machines draw different amounts of power at varying levels of efficiency. Each type of mining machine operates at a different level of profitability based on the cost of electricity per kilowatt hour. Our base case assumed $0.06 per kwh of electricity cost.  Next, in this machinery-heavy business, the mining companies that buy ASICs have a meaningful amount of depreciation to deal with. Our model assumes 22.5% of revenue as the base case based on the assumption that mining companies will depreciate their ASICs over five years.  These companies then have other costs associated with SG&A which, through public company comparisons and informed by Galaxy’s work, is estimated to be around 12.5%.  Lastly, we included a catch-all for “other expenses” that made up 3.5% of revenues, as a way to curtail the potential overstatement of profitability. We could have easily made the same adjustment in the other direction and recognize this is largely a design choice by our team.  The result  Below we present our results in two-way charts using various scenarios adjusting for bitcoin price, Bitcoin’s total hashrate, the cost of electricity and U.S. share of global hashrate. The numbers in the chart represent the annual federal tax revenue to the government from mining companies, assuming a 21% federal corporate tax rate.  In the event the input is not sensitized against in the chart, the base case is:  Global bitcoin hashrate of 200 EH/s  Electricity cost of $0.06 kwh  U.S. has a 30% share of global hashrate  21% federal corporate tax rate  In the base case scenario, bitcoin miner pre-tax profitability was estimated at $1.4 billion and a tax bill of $299 million. That scenario shows up in the middle of each table below. All other numbers in the tables are representative of estimated taxes if those inputs were changed. For example, if bitcoin price were $60,000 and hashrate were 250 EH/s, taxes to the U.S. government would be $335 million.  Conclusion and disclaimer  Of course, this exercise was for informational purposes and the results provided are for illustrative purposes only.  We recognize the shortcomings of our model and this exercise. But at the very least, bitcoin mining represents a potentially profitable industry that, when domiciled in the U.S., could provide the government with increased tax revenue. While the specifics of “how much” revenue this could bring the government vary greatly (showcased by the wide range of dollar amounts shown in the two-way tables, in some scenarios even hitting $0), profitable businesses represent tax revenue opportunities for the U.S. government.

42416657,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWX6t,1645621200,Cosmos Builder Tendermint Rebrands to ‘Ignite’ as Team Shifts Focus,"Tendermint, the company that launched the blockchain-interoperability protocol Cosmos, announced Wednesday it is rebranding to “Ignite.”  Ignite CEO Peng Zhong told CoinDesk that the rebranding doesn't involve major changes to the firm’s road map or leadership. Instead, the brand refresh is meant to symbolize a pivot to “a product-first focus,” with the name “Ignite” bringing to mind “the initiation of change and action.” Tendermint’s prior focus was on developing back-end Cosmos infrastructure.  The refresh comes as ATOM, the native token of the Cosmos blockchain, tops $7 billion in market capitalization. LUNA, the native token of the Cosmos-based Terra blockchain, has climbed to a market cap of $44 billion, suggesting that much of Tendermint’s early goals may have already been accomplished.  Zhong, who has a background in front-end development, frames Ignite’s pivot as a way to play to his team’s design and product chops. The team’s new growth strategy involves optimizing the user experience of Ignite’s portfolio manager, Emeris, to better on-board newer users into Cosmos and build its developer platform, Starport, into a tool that enables non-coders to easily churn out blockchains and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  Cosmos history  Ignite launched Cosmos in 2017 to support its vision of a multi-chain future, where many different blockchains coexist to support specific use-cases.  Today, transferring assets between blockchains like Ethereum and Solana can be accomplished through the use of cross-chain “bridges,” but the recent $326 million hack of the Wormhole bridge demonstrates that sending assets between distinct blockchains can pose security risks. Cosmos provides a way for developers to quickly spin up blockchains that can interact with one another without the need for specialized tooling.  Since its launch, the Cosmos network has grown to host 38 different blockchains with a combined market cap of over $122 billion, and Ignite’s tools have been used by major projects like Terra, Binance Smart Chain and Facebook’s ill-fated libra stablecoin.  The Ignite team was responsible for building out the core infrastructure underpinning Cosmos, but the bulk of the project’s development has gradually shifted away from Ignite to Cosmos’s broader development community.  Though Ignite is over eight years old – practically ancient in crypto years – Zhong insists that the company is only at the beginning of its journey.  “We’re going see a future of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of [blockchains] connected to each other,” Zhong said in an interview. “That sort of growth is really only possible if we help educate, excite and galvanize people to build and be a part of this ecosystem together.”  Despite the messy breakup of Ignite’s founding team in 2020, the Cosmos ecosystem has enjoyed steady growth over the past year, and Ignite hired 90 new employees in 2021, bringing its total headcount to 120.",POSITIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/23/cosmos-builder-tendermint-rebrands-to-ignite-as-team-shifts-focus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0e6d26f8b429115f007bd47551d0c9bca60ba46-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning body, proposed punitive electricity prices for crypto miners in November.  The NDRC's Zhejiang branch and the local agency of the national grid operator jointly published a notice on Feb. 14 saying crypto miners would have to pay an additional RMB 0.5 ($0.79) per kilowatt hour (kWh). The notice also called on government entities and grid operators to strengthen their monitoring for crypto mining activity. The notice was dated Feb. 11, meaning it was probably passed around government departments and key stakeholders before being posted online.  In December, the southern island of Hainan introduced an RMB 0.8 per kWh surcharge for miners, CCTV reported. Inner Mongolia added RMB 1.0 per kWh starting in January.  An official from the Zhejiang Government Service Center told reporters on Tuesday that crypto mining is still prohibited. The official was responding to confusion among some Chinese internet users, who had speculated the introduction of higher costs meant mining was allowed, China Times reported.  Chinese central government bodies issued their starkest and most comprehensive ban on crypto mining and trading in September. Crypto mining was included in a list of industries to be eliminated in October. But provincial authorities and agencies are still trying to implement the ban.  The electricity premium is a supporting punishment to the ban, the Zhejiang official said yesterday, according to China Times.  Also yesterday, authorities in Beijing's neighboring province of Shandong, called on citizens to report on suspected mining activity through hotlines.  In October, authorities in Zhejiang busted a graphics processing unit (GPU) mining operation at a government facility after screening 4,699 internet protocol addresses.

42416640,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWWNx,1645619796,Morgan Stanley Says Bitcoin Cannot Escape Energy Requirements,"Mining for cryptocurrencies can be highly energy intensive, with bitcoin mining alone requiring the same amount of electricity as the Netherlands' annual total power generation, or 0.5% of total global electricity consumption, Morgan Stanley said in a report entitled “ESG Considerations.”  Environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are standards for a company’s operations that some investors use to screen potential investments.  The bank notes that publicly listed bitcoin mining companies have begun to promote sustainability goals, and many buy carbon credits to offset their impact or aim to use cleaner forms of energy.  Bitcoin and ether approve transactions in a highly energy intensive way known as proof-of-work (PoW). Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a more energy-efficient alternative to PoW, which could reduce the climate impact, the bank said.  Ethereum hopes to move to PoS by late 2022, and while it requires much less energy than PoW, it brings its own challenges with risks of centralization, analysts led by Sheena Shah wrote on Tuesday.  Morgan Stanley also sees a continued risk of governments restricting energy use for crypto mining, noting that as energy costs have risen, countries such as China and Kosova have banned mining, while others have restricted the activity.  With respect to social considerations, cryptocurrencies are often viewed as a “means of supporting financial inclusion due to relatively low costs, low barriers to entry relative to the traditional banking system and relatively fast transaction times for cross border payments,” the bank said.  But there is still the need for internet access, inherent volatility in fees and the cryptocurrencies themselves, and crypto doesn’t solve the key issue of unbanked individuals having insufficient money, it added.  Governance of crypto applications will be an important topic, the report said, as it is becoming apparent these apps are not as decentralized as first promised.  New regulations will likely change the rules of investing in crypto-related products, but are unlikely to change the “core of how the underlying crypto is run,” the bank noted. It also noted the emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) as a new type of governance approach.

42416663,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWXGW,1645615601,Terra's LUNA Jumps 15% as UST Stablecoin Gets $1B Bitcoin Reserve,"Buoyed by positive news flow, LUNA, the native token of the smart contract blockchain Terra, has become the best-performing major cryptocurrency in the last 24 hours.  The cryptocurrency has risen nearly 15%, topping the $55 mark, outshining crypto market leader bitcoin's near 4% rise by a significant margin, CoinDesk data show. Other notable gainers on the list of coins with at least $1 billion market value are blockchain-like public network Hedera's HBAR token, up 14.5%, and Avalanche's AVAX cryptocurrency, up 12%.  LUNA's leadership perhaps stems from Singapore-based non-profit organization Luna Foundation Guard's (LFG) decision to create a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for UST – Terra's decentralized stablecoin, whose value is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.  LFG announcedon Tuesday that it had raised $1 billion through private token sales to build the bitcoin reserve and the buyers will lock up the coins for a four-year vesting period. The funding round was led by the likes of Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital.  ""Raising a BTC reserve is a smart move and may result in lesser fluctuations of UST during future bouts of market volatility,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. ""Ideally, LFG would take steps to keep the reserve 100% on-chain for transparency rather than through centralized means, however, the price action of Luna since the announcement has been largely promising in restoring confidence to the Terra ecosystem.""  Pseudonymous decentralized finance researcher Westie tweeted that the deal is extremely important for Terra's stability, LUNA's value capture.  Increased stability might bring more robust demand for UST, resulting in reduced LUNA supply. LUNA's fortunes are closely tied to UST as the stablecoin's creation is facilitated by burning LUNA. In other words, to mint 1 UST, $1 worth of LUNA must be taken out of circulation.  According to the data tracking website CoinGecko, UST's market capitalization has surged from roughly $300 million to over $12 billion in one year, establishing the dollar-pegged digital asset as the fourth-biggest stablecoin worldwide. Meanwhile, LUNA has chalked up a near sixfold rally in the past 12 months.  Why BTC reserve?  Unlike tether and other centralized stablecoins, UST isn't backed by dollars and its peg is maintained by allowing users to alter UST and LUNA supplies.  Here is how it works: Terra's swap function allows users to always swap $1 worth of Luna for 1 UST, and vice versa, according to the official blog. So when UST trades at $0.98, users can buy one UST for $0.98 and then swap the same for $1 of LUNA through Terra's swap function and sell LUNA in the market. The protocol burns one UST and mints LUNA, driving UST's supply lower and putting upward pressure on UST's price.  On the other hand, if UST trades at $1.02, LUNA holders can swap $1 worth of LUNA for 1 UST through the swap function and sell the UST in the market at $1.02, pocketing the difference. In the process, the protocol burns LUNA and mints UST, increasing the stablecoin's supply and putting downward pressure on the peg.  The mechanism is rewarding during bull runs but can be detrimental during a market crash when there is less incentive to mint either of the two coins to keep the peg intact, as explained in a Twitter thread by Westie.  The bitcoin reserve is expected to mitigate that risk to some extent, given the top cryptocurrency is less correlated to Terra's ecosystem and arbitrageurs can swap UST to bitcoin to support UST's peg. In a press release, the Luna Foundation Guard said that moving forward, it may introduce other major non-correlated assets within the market to the reserve.  ""The fund will serve as a ""release valve"" for UST redemptions during selloffs [periods of significant UST demand contraction],"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the TagusCapital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  ""The UST Forex Reserve further strengthens confidence in the peg of the market's leading decentralized stablecoin UST,"" Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, said in a press release. ""It can be used to help protect the peg of the UST stablecoin in stressful conditions. This is similar to how many central banks hold reserves of foreign currencies to back monetary liabilities and protect against dynamic market conditions.""  Looking ahead, the investor optimism from LFG's reserve announcement, coupled with signs of risk reset in the broader market and the impending launch of Mars Protocol's lockdrop, could keep LUNA better bid.  ""Lockdrop allows users to lock UST into Mars' Red Bank in exchange for a distribution of $MARS tokens that are claimable once the protocol launches,"" analytics firm Delphi Digital said in a daily market update. The protocol goes live today, and users will have until Friday to participate in the lockdrop.  ""Mars (an advanced money market protocol) is (finally) launching, with $18.5 million of UST locked up for Phase 1 of the token distribution,"" Tagus's Solot said.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/23/terras-luna-jumps-15-as-ust-stablecoin-gets-1b-bitcoin-reserve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70f74bd5d22dc3d93a5dd0d7c785d853e02d0f85-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of Wednesday, the focus is more on achieving a huge milestone than on making future percentage increases. SHIB remains active, with a current price of $0.00002498, a 24-hour low of $0.00002357, and a 24-hour high of $0.00002534. At least two of the following events must occur for SHIB to achieve and break past the $1 threshold. Burning Shiba Inu A large currency burn must occur. Crypto coins are taken out of circulation by the process of burning. Furthermore, a lesser supply supports a higher price. The simple fact is that there are just too many SHIB tokens in circulation today to make it past the $1 barrier. The current circulation supply is 549 trillion tokens. The coin&apos;s market value would be more than $549 trillion if each token were worth a dollar. That is more than the whole cryptocurrency market. And it&apos;s larger than tech giants Apple and Amazon. These two companies are each worth $2.7 trillion and $1.5 trillion. SHIB coin burns is taking place. Bigger Entertainment has hosted Burns. On Valentine&apos;s Day, nearly 370 million Shiba Inu tokens were burned. But it&apos;s not enough to decrease the vast supply since a significant decline in token supply is required to achieve $1.

High risks of liquidity breaking down $0.055, lack of interest from large investors, and minimal volatility. It sounds pretty depressing. These facts increase the likelihood of the RVN price fall to $0.027. But is there really any positive hope for a new wave of RVN growth? To do this, we need to carefully analyze the last fall wave from August 2021. https://www.tradingview.com/x/rUTxy6Er/ On the chart, we see that after two weeks of active growth of the RVN price sellers for six months lowered the price to the bottom line of consolidation. This cryptocurrency is characterized by sharp price rises. In addition, we see that updating local lows during the fall wave from November is starting to be a problem for sellers. Aggression to break the $0.055 mark is not enough. Therefore, by closing the weekly candle above the $0.055 mark, buyers will have every chance to close the month of February with a hint of a reversal of the RVN market. Until we see an increase in the interest of market participants and an increase in trading volumes, we will expect the RVN price to continue to move within the consolidation range of $0.055-$0.14. Therefore, in the case of closing the weekly candle above $0.055, the first target for growth will be the middle consolidation line - $0.088, and the final target - $0.14.

LUNA’s 16% jump was buoyed as Singapore-based Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit organization supporting the growth of the Terra ecosystem, said it raised $1 billion through the sale of LUNA to several influential crypto funds and investors.  The funding round, among the largest raises to date in crypto circles, will go toward building a bitcoin-denominated foreign exchange reserve for UST, an algorithmic-based stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem.  LUNA hit resistance at the $58 level following Tuesday’s rise. Prices could move to the $60 level if they hold above $58, but rejection could mean a move back to the $48 level from last week.  ADA recovered the $0.90 level on Wednesday morning after a sell-off to the $0.81 level over the weekend. No immediate resistance exists at current levels, suggesting prices could move to the $1 level if current buying activity continues. ADA broke below the $1 support last week, a level it held during the final weeks of January.  Cryptos up as global markets rebound  The recovery came after a sell-off in risk assets over the past week due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Bitcoin fell 12% to nearly $36,600, a level previously seen in mid-2021. Prices of ADA dropped 16%, with ether, Avalanche's AVAX and Polkadot's DOT falling 14%.  Crypto market capitalization dropped from $2 trillion to as low as $1.7 trillion in the past week as global markets reacted to the macroeconomic effects of Russia-Ukraine tensions, inflation and hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve policies. The S&P 500 fell for two days since the start of this week, and is now down more than 10% from lifetime highs at the start of 2022.  On Tuesday night, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia. President Joe Biden said the country has “cut off Russia's government from Western financing” and threatened tougher steps if Russia ""continues its aggression.""  Asian and European market futures rose on Wednesday after the sanction announcement. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3% while Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.8%. Futures on U.S. technology firms tracker Nasdaq 100 rose 1.1%.  A marginal recovery in stocks converted to big moves in crypto in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin rose 4.6%, ether rose 6.8%, while Solana’s SOL and XRP increased 7% each. Total market capitalization rose by 5.8% to $1.85 trillion.  Market watchers remain cautious  Despite Wednesday’s jump, some crypto market professionals said current macroeconomic sentiment was not conducive to sustaining upward movements.  ""The current environment mixing uncertainty around inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical risks, is likely to continue to impact crypto markets,” said Jordi Muñoz, CEO of PotionLabs, in an email to CoinDesk.  ""We expect the turbulence in markets to continue while the geopolitical, interest rates and inflation risks fully play out. This may continue to impact crypto markets, but we remain bullish over the long-term value of crypto markets,” Muñoz added.  Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, echoed the sentiment. “So far, the rebound of risky assets, which includes cryptocurrencies, can be considered as a movement within a downtrend,” he said in an email to CoinDesk.  “Bitcoin has been trying to correct from levels close to the lows of February, but this is probably not the bottom yet. Expectations of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and rising geopolitical tensions are putting pressure on all risky assets,” Kuptsikevich added.",NEUTRAL,ADA | LUNA,ADA | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/23/cardanos-ada-jumps-amid-recovery-in-major-cryptos-traders-still-remain-cautious,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/624c008d3886735a03a25518979a02dc9759c3a7-1813x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The REEF price has broken an important price range of $0.0147 and is confidently moving within the fall channel. In the weekly timeframe, we see that the candle of 7 February tested the $0.0147 bottom range. This fact confirms the dominance of sellers in the REEF market, even at local lows.

The only positive outcome of the REEF market without updating the lows is the organization of global consolidation in the range of $0.009-$0.0147.

The Aventus partnership with Scytale Ventures includes a sizable grant of DOT, the native token of the Polkadot network. The value of DOT contributed by the VC was not disclosed; Scytale’s Horizon Fund II took a significant position in the native token of Aventus (AVT) as a vote of confidence in the project. Aventus has been around since 2017.  The auction process to win Polkadot parachain slots saw its first cohort of projects gather billions of dollars worth of DOT late last year, much of it from community-based crowdloans that staked tokens behind a slew of startups.  As well as exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) and more, Ethereum bridges and connectivity solutions already exist within the Polkadot system; one of the first and most high-value parachain auctions was won by Moonbeam, for instance, which brings Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to Polkadot.  There’s an important distinction between the two projects, said Aventus CEO Alan Vey, since Moonbeam is more focused on general-purpose computing, while Aventus is “a bit more of a walled garden, a more performant environment, but less general-purpose.” It may be one of Polkadot’s first takes on “enterprise blockchain.”  Moonbeam allows users to write smart contracts and deploy the same kind of code that runs on Ethereum. “With Aventus, you can’t do that, you need to build what are called ‘pallets,’ which are essentially code that the whole network has to approve before it’s deployed,” said Vey. “So it’s two different technical ways of coming at the same solution.”  Read more: Polkadot Parachains Go Live, Capping Yearslong Tech Build for Ambitious Blockchain Project  Now that the auction process has been up and running for some time, the amount of DOT required to snag a parachain slot is in the millions of dollars. In terms of timing for an auction, Vey said it depends partly on the existing Aventus network (which was built using Substrate, Polkadot’s open source framework) being migrated over to the parachain, as opposed to simply launching there, like most of the other projects.  As such, a possible auction would probably happen around the end of Q2 or in early Q3, he said.  “We launched in production with that tech last February and started building and did a bunch of interesting client deals,” said Vey. “Transactions have been growing and delivering for our stakers, and most recently we listed on Coinbase. So there’s been a lot of momentum.”",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/23/aventus-taps-scytale-ventures-to-boost-polkadot-parachain-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/512afeba8fb8a34f4a18ae4e3b72e5a769a432e8-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The amount is worth $235,000 at the time of writing. PeckShield first reported the exploit in a tweet.  Blockchain data shows the token was created during early Asian hours and was listed on BSC-based PancakeSwap shortly afterward. W3M saw over 1,800 transactions in the following hours and over 1,000 holders at the time of writing.  However, the anonymous developers pulled W3M’s trading liquidity some five hours after its issuance – causing the infamous rugpull, a crypto market lingo used to refer to such acts.  Prices of W3M dumped from highs of $0.000000204 to under $0.00000000277 after the rugpull, a near 100% decrease.  Tokens like Web3Memes can be issued by anyone on BSC or other networks. Issuers can then pair such tokens with another popular token, such as tether (USDT) or BNB, and list the pair on a decentralized exchange by providing initial liquidity. The process is wholly automatic and relies on smart contracts instead of third parties or centralized entities.  In 2021, over $2.8 billion in investors' funds were lost to rugpulls, as reported.

The LUNA coin price shows a symmetrical triangle pattern breakout with a 15% jump in the last 72 hours. The price sustains above the 200-day EMA and remains significantly neutral in the bearish market. Will this triangle breakout help the altcoin regain the uptrend momentum? Key technical points: LUNA coin price sustains above the $50 mark. The MACD and signal lines avoid yet another potential bearish crossover. The 24-hour trading volume in the Terra token is $2.82 Billion, indicating a 1.24% fall. Past Performance of LUNA LUNA coin price shows a 15% price jump after a fakeout of the 200-day EMA resulting in the symmetrical triangle breakout.

Source-Tradingview LUNA Technical Analysis The short-coming uptrend in the LUNA coin price lacks the volume support as the 1.24% rise remains negligible to show a bullish commitment.

Creating Bitcoin Reserve for UST Stablecoin According to an official announcement, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) has raised $1 billion through an over-the-counter sale of LUNA, the native token behind Terra blockchain. Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital led the token sale, with participation from DeFiance Capital, GSR, Republic Capital, Tribe Capital among others. The funding will go toward building a bitcoin-denominated foreign-exchange reserve for UST, Terra&apos;s biggest stablecoin. Pegged to the US dollar, UST currently boasts a market capitalization of over $12 billion, a number that has more than tripled since November last year. Largest Funding Round in Crypto&apos;s History The latest fundraise is one of the largest to date in crypto, just next to NYDIG&apos;s $1 billion funding round in December last year which raised its valuation above $7 billion. The $1 billion from the sale will initially capitalize on its UST Forex Reserve, with investors locking up the purchased LUNA over a 4-year vesting period. Additional details on the reserve&apos;s function will be released in the coming weeks, the foundation said.The post LFG Raises $1B to Form Terra&apos;s UST Reserve Denominated in Bitcoin appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BTC | FIAT | ICO | LUNA | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/lfg-raises-1b-to-form-terras-ust-reserve-denominated-in-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Earlier advertisements must not appear in the public domain unless they comply with the new guidelines after April 15, 2022.  The ASCI said it held extensive consultations ""with different stakeholders including government and the virtual digital asset industry"" to frame the guidelines.  The primary guideline requires all ads for VDA (virtual digital asset) products and VDA exchanges or featuring VDAs to carry the following disclaimer: “Crypto products and [non-fungible tokens] are unregulated and can be highly risky. There may be no regulatory recourse for any loss from such transactions.”  According to the guidelines, the words “currency,” “securities,” “custodian” and “depositories” may not be used in advertisements of VDA products or services because consumers associate these terms with regulated products.  The guidelines also mandate the cost or profitability of VDA products shall contain clear, accurate, sufficient and updated information. For example, “zero cost” will need to include all costs that the consumer might reasonably associate with the offer or transaction.  The guidelines include a requirement that ""returns for periods of less than 12 months shall not be included"" in advertisements in order to make sure that ""information on past performance shall not be provided in any partial or biased manner.""  India's advertising watchdog stated that several of the current crypto-related advertisements ""do not adequately disclose the risks associated with such products.""

A new report from Delphi Digital demonstrates that some of the latest news and developments in the Terra ecosystem are leading to substantial growth in UST adoption - including the new Mars Protocol and Terra&apos;s new &apos;LFG&apos; formation. UST And The Latest Catalysts A quick briefing: UST is Terra Luna&apos;s native stablecoin, a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin that has been emerging throughout the past year. With the minting of new UST, a dollar equivalent of LUNA is burned. Recent weeks have brought substantial growth to UST supply, spurred by a number of new tools available in the Terra ecosystem, and accordingly LUNA burning has increased substantially as well. Delphi cites two major drivers: the creation of the Luna Foundation Guard (or LFG) and a new lockdrop from emerging Terra tool Mars Protocol. The lockdrop will, of course, lead to more locked UST, and the formation of the Luna Foundation Guard resulted in a $450M Luna burn mechanic. UST growth continues and Luna burning has increased this month. | Chart provided by Delphi Digital. According to routine bot tool @USTmarketcap, the current market cap of UST has surpassed $12B this month and is rapidly approaching $13B.
