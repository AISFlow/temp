Blockchain platform NEAR Protocol has partnered with the Universal Hip Hop Museum (UHHM) and Ed Young, co-founder of The Source magazine, to release a collection of non-fungible tokens featuring hip-hop artists from the 1970s to now.      The NFT.HipHop collection will feature NFTs of 47 legends – from Eazy-E to Lil Wayne – to honor the 47th year of the hip-hop era. The pop-up marketplace goes live on June 19, commemorating Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the end of slavery.      As NFTs grow in prominence over 2021, Young sees the collaboration with NEAR as a way to reconnect with hip-hop and rap’s peer-to-peer origins.      “Since its beginnings, hip-hop grew from the grassroots,” Young said in a statement to CoinDesk. “From hand-recording tapes one by one to sell to friends, to the block parties powered by electricity from street lamps, it was a collective creation of a culture and economy developed through the artist and fan working together.”      Young finds NFTs promising as a means of restoring financial agency to emerging artists, eliminating the middlemen between musicians and their fans.      While the current marketplace for music-themed NFTs has largely served big-name artists with established followings, Young is confident that in the long term, independent artists will be the ones who benefit most from the technology.

Altcoins such as BAT and VET did trim some of their losses over the last 24 hours, but bears were still dominant in each of their respective markets. While TRX also noted selling pressure, the RSI's bullish divergence induced some optimism with respect to its short-term trajectory. Tron [TRX] Source: TRX/USD , TradingView An ADX reading of 15 suggested a weak trend in Tron's market as the cryptocurrency maintained its channel of $0.074 and $0.066. Huge price swings were unlikely considering low volatility and TRX would likely oscillate between the aforementioned region over the coming sessions. While the RSI traded in neutral territory at press time, its uptrend was an interesting development. Not only did the index show a bullish divergence with respect to the price, but also pointed to stronger price action in the near future. A hike above the $0.074-resistance would see the cryptocurrency head towards its next ceiling at $0.0841. Basic Attention Token [BAT] Source: BAT/USD , TradingView At the time of writing, Basic Attention Token seemed to defend the $0.591-support as focus shifted to the upper trendline of its down-channel. The RSI highlighted oversold conditions in the market, but recovered over the last few sessions. The MACD closed in on a bullish crossover as well. However, these cues were not enough to warrant a breakout from the pattern especially since the 24-hour trading volumes were on the weaker side. Moving forward, expect BAT to oscillate between its channel once it reaches a strong support level. In case of an early breakout, the target can be set just above the $0.715-resistance and near the 200-SMA (green). VeChain [VET] Source: VET/USD , TradingView VeChain's movement was also within the confines of a descending channel but a breakout did not seem likely in the near future. The constricted nature of VET's EMA Ribbons suggested sideways movement and an active bearish trend. Moreover, the RSI pointed south and it could trade in the oversold region once again over the coming days. VET's defensive lines rested at $0.091 and further down the charts at $0.066. Both these areas had the potential to trigger a breakout, but broader market movement would likely dictate the direction of huge price swings.
