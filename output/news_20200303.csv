42431569,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xHh,1583271614,Steem Community Mobilizes Popular Vote in Battle With Justin Sun,"The Steem community is striking back after an attempted end-around by Tron founderJustin Sun.      While CoinDesk has been writing this report, four former Steem blockchain validators (known as ""witnesses”) have been voted back onto the council of 20 nodes that keeps Steem running.      Steem validators tell CoinDesk that by hitting four validators it is no longer possible for the Tron Foundation to launch a contentious hard fork to change the economic rules governing STEEM tokens.      On Monday, Sun was able to put a new slate of witnesses in charge after a contentious soft fork limited his voting power.      Sun acquired the popular Steemit app and its large share of STEEM tokens on Feb. 14. Referring to the tokens that were effectively frozen in a community-led soft fork following the Steemit acquisition, he wrote on Twitter Tuesday:    ""#STEEM has successfully defeated the hackers & all funds are super #SAFU.""    There's no better way to put this: One man’s ""hack"" is another’s ""legitimate exercise of power by a blockchain's duly elected leaders.""      Sun's tweet got ratio’d pretty hard, with 486 replies to 236 retweets, as of this writing.      Here is what we know. (It's important to note that unlike some blockchains, Steem uses a delegated proof-of-stake [DPoS] consensus mechanism, meaning a limited number of nodes validate transactions on the chain.)      To recap: Early Monday morning the Steem blockchain was taken over by a group of recently created accounts with names like ""goodguy24,"" ""nicetry001"" and ""bostonawesome."" These witnesses emerged after the previous set of 20 leaders presided over the aforementioned freezing of Sun’s newly acquired “Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake” of STEEM tokens.      At issue: Whether that pool of tokens – large enough to sway the governance of the entire Steem blockchain – could be used at Sun’s discretion.      Steem has always had angst over Steemit’s cache of STEEM, but former witnesses tell CoinDesk that Steemit had always committed not to vote those coins. The soft fork was executed because witnesses feared that would no longer be the case with Sun.      The exact volume of Steemit's ninja-mined stake has always been unclear; however, Sun referred to it as 65 million STEEM in one of his Tuesday tweets.      In a thread of 10 tweets, Sun defended his company's actions.  He described the soft fork by writing: ""Such actions are against every aspect of the core value of humanity & decentralization & sanctity of private property.""      He described the influx of a new slate of witnesses by writing: ""Misleading comments re us collaborating w/ exchanges on a hostile takeover is false. Our intention was never to take over the network & all parties' votes will be withdrawn.""      Just before CoinDesk's report on Monday came out, Binance CEO “CZ” Changpeng Zhao indicated his company was likely to unstake its Steem from the deciding vote.      Overnight, Huobi issued a statement, also committing to canceling the vote. ""Based on the information provided to us and out of an abundance of caution, we decided that helping Steemit and Tron was in the best interest of our users – and the network at large,"" Huobi wrote. “However, this action is not final.”      Meanwhile, on a Discord server managed by one of the newly re-annointed Steem witnesses, token holders have been organizing. A member of the community who goes by @Aggroed and runs the server told CoinDesk via email:      ""That's a community gathering place where we host town hall discussions that anyone in the Steem community is welcome to attend. We hosted seven hours of open forum yesterday. We're currently in hour 3 today.""      He said longtime witnesses have been stumping in various private and public forums. It’s activating a new level of voter participation on the chain.      Steemit and Tron have yet to reply to requests for comment from CoinDesk.      Steemit resignations    Steemit has become a small company – and it's rapidly getting smaller.      In the last 24 hours, four employees have quit: Andrew Levine, head of communications; Steve Gerbino, a developer; Tim @roadscape, a developer who works pseudonymously; and developer Michael Vandeberg.      Similarly, when the Tron Foundation acquired BitTorrent, that company also saw a rash of employee exits and a subsequent lawsuit.      Steemit initiated a restructuring in November 2018, after announcing on YouTube it would lay off 70 percent of its employees. Last year Steemit published an update on the restructuring, listing six staff members who represented its leadership. The list included Levine and Vandeberg.      It's not clear how many people worked at Steemit at the time of Sun’s acquisition, but one source with knowledge of the community indicated it only had seven employees.      Watch the votes    As the backing for Tron's witnesses recedes, the backing for the old witnesses is growing.      The first two witnesses who returned to top slots today were part of the group that enacted the soft fork. As of this writing, @Yabapmat has over 10,000 voters (or, more accurately, wallets) supporting his role and @roelandp has more than 12,000 voters. Meanwhile, the top witness from the group voted in by Tron, Binance and Huobi is only backed by 51 voters.      Additionally, the gap in votes between the new witnesses supported by the Tron Foundation and those supported by the community has shrunk dramatically. The Tron-backed witnesses are losing votes (likely from exchanges unstaking STEEM as they announced they would) and the old slate of witnesses is gaining. It's gone from a big difference to a tiny one.      The broader crypto community has generally been supportive of the Steem community. For example, 1confirmation's Nick Tomaino tweeted, ""The Steem situation also shows you can’t buy a community, you have to earn it.""      Still, some remain skeptical of its underlying structure. Dovey Wan of Primitive Ventures tweeted, ""The hostile take over of $STEEM only tells you how hypocritical SUN is and why DPOS as a consensus layer is non-resilient.""      But STEEM holders haven't given up on their blockchain. Matt Rosen, a co-founder of the Steem-based game Splinterlands, runs a witness (with @Aggroed) that served for a long time in the top 20. That witness was the first to break through to the top 20 again following yesterday's events. He told CoinDesk in an email:    ""The Steem community has rallied against the takeover in an unbelievable and unprecedented manner with well over 20M STEEM worth of votes being added to the community-chosen witnesses in order to try to overtake the Tron/Exchange voted accounts.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | BNB | FORKS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/03/steem-community-mobilizes-popular-vote-in-battle-with-justin-sun,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09c408fdbb2a48ffb04604090baee0c2e9e77cca-1280x760.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431584,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xhh,1583265889,Lesser-Known Exchange Inflates Paxos Standard Daily Trading Volume to Record Highs,"While it seems Paxos Standard (PAX) experienced a sudden surge in trading volumes, the stablecoin’s own issuer questions that very data.      Data appear to show Paxos Trust Company, the New York-based regulated blockchain company, saw daily trading volume on its stablecoin rise to a record high of $1.3 billion on Tuesday – representing a staggering 282 percent rise from the trading volume of $339 million observed on March 1, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      However, the spike in trading volume may not be what it seems, as over $850 million is coming from a lesser-known centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in the British Virgin Islands called TOKOK, according to data source CoinMarketCap.      Often, random exchanges inflate the volume figures, making the record tally look unreliable. CoinDesk reached out to TOKOK for comment but the exchange did not respond by press time.      If the volume data from TOKOK are excluded, the tally would be about $400 million, the average daily volume witnessed in the last six months.      A Paxos spokesperson told CoinDesk faulty data on aggregator sites may be the culprit, adding the combined daily trading volume of three stablecoins powered by Paxos - PAX, Huobi stablecoin (HUSD) and Binance stablecoin (BUSD) - is $60 million, according to Messari’s real 24-hour volume.      The key takeaway here is the headline trading volume figure can be misleading, and investors should always check whether volume is coming through from reliable exchanges before drawing conclusions.    Transaction count surges    PAX recently registered an all-time high daily transaction count of 6,800 and processed about 6,500 transactions on March 2, according to Coin Metrics Pro.       The daily transaction count is currently up nearly 600 percent from lows below 1,000 seen in December.      Meanwhile, the stablecoin’s supply has dropped below $200 million for the first time since September, having topped out near $260 million in January.      Paxos Trust Company launched stablecoin PAX in September 2018 and is responsible for backing every issued token with U.S. dollars held in segregated accounts at FDIC-insured U.S. banks. With market capitalization of $190 million, PAX is currently the fourth-largest stablecoin, according to data source CoinMarketCap.      Generally speaking, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. That is achieved by pegging the value of the coin to other asset classes, usually U.S. dollars.      Paxos launched a Fiat Gateway service in November last year to allow customers to more easily fund their accounts with traditional money. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, was the first to integrate Paxos’ new dollar gateway.

Today is Super Tuesday - one of the biggest days of the U.S. election primary season. Increasingly, prediction markets and pollsters suggest it’s coming down to a two-person race between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders (although Mike Bloomberg has insisted he’s staying in).      In this episode, NLW breaks down each candidate in the context of their positions vis a vis cryptocurrency, and looks at the possible role of three other fallen contenders during the rest of the campaign.      As Bernie leads the Twitter poll, the question arises: Do people think Bernie will be good for bitcoin because he shares the same values of prioritizing the little guy over big banks, or because his programs will demand so much quantitative easing (QE) it will send bitcoin to the moon?

42431573,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xNh,1583262619,New Wallet From Stablecoin Issuer STASIS Syncs With Financial Institutions,"Institutions can hedge against possible bank runs with a new wallet from euro-backed stablecoin issuer STASIS, which stores assets with financial intermediaries that have low-risk balance sheets.      STASIS said Tuesday its new wallet, fully integrated into the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), would offer regulated financial institutions, in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets, a new gateway into cryptocurrencies.      ""We aim to bring licensed fintech service companies to the cryptocurrency market and enable them to experiment with using crypto for its operations without any regulatory or safety concern,"" STASIS founder and Chief Executive Gregory Klumov said in a statement.      The new wallet expands how the assets backing the stablecoin are stored. Rather than holding them with commercial banks, the underlying funds are held with financial intermediaries. Speaking to CoinDesk, Klumov said it was a ""very significant"" characteristic that effectively minimizes counter-party and balance-sheet risk.      Two intermediaries who partnered with STASIS are said to have accounts with European Union central banks. While one is in stealth mode, the other, crypto financial services provider Globitex, stores its assets directly with the central bank of Lithuania, Klumov said.      A non-custodial solution, the wallet will enable the firm's 30,000 users to buy and sell its EURS stablecoin directly from their bank accounts.      Most commercial banks make money by lending users' deposits as loans. Generally, only a small fraction of funds are ever held by the bank and available for withdrawal on demand.      Should confidence in the banking system fail, as it did in 2008, many big-name banks would not be able to meet all customer withdrawal requests. Institutions are only eligible for a maximum payout of €100,000 (~$117,000) for assets lost should a bank collapse.      The fear of financial collapse is particularly prevalent in Europe, where the euro crisis brought many southern states to the verge of bankruptcy. Many vividly recall customers of Greek and Cypriot banks receiving ""massive haircuts"" on their account balances, in return receiving equity and bonds that were ""basically worthless,"" said Klumov.      Financial intermediaries, like the ones partnered with STASIS, hold user assets in segregated accounts; they can be withdrawn in their entirety at any time. ""In the case of a run on such an institution, every customer will get their money back,"" Klumov said.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/03/new-wallet-from-stablecoin-issuer-stasis-syncs-with-financial-institutions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3db9b89d625ad3bdb8229feff208b3e9c2c38930-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431566,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xBh,1583253208,Bitcoin Drops 2% Following Fed's First Emergency Rate Cut Since 2008,"Bitcoin prices slid Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced an emergency cut in interest rates to counteract risks to the economy from the spreading coronavirus.      The largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 2.2 percent to $8,722 as of 15:28 UTC (10:28 a.m. ET). Prices had surged 4.6 percent on Monday, rising alongside U.S. stocks as traders in traditional financial markets bet the Fed would soon cut rates to address the economic impact of the contagion. Efforts to contain the outbreak have disrupted travel and business activity while threatening consumer confidence.      The Federal Reserve, led by Chair Jerome Powell, cut its benchmark short-term interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. The U.S. central bank's monetary-policy committee hadn’t been scheduled to make its next decision on interest rates until March 18. This marks the first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis in 2008.      “The coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,” the Fed said in a statement on its website. “The committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.”      Nonetheless, an hour after the Fed's rate cut, the S&P 500 index was down 1 percent.      Despite a belief among some investors that bitcoin (BTC) should trade as a safe-haven asset akin to gold or U.S. Treasury bonds, the cryptocurrency’s price had tumbled recently along with riskier assets like stocks as traders scrambled into cash.      Economists with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday in an assessment that the coronavirus contagion likely will shave 0.5 percentage point off of projected 2020 global growth, from an “already weak” 2.9 percent.      Global authorities, including the Fed as well as the Bank of Japan, International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said they would act as needed to help offset any lasting economic damage from widespread travel cancellations, quarantines and factory disruptions.      Trading in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s market for futures contracts on the Fed’s benchmark interest rate had moved over the past week to reflect a 100 percent chance of a 0.5 percentage point cut by the central bank’s March 18 meeting.      The Fed started raising interest rates in 2015 as the economy recovered from the 2008 financial crisis. But the central bank abruptly reversed course last year and started cutting rates as the stimulus faded from President Donald Trump's late-2017 tax cuts.      The crypto-focused investment firm Arca, based in Los Angeles, wrote Monday in an emailed analysis that ""surprise"" central bank actions have now become ""expected"" by traders whenever markets are rattled.      They are ""no longer surprises,"" Arca said. ""In fact, they are outright demanded.

42431577,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xRh,1583251360,NBA Player Spencer Dinwiddie Taps Broker-Dealer in Push to Tokenize Sports Contracts,"An initiative by National Basketball Association (NBA) player Spencer Dinwiddie to tokenize the value of professional athletes' contracts has engaged a specialist investment bank to manage an upcoming offering.      DREAM Fan Shares (DFS) announced Tuesday it has brought in New York-based Tritaurian Capital, a FINRA-registered investment bank and broker-dealer providing specialized private placement expertise, to help facilitate the company's inaugural offering in securities linked to athletes' earnings.      ""We are happy to announce the engagement of Tritaurian Capital for the upcoming SD26 offering,"" DFS said in an email made public by journalist Roy Katsiri on Twitter earlier today. ""We believe they are the best suited team to help bring this emerging asset class to market.""      DFS and Tritaurian Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      DFS will offer ethereum-based tokens linked to shares in the contracts, beginning presumably with Dinwiddie's. The NBA player has previously said he wants to tokenize his three-year contract, worth a total of $34.5 million, and sell to investors for a lump sum.      ""DFS leverages guaranteed contracts and the potential for performance-based bonuses and other contingent bonuses to structure debt securities represented by PAInTs [Professional Athlete Investment Tokens], giving accredited investors the opportunity to invest in securities tied to the financial success of athletes, artists and influencers,"" reads DFS' website.      It's unclear whether the contracts of other sports players will be included in the initial token offering, which will only be available to accredited investors at a minimum $150,000 buy-in. DFS says plans to tokenize securities based on the contracts of artists and social media influencers are also in the pipeline.      A player for the Brooklyn Nets, Dinwiddie first outlined his intentions to tokenize his own contract back in September, even partnering with custodian Paxos Trust Company. Days later, the NBA said this was in violation of the league's collective bargaining agreement, which outlines how athletes are employed by their respective clubs.      In January, Dinwiddie reached a compromise with the NBA where instead of paying out dividends, as originally intended, he would issue a flat bond, which would offer no accrued interest. At the time, the NBA said it was reviewing the modified agreement and refused to say whether it had fully signed off on the sale.      Established in 2001, Tritaurian provides expertise in both traditional finance as well as with blockchain technology.

42431578,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xVh,1583247851,Stellar-Based IoT App Nodle Joins Tokenized Connectivity Race,"An app that allows users to earn a Stellar-based token by providing last-mile access for internet-of-things (IoT) devices is now live on Apple’s App Store.      “The Nodle Cash app for iOS has been in development for the last six months,” Nodle CEO Micha Benoliel told CoinDesk. “We believe Nodle is truly for everyone.” The app is already live on Android.      The company claims to process one million micropayments daily on average, giving a very high transaction volume for its NODLE token. While the app delivers on one of the promises of the decentralized web, the prospect of users getting paid for providing data or services, the token itself isn’t listed on any exchanges yet. Users can trade NODLE peer-to-peer but recouping any value for them isn't yet feasible.      ""We believe the value of the coin will be directly supported by the demand for the network and its services. The only way to get Nodle Cash today is to generate it on your phone,"" Benoliel said. By adding iOS, the company believes it can vastly increase its user base.      Nodle enters much the same space as Helium, an IoT network built around dedicated hardware devices that are fairly expensive for an average user.      Nodle has the advantage of running on equipment that users already have, but it’s limited by the range of those devices. One Helium node can cover a wide area using its longfi technology, which also has the advantage of passing easily through many materials. While Helium may have more friction, a few nodes can cover most American cities, according to the company.      That said, in a future where there are vastly more connected devices than people, there may be room in the market for many last-mile solutions for data.      It only takes one smartphone passing by every now and then to work for the use cases Nodle has in mind. ""When smartphones connect back to cellular or WiFi, the data from these sensors gets pushed to the cloud using the Nodle Cash app as a relay,"" Benoliel explained.      Ideal use cases for Nodle include smart-city solutions, where sensors collect needed data but real-time updates aren't essential. Benoliel said the city of Paris is using it to keep track of some specially designed park benches. Nodle uses the Bluetooth Low Energy standard.      It's also useful for cheaply keeping track of physical items, even things as small as handheld tools or other equipment. Two partners that run data over Nodle daily are Chipolo (which keeps track of very small items, like keys) and Pawscout, for pets, Benoliel said.      Nodle is an app that currently runs on the Stellar blockchain. It's also currently developing on a Polkadot substrate with plans for NODLE to be interoperable between the two chains.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/03/stellar-based-iot-app-nodle-joins-tokenized-connectivity-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59dbaa888f954687568e6968f5dceb7460159302-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431572,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xLh,1583244186,Algorand Blockchain Chosen as Underlying Tech for Marshall Islands' Digital Currency,"The Marshallese sovereign (SOV), which could become the first state-backed digital currency to enter circulation, will be built using the Algorand protocol.      SFB Technologies, the technology provider tasked with delivering the SOV initiative, announced Monday it had selected the Algorand protocol as the blockchain base for the upcoming digital currency of the Marshall Islands.      SFB co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Jim Wagner said in a statement Algorand had been selected following ""extensive market research among the leading protocol options."" Algorand was secure and scalable enough for the SOV to be properly issued and managed, he added.      ""One of the strengths of the Algorand protocol is the speed at which we operate, with transactions not just happening quickly but also with absolute finality,"" explained Algorand Chief Operating Officer Sean Ford to CoinDesk, adding the core chain was easy to use and could scale dynamically to handle fluctuating volumes.      ""We know that our tech has the ability to support this effort,"" he added.      The brainchild of Silvio Micali, MIT professor and Turing Award recipient, Algorand is designed as a scalable proof-of-stake network free of potential governance issues, like forks. Having raised more than $60 million in a public token sale last summer, the protocol is already being used by an Icelandic e-money startup to develop bring fiat currencies onto the blockchain.      Per its agreement to build the Marshallese SOV, Algorand will provide base technology for the creation, issuance and ongoing management of the digital currency. The company will also provide technical support once the currency has launched, ensuring it continuously suits the country's requirements.      The SOV won't be built on the public Algorand blockchain but a permissioned version, known as a ""co-chain,"" that will give the Marshallese government and central bank greater oversight of the network. The digital currency will be pegged to the U.S. dollar – the country's officialcurrency – and will algorithmically fix its inflation at 4 percent.      The Marshall Islands first stated its intention to launch a digital currency back at the beginning of 2018 to work alongside the U.S. dollar. In a guest post for CoinDesk, the Marshallese minister in-assistance to the president and environment said the nation is working with international regulatory bodies to ensure the SOV meets all compliance requirements.      Algorand has been working with the nation on its SOV initiative for several months. Slated to launch later in 2020, and with the Chinese and Cambodian governments also planning on issuing their own digital currencies, the race to be first is already underway.      ""It's all hands to the pump,"" said Ford. ""We're very actively partnering with [the Marshall Islands] as the first out of the gate.""      Ford added the SOV could be made compatible with the digital currencies of other sovereign countries, as part of a global ecosystem, sometime in the future. He said: ""We know central bank digital currency initiatives are only expanding, there are many different countries that are now collaborating and thinking about how they can leverage blockchain in this space.""      Ford wouldn't confirm if Algorand had either partnered, or was looking at partnering, with other countries to help them develop their own sovereign digital currencies.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/03/algorand-blockchain-chosen-as-underlying-tech-for-marshall-islands-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5787b80ca98180bb6e98850504b45b582de6de-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform, which provides trading in crypto, fiat currencies and assets like metals, is partnering with TaxBit to provide customers with a tax liability dashboard on its user portal, and intends to help customers file more accurate tax returns, streamlining what has to date been an opaque process for crypto investors.      Michelle O’Conner, Uphold’s vice-president of marketing and communication, told CoinDesk the move is part of an effort to make her company more accessible for customers by simplifying the tax-filing process.      “We’ll provide real-time liabilities, real-time information, what your liability will be when making a trade, how to reduce your liability,” O’Connor said.      While Uphold is working with TaxBit, O’Connor said her company would not be providing any tax advice itself. Rather, Uphold will defer any actual questions or advice to TaxBit, which has certified public accountants on retainer.      Essentially, Uphold and TaxBit intend to file 1099-B forms, which are typically used for investments and report cost-basis, rather than the 1099-K forms some exchanges previously filed for their customers.      “This tax form was kind of a spur-of-the-moment reaction to something, but there was never any clear IRS guidance that that was the correct form,” said TaxBit co-founder Austin Woodward.      The 1099-K reports income and is used by merchants. Because exchanges were filing crypto transactions as income, they effectively said their customers’ assets had greater value than in reality (or what the customers were reporting directly), resulting in some customers being audited and others receiving warning letters from the agency.    Filing property    Uphold’s CEO, J.P. Theriot, is one of the individuals who received an audit from the Internal Revenue Service due to inaccurate numbers being reported from his crypto holdings.      “Our CEO actually received a letter from the IRS basically saying ‘you owe an absurd amount of money’ from the 2016 tax season, and it was totally inaccurate,” O’Connor said. TaxBit helped resolve the situation.      TaxBit has been communicating with the IRS as part of an effort to reduce these audits, Woodward said. The company claims to have helped resolve “hundreds of 1099-K audits,” helping the agency accept the 1099-B as a more relevant form in the proces.      The B form lists all transactions, the numbers when buying or selling and the gain (or loss), Woodward said. The platform will file this form to the IRS, while the taxpayer will file the corresponding 8949 form.      “They’re intended for property transactions. The IRS defines property as a capital asset which encompasses equity, property [and crypto assets],” he said.      Woodward said he doesn’t yet know what the IRS might do for past years, given that there are likely scores more 1099-K forms that present individuals’ crypto holdings as much higher than they might be in reality. The agency is operating on a roughly two-year lag when it comes to audits, meaning individuals were audited in 2019 for their 2017 tax returns.      However, the agency is working to better understand how to treat crypto, he said.      “They’re investing heavily, they’re becoming more educated and informed,” Woodward said, referencing a CoinDesk investigation that found the agency spent $4.1 million on blockchain forensics provider Chainalysis, of which $3.6 million came in the last two years alone.      The IRS is even holding a summit on March 3, inviting stakeholders to participate in a number of panels addressing various questions about crypto and blockchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/03/uphold-teams-with-taxbit-to-more-accurately-report-users-crypto-trades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c25e68e30da27ad0bcca4384d7e77186deb805f-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431579,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xXh,1583240400,IBM’s Public Cloud Is Secure Enough for Crypto Custodians,"IBM’s public cloud is secure enough to attract crypto custodians.      Announced Tuesday, Singapore-based custody provider Onchain Custodian has released the latest version of its hardware-based vault, hosted entirely on Big Blue’s banking-grade public cloud.      Previously, IBM has offered cloud services to digital asset custodians on a hybrid basis, where certain servers guarding private encryption keys are held on-premise by the custodian, with other services run from data centers that are rented out and in remote locations. But this is the first time a custodian has felt comfortable outsourcing the entire key management and storage process to IBM’s public cloud.      “Onchain has been using a pure public cloud model from day one,” said Rohit Badlaney, executive director of IBM Z Cloud. “They seem to have got a lot of interest from clients, whether it's hedge funds or institutional investors. It will be interesting to see how this market moves.”      IBM itself has no access to private keys created and stored on its HyperProtect cloud. The system is built using hardware security modules (HSM), a kind of lockbox that safeguards and manages digital keys in a tamper-proof environment.      Alexandre Kech, chief executive and co-founder of Onchain Custodian, said guarding keys in your own custom-built vaults might intuitively appear to be the safest method, but this isn’t necessarily the case.      “If it’s on-premise that means you know where it is, if you happen to be badly intentioned,” said Kech. “Of course if you are a bank you can secure that pretty well, but if you are a startup, it’s creating more risks. Even if your data center is secure, it’s generally difficult to geographically disperse it.”      Sequoia-backed Onchain currently has about 30 customers with the main focus on Asia for now. These include the Neo and Ontology foundations, and on the exchange side, Wowoo, BiKi and kuCoin.      Onchain went live with a cold-storage-only v1 of its custody solution back in April 2019. Cold storage typically means crypto assets are stored on digital media that has never been, and never will be connected to the internet. Like burying your private keys in the back garden, it can take hours or even days to access your assets, and so not ideal for active trading.      Kech described the new version Onchain released this week as “warm” storage. This means the HSM can connect to the internet to sign transactions on the blockchain in semi-automated fashion, but it remains distinct from a hot wallet system since the HSM isn’t permanently connected to the internet, he said.      Onchain has managed to snag insurance from Lloyd’s of London for its HSM-based “warm” offering, a further positive sign from the London insurance market, following the recent announcement that Lloyd’s has officially begun backing hot-wallet insurance policies.      Kech said Onchain used Lockton as its broker and found two Lloyd’s underwriters supporting the policy.      “I can't say the size of cover but it's a crime policy, meaning it's covering third-party theft and employee misconduct,” said Kech. “It covers both cold and warm. It would not cover hot, permanently online, but HSMs in our solution are not considered as permanently online.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/03/ibms-public-cloud-is-secure-enough-for-crypto-custodians,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60f5bd213c309fd1a162c7b8a068f431b5a5bee4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xbh,1583236800,"India's Appetite for Crypto Derivatives Is Growing, Exchanges Say","India is developing an appetite for crypto derivatives, even as the country's Supreme Court continues to deliberate over the future of the exchange industry.      ""We witnessed a huge demand for futures trading among Indian crypto users [in early 2020],” said CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta, founder of an exchange aggregator.      Meanwhile, the Indian exchange Unocoin has been embroiled in a court case about the proper regulations for fiat on-ramps since 2018. Unocoin co-founder Sathvik Vishwanath agreed, saying “while we believe it is pretty much the time to launch a derivatives market, the restrictions from Reserve Bank of India on banks is making the on-ramp and off-ramp complicated and is keeping the average customer away.”      Vishwanath said that in the meantime, the exchange still serves 26,000 active monthly users in India with a crypto-only platform and has plans to launch derivatives options within the next few months. Likewise, Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said his team in Mumbai is focused on growing the derivatives offering in 2020, thanks to his previous experience trading derivatives for the Union Bank of Switzerland before founding the crypto exchange in 2018. In fact, this week Delta Exchange launched new exotic options in bitcoin and ether, allowing users to take leveraged bets on the size of the cryptocurrencies' price moves.      “We see derivatives are one of the areas that is really under-penetrated in crypto,” Balani said. “If you look at daily FX trading ... derivatives are four to five times the size of spot markets, but in crypto this isn’t true yet.”      The biggest challenge for derivatives platforms, he added, is scaling. Balani’s co-founder, Saurabh Goyal, was previously director of engineering at the Indian video streaming platform Hotstar, which routinely handles upwards of 20 million people using the platform at once to watch sports and other live events.      Local startups aren’t the only ones to notice India’s growing demand for cryptocurrency trading options. Back in November, the global exchange giant Binance acquired India’s leading digital assets platform, WazirX. And it looks like by 2021 this might be just one of many companies looking to develop a presence in India, a country of 1 billion people which until now has seen a mere pittance in crypto volumes.      Indeed, Cashaa CEO Kumar Gaurav said his online banking platform now sees more than 150 percent growth in crypto activity every month. As such, he estimates these Indian clients are involved with trading up to 1,000 bitcoin in daily volume, primarily from over-the-counter trading desks looking to get in on the adjacent crypto derivatives boom.      “I expect this trend will continue and anticipate strong demand for crypto options from India in 2020,” Gaurav said. “Before the regulatory hurdles, Indian exchanges were doing $50-60 million in daily volumes and we can expect this volume to come back soon.”    Demand meets supply    Given the unclear regulations in India related to fiat on-ramps, Balani said his exchange will shift to focus on users looking to “hedge against volatility in their portfolios” through large-scale derivatives trading.      These plans include interest rate derivatives and, eventually, Lightning Network functionality, for the speed the bitcoin scaling solution provides.      “In the next couple of months, you’ll see lightning withdrawals and deposits for our customers,” Balani said, describing that first step for the platform’s 25,000 registered traders facilitating more than $300 million in monthly volume so far this year.      The interest rate derivatives will be modeled after decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Compound Finance, where traders earn interest on crypto deposits. Delta Exchange researcher Pooja Shah said traders may prefer her startup, rather than incumbents like BitMEX, because Delta offers more variety. According to Delta staff, the exchange has seen more month-over-month growth among Indian users in 2020 than any other nation.      “While the market leader BitMEX has 10 contracts, we have over 30 contracts available for trading,” Shah said. “For example, WRX futures listed on Delta within six hours of its IEO opening on Binance. … This made us the only platform where people could short WRX and lock their IEO gains.”      Most of these Delta users are located in Southeast Asia, where incumbents like OKEx are also looking to grow their derivatives offerings. OKEx Financial Markets Director Lennix Lai said derivatives now makeup nearly 66 percent of the exchange's daily global volume, more than $2 billion in options alone.      “I believe that [the crypto derivatives] market still has some room to grow … maybe 10-20 percent more,” Lai said.      In fact, Gupta of CoinDCX said his platform was seeing such high demand for crypto derivatives that the platform partnered with OKEx for liquidity on the backend. As Gupta’s team works on implementing know-your-customer (KYC) procedures to become a fully-fledged exchange, even more competitors are flocking to capitalize on Indian demand for crypto derivatives.      Ashish Singhal, CEO of the exchange CoinSwitch.co, said Indian traders have “started to embrace” crypto derivatives in particular.      ""India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) has beaten CME Group to be the world’s top derivatives exchange, showing India’s appetite for the derivatives market,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO of the exchange CoinSwitch.co. He added that Indian traders have “started to embrace” crypto derivatives in particular. Traders are familiar with it and regulators appear to be less concerned about crypto-to-crypto transactions than about fiat on-ramps.      “In all likelihood, 2020 may be the game-changer for the crypto in India,” said Unocoin’s Vishwanath.

42431571,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xFh,1583236800,Why Aren't the Candidates Talking About Digital Currency?,"Today’s arrival of Super Tuesday, that 15-state do-or-die Democratic primary battle, seems like a good excuse for a retrospective on how the U.S. presidential campaign has played out until now.      Specifically, let’s look back at how many of the presidential hopefuls noted an elephant in the room. How many contemplated the real possibility the international monetary system will soon be dramatically disrupted by digital currency and new finance initiatives emanating out of Beijing, Facebook’s headquarters and wherever in the world the #DeFi community is based?      These radical new ideas about money could challenge U.S. global economic dominance over the next president’s four-year term. Surely someone has a contingency plan. Right?      Let’s do a poll.      How many candidates mentioned during a year’s worth of debates and mainstream media interviews that China, by some measures already the biggest economy in the world, is about to launch a digital currency?      Answer: Zero.      How many candidates have a policy position for contending with the following potential challenges?    A Wall Street crisis spawned by foreign businesses directly settling foreign trade contracts with digital currency rather than through intermediating U.S. banks  Washington regulators struggling to impose sanctions on North Korea, Iran, Russia and other rogue states when those banks can no longer act as enforcement agents  The bankruptcy of Social Security accounts when U.S. Treasury bonds plunge in value because digital trade settlement makes it unnecessary for foreign central banks to hold reserve assets as a volatility hedge    Zero. Zero. And Zero.      CoinDesk reporter Benjamin Powers has been hounding candidates and their advisers with questions such as these as part of our ongoing Election 2020 coverage, part of a series we’re calling the “Post-Trust Election.”      On digital currencies, Benjamin says, “candidates have been noticeably quiet.” Sure, “Bloomberg has the outlines of a policy plan, and a Sanders surrogate said the campaign sees possibilities for digital currencies to support more agile, peer-to-peer transactions. But it’s largely crickets from the rest of the field.”      Yet, in talking to voters in South Carolina this week, Benjamin found many were well informed about this rapidly evolving technology and thought candidates should be talking about it.      Instead, they’re getting responses like Joe Biden’s to a debate question on how he would contain North Korea’s nuclear weapon development: ”I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power.”      When the U.S. puts “pressure” on foreign governments, its primary non-military weapon is the threat to restrict financial flows into or out of the U.S. financial system. But as was discovered in a recent simulation run by Harvard and MIT researchers, one led by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, digital currency technology is likely to hinder Washington’s capacity to sanction North Korea.      Biden’s response is understandable. It’s hard for someone born two years before the Bretton Woods agreement to imagine a world in which the U.S. loses its unique gatekeeper role in the global economy. Heck, for an American of any age for whom low interest rates and other benefits of the dollar’s “exorbitant privilege” are viewed as the norm, it’s unsettling to imagine a world without them. No wonder digital currency doesn’t play in Peoria.      And, let’s be clear, the candidates’ main opponent isn’t contemplating the prospect of a different financial system either.      In a 2019 tweetstorm about his dislike of bitcoin (BTC), one now infamous in cryptocurrency circles, President Donald Trump said, “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!”      Yet, as international monetary system historian Barry Eichengreen’s work shows, reserve currency status never lasts. Eventually, the imbalances it fosters reach breaking point.      Now, with surveys showing foreign trust in U.S. leadership at all-time lows, with threats to the global economy such as COVID-19 (coronavirus) looming ominously, and with new digital currency technologies allowing users to bypass the dollar, the catalysts for change are looming.      Strikingly, central bankers, sensing an international arms race in currency technology, are sitting up and taking notice. A recent Bank of International Settlements survey of 66 central banks covering 90 percent of global economic output found 80 percent of them are working on digital currency projects and that 10 percent plan to go live with them within three years. The Bank of England’s outgoing governor, Mark Carney, has called for world leaders to come up with a new “digital hegemon” to replace the dollar at the center of the international monetary system. And earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitted Libra and China’s digital yuan had “really lit a fire” under his institution, given the “systemic risks” they pose for the dollar.      The question is, when will the same fire be lit under our politicians’ behinds?",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

42431583,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xfh,1583235000,Bottom In? Bitcoin Makes 4.5% Gain as Sellers Lose Steam,"View  A bullish doji reversal pattern seen on the daily chart indicates scope for a stronger recovery rally to resistance lined up at $9,075 and $9,312.  If the flag breakout seen on the hourly chart fails, a pullback to $8,500 may be seen.  A UTC close under Sunday's low of $8,410 would revive the bearish view.    Bitcoin (BTC) looks to have found a price bottom over the last two days and may soon witness a stronger recovery rally.      The top cryptocurrency formed a doji candle on Sunday, signaling seller exhaustion at the one-month low of $8,410 and aborting the sell-off from the recent high of $10,500.      While Sunday's candle warned of a potential price bottom near $8,400, a 4.5 percent rise Monday confirmed it. So stronger buying interest could emerge in the short term, powering the cryptocurrency to key resistance levels above $9,000.      The risk reset in the traditional markets is also supportive of gains in bitcoin. The S&P 500, Wall Street's equity index and the benchmark for global equities, surged by 4.6 percent on Monday on hopes for coordinated interest rate cuts by major central banks.      S&P index futures are currently reporting a 1 percent gain. Meanwhile, gold has recovered to $1,600 from Friday's low of $1,563. The recovery may continue, possibly helping bitcoin gain altitude, as the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates by 25 basis points early Tuesday and markets are expecting the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to follow suit later this month.      Bitcoin dropped sharply last week along with stocks, which took a beating on fears that a coronavirus pandemic would put a sizable dent in global economic growth. Gold also declined last week, reportedly due to margin calls.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $8,840, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.    Daily chart    Bitcoin has defended the trendline rising from December and January lows with a bullish doji reversal pattern comprising of Sunday's doji candle and Monday's positive follow through.      As a result, the path of least resistance is on the higher side. The cryptocurrency could challenge resistance at $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) in the next 24 hours. Acceptance above that level would shift the focus to $9,312 (Feb. 19 low) and the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance at $9,500.      The outlook would turn bearish if prices close under Sunday's low of $8,410. That would likely bring in additional losses toward $8,213 (Feb. 24 low) and $8,000.    Hourly chart    The pullback from Monday's high of $8,980 took the shape of a bull flag – a pause that often ends up accelerating the preceding upward move.      The hourly candle at 09:00-10:00 UTC Tuesday closed above the upper end of the flag, confirming a breakout and opening the doors for a rally to $9,230 (target as per the measured move method).      If the breakout fails, a fresh drop toward $8,500 may be seen. A failed breakout is a powerful bearish signal.

42431580,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xZh,1583229600,"With Central Bank Digital Currencies, States Are Reasserting Power Over Money","James Cooper is a professor of law at California Western School of Law in San Diego. A former contractor for the U.S. and adviser to governments and indigenous peoples concerning disruptive technologies for the legal sector, he has advised blockchain companies in Asia.      In the heyday of cryptomania, when everyone was investing in any idea that had the word “blockchain” attached to it, there was much speculation about the end of the state. Distributed ledger technology would not only bring about the demise of intermediaries like big technology platforms and overfed financial institutions, but it would also challenge the primacy of the sovereign state itself. Decentralization would mean that the democratic process could be more horizontal, more responsive, more direct and more efficient.      Blockchain technologies and the cryptocurrencies built thereon were also set to challenge the monopoly that states have maintained on currency. Traditionally, the creation, printing and control of legal tender has been an activity strictly reserved for states. The development of state-sanctioned, sovereign-backed cryptocurrencies, however, have meant that the state is not out yet. Not by a long shot.      A handful of countries have entered the brave new world of sovereign digital currencies. The biggest and most ambitious central bank digital currency project is China’s Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DC/EP). On Oct. 24, 2019, a day now called “China Blockchain Day,” President Xi Jinping announced his country’s blockchain strategy and the rollout of its new state-sanctioned cryptocurrency project. While many major financial leaders feared being the first movers, China studied blockchain for years while outlawing cryptocurrencies. Again and again, China banned Initial Coin Offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges. The country’s law enforcement authorities even deterred Chinese hotels from hosting crypto-oriented conferences.      When Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg warned Congress it had better support the social media company get its Libra digital currency to market lest China get a head start, the bureaucrats in China moved into high gear. Within months, they launched the DC/EP plan with initial testing in Suzhou and Shenzhen. The system’s strength is its interoperability and the fact one does not have to be online to use it. That it is linked to the Chinese national currency – the yuan or renminbi – does not hurt either. By layering insurance, health care, finance, energy and consumer purchasing into one unified public blockchain, there will be economies of scale and more efficient distribution of private and public goods. And not just in China but around the world with the 71 partners in its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative.      Long before the DC/EP came the Marshallese sovereign (SOV), the national digital currency promoted by the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The SOV will be introduced through a sale over an extended period of time through a Timed Release Monetary Issuance. The Marshall Islands must improve the nation’s anti-money laundering (AML) and know your client (KYC) rules so that the SOV does not run afoul of United States Treasury and International Monetary Fund regulations.      An even shadier central bank digital currency project – the Venezuelan Petro – was released last year in the midst of the one million percent inflation afflicting the South American hydrocarbon giant nation’s economy. But with United States sanctions against Venezuela and the fact that the digital assets are backed by oil reserves that have already been pledged for Chinese and Russian loans, this project is a failure.      On the other end of the “let’s try out a sovereign-backed digital currency” spectrum is the normally conservative Sweden, which announced two weeks ago the Sveriges Riksbank’s pilot of an e-krona project. This trial is an attempt by the Swedish Central Bank to study the manner in which Swedes – known for their aversion to using cash – would utilize a national digital currency.      As other developed, industrialized countries follow suit, the state will continue to play a critical role in our lives. It is no secret that the primary role that the state has maintained for centuries has been whittled away through privatization, deregulation and the outsourcing of other inherently governmental activities like education, healthcare, telecommunications, waste management and feeding and arming our troops.      This hollowing-out process is by no means complete. The state is making a comeback with the advent of sovereign backed digital currencies. After all, nothing is more centralizing than a state’s control over decentralized technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,James Cooper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/03/with-central-bank-digital-currencies-states-are-reasserting-power-over-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ce31aa6e46c9d777801584e9e91018ac7099ad2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431570,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3xJh,1583226000,How to Stop the Next Quadriga: Make Exchanges Prove Their Reserves,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      What differentiates bitcoin from its analog cousin, gold? You might respond ‘divisibility’ or ‘portability.’ You would be correct. But what really differentiates it? The answer, of course, is auditability.      Consider the set of things you can prove about a lump of gold. If you use it as a settlement medium, with the help of an XRF Spectrometer (available for sale for $13,500), you can prove that this inbound fleck of gold is genuine. Now what can I prove about your gold? Well, nothing. I have to take your word for it that it is in fact gold. This isn’t an issue, unless you’re holding the gold on my behalf. Now I have a problem: I’ve entrusted you with my gold — perhaps you’ve issued me an IOU that represents a claim on that gold — but I have no ability to determine that you have the gold you claim you have on deposit. I cannot audit your gold from afar.      Perhaps I choose to trust you. But if you don’t go to the effort of re-verifying all the gold you receive, then you need to prove to me, your depositor, that all of your counterparties in the gold supply chain are honest. And they need to prove that their counterparties — miners, refiners, jewelers, recyclers, custodians — are honest, too. The outcome is a fully permissioned supply chain in which a single body holds each entity to account with a convoluted ruleset. One such walled garden is governed by the London Bullion Market Association, which manages $400 billion worth of gold sitting in vaults in London. Because it’s so costly to administer a gold supply chain, link by link, and ensure that not only is the gold, well, gold, but that it’s gold stamped by the right people, LBMA gold rarely strays outside those confines.      And this is the best case scenario, believe it or not. The other outcome is that the government (or really, a single government) holds everyone’s gold and then refuses to give it back when the time comes.      So costly verification leads to concentration. The more expensive it is to verify the integrity of a monetary good, the more taking delivery of it is difficult for smaller holders, and the more it lends itself towards capture.    One potential solution is to demand that exchanges issue periodic proofs that they actually have dominion over assets owed to depositors.    Take bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand. How do you verify the validity of some inbound bitcoin you are receiving? For the paranoid: run a full node. Using the beefiest providers, it’ll set you back $150 per month, or you can build your own with a $35 Raspberry Pi. What about verifying the integrity of all the bitcoin ever mined? Your full node does that by default, simply by following consensus rules. For each block, it checks that there was a sufficient cost exerted to create those new bitcoins, and that they were mined according to the predefined schedule (50 BTC per block for four years, then 25, and so on). To obtain a summary, run the gettxoutsetinfo RPC command on your full node.      Now what about you proving to me that you truly own some bitcoin that you claim you own? Thanks to public-key cryptography, this is trivial. The most convenient way in bitcoin is to use the signmessage RPC command present in software like Bitcoin Core or Electrum. I provide you with a string of text, and you pair it with your private key to create a proof that you own some given UTXOs. This is quite powerful: trusting only cryptography, I can know for a fact that you control a specific quantity of bitcoin at a moment in time.      Some bitcoiners believe bitcoin’s auditability advantages over gold will allow it to escape the dismal fate suffered by the shiny rock. President Nixon had an easy time voiding the gold standard in 1971 because most of the relevant gold was already held in U.S.’s government vaults. Bitcoin is held by millions of people. And I count myself among those who are optimistic that bitcoin’s properties as highly auditable collateral will yield a monetary base asset which is held mostly by end users, rather than a tiny handful of intermediaries.  Despite the ease of taking ownership of one’s bitcoins, the reality is that, by my count, at least 20 percent of outstanding supply is held by intermediaries. Although those in the Rothbardian school would disagree with me, I don’t believe that fractional reserve banking is inherently fraudulent. The fraud occurs when exchanges represent themselves as fully reserved when they are not. In theory, bitcoin’s qualities lend themselves to mitigating this risk. Even in a custodial setting, the auditable nature of bitcoin means that savers can independently verify that the liabilities of depository institutions match their assets. The problem is that some of the most prominent bitcoiners don’t share my enthusiasm for the idea. Problematically, this group includes the CEOs of the bitcoin banks, today referred to as exchanges.      These bitcoin banks are the prime beneficiaries of the existence of bitcoin. They are the largest businesses in the industry. The public has an insatiable demand for intermediated bitcoin, and has paid dearly for the privilege. Exchanges store a wonderfully auditable asset, but for the most part, they simply ask depositors to trust them not to misbehave by establishing covert fractional reserves. And the history of bitcoin banks is full of breaches of that trust. The list is long and painful: Mt. Gox, Quadriga, FCoin, Cryptopia, Bitfinex, Cryptsy and Bitcoinica, among many others, have all suffered major hacks or insolvencies. Exchanges simply have too lousy a track record to get a pass.      Exchanges are meant, in theory, to distinguish operating capital from user deposits, and to hold those deposits equivalent on a 1:1 basis to liabilities. In practice, either through malice or incompetence, some exchanges never develop sufficiently strong controls, fail to mitigate key man risk, or simply lose track of their coins. Since redemptions rarely come all at once, these insolvencies can go undetected for years. Unknown to the unwitting buyer, Mt. Gox was most likely already insolvent when it was sold to Mark Karpeles in 2011.      For sure, depositors can find some assurances in laws and regulation: if an exchange has a Bitlicense or a license to operate Limited Purpose Trust Company in New York, it is likely subject to reasonable scrutiny over its deposit-taking activity. Even better: registering as a Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution. The Wyoming law stipulates specific requirements for deposit-taking ""crypto banks"" designed to give depositors confidence – although no institutions have received the charter just yet. Generally speaking however, exchanges are not forthcoming with the details of the audits they may undergo, when they do exist. And many exchanges are lightly- or entirely un-regulated. Some of the deepest pools of liquidity in the crypto industry – Binance, BitMEX, Derebit, Bitfinex, among others – are not meaningfully regulated in any sense. Now bitcoiners should demand not moreregulation, but rather seek to head off future regulatory power grabs by holding exchanges to a higher standard in the first place.      One potential solution is to demand that exchanges issue periodic proofs that they actually have dominion over assets owed to depositors. These ""Proofs of Reserve"" (PoR), if done properly, leverage bitcoin’s neat cryptographic properties and give depositors reasonably sound assurances that the exchange is not misrepresenting their solvency. Such PoR ceremonies purport to prove that deposit-taking institutions have sufficient BTC in reserve to satisfy all liabilities owed to depositors. After a brief period of enthusiasm for the public audits in the wake of Mt. Gox in 2014, today only one exchange routinely carries out these attestations — the London-based Coinfloor.      I envision a robust, periodic PoR program not as a panacea, but as a complement to regulation in onshore exchanges, and an (inferior) substitute offshore. If some operations, formerly reliant on contracts and trust, can be formalized and expressed as code, we should embrace them. Now the set of engagements in which software and cryptography outperform the standard trust-manufacturing processes is rather small. But proving custody of a digital asset is one case where signmessage is more convenient, and perhaps cheaper, than an auditor’s report. While implementations vary, the process as it is currently carried out entails posting an anonymized list of user deposits as well as an attestation to BTC held in the vault.      Proof of Reserve and other solvency attestations are not without their drawbacks, and exchanges have managed to trick assessors implementing the process in the past, but we shouldn’t forget the broader objective here. If we are unable to take advantage of the innate cryptographic verifiability of bitcoin, then we have scarcely innovated relative to gold. One wonders – what are we doing here, again?

Turkish citizens with an Akbank bank account can use the direct channel as of today.      Founded in 1948, Akbank is one of the largest banks in Turkey.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the new Akbank integration would make their services as accessible as possible in a country ""fast-adopting digital assets.""

The lira's volatility and an uncertain political-economic outlook have pushed many of the country's citizens to engage with digital assets.

In November, the exchange launched its first crypto gateway with the lira. At the time, Binance's strategy director Gin Chao said Turkey was one of the countries the exchange was most interested in expanding its services to.

The first from an external party, the placement will build out Folkvang's existing offer as well as expand its presence globally, according to a press release. The exact size of the investment was not disclosed.

In February, FTX opened a public sale for tokenized equity that would take its overall valuation up to a billion dollars. The sale is expected to finish March 7.      Alameda was reportedly impressed by the speed in which Folkvang aggressively captured market share. With daily trading volumes in the hundreds of millions, ""they [Alameda] were like: this is interesting, we want a piece of that,"" said van Rossum.      In a statement, Alameda CEO and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX exchange, said van Rossum had been an ""early adopter and is a key player on the FTX exchange,"" continuing: ""He has demonstrated an enviable track record and we’re excited to take part in the next big phase of his trading firm’s expansion.""      An Alameda spokesperson declined to comment on the exact investment figure.      In Norse mythology, Folkvang was the final resting place for warriors who died in combat. ""There are a lot of similarities between battlefields and financial markets,"" explained van Rossum. ""We thought the name was very well-fitting.""      UPDATE (Mar. 3, 09:55 UTC): A previous version of this article stated Alameda owned FTX. In fact, it does not but shares the same CEO and has a business relationship. We also stated Folkvang was based in Hong Kong-based on comments from the firm, but after publication a representative said they had not understood the original question and the firm is based in Panama.
