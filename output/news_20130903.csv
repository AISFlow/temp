42425061,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIVh,1378224938,What should we do with stolen bitcoins?,"Thousands of bitcoins have been stolen from users since the virtual currency started, and yet we can see all of these thefts happen, in real time, on the block chain. We know which addresses the stolen coins are sent to, and which ones they are stolen from. We can track the life of a bitcoin through the network.  Why, then, can't we simply take those stolen coins out of commission?  A UK-based digital forensic services firm, Systech, has begun offering a recovery service for lost and stolen bitcoins. The service is twofold: firstly, it will use its traditional forensic data recovery techniques to salvage coins from damaged hard drives. Secondly, it has also announced a tracing service for stolen bitcoins, which it hopes will enable victims to find out who tries to exchange stolen coins for fiat currency.  Tracing stolen coins should, theoretically, be relatively easy on the bitcoin network. It is paradoxically one of the most private and transparent decentralized networks in existence.  On the one hand, you can register a bitcoin address instantly, at no cost, that has no links to your real-world identity. There's the privacy.  On the other hand, the transparency of the block chain means that everyone can see every activity conducted by any bitcoin address, including the amount of bitcoins that it holds, where they came from, and where they go when it sends them on somewhere else.  This has led to some controversial actions on the part of bitcoin exchanges in the past. In 2012, over 43,000 bitcoins were stolen from Zhou Tong’s Bitcoinica leveraged trading platform, which subsequently shut down.  Mt Gox then began freezing accounts  containing bitcoins that could be traced to the theft, and demanding that account holders submit identification. This was before KYC rules demanded that account holders register proof of identity.  “What we do is carry out an analysis and parse the block chain for all transactions. We can then follow a transaction even when the coins are split up into multiple transactions and wallets, or aggregated into one wallet,” said Systech spokesperson Simon Lang.  Because exchanges are now subject to KYC and AML rules, it should be easier to obtain the identities of people trying to exchange bitcoins linked to a theft, Lang added.  There are challenges, though. The taint of a coin can help investigators to track the relationship between two addresses, making it harder for thieves to hide their stolen coins simply by sending them to lots of different addresses. However, the more an output is used in subsequent transactions, the more difficult it is to prove that it is stolen, say experts.  “The taint remains definitive while subsequent transactions disperse the funds, but it gets diluted if aggregated with coins from other sources,” said Tamás Blummer, founder and CEO of BitsOfProof, a company that sells commercial-grade bitcoin servers.  Jeff Garzik, a core developer of the Bitcoin protocol, said the ability to prove that a coin is stolen falls drastically after the first subsequent transaction.  “At its most basic level, the Bitcoin protocol destroys each coin when it is spent, and creates brand new coins for the recipient. Sending 1.0 BTC to me might involve destroying coin #1111 (0.5 BTC) and coin #1112 (0.5 BTC), and creating coin #6789 (1.0 BTC).""  So, a ‘coin’ may be made of several inputs, some of which might be stolen, and some of which might not. “Thus, beyond a single transaction, you cannot say that a coin is 100% stolen.”  Blummer points out another problem: a smart thief will try to cover their tracks using a laundry transaction, which obfuscates the inputs and outputs entirely. One way of doing this is via a mixing service.  These services receive bitcoins, and mix them with bitcoins from many other users, before resending the same amount back to the sender from the mixed pool of inputs. This obfuscates the inputs and outputs stemming from a theft, making it far more difficult to trace them.  It isn't always foolproof, however, said Lang:  “The liquidity of these sites is still so low that it is sometimes still possible to follow out.”  The question is, what should be done with stolen transactions that can be followed? You might think it's a no-brainer not just to identify stolen outputs, but also to stop them being spent altogether. In fact, we could go further, and simply build something into the bitcoin protocol that stops transactions being mined if they are based on outputs from stolen coins. After all, the transparency is built right into the system.  Not so fast, says Garzik. If the technological challenges above don’t make it difficult enough, the legal and economic considerations should dissuade us.  ‘Victims’ may claim a theft, even if they have stolen their own bitcoins. Even if a victim can be proven honest, police reports from jurisdictions around the world must then be reviewed and authenticated and matched to bitcoin transactions, to try and find a perpetrator of a theft. Then, a community consensus would be needed to upgrade a transaction blacklist. And if the person running the blacklist got it wrong, they could be legally liable.  Garzik asserts:  “It is not the place of engineers to sort through police reports, and pronounce judgements on each transaction as good or evil.”  Any such pronouncements will be subjective, he says. “Businesses and exchanges receiving bitcoins are in the best position to know their customer, and make some sort of judgement about that.”  At least some payment processors, too, are wary of building mechanisms into the Bitcoin protocol to stop stolen coins from being spent. BitPay, Garzik’s employer and a processor of bitcoin payments, says that such a move would alter the certainty of transactions. Far better to build some sort of transaction reversibility into the layers atop the protocol rather than the protocol itself, the firm says.  The final concept is perhaps the most important: fungability – the idea that one unit of a currency should always be equivalent to another unit of the same currency.  “It is important that the value of one bitcoin is the same as the value of another bitcoin,” Garzik concludes, arguing that failing to preserve the fungability of coins would change bitcoin’s underlying economic principles. “Otherwise it becomes impossible for software and average users to figure out which bitcoins they should hold, and which they should avoid.”  So, yes, we can follow stolen coins – or parts of them, in subsequent transactions – through the network. But officially besmirching those coins based on fraudulent transactions in the chain is a bad idea, say experts.  While exchanges and merchants may be able to make some qualitative judgements about the validity of a transaction with a relation to stolen outputs, trying to codify this into the protocol itself is fraught with difficulties. For the time being at least, the Bitcoin protocol will treat all coins as equal – stolen or not.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/03/what-should-we-do-with-stolen-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f64a085377fe711c1f044293b564697d7bf20539-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422951,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yuth,1378212164,Raspberry Pi used in new bitcoin-operated pool table,"Games room specialist Liberty Games has created a bitcoin-operated pool table that runs on Raspberry Pi. Next to the table's traditional coin slot, there is a QR code and an LCD screen, which displays the price per play in bitcoins. Users simply scan the QR code and send the displayed amount to the owner's bitcoin wallet address. The machine then automatically tips the balls out – they don’t have to be manually released.  Stuart Kerr, technical director at Liberty Games, said he decided to give the idea a try after reading CoinDesk's article 'Will bitcoin ever be used for gas pumps, parking meters and pool tables?'. He said it didn't take very long to move from concept to finished product: ""Actually writing the code for the Raspberry Pi wasn't too bad, there's loads of support out there. I just took a few things from GitHub and the like and changed them around a bit.  ""Then we had to wait a while to get the pool table, because they're all made to order, so that wait was probably the longest part of the process."" There's a lot of unused space inside a pool table, so fitting in the Raspberry Pi, which is very small anyway, was no problem, he added, before stating that the table can be powered either by a battery pack or via a mains adapter.  Setting the price  The owner of the pub or pool hall that houses the table can decide the price-per-play. ""There's an in-built web admin control on the Raspberry Pi, so when you turn it on, the LCD display gives you the IP address, so you just put that in the web browser of a computer that's on the same network and you get a screen where you can set up the price-per-play,"" Kerr explained. He said it can be linked to an RSS feed showing the bitcoin to pound sterling exchange rate, then a rolling average exchange rate is used to calculate what the price is in bitcoin. As for the cost to the owner, Kerr said it's ""not actually too bad"" at around £100-£150 more than a normal pool table would cost.  Pool Table Analytics  Analytics of the table's use can be accessed through the Raspberry Pi's web admin. Kerr said the analytics are pretty basic at the moment, but the company will continue adding features to it. ""We'll make it so you can see how many games have been played since you last checked and when its most popular hour was – which a standard pool table just doesn't give you,"" he explained.  The company, which ships worldwide, is now looking at adding bitcoin payment options to a number of its other products, which include jukeboxes and pinball machines. Next on the list, though, is an arcade machine.  The publican's view  Kerr said he'd not yet been in touch with any pubs about the table yet, but we spoke to Stephen Early, founder and director of Individual Pubs limited, which owns five pubs in the UK that accept bitcoin. He said he thinks the table ""looks good"" and added:  ""I think that if we installed one of those tables in our pub in Hackney [London] it would get a reasonable amount of use – although, just like with our tills, the vast majority of the time people will still use pounds.""  Early thinks the biggest problem would be getting power to the table as most pubs don't have a socket in the floor under their pool tables, and the Raspberry Pi can ""really eat batteries"". He said Liberty Games would have to be careful if it creates machines that accept bitcoins, but pay out prizes in pounds, as those may become a target for fraud. Early explained his pubs are currently receiving around £1,000 in bitcoin per month: ""It's not a big part of our business, but it was definitely worth doing. Even if nobody uses it, it doesn't cost us anything to maintain.""  CoinDesk had one more pressing question that it wanted to get to the bottom of: how are bitcoiners supposed to reserve their place in the queue for a pool table? Usually, people leave their coins on the side of the table to signal their intention to play the next game, but bitcoiners don't have anything physical to put down. ""Damn – I didn’t think of that. Although, I could potentially add in a queuing system that displays the bitcoin address of the next player up!"" Kerr replied.

42425080,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIrh,1378197687,"How does total value of bitcoin compare with money supply of Peru, Turkey, Tajikistan and China?","It’s been commonly reported in the media that the total value of bitcoin in circulation is well over $1 billion. But what does that mean? For bitcoin, this is normally calculated by market capitalization, which is a figure that is normally attributed to the total valuation of a stock. You take the total shares outstanding and multiply that by the stock price. Google, for example, currently has a stock price of $866.39 as of 26th August. Multiply that price by 333.22 million shares, and you get a market cap number of $288.6 billion for the company. Personally, I’ve long been wary of calculating bitcoin by market cap. The reason? It’s not a stock, and behaves much differently which makes it hard to determine valuation in that way. Recently, however, a report by the International Monetary Fund regarded bitcoin as a “private currency”. Indeed, around the same time the German government indicated they had come to the same conclusion, deeming it a private unit of exchange.  That got me thinking. What if I took the market capitalization of bitcoin and compared it to some countries? What is bitcoin actually worth when compared to certain fiat currencies? To do this, I took the M2 money supply of a few countries and compared it to bitcoin’s market capitalization to get these figures. It’s not a perfect comparison. For example, countries actually produce goods and services, as reflected in gross domestic product, which I have also included. But this can give some idea of how bitcoin stacks up against national economies. The most recent reports of M2 money supply come from July 2013, so I took the high market cap of bitcoin from July, which was $1,166,486,326 according to Blockchain.info. Money Supply data came from Tradingeconomics.com, which obtains that data from central banks, while GDP numbers were 2012 figures from the World Bank.

Let’s not forget that fiat-based money is under the influence of central bankers. These are officials who have the ability to change supply and lending interest rates, generally in order to stave off inflation and other economic factors. The reality is that, while some believe bitcoin is not real money, this comparison shows that BTC has real worth. Gold, for example, is not real money. It’s not a unit of exchange like bitcoin is. You cannot give Foodler a portion of an ounce of gold for food delivery. You can, however, give Foodler the current fiat-exchanged amount of bitcoin to satisfy your hunger pains. The problem? Unlike fiat, bitcoin is still not a commonly used method of exchange. Maybe someday in the future it will be, but for now you cannot simply go to any store and pay for items with bitcoins. What may be more likely, at least in the short term, is that perhaps bitcoin will simply be used as a means of transmitting value throughout the financial system. Only time will tell. What do you think about the value of bitcoins versus fiat? Could bitcoin be more valuable than fiat over time because it is math-based and decentralized?",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/03/how-does-total-value-of-bitcoin-compare-with-money-supply-of-peru-turkey-tajikistan-and-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/255032d0d89abdeb0c4dfc317e6bf2095f4fa843-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
