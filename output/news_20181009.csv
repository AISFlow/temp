42429791,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Idh,1539118827,Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX Awaits Ruling on $22 Million in Frozen Funds,"Canada-based crypto exchange QuadrigaCX is waiting on a verdict in a long-running legal case against the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).  At the heart of the dispute is CA$28 million, or about $21.6 million in U.S. dollars. The case began in January 2018, when the CIBC froze multiple accounts opened by QuadrigaCX's payment processor, claiming that it was unable to determine whether the exchange or individuals who deposited funds to purchase cryptocurrencies owned the money in the accounts, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday.  QuadrigaCX maintains that it owns the funds in the accounts opened by Costodian, Inc., but the CIBC is unsure. As such, it's asking the Vancouver courts to take ownership of the funds and determine whether the exchange, the payment processor or 388 individuals legally own the funds.  The frozen accounts are harming QuadrigaCX's customers too, the exchange has contended. Because the exchange cannot access the money, some customers face delays when attempting to withdraw their money from the platform.  In response to a request for comment, QuadrigaCX founder and CEO Gerald Cotten told CoinDesk that ""to put it briefly, CIBC is currently holding nearly $28 [million Canadian dollars] of ours hostage and has been doing so since January.""  ""We went to court in June to sort it out, and are just waiting on the judge to issue his ruling at this point,"" he explained in an email.  Cotten referred further questions to counsel as the case is still ongoing.  However, a Reddit account purporting to represent the exchange said in a comment that ""it is truly frightening how much power the banks have,"" adding that ""we find it particularly troubling when they attack crypto companies and then create their own competing crypto projects.""  It went on to say:  ""After they realized that they faced a potentially massive lawsuit for the damages that they have caused, they went out of their way to discredit crypto, our customers that had sent wires, and anything else they could think of to retroactively justify freeziing [sic] an account while continuing to accept deposits for another month. In court things went pretty well for us. Now we just need to wait for the judge to issue his written judgement, which apparently takes a while in Ontario.""  ""As soon as the judge rules on this motion, we will be pursuing legal action against CIBC for the massive amount of damages they have caused,"" the account added.

42429799,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Ivh,1539114323,There's A Giant Bitcoin Rat on Wall Street And It's Staring Down the Fed,"There's a towering inflatable rat on Wall Street and it's found a temporary home in front of a branch of the world's most powerful bank.  Claws out, fangs fierce, the art piece installed Tuesday is an homage to the giant rats inflated by union protesters as a way to point a finger at companies for mistreating employees. But this latest rat has been updated for modern times. Instead of a dull brown, it's covered in colorful code and math equations in an ode to bitcoin.  The massive art piece was just installed as a sort of ""protest"" designed to get viewers to think critically about the state of economics and money management. ""Bitcoin will take you apart,"" the rat seems to argue from its perch in front of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's iconic stone exterior. On its piercing blue eyes, its pupils spell out the letters ""PoW,"" short for proof-of-work, bitcoin's underlying algorithm.  Not a permanent installation, it's expected to be on display for a few days according to artist and ex-hedge fund manager Nelson Saiers, who wants to use the piece to direct attention to The Fed, perhaps the world's most powerful bank because it controls the U.S. dollar.  While this control is intended to keep the U.S. economy running smoothly, critics argue that central banks devalue money and that it's inner-mechanics aren't as transparent as they should be (an opinion that has a lot of clout in bitcoin circles).  As if a giant rat staring angrily at the Federal Reserve didn't make this point already, Saiers specifically chose to set loose his creation on Maiden Lane, named after the entity that bailed out the giant companies AIG and Bear Stearns during the 2008 financial crisis.  But while rats have a long history in protest, it arguably carries added symbolism for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Remember the time Warren Buffet called bitcoin ""rat poison squared?""  You could think of the art installation as a kind of commentary on that, too.  Saiers told CoinDesk:  ""Warren Buffett called bitcoin 'rat poison squared' but if the Fed's a rat, then maybe rat poison is a good thing.""  Pushing buttons  But if his latest project draws more than a few confused stares this week, know this sort of protest art isn't exactly new for Saiers.  Actually, the former mathematician has earned the nickname ""The Warhol of Wall Street"" with paintings that depict the darker side of finance, including the market crashes and other complexities that can impact greatly those who understand it the least.  Saiers' work has aimed to go beyond critiquing money. He's also taken a stand against non-violent drug crimes by hanging football jerseys spelling out the first 100 or so digits of pi (the connection, in his mind, being that pi is an irrational number and arresting someone for smoking pot is similarly ""irrational"".)  However, this is his first piece related to bitcoin. While at first glance it might look like it, it's really not an anti-Wall Street art piece. The rat is art, after all, so it's really up to the viewer's interpretation.  But Saiers gives viewers a few things to think about. For one, he thinks the rat gets the bitcoin philosophy across in an easy to understand way. ""The sculpture's supposed to kind of reflect the spirit of Satoshi and what he's trying to do,"" Saiers said, adding that bitcoin's pseudonymous creator seemed to be ""against bailouts,"" like the one in 2008.  (When he or she first created and launched the cryptocurrency, they stuck a news clip of a bailout in the first block of the bitcoin blockchain, to be stored there forever, which many interpret as a criticism of banking and government ties.)  Saiers sees his art as a way for onlookers to learn about bitcoin and the Federal Reserve - both of them. ""They each have their strengths and weaknesses. Satoshi is obviously very talented. The Fed has lots of talented people as well,"" he said, not advocating for one or the other, even if they seem like conflicting  In short, he just wants people to just enjoy the silliness of it and maybe learn a thing or two.  ""It's art, so I hope they're entertained by it. It's informative, I hope people will learn [and] I'm hoping it'll at least help people understand bitcoin better and be kind of faithful to what Satoshi would have wanted,"" he said.  As for whether this could be achieved with a more attractive piece of art, Saiers seems most keen on making an impression. (""Bitcoin has left economics and has entered the public consciousness,"" Saiers argued.)  Similarly, people sure seemed curious about the rat, with many passersby snapping selfies with it already. When Saiers and his friends first put up it up, they accidentally put it on private land. The security guards chased them off to the public sidewalk. But they did so kindly, as they all ""got a kick out of the rat,"" he said.  Again, Saiers isn't expecting much controversy. Part of the fun (he believes) is that the art is ambiguous. In his mind, it's unclear whether bitcoin or the Federal Reserve is the rat.  Saiers sees one other interesting connection. Like Satoshi, the famous street artist Banksy is pseudonymous, and he speaks about rats very fondly.  ""They exist without permission. They are hated, hunted and persecuted. They live in quiet desperation amongst the filth. And yet they are capable of bringing entire civilizations to their knees. If you are dirty, insignificant and unloved then rats are the ultimate role model,"" Banksy wrote in his book ""Wall and Peace.""  Saiers thinks bitcoin might prove similar.  ""People have been mocking bitcoin, but now it's a $100 billion entity. It's been scorned, but will it play a role in dampening the importance of central banks and fiat currencies?"" Saiers said, adding:  ""I'm not saying it will! But that's why I chose a rat.""

42429798,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Inh,1539113400,Mastercard Patent Hints at Plan for Multi-Currency Blockchains,"Mastercard has won a patent for a proposed system that would allow for the launch of different kinds of blockchains – including those that support multiple currencies.  Published Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the patent explains that a group or company may need to store different types of transaction information on a single platform – something that is currently difficult to do on a single blockchain.  To counter this issue, MasterCard describes how a specific block-generation method for a permissioned blockchain can ensure that different blocks store different types of information.  The document, which was first filed in July 2016, explains that ""the transaction records stored in the blocks comprising a blockchain are often required to be of the same format and include the same types, and sometimes even sizes, of data.""  However, ""in the case of an entity that wants to use multiple types of blockchains, such as a different blockchain for several different currencies,"" that source might need to run multiple blockchain platforms, which in turn would require a large amount of computing power.  The patent goes on to explain:  ""There is a need for a technological solution to provide a partitioned blockchain that is capable of storing multiple transaction formats and types in a single blockchain, reducing the computing resources and processing power required for deployment and operation of the blockchain, while also providing for enhanced usage of permissions for permissioned blockchains.""  The patent adds that an appropriately partitioned blockchain can receive information about transaction types from different computing devices. Each partition, referred to potentially as a ""subnet"" by the patent, would store information about a specific type of currency or otherwise hold different types of information than the other subnets.  Among financial companies, Mastercard has become a prolific filer of proposed patents, all developed around various use cases of the technology.  For example, earlier this year, the firm scored a patent for a system that, as envisioned, would speed up cryptocurrency payments within a proposed system.

The company, which operates a daily news web portal and prints a bi-weekly magazine, is moving its content to a distributed ledger-based platform provided by Civil, according to a blog post from Civil co-founder Matt Coolidge on Tuesday.  As part of the partnership, Forbes will begin archiving aspects of its existing content on the platform, as well as working with the startup to ""experiment with new methods of reader engagement.""  Forbes senior vice president of product and technology, Salah Zalatimo, said the company is ""relentlessly focused on rapid experimentation and implementation"" to find how to draw in an audience, as well as how the journalism industry might look going forward.  He added:  ""Forbes and Civil believe passionately in the mission of journalism, and together we can provide audiences with a level of unprecedented transparency around our content. We'll also be able to expand the reach of our writers and identify new revenue channels over time.""  The experiment will begin next year, when Forbes begins publishing some article metadata to a blockchain platform. Should this aspect succeed for both companies, Forbes will move to publish all article metadata to Civil's platform, according to a press release. Essentially, Forbes will be storing proof of an article's existence on the platform.  Forbes writers and editors will see blockchain publishing tools integrated into its content management system (CMS), which will help streamline the process of adding such metadata – which includes an author's identity and some information about sources within a piece – to the company's platform.

In a blog post published Tuesday, the SpankChain team disclosed the hack, saying 165.38 ETH (worth around $38,000 at the time) had been lost at around 18:00 PST on Saturday. The intrusion, which the post said was made possible by a bug in the network's payment channel smart contract, also caused $4,000 in SpankChain's BOOTY token to be frozen.  It apparently took over 24 hours for the project to realize the hack had taken place, with the post stating:  ""Unfortunately, as we were in the middle of investigating other smart contract bugs, we didn't realize the hack had taken place until 7:00pm PST Sunday, at which point we took Spank.Live offline to prevent any additional funds from being deposited into the payment channels smart contract.""  Of the cryptos stolen, $9,300 worth of ETH and BOOTY belonged to users, and the remainder to the project. According to the blog post, full refunds will be ""sent directly to users' SpankPay accounts, and will be available as soon as we reboot Spank.Live.""  SpankChain warned of 2–3 days' delay ahead while its developers patch the issue behind the hack, redeploy a new smart contract and fix the other contract issues that were already being worked on. Limits on the use of BOOTY tokens have also been put in place temporarily.  So far, the team says, it seems the attack was due to a ""reentrancy"" bug, similar to the one that allowed a major hack of The DAO crypto project in 2016.  ""The attacker created a malicious contract masquerading as an ERC20 token, where the 'transfer' function called back into the payment channel contract multiple times, draining some ETH each time,"" the team said, adding that it will undertake an ""in-depth investigation of the attack"" in the coming days.  SpankChain further conceded it had decided not to pay for a security audit for the payment channel contract due to the costs involved, However, ""taking into account both the perception value and opportunity cost of the time spent reacting to the hack, it would have been worth it,"" the post says.  The firm concluded by pledging it would improve its security practices, ""making sure to get multiple internal audits for any smart contract code we publish, as well as at least one professional external audit.""

42429786,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1ITh,1539090030,Crypto Fund Wins License From Swiss Markets Watchdog,"Switzerland's financial markets regulator has issued a license to a cryptocurrency investment fund in a move that opens the door for wider institutional participation in the country's crypto activities.  Zug-based Crypto Finance AG announced on Tuesday that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has given the green light to its subsidiary, Crypto Fund AG, to legally act as an asset manager.  A search on the FINMA database shows that Crypto Fund AG – founded by former UBS banker Jan Brzezek in 2017 – is now authorized as a manager of ""collective investments"" under the country's Collective Investment Schemes Act.  With the license, the firm said Crypto Fund AG is now allowed to manage and distribute both domestic and foreign funds for investing in crypto-related projects. The registration as an asset manager arrives as an extension to another license that Crypto Fund AG received from FINMA in June which limited the firm's activities to merely distributing funds to qualified investors.  Brzezek said in the release:  ""The importance of crypto assets is growing and our aim is to accelerate maturity in these markets. Regulatory recognition remains highly sought after by participants, as seen in recent press and company statements.""  In recent years, Switzerland has proved popular with companies working with cryptocurrencies and blockchain, thanks to its relatively welcoming regulatory regime.  FINMA notably issued guidelines early this year that clarified when it would class tokens as securities and what crypto projects need to do to carry out ICO activities while remaining compliant.  In June, SIX, the primary stock exchange in Switzerland, announced it is developing a blockchain-powered trading platform to tokenize traditional financial assets and boost liquidity for institutional investors.  Meanwhile, SEBA Crypto AG, another Zug-based crypto startup (also founded by former UBS bankers), is seeking a banking and securities dealer license from FINMA, having raised $104 million in a bid to become a regulated crypto bank, as CoinDesk reported last month.

42429782,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1IVh,1539086345,Middle East's First Central Bank-Backed Crypto Exchange to Launch in 2019,"Two blockchain veterans are gearing up to launch what could be the first cryptocurrency exchange in the Persian Gulf to be licensed by a central bank.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Rain Financial has opened its public waiting list after a year in the Central Bank of Bahrain's fintech sandbox. Co-founded by Saudi blockchain consultant Abdullah Almoaiqel and Egyptian investor-turned-meetup organizer Yehia Badawy, along with their business partners Joseph Dallago and AJ Nelson, Rain aims to offer both a brokerage for retail crypto investors and an institutional platform along the lines of Coinbase Pro in Silicon Valley.  Although at least five other exchanges are also involved with the Bahrain sandbox – a regulatory program where applicants experiment in a closely supervised environment before graduating to full-fledged licensed businesses – Rain was the first to join in September 2017, and expects to launch in early 2019.  ""What is unique about Rain is they are the most advanced and the closest to graduating,"" Khalid Saad, CEO of Bahrain Fintech Bay, a non-profit co-working space for local startups, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""There's no cryptocurrency exchange in the region that is officially regulated. Hopefully, Rain will be the first one.""  Such an entity could conceivably encourage new capital flows into the crypto ecosystem from a part of the world rich in natural resources like oil and gas. As it stands, few Persian Gulf residents officially participate in the crypto markets, partly for fear of the sector's shadowy reputation (although Dubai has notably been a pioneer of ""smart city"" applications of blockchain technology).  Crypto-curious investors ""are waiting for the right regulations to be in place and the right partners,"" Rain co-founder Badawy said. ""We are here to fill this demand, with institutional-grade infrastructure.""  Intrigued by the potential of this largely untapped market, crypto veterans such as Cumberland Mining founder Mike Komaransky, Bitcoin Core developer Jimmy Song and BRD crypto wallet cofounder Aaron Lasher, have all invested in the Bahrain-based startup. (Rain would not disclose how much it has raised.)  Further, Rain has tapped Joseph Dallago, an alumnus of the crypto wallet startup Abra, to be its CEO.  Uphill battle  To be sure, the Dubai-based incumbent BitOasis has been facilitating bitcoin purchases since 2015, and is also a participant in the Bahrain sandbox.  But while BitOasis (which did not respond to several requests for comment) has focused on building an active user base among retail investors, the Rain founders have been meeting with institutional players throughout the region, from bankers to regulators, seeking their support.  They faced an uphill battle. Kuwaiti regulators have essentially banned institutional traders from working with cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority asserted in August 2018 that ""no parties or individuals are licensed"" to trade bitcoin in the kingdom.  ""The primary concerns with the regulators in Saudi Arabia is with unregistered entities,"" Rain co-founder Almoaiqel told CoinDesk. ""Some of the regulators are not aware that bitcoin payments are not really anonymous and there are ways to track these.""  After months of educating regulators about the know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering standards applied by Western exchanges, which it plans to follow, Rain says it has secured banking partners to allow fiat-on ramps in all the local Gulf currencies.  ""It's been a long journey educating our different regulators and partners,"" Badawy said.  But Rain has also been fortunate in that ""Bahrain is a really advanced and progressive regulator in the region,"" Almoaiqel said. And the sandbox environment allowed the company to show the Central Bank of Bahrain how it would operate while limiting the damage should something go wrong.  ""Whatever goes into a sandbox is designed to be small enough to fail, so that if it doesn't work out there is remediation available,"" noted John Collins, a partner at the advisory firm FS Vector in Washington, D.C. and former head of policy and government affairs at Coinbase.  Aside from giving startups ""a safe space to work with regulators,"" Collins said, sandbox programs around the world are creating ""regulatory bridges"" across jurisdictions, such as the cooperation between the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.  ""That's another added benefit, especially for crypto exchanges,"" Collins told CoinDesk. ""If you are able to be in a sandbox but interacting with any number of different regions at the same time, that is a uniquely good fit for a crypto product.""  'Pent-up demand'  Across the Gulf, crypto adoption has been slow to take root compared to Middle Eastern countries like Turkey and Israel. Yet Rain CEO Dallago told CoinDesk people in the Gulf often value universal assets, such as precious metals, far more than retail investors in Western markets.  ""We feel like the regional tastes really match up with the characteristics of bitcoin,"" Dallago said. ""There's a lot of pent up demand in the region.""  Further, Almoaiqel said, ""remittance is a huge use case here. The region has a high population of foreign workers."" Indeed, immigrants and expats reportedly make up more than half the population of the Gulf countries except Saudi Arabia.  Still, it's hard to say how much demand there really is given the precarious regulatory climate. The peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins facilitated just $266,634 worth of Saudi bitcoin trades the second week of September, volumes comparable to neighboring countries like the United Arab Emirates. This is a pittance in contrast to places like Argentina, which saw $6.9 million worth of LocalBitcoins transactions the same week.  On the other hand, many believe that broader education in the Gulf could tip this scale. So Rain's co-founders are organizing dozens of local bitcoin meetups from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia, including an event at the Bahrain Fintech Bay headquarters that attracted around 50 participants in July.  ""The point of these meetups is to educate people in the region about the benefits of digital currency,"" Almoaiqel said, concluding:  ""It's our duty to counterbalance all the negative news about cryptocurrency scams.""

42429801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Irh,1539082880,Cautiously Bullish: Bitcoin Price Clears Key Trendline to Pass $6.6K,"Bitcoin saw a low-volume bullish breakout Monday, but the long-awaited move is sending mixed signals to investors  The leading cryptocurrency cleared the trendline sloping downwards from the July 25 high and Sept. 5 high around midday yesterday, adding credence to the argument put forward by many, including billionaire investor Novogratz, that the market has carved out a long-term bottom around $6,000.  However, so far, the bullish trend change hasn't significantly revved up investor interest. This is evident from the fact that the total trading volume rose by a meager 15 percent yesterday, according to CoinMarketCap. More importantly, 24-hour trading volume is holding below $4 billion (near the yearly low so far).  Further, the follow-through has not been impressive either. By now, one would have expected BTC to be trading above last week's high of $6,741. After all, the breakout occurred after a prolonged period of low volatility action. Instead, it is trading at $6,650 at press time and is holding just above the trendline support (former resistance) of $6,630  Hence, there is merit in being cautious, despite BTC's move above the falling trendline.  Daily chart  As seen in the daily chart, BTC closed above the 2.5-month long falling trendline yesterday, signaling a bullish reversal.  However, the lackluster response to the upside break likely indicates that investors need a more credible evidence of a bullish breakout.  The cryptocurrency is likely to adopt a stronger bullish bias if it can cross the next key hurdle at $6,775 (upper Bollinger band) on the back of strong volumes.  Weekly chart  As can be seen, BTC has been struggling to find acceptance above the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) since mid-September. Therefore, BTC's upside break of the trendline, as seen in the daily chart, would look more convincing once the 10-day EMA is scaled.  View  BTC took a bullish turn Monday, opening doors for a rally to $7,000, but low volumes suggest caution is advised. The bullish move will look more legitimate if the 24-hour trading volume crosses $5 billion in the next few hours.  The outlook would change from cautiously bullish to strongly bullish if BTC can rise above the 10-week EMA at $6,712. As per the daily chart, a move above the upper Bollinger band of $6,775 would also bolster the bullish setup.  A UTC close back below the 2.5-month-long falling trendline would neutralize the immediate bullish scenario.  A break below the Oct. 3 low of $6,424 would put the bears back into the driver's seat.

The company said in an announcement Tuesday that it will start full-scale preparation to issue the stablecoin, called GMO Japanese Yen (GJY), in preparation for a move into the blockchain remittance and settlement business.  GJY will be issued to Asian markets in the fiscal year of 2019 via Z.com, a cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary launched by GMO as part of its wider efforts to move into the cryptocurrency business.  The firm added that the introduction of GJY to its crypto business would help GMO settle transactions since it also operates mining farms and recently launched a new web bank in partnership with Aozora Bank Group that will ultimately integrate blockchain technology for settling cross-border settlements.  GMO is the latest in a flurry of notable companies to have issued a stablecoin – a cryptocurrency that uses various methods to maintain a stable price – in recent months.  In July, IBM revealed it was working with the Stellar protocol on the launch of a U.S. dollar-pegged token. And, last month, crypto exchange Gemini, blockchain startup Paxos and crypto payments firm Circle all announced their own U.S. dollar-anchored stablecoins are now live for trading.  GMO won't be alone in offering a yen-pegged coin, either, as the founding partners of a $1 billion blockchain fund based in China also revealed plans to roll out a yen-anchored offering in mid-September. That launch is penciled in for the end of this year or early 2019.

Built as part of solarisBank's ""Blockchain Factory"" initiative, the partnership will enable Bitwala to offer banking services by way of solarisBank's German banking license, spokesperson Roman Kessler told CoinDesk.  The goal is to launch the service in mid-November, and Bitwala hopes to cater to those who already hold cryptocurrencies. Bitwala raised €4 million in new funding last month to support its efforts.  Thus far, according to the company, 35,000 users have pre-registered for the upcoming service.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Kessler stressed that ""we are a blockchain banking service"" and not a bank. That said, Bitwala hopes to get there one day, and is planning to seek a German banking license of its own next year.  Bitwala's partner has some notable backers, including Spain-based BBVA and card provider Visa. SolarisBank closed a €56.6 million Series B funding round earlier this year, according to TechCrunch, having been founded in 2016.  Kessler explained two aspects of solarisBank drew Bitwala to it: the ""fantastic technical platform that allows"" any company the ability to easily ""go in and plug your use cases"" into the solarisBank API, and the regulatory access vis-a-vis its banking license.  Indeed, solarisBank positioned itself as a possible partner for the crypto-industry through its Blockchain Factory effort.  And the solarisBank partnership helps Bitwala avoid some of the regulatory pitfalls it's encountered in the past. In January, Bitwala was one of several cryptocurrency companies affected when Visa Europe closed the account of its debit card issuer.  ""We are very proud to partner with solarisBank as we launch our new product.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said in an announcement on Tuesday that the two are testing the proof-of-concept as part of a blockchain project dubbed ""Making Money Smart.""  The goal is to introduce a blockchain token coded with smart contracts to the country's National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) so that participants and service providers can execute payments based on pre-defined conditions, such as who can spend certain funds by what deadline.  CSIRO went on to explain that the reason for selecting participants and service providers in the NDIS to run the trial is because participants of the scheme need highly ""personalized payment conditions.""  ""In the NDIS, participants have individualized plans that can contain multiple budget categories – each with different spending rules. The prototype app supports participants to manage their plan by enabling them to find, book and pay for services from NDIS service providers without the need for paperwork or receipts,"" the announcement explains.  Sophie Gilder, head of CommBank's blockchain innovation lab, added that the distributed network can share information of NDIS participants across different parties and automate transactions, which gives the government a higher visibility of money flows and helps reduce the costs for service providers.  The partners will release a further report for the Making Money Smart project in November, which will detail the designs, benefits, and limitations of the test with suggestions for other future applications.  The joint effort is the latest blockchain exploration conducted by the two groups. As CoinDesk previously reported, CSIRO announced it had completed a global test of its own blockchain network that claimed to be able to process 30,000 cross-border transactions per second.  The news also follows a recent report that CommBank worked with the World Bank Group to raise $81 million for a bond issued via a blockchain network developed by the bank.

42429795,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Ilh,1539057609,"To Scale Bitcoin, Little Improvements Will Need to Go a Long Way","Kaizen.  The Japanese word for ""improvement,"" and as it relates to business, it's the philosophy of continuous improvement on working practices. And with that as the tagline for the fifth edition of bitcoin engineering conference Scaling Bitcoin, it became a perfect way to summarize what's happening today among the cryptocurrency's developer ecosystem.  With the scaling debate coming to a head last year – and ending with a group of big block supporting enthusiasts breaking off to form competing cryptocurrency bitcoin cash and bitcoin getting the long-awaited code upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit) – this year's Scaling Bitcoin conference just didn't have the flair that perhaps past events had.  What seemed pulled from another piece of the kaizen philosophy – the notion of eliminating waste for a lean business – many of the talks over the two-day conference held at Keio University in Tokyo revolved around little updates that could make a big difference in terms of efficiency of the network.  From figuring out what to do with the vast amount of so-called dust (an output with tiny pieces of a bitcoin in them, small enough that the fees for sending eclipse the amount sent) on the network to fine-tuning the lightning network, Scaling Bitcoin seemed to present a much more relaxed and focused developer community.  Jameson Lopp, a bitcoin developer and engineer at bitcoin security startup Casa, agreed.  ""Most of the presentations were of small improvements that seem fairly likely to be implemented, which is arguably preferable to huge overhauls that promise significant improvements but add a lot of complexity and would be contentious,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Lots of small improvements add up over time too large improvements.""  Still, that doesn't mean the several hundred developers, academics and Japanese technology enthusiasts in attendance weren't reminded about the potential of the protocol.  During Keio University professor Jun Murai's opening keynote, he pointed out that in 2000, only 6 percent of the world population was using the internet, but by 2017, more than 54 percent of the global population was online.  ""When you are developing for the bitcoin scale, this is what you have to see and to think,"" Murai said.  Sweep up the dust  One area of small improvements that several presentations touched on was the massive amount of UTXOs, or unspent transaction outputs – especially those holding bitcoin dust.  For Sergi Delgado Segura, a cryptocurrency researcher at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the question is ""how many unspent outputs are actually worth spending; how much space is devoted to storing not-worth-spending outputs?""  Looking at the question with 110 satoshi's per byte in mind, according to Segura, about 50 percent of UTXOs are actually dust – meaning those pieces of bitcoin are unlikely to ever be spent.  ""This is nothing new; this has been going on since the beginning of the coin,"" he said, although, added: ""We are reaching a certain point where this is becoming a real problem.""  For instance, the same research was applied to litecoin and Segura found that almost 80 percent of UTXOs are dust.  This becomes a problem namely for user's ability to run a full node, especially in low resource devices (like general purpose laptops). By storing all these ""unprofitable"" UTXOs on the blockchain, full nodes must download and store all this data, even though it's nearly useless.  As bitcoin attracts more users, Segura said, the amount of dust-based UTXOs will grow, and it will grow unbounded because that's how the system was built. While Segura said that's not because anyone did anything wrong, there does need to be some real thought put into the proposals out there to mitigate this.  For one, Segura said, everyone should be consolidating outputs when fees are low – like they are right now. Secondly, a good coin selection algorithm, which decides which bits of date come together to create a user's bitcoin transaction, will also help.  There are other proposals for this problem as well.  For instance, Benedikt Bunz proposed using RSA accumulators, a cryptographic one-way function that answers a query about something without revealing all the individual data points that were used to come to that answer.  While Merkle trees have been utilized in the past to allow clients to check that an unspent UTXO is being used without sending the client the entire state of the blockchain, RSA accumulators could be a more efficient replacement.  During a Bitcoin Core (the most popular bitcoin software) developer meeting on Monday, October 8, Tadge Dryja, a developer and the co-author of the lightning network paper, proposed a similar thing.  Instead of RSA accumulators – which he said are ""unproven"" – he's working on a hash-based accumulator whereby the hash of each UTXO is stored, decreasing the amount of storage by half. Plus, instead of storing all the hashes of every UTXO, Dryja wondered whether storing some ""compact representation,"" or aggregated bundle of the UTXOs with their proofs would be less cumbersome.  According to Lopp, cleaning up the UTXO architecture has been discussed on and off for about six years, and hopefully, with the concept of accumulators, something can be implemented that's efficient.  Praise for layer two  As the lightning network gains momentum, it's no surprise that the layer-two scaling technology for pushing transactions off-chain got a significant amount of time.  On day two of the conference, lightning had its own category – representing three talks that covered rebalancing (or the idea of closing a channel after a number of transactions have been performed) of lightning network channels; lightning benchmarks; and incentivizing watchtowers, the entities responsible for watching lightning channels to make sure no fraud occurs.  But on top of that, other layer-two solutions got attention as well.  For instance, in the incredibly fast-talking style Olaoluwa ""Laolu"" Osuntokun has become known for, the respected developer and co-founder of Lightning Labs, spoke about payment channels more broadly.  And not only just a one-to-one payment channel but multi-party payment channels and channels upon channels.  One such topic was so-called ""channel factories,"" which Laolu defined as ""a layered set of transactions of intermediate transactions"" – so multi-party channels layered on each other, each with their own way of validating transactions.  He also spoke about route tunneling, or the ability to connect to users on other layers of the multi-party channel in order to create a specific channel with them.  Speaking about this idea, Laolu said:  ""It's sort of like a new dimension or a new underworld and you can tunnel them into the third dimension which I think is pretty cool.""  This, he said, could be used if, for instance, ""the liquidity wasn't sufficient for selling stickers or whatever is cool these days, I can advertise shortcut routes that tunnel through channel formation. We are able to create new channels in seconds to satisfy directional flow above ground.""  Other layer-two solutions that were touched on at the conference include statechains and a bitcoin bridge called Niji.  Speaking to another difference between this year's Scaling Bitcoin and subsequent year's, Lopp said, it was the focus on lightning and the idea that ""in general it is going to be easier to make changes to second layers because changes don't require the same level of consensus if at all.""
