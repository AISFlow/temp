42376984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwp5,1394838672,Icelandic Parliament Committee Holds Closed Session to Discuss Auroracoin,"Iceland's Parliamentary Economic Affairs and Trade Committee held a formal discussion regarding auroracoin in closed meeting on 14th March.  Auroracoin  is a digital currency based on the litecoin source code, and a portion of it will be provided for free to Icelandic citizens. It has experienced a remarkable surge in popularity as an alternative to bitcoin, passing litecoin in total market cap in early March for a short period. It is currently the number four digital currency by market cap.  Only political figures and central bankers reportedly attended the Parliament meeting, however, representatives of the digital currency were noticeably absent.  Auroracoin's  creator, Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson, told CoinDesk:  ""The Committee did not reach out to the auroracoin community or anyone involved in cryptocurrencies to my knowledge.""  The Icelandic media outlet Mbl.is has a story on the Committee's vice-chair Pétur Blöndal confirming that the session took place. An English translation of the article is available on the auroracoin forums.  Government Response  Iceland's Chairman of the Committee for Economic Affairs and Trade is Frosti Sigurjónsson of the ruling Progressive Party.  Sigurjónsson has been asking the Central Bank and the Financial Supervisory Authority to issue warnings about cryptocurrencies such as auroracoin, according to Óðinsson.  He says Sigurjónsson ""is a staunch and vocal enemy of bitcoin, auroracoin and other cryptocurrencies.""  On Sigurjónsson's website, he has a short blog post on auroracoin suggesting that the coin is a scam. At the end of the post, he writes, translated from Icelandic:  ""There is evidence however that this is a case of [a money] scam and illegal.""  ""They can make it illegal to own or trade auroracoin,"" said Óðinsson. ""However, they will never be able to control such a decentralized system, or stop Icelanders from using the currency, without turning Iceland into a police state.""  Sigurjónsson has been contacted for comment, and has not yet replied.  Speculation  Auroracoin was created as decentralized digital currency for the people of Iceland. Óðinsson, its inventor, is aiming to give Icelanders an alternative to that country's fiat krona denomination.  After the 2008 financial collapse, the banking industry in Iceland was mired in turmoil. The inflation rate of the krona shot to 18% by the end of 2009.  Óðinsson plans to give every one of Iceland's 320k people 31.8 AUR starting March 25 via an initiative he has dubbed 'AirDrop'. A web interface that has an online verification system using Iceland's personal identification will be used to dole out the coins.  Community  The purpose of giving premined auroracoin to Icelanders in particular is to build a community around the coin.  Another effort, called scotcoin is working on a similar effort. Scotcoin is giving everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 the opportunity to obtain its coins. At 980 million premined coins for Scotland's population of 3.5 million, each person would receive 280 scotcoins.  Fifty percent of the auroracoin's 10,619,651 units circulation is reserved for the Icelandic community. This likely led to AUR's price to speculate upwards of $45. It is currently trading at $21.  Many industry observers are eagerly awaiting what happens when auroracoin's 'AirDrop' commences, with some suggesting it could lead to a sharp decline in auroracoin's value should new recipients immediately cash out their coins.  Circulation, however, might be more important than price for auroracoin to remain strong. And at a current supply of just over 10 million, auroracoin still has a lot more coins to be mined. The total number of auroracoins is set to be 21 million.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story, and will post updates as they become known.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | AIRDROP,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/14/icelandic-parliament-committee-holds-closed-session-to-discuss-auroracoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3c0c49c7b7e7d62f4355815f41a2dc5a347a5a2-2019x1483.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Menufy  didn't make much of a fuss out of the news, however – the Coinbase deal was announced only on Twitter and reddit.  The company says its service is available in nearly 400 restaurants across 28 states.  The service is free of charge, so any restaurant that wants to enroll can do so freely, with no contracts.  Level playing field  Menufy develops e-commerce software and custom websites for each of its restaurants. The service is mobile-friendly and allows users to order and pay for food in a few easy steps, even if the restaurant in question doesn't have its own website.  The approach is rather clever, as most small restaurants still don't have their own e-commerce platform, and many don't even have a web presence.  Menufy lets small restaurants sell online without spending a fortune, and, as a result, helps level the playing field with big franchises that can afford to invest in such services.  Room to expand  The news doesn't mean that 400 restaurants have started accepting bitcoin directly, however, as Menufy handles the whole process through Coinbase.  The proprietors might not even be aware that they are accepting bitcoin payments – in the same way most people don't know they're using HTTP when they browse the Internet.  Though the 400 restaurant total sounds impressive, some relatively big states like California and New York are underrepresented.  Texas is not  , however, and Texans tend to love both a nice meal and bitcoin, so it's a match made in heaven, perhaps. Menufy says it is working to extend its reach to other states and expand its portfolio.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/14/menufy-now-supports-bitcoin-payments-at-400-us-restaurants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd3ac69c5c26a56a919f5a30cc23ac8bcb6561a5-1025x607.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376983,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwmZ,1394826623,Avalon ASIC's 40nm Chip to Bring Hashing Boost for Less Power,"A newly released report reveals details of Avalon ASIC's upcoming third-generation bitcoin mining chip.  According to the preliminary report, the 40nm ASIC – which Avalon is calling the A3233-Q48 – will have 7 GH/s of power per integrated circuit, which is a substantial performance increase from Avalon's previous 55nm node chip.  Furthermore, that boost will come with reduced power consumption because of the decreased node size – welcome news for miners struggling with high electricity bills.  The chip will come in a 7 x 7mm package, which has not changed from the second-generation version.  Smaller and shorter paths will endow the chip with lower power consumption, but increased heat density – hence the decision to stick with the same overall dimensions.  Avalon was the first company to manufacture and deliver ASIC chips for bitcoin mining, but it has experienced problems with shipment delays in the past, which they have tried to put behind them.  ASIC Evolution  When asked about the new chip, Yifu Guo, co-founder of Avalon, told CoinDesk:    ""[With the] last generation, we had 120 hash cores in the chip design, 1.5 GH/s per chip, 2 watts per GH/s, on 55nm standard cell design. This generation we have 768 hash cores, 7 GH/s per chip, 0.75 watts per GH/s, on a 40nm full custom design.""              The new chip will be able to hash much faster, while increasing power efficiency by a factor of 2.5. For comparison of specifications, Avalon's second-generation A3255-Q48 chip preliminary report can be found here.    Focusing on chips  Guo said that pricing for the A3233-Q48 has not yet been determined, but he made it clear that Avalon's focus is on selling quantities of ASIC chips to sophisticated buyers:  ""Pricing is not yet determined. We are focusing mainly on chip sales, and producing some of our design as prototypes to demonstrate the chips.""  The company currently has its second-generation chip available for 13 BTC per 2,500 units. At recent CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index valuations, that's around $8,200.  That chip operates out of the box at 1.2 GH/s, but it can be overclocked to 1.5 GH/s.  Avalon has also said it is publishing open-source designs for the chips on its GitHubhttps://github.com/BitSyncom pages to be used for different applications. A USB stick, 2U rack-mount blade and a PCI-e design will be available form factors.  The rivals  In comparison to Avalon's business model, some ASIC chip designers, like Butterfly Labs, only currently sell full mining units. BFL is currently attempting to bring its 600 GH/s 28nm Monarch blade to market, but has experienced delays.  KnCMiner  is also selling only complete miners. Its 20nm design has been taped out, making it the first SHA256 ASIC at that node. Taping out refers to last stage of the design process for an integrated circuit.  As for Avalon, Guo said he expects the bitcoin ecosystem to build complete miners with its chips.  The company is endeavouring to provide a low-cost entry into mining with its future chip designs.  Said Guo:  ""We hope the community will take up the production, [so] we can focus on engineering and improving chip design in generation four, while lowering the barrier of entry for mining.""  Turbo mode  The A3255-Q48 is able to achieve a 1.5-1.6 GH/s speed by overclocking from its typical core voltage of 0.9 volts to 1.0 V, with a maximum of 1.1 V.  Avalon will have overclocking, or 'turbo mode', results available soon for the third-generation chip, Guo says. This will exceed the 7 GH/s normal operating performance when at .75 V. The chip's core maximum, according to the report, is .9 V. Guo added:  ""This is [a] preliminary result. We will be releasing low-power performance mode data, as well as turbo mode data soon as results becomes available.""  The third-gen chip will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor, which has been Avalon's fabricator for all of its chips so far.  A release date for the A3233-Q48 has not yet been set, the company says.    Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of any of the companies mentioned.

The award was handed out at the Linux New Media Awards 2014, where bitcoin was named the 'most innovative open-source project'.  The open-minded, open-source community behind Linux has a soft spot for innovation, encryption and apparently privacy.  In addition to bitcoin, the audience also decided to hand out further awards to email encryptor GnuPG and the Tor project, along with developers' tool Git.  Most innovative of them all  Thousands of Linux enthusiasts and readers of leading Linux publications took part in the vote, reports Linux-magazin.de.  However, bitcoin received the distinction of being the most innovative open-source project. Open-source advocate Thomas Uhl praised the role of digital currencies and said he is a bitcoin user and a fan.  The award was accepted by Oliver Flaskämper from Bitcoin Germany GmbH, the company behind bitcoin.de.  Here to stay  Flaskämper said bitcoin.de is the biggest marketplace for bitcoin in Europe, and that the exchange is in good health – probably in an effort to distance himself from now-bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  He likened bitcoin to several online services that have transformed the online landscape in the past, such as Wikipedia and social networks, and suggested that bitcoin will revolutionise the global financial system.  This is not bitcoin's first tech accolade this year. Back in February, TechCrunch awarded it the Best Technology Achievement 2013 award, or 'Crunchie'. The award was accepted by Peter Vessenes, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation.  In its summary of the award, TechCrunch concluded that bitcoin is “almost mainstream” and that it seems likely it is here to stay.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/14/bitcoin-scoops-linux-media-award-at-cebit-2014,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a875ac10a75649c5e5efa522d92a5b12c897b062-1000x615.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425561,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Th,1394821433,Chamath Palihapitiya to Speak at CoinSummit San Francisco,"Noted early tech entrepreneur Chamath Palihapitiya has been added to the speaker list for CoinSummit San Francisco, an upcoming two-day, invitation-only event to be held on 25th and 26th March at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.  Palihapitiya, one of the largest individual bitcoin investors and a prominent early executive at Facebook and AOL, joins an already impressive lineup of industry talent that includes keynote speaker and early software pioneer Marc Andreessen; Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList; Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs; and Nejc Kodrič, CEO of bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.  Additional speakers include David Lee, partner at SVAngel; Tony Gallippi, CEO of BitPay; Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase; and Jackson Palmer, co-founder of Dogecoin.  Palihapitiya has emerged as one of the more credible investors advocating for bitcoin in recent months, memorably speaking out on the digital currency's behalf at TechCrunch Disrupt last October.The comments were seen by many as a key vote of confidence at a time when many in the mainstream were questioning whether bitcoin was a speculative bubble that would soon burst.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Palihapitiya said that bitcoin regulation is a topic he is eager to discuss at the engagement.  ""Figuring out how bitcoin efforts intersect with existing regulators and regulations is now front and center.""  Likewise, Palihapitiya suggested he would also appeal to the ecosystem to rethink its overall business strategy in order to appeal to more mainstream consumers.  ""We need to create a broader, diverse ecosystem of best-in-class point products versus Swiss Army knives. Xapo is a great example of deciding to do one thing really well. Once more companies do this, we will be able to appeal to a broader set of the world.""  The statements support TechCrunch's prediction that Palihapitiya would soon become ""one of the most prominent advocates for the digital currency"", a development that seems to be coming to pass with his addition to CoinSummit San Francisco.  What to expect  For the event, Palihapitiya will be interviewed by Brad Stone, a senior writer for Bloomberg Businessweek and author of The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon. Stone co-authored a feature on bitcoin which made the front cover of a January edition of Bloomberg Businessweek.  Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, Palihapitiya grabbed headlines when he estimated his personal bitcoin holdings to be worth $5m and suggested he would look to double or triple this investment.  Palihapitiya also suggested that he will continue to champion bitcoin as an investment at CoinSummit.  ""We will have some good tax policy and regulatory oversight that will allow more traditional financial institutions to participate in the ecosystem - irrespective of their view of bitcoin as a currency, commodity or other. BTC is at $10k next year.""  Palihapitiya focused much of the conversation on bitcoin as an investment, as well as the underlying technology, topics that are both likely to be on the docket for CoinSummit.  About Palihapitiya  Born in Sri Lanka, Palihapitiya is mostly known for his work at high-profile tech companies, beginning with ICQ Messaging, which was later acquired by AOL. Palihapitiya went on to work on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM).  Founder and partner at The Social+Capital Partnership, a Palo Alto-based VC fund made up of philanthropists and technologists, Palihapitiya notably invested $15m in Barry Silbert's alternative investment platform SecondMarket, which is working on launching a regulated bitcoin exchange in New York this year.  Further, he is the current owner of the Golden State Warriors NBA franchise, which has added credibility to rumors that the franchise may accept bitcoin soon.  As noted in his profile in BusinessWeek, Palihapitiya was integral in helping Facebook grow from just 50 million users to more than 750 million users.  Bitcoin users can only hope his support helps the digital currency achieve similar results.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/14/chamath-palihapitiya-to-speak-at-coinsummit-san-francisco,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b59cb7fdf99f08dec49b5fd5a13a138ae46766d2-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425551,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW29h,1394820484,Mt. Gox Issues Chapter 15 Statement,"Mt. Gox has filed a petition to protect itself in the US as it tries to reorganize.  The defunct bitcoin exchange said that a petition for Chapter 15 protection was filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas on 10th March, and a temporary relief order was issued the same day. The preliminary relief order is scheduled for confirmation on 1st April. The exchange stated:  ""This means that the effect of the Civil Rehabilitation applies now on a temporary basis to assets located in the United States which will be preserved. Accordingly, the acceptance by the US court of the Civil Rehabilitation means that any enforcement of a judgment against MtGox Co., Ltd, any attachment of its assets, the creation of any lien against its assets or the disposition of any assets located in the United States are temporarily no longer possible.""  In a chapter 15 filing, a representative of an insolvent foreign company with assets or interests in the US files for recognition in the US. It's designed to assist that representative in gathering assets, defending against litigation, or anything else that would help with with the foreign proceeding.    Chapter 15 Petition Filed by Mark Karpeles    This is an ancillary legal procedure, designed to complement what's happening in Japan. The Tokyo District Court has issued an order prohibiting any disposition of the assets of Mt. Gox. Assets located in the US will be used to repay creditors, so their preservation was necessary to ensure the civil rehabilitation progress proceeds smoothly.  A legal source close to the case suggested that what's happening in Japan is the rough equivalent of a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the US, designed to protect a company while it reorganizes. The chapter 15 filing here is designed to help with that.  ""The Japanese debtor needs assistance from the US court. Its foreign representative can file a Chapter 15 in the US,"" said the source. ""That filing asks for them to be recognized as the foreign representative, and grant them some relief. In this case they're asking to stay some lawsuits.""  Mt Gox was allowed to do this by its Japanese insolvency supervisor, on condition that CEO Mark Karpeles was the foreign representative for Mt Gox in the filing. His personal declaration is here:    Karpeles Declaration    Earlier this week the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago imposed a temporary restraining order and froze US-based assets controlled by Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles. The order is temporary, but the assets will remain frozen for at least two weeks.  Mt. Gox says a petition was made on 11th March in an effort to stop the proceedings of ""a lawsuit taking place in the US"" pursuant to chapter 15 and the petition was accepted.  The Chapter 15 petition explicitly states that one of the goals is to secure Mt. Gox assets in the US. The exchange has been sued by a number of customers in the US, and they are hoping the suit can attain class action status.  However, lawyers representing the plaintiffs believe Chapter 15 protection will not stop the suit from moving forward, as Chapter 15 protection only covers Mt. Gox KK, registered in Japan.

The comments follow Buffett's first statements on bitcoin on the network on 3rd March, when he suggested that bitcoin was not a currency, writing it off as a passing fad.  Buffett was similarly dismissive of bitcoin again in his latest interview, at least as an investment opportunity, advising investors to ""stay away from it"". He added: “It's a mirage basically.""  Buffett did however allude to the underlying technology of bitcoin as a payments network, comparing it to checks and money orders as a ""very effective"" and ""anonymous"" way to transmit money, adding: “It's a very fast money order"".  However, he also seemed to infer that were bitcoin to be used primarily for this purpose, its value would then be questionable, just as checks and money orders do not possess any value.  “I hope bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, [but] the idea that it has intrinsic value is a joke.”  Full statements  The bitcoin question that arose around the nine-minute mark was an aside to the larger conversation, though it did spark a brief roundtable discussion of bitcoin and its ledger technology.  In the interview, Buffett covered a range of topics from his $1bn prize for this month's NCAA college basketball tournament to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.  Buffett spoke more generally about investments too: commenting on the state of the US economy, as well as the investment benefits posed by stocks and bonds.  Influence  Though it's unclear from the statements how deeply Buffett has assessed bitcoin or its underlying technology, these statements are likely to have an impact in the financial community.  Buffett's influence is perhaps best summed up by his Investopedia profile authored by Richard Loth, who wrote: ""Buffett has yet to write a single book, but among investment professionals and the investing public, there is no more respected voice.""  However, accounts of his investment style suggest bitcoin would not be a high priority for Buffett, as he favors predictable earnings, understandable ideas and strong franchises.

""We are looking into that,"" Mark Wetjen, the CFTC's acting chairman, said at an industry conference. ""It's been initiated, there's been an internal discussion at the staff level.""  The CFTC, which regulates the swaps and futures market, is studying whether bitcoin falls under the same rules as commodities markets, according to Wetjen. He said:  ""I think people [within the CFTC] believe there's a pretty good argument that it would fit that definition.""  Issues remain  ""Then there's a separate question about whether or not there is some derivative contract based on, or denominated in, a virtual currency and whether that's listed on an exchange,"" Wetjen stated, adding that the issue remains to be looked at in detail.  Wetjen said he could not predict the outcome of the discussions or give a timeframe for regulation. The chairman has previously spoken out about cryptocurrencies. In a statement before the US Senate Committee he said:  ""Virtual currency [...] does present new risk, as a firm would be interacting outside of bank payment channels, increasing the risk of hacking or fraud, among other cybersecurity issues. The CFTC is working with registrants that are seeking to accept virtual currencies to educate them about best practices.""  Change of attitude  The comments follow New York State's recent decision to commence regulating bitcoin exchanges this week.  Referencing the collapse of Mt. Gox and other exchanges, New York’s Superintendent of Financial Services, Benjamin M. Lawsky, announced that the state is accepting applications for digital currency exchanges, with such submissions representing a formal commitment to the regulatory process.  Lawsky said that these businesses will be regulated under new New York regulation, anticipated to be in place by the middle of 2014.  Wetjen's comments seem to indicate that regulation is now very much on the horizon across the US as a whole, which will come as a relief to many bitcoin business that had complained of a lack of regulations to abide by.

When asked exactly how many bitcoins had been stolen, Godecki would not part with the specifics, replying: ""It's managable - it was only a part of our hot wallet.""  Community reaction  Meanwhile, the platform’s users have been discussing the incident on various Polish cryptocurrency forums, and a user’s account of what happened was published by local news site Niebezpiecznik.pl. According to the information obtained, the attack targeted digital currency worth several million dollars. The user said:  ""At about 09:34 am, someone placed an offer to buy bitcoins at PLN 5,000 per unit, for a total of at least PLN 94m, and after a while offers to sell for the same price were also made.”  As a confirmation of the presented account, a screenshot taken from the website prior to the shutdown by another user shows an offer to buy 18,978.5 BTC for the total amount of PLN 94.89m ($31.1m), which translates into roughly PLN 5,000 ($1,637) per BTC.  About Bitcurex  According to data obtained from Bitcoincharts on 14th March, Bitcurex had a 30-day volume of 18,359.3 BTC and PLN 36.61m ($12m). The platform’s six-month volume is 131,617.4 BTC and roughly PLN 229m ($75m).  The attack comes several weeks after Bitcurex released a statement designed to calm its users following the meltdown of Mt.Gox.  ""Out of concern for the safety of transactions made by our customers and their funds … we repeated a series of internal audits, as we always treat such incidents very seriously, regardless of how efficient our system is and how much we trust our solutions.”  It added: ""Bitcurex has always absolutely prioritized the safety of the service and the mechanics of its operation. This is why we always choose solutions that we are 100% sure [of], and it does not matter how much time and effort it takes to implement them.”  The incident is not the first attack to target a Poland-based bitcoin exchange. As earlier reported, in November 2013, Poland’s digital currency exchange Bidextreme.pl was hacked and its customers’ bitcoin and litecoin wallets were emptied.  The amount of digital currency stolen was not disclosed by the Polish platform, which was founded in 2013. Following the attack, the site was shut down by its owner and put up for sale for a minimum price of 170 BTC.  Set up in July 2012, Bitcurex is based in Łódź, Poland. The cryptocurrency exchange is operated by local company Digital Future Ltd.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/14/polish-bitcoin-exchange-bitcurex-targeted-by-hacking-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34bcbeba8c5800b9c8e0feefda2842ccb042fbaf-1000x735.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425591,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Hh,1394804027,"Iranian Government Could Move Quickly to Regulate Bitcoin, Reports Suggest","A new report from Fars News Agency has surfaced, suggesting that Iran's National Center of Cyberspace (NCC) may consider implementing regulation regarding digital currencies, possibly as soon as this year.  Founded in 2012, the NCC is a government body responsible for implementing policies created by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC), which oversees Internet issues. The organisation has been described as a major decision-making authority in the hardware and software fields.  Informal translations of the text  , corroborated by CoinDesk sources in Iran, suggest that the document provides an overview of bitcoin's benefits, noting that it is not controlled by governments, features irreversible payments and comes with very low transaction fees.  Statements from Saeed Mahdyoon, described in past reports as a telecommunications official with the Iranian government, indicate that the nation sees regulation as necessary, given that the world is quickly adopting digital currency payments and that the positive and negatives of their use are still unknown.  Further, he suggests high-level officials in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance and the Central Bank of Iran may be involved in the deliberations.  Community reaction  A spokesperson for Iran-based bitcoin exchange CoinAva suggested that the reports seemed credible given that the Fars News Agency has ties to the Iranian government. Though, he doesn't believe this is an accurate representation of the agency's internal thinking.  ""I see this news as testing the water to get feedback and reaction from other authorities in power rather than an official stance.""  Mor Roghani, CEO of Iran-based e-commerce business Persian Shoes, was more positive about the announcement, suggesting also that this won't be the last of Iran's statements on bitcoin. Said Roghani:  ""The fact that someone in the government has positive attitude toward bitcoin is fascinating. I think we will see more in the coming months.""  Bitcoin ecosystem  Though the current bitcoin ecosystem in Iran remains small, the country's population is predominantly young, meaning more than 50% of the population now uses the Internet.  Estimates from The Washington Post suggest Iran has the highest number of Internet users in the Middle East, and perhaps unsurprisingly, some of these individuals have become interested in bitcoin. The business sector remains small as well.  CoinAva launched in July, while merchants like Persian Shoes and independent musician Mohammad Rafigh are using bitcion as a payment tool to open up paths to new customers.  Notably, speculation on reddit centered on how bitcoin could potentially gain significant inroads given issues with the domestic currency, the rial. In 2012, the currency suffered from severe hyperinflation, though more recent reports now suggest the currency has stablized. Discussions also theorized bitcoin could help the country hedge against harsh sanctions imposed by other nations.  Bitcoin in the Middle East  Though on-the-ground reports are scarce, some companies and countries in the Middle East have acknowledged bitcoin, suggesting awareness may be small but growing. For example, Anghami, a streaming music platform serving the Middle East and North Africa, recently began accepting bitcoin.  The Central Bank of Jordan, the Bank of Lebanon and the Bank of Israel have also commented on digital currency regulation, with Israel and Lebanon issuing warnings to consumers and Jordan limiting its banks ability to work with the sector.

42425558,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Ph,1394800215,Macro Energy Shares Soar on Australian Stock Exchange Following Bitcoin Deal,"Shares of Australian investment firm Macro Energy gained 42% yesterday, after news emerged that it plans to enter the bitcoin space and raise A$9.1m ($8.2m) in funding.  Yesterday, the company announced the acquisition of Digital CC and its subsidiary digitalBTC, which runs a bitcoin mining operation and a trade desk.  The move will make digitalBTC the first bitcoin company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Macro Energy also announced that it has firm commitments from investors who are planning to invest A$9.1m in the consolidated company.  The money will be used to expand digitalBTC's mining and trading operations, as well as to develop retail bitcoin products such as mobile apps.  Zhenya Tsvetnenko  , the founder and chairman of digitalBTC, pointed out that the ASX listing will allow public market investors the opportunity to get involved in digital currencies.  Are institutional investors looking at bitcoin?  A number of leading names in the financial industry have started looking into bitcoin and several interesting reports have been published over the last couple of months. None of them will enter the bitcoin space anytime soon, but their interest has not gone unnoticed.  They are not keen on bitcoin as a currency, but rather as a cost-effective payments platform, especially for microtransactions and remittances. While the media buzz is still focused on speculation, questionable practices and volatility, the big players are looking at the Bitcoin protocol and the network.  Earlier this week Perseus Telecom announced the launch of a globally integrated bitcoin exchange and the Digital Currency Initiative. The firm is one of the leading providers of high-bandwidth communications used by trading firms around the world and it believes it can offer unparalleled security and speed, trouncing existing bitcoin platforms.  Movement on the regulatory front  Regulatory issues  remain the biggest concern for big investors who are reluctant to make investments in a completely unregulated market. However, the ball is finally rolling and New York State is leading the charge, spearheaded by New York’s Superintendent of Financial Services, Benjamin M Lawsky.  Lawsky and the NYDFS are working on no-nonsense regulation that could pave the way to the creation of New York-based bitcoin exchanges and a lot of headway has been made over the last couple of months.  The NYDFS bitcoin hearings in January were a step in the right direction and this week New York started accepting applications for digital currency exchanges.  However, the rest of the US might not be as keen to regulate and embrace digital currencies. The Texas State Securities Board has apparently informed Balanced Energy LLC to stop getting involved in bitcoin.  The company has also been accused of selling unregistered securities, so regulatory involvement may have a different background than some reports indicate, ie it has more to do with violating securities legislation than merely investing in bitcoin.  The regulator also pointed out that Balanced Energy has failed to disclose to investors the risks of using bitcoins to purchase interest in various investments. Extreme swings in the price of digital currencies could affect the amount of money available for business operations, the regulator warned.  According to the Austin American-Statesman, this is the first bitcoin-related cease and desist order issued in the US.  The company has been ordered to stop accepting bitcoin investments and selling unregistered securities.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/14/macro-energy-shares-soar-on-australian-stock-exchange-following-bitcoin-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8dd40226138880ac79be6b49148bd6046873fe6-1000x742.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425554,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Bh,1394796962,"Australian Tax Office Explains Bitcoin, Intends to Tax it","The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has provided businesses with some more guidelines on how it intends to deal with bitcoin, stating that income and profits derived from bitcoin transactions are taxable.  The letter, sent to an Australian bitcoin entrepreneur in response to a request made last June, was a private ruling to specific questions and noted its contents were valid only to that case. But it gives digital currency businesses in the country a better idea of how they should act to comply with tax regulations.  The first question asked if transferring bitcoins to a private company in return for shares would count as income, either ordinary or that from a for-profit undertaking. The answer was simply ""Yes"".  As to whether transferring bitcoins to another party would be subject to Goods and Services Tax (GST), the answer was also a one-word ""Yes"".  Bitcoin profits would also be subject to capital gains tax, though deductions depending on the individual case would apply.  Clear understanding  The letter also laid out a series of explanations showing the ATO has a fairly clear understanding of what bitcoin is, as well as the technology and processes behind it.  It acknowledges that bitcoin is ""based on an open source cryptographic protocol, which is not under the control of a central authority"".  According to the ATO's definition:    ""A Bitcoin is a numerical amount that is allocated to a ‘Bitcoin address’. A Bitcoin address is a long string of numbers and letters, each one unique. The process through which Bitcoins are created and enter into circulation is called Bitcoin mining.      Mining involves using freely downloadable Bitcoin software to solve complex cryptographic equations that essentially verify and validate blocks of Bitcoin transactions. The first ‘miner’ to successfully solving an equation receives a specified number of newly created Bitcoins as a reward to their Bitcoin address.    Accordingly, Bitcoins rely on a network of Bitcoin miners using the system to validate transactions and collectively implement a replicated ledger of Bitcoin transactions. The security of this ledger is protected by this mining process.    Bitcoins are circulated using a peer-to-peer computer network. Bitcoin users store their Bitcoins in a software program called a ‘Bitcoin wallet’.    A transaction involving Bitcoins requires an account, which is in essence a ‘public-/private-keypair’. A Bitcoin address derived from the public key is used to identify the account. To transfer Bitcoins to an account a transaction is created with the address of the account as the destination. To send Bitcoins from an account, the transaction has to be signed with the private key associated with the sending account.""    It also identified that participants in the bitcoin economy did so with the intention of making money, particularly those who mined:  ""You invested a substantial amount of money in computer hardware and advanced scientific computing systems with the purpose of making substantial profit from mining and selling Bitcoins.""  An ATO representative had said in early February that the department would publish guidelines on bitcoin for the current tax year, which ends in June. Transactions would be taxed according to their value in Australian dollars.  Permissive atmosphere  Australia has provided some of the more level-headed responses to bitcoin and bitcoin business so far. Compared to other nations, warnings from Australia's regulators have been comparatively mild and so far unofficial.  While the country's corporate banks have reacted in different ways, there have been no central bank moves to block those banks or other financial institutions from working with digital currency. There are no longer any government-owned banks in Australia.  So far the response has been similar to that of Singapore, which has also provided some guidelines on how bitcoin businesses should approach tax time.

42425565,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2bh,1394790056,Hong Kong's First Bitcoin ATM Goes Live Today,"Hong Kong's first bitcoin ATM opened earlier today at a cafe in one of the city's busiest pedestrian districts.  The ATM, a Lamassu one-way bitcoin dispensing machine, will be sited at Mr Bing – a cafe franchise that specialises in Beijing crepes or jianbing.  The launch took placeat 7:30am, within the franchise premises at 83 Wellington Street, just off Hong Kong's Central-Mid Levels escalator.  With such a public location, it will likely serve as an indicator of the Hong Kong general public's interest in bitcoin.  Competition  Just hours after the Mr Bing machine went live, local Hong Kong bitcoin exchange ANXBTC also launchedhttp://www.ntd.tv/en/news/science-technology/20140313/110616-hong-kong-company-launches-city39s-first-bitcoin-atm.html a similar machine, revealing a race was on to supply bitcoins to an increasingly aware public in the startup and financial hub. There are even reports that a third company, Alitobit, will unveil another ATM in the coming weeks.  Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin announced it would be shipping machines to Hong Kong back in early January, but it seems it has been beaten to the post by the simpler, smaller Lamassu version.  The special administrative region of China already has online digital currency exchanges like ANXBTC and Bitfinex, with others coming soon. Furthermore, ANXBTC opened a physical trading counter just a couple of weeks ago.  Ideal location  In densely populated Hong Kong, the Central-Mid Levels escalator is an 800-metre covered escalator and moving walkway system – the longest in the world – that carries 55,000 people a day, serving as a commuter transit system carrying city workers to and from their apartments.  The route has become a highly developed retail and restaurant precinct, and the Mr Bing outlet sees a high turnover every day.  The Beijing creperie – which was founded by New Yorker Brian Goldberg – was also present at Hong Kong's recent 'RISE:Bitcoin' event, which aimed to introduce newcomers to digital currency use in daily life and attracted over 100 interested attendees on the day.  The company launching the ATM, Bitcoin Group HK, was formed by five long-term Hong Kong residents who came together to find new opportunities for digital currency in the territory.  Should the first ATM prove successful, they will definitely be scouting out a location for a second machine.

42425553,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Dh,1394769854,Coins for Bands Hope to Disrupt Music Industry,"Altcoins targeting specific communities are starting to emerge. This month sees the introduction of two separate cryptocurrencies aimed at musicians. Songcoin and FUNK each take different political and technical approaches to helping the independent music economy.  Songcoin is the brainchild of Pimovihttp://doon.wpengine.com/, a subsidiary of Australian natural gas exploration firm The Chancellor Group.  Co-founded by Kasian Franks, who formerly founded now-defunct multimedia search firm SeeqPod, Pimovi is a digital entertainment company, eager to get involved in the cryptocurrency space.  Songcoin is designed not only to accommodate donations from fans, but also as a means of running contests and promotions – almost as a kind of loyalty points system that can travel between different bands and labels.  ""We decided that the first phase should be providing musicians with tip jars. Fans can acquire Songcoins and can use them to tip musicians, and then as the circulation increases, the value would increase and the musicians would have another form of revenue,"" Franks said. ""We would step in as a company and do everything that we wanted to do to support it.""  Pimovi, 61% owned by the Group, has some muscle behind it. It has Rax Saxena of Cisco Systems, and formerly of JP Morgan Chase, Bank Of America And PricewaterhouseCoopers, on its advisory board. On the technical side, it has Dylan Durst, described as one of the co-architects of namecoin, advising.  The architecture of the coin was originally to be based on namecoin, but Franks said that the firm switched to litecoin, before finally settling on bitcoin. Now, it's effective a bitcoin clone, with the same SHA-256 proof of work, reward block, and difficulty. Which begs the question: why wouldn't musicians simply use bitcoin instead?  ""The way I always answer that question is, why doesn't the world have one credit card? The world has hundreds or thousands of them, serving different industries,"" Franks says. ""They all build in incentives and various ways that their customers specific to their industries can benefit. We can use Songcoin to create further incentives for music fans.""  Franks says that this extends into running services atop the coin, partnering with musicians for contents and promotions, but also with ticket houses and merchandisers to provide discount sales.  A marketing play  This seems to turn it into a marketing play, rather than a technological innovation. Songcoin will be premined, with the premined proportion amounting to far less than 50%, said Franks, although Pimovi hasn't decided what proportion will be premined yet. The premine will be used for initial giveaways to promote the coin (known as 'faucets', in the cryptocurrency world).  But Franks maintains that bands are interested. He will work with the Merlin Group, he says, which represents many indie labels, and he already claims to have one large band interested.  Naturally, Franks sees big things ahead for the coin. ""We are closely watching Auroracoin with its $230 million market cap along with its distribution designed for Iceland's population. We see the music listening population as being much larger obviously,"" he said.  He begins the premine in a week, and expects to provide wallets on Windows, OSX and Linux in around two weeks. Miners will be able to begin mining around then, too.  While Franks is using the bitcoin source for Pimovi's coin, Simon de la Rouviere has chosen a Scrypt-based mechanism for his. De la Rouviere, co-founder of bitcoin-based digital content sales site Min.io, has launched the Cypherfunks, a network of musicians with its own cryptocurrency, called the FUNK.  Anyone can join the Cypherfunks, says de la Rouviere, who describes participants as a ""decentralized band"". All musicians have rights to everything produced, and it can remixed and shared by participants in the collective. It is essentially crowdsourced, open sourced music.  The currency, like Songcoin, will be used for musician tip jars, and can also be used for donations. If members of the collective want to mount a project or play at a venue, then others could donate the cryptocurrency to help.  Venn diagrams of crypto currencies  De la Rouviere has his own argument for why musicians shouldn't simply use bitcoin.  ""Each cryptocurrency encompasses its own network, acting as stock in that network,"" he said. ""So if it is a new project that can't necessarily fully fit into another cryptocurrency, it is better to create a new currency for it. Think of it in terms of venn diagrams: each cryptocurrency overlapping with others.""  The coin will have a two-minute block time, and will initially distribute 100,000 coins per block, an amount that will be halved every year for four years. From year 5 onwards, the block reward will be fixed at 5000 per block, and there will be no cap on the number of FUNKs.  ""The infinite supply decision was difficult to make, because it untested at the moment. The reason for it was that if the coin also acts as stock in the idea, there might not be enough transactions in the future for the miners to sustain themselves just on transaction fees,"" de la Rouviere said.  The coin will not be premined, he said. ""Everyone needs equal stake in the idea for it flourish fully.""  De la Rouviere also sees potential for micropayments with the cryptocurrency, which will be traceable in and outside the Cypherfunks community, and he is working on various micro payments schemes, including a project based on PayFile, a micro transaction system initially developed by bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn.  This would allow users to pay for files downloaded on a per-kilobyte basis. ""This could work well for things like streaming of MP3s,"" he said, ""but the jury is still out whether users would want to do it this way.""  In any case, members of the collective are all supposed to own the music, which makes micro payments a bit tricky, unless it's donation-based, he points out.  ""An idea is for each song sold (in say BTC or Doge), it is used directly to buy up FUNK on the market and then donate that FUNK to either projects within the community or just directly to the miners (as tx fees).""  The emergence of two musician-focused coins in the same month shows opportunity for a disruption in the independent music economy. With altcoins sprouting weekly and all of them targeting different communities, we're sure these won't be the last.
