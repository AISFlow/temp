42378652,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwwp,1457118824,Bitcoin Price Dips Closer to $400 Following Network Disruptions,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  While the bitcoin network’s capacity challenges have been generating substantial visibility, the digital currency enjoyed robust trading volume this week, with market participants transacting more than 28m BTC in the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 4th March.  Likewise, bitcoin's price was relatively stable, falling less than 1% heading into 12:00 UTC on Friday. This figure increased to 3.3% as the price deflated to $409 by 23:59 UTC, figures from the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveal.  This figure was $10 higher last week when bitcoin traded at $421.01 at 00:00 (UTC) on 26th February. The relatively modest decline was comparable to movements from week before, when bitcoin climbed only 1% after fluctuating between $410 and $450.  Still, the digital currency experienced sharp gyrations this week amid news that the network was exceeding its capacity for transactions, a development that resulted in users paying sometimes substantially higher fees.  Overall, volatility was tight this week, as bitcoin enjoyed gains on 26th February, rising 2.9% to $431.69 by 23:00 (UTC). The currency hit a local peak over the next few hours, reaching $434.14 by 02:00 (UTC) on 27th February.  Bitcoin then dropped within the next 24 hours or so, hitting $422.07 at 01:00 (UTC) on the following day. This represented a 2.8% decline.  This volatility continued, as the digital currency surged to $440.48 by 10:00 (UTC) on 29th February, 4.4% higher than the low of $422.07 bitcoin encountered early the day before. The currency quickly lost some of these gains, depreciating to $431.26 at 07:00 (UTC) on 1st March.  Bitcoin continued to waver between $420 and $440, before reaching $419.56 and then $416.30 at 00:00 (UTC) and 05:00 (UTC) on 3rd March.  For the remainder of the week, the currency largely fluctuated between $415 and $425, before ending under $410.  Blockchain doubts  The price dip could be considered small, however, given the mounting uncertainty surrounding the future of the network.  Recently, bitcoin generated substantial media attention as users faced both longer than average wait times and in some cases, sharply higher fees. As the blocks on the blockchain filled, potentially due to the actions of a single disruptive entity, a backlog of transactions awaiting processing developed.  This problem has persisted as bitcoin enthusiasts are locked in a debate surrounding how to address the steadily deteriorating space.  While one group, Bitcoin Core, has been working on a solution that would increase capacity by reworking how signatures are stored, Bitcoin Classic has published code that would double the transaction capacity of the blocks.  As developers and market observers work toward a solution, users are running into challenges associated with fees.  Because of these challenges, some transactions are going unprocessed, and others are being severely delayed, issues that may have affected overall sentiment even if it did not affect price.  Since exchange users must pay to send bitcoin deposits to exchanges, users who paid fees that were too low may have seen deposits rejected.  Representatives of some exchanges, however, said this may have mainly affected operations at industry businesses, which need to pay extra fees when sending users bitcoin funds in withdrawals.

42378641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwiz,1457113089,Pastor Charged With Taking Bribes from Defunct Bitcoin Exchange,"A New Jersey pastor and former credit union executive has been indicted for allegedly taking bribes from the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Coin.mx.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Coin.mx operators Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev were arrested last summer and charged with running an illegal money services business.  Prior to its closure, Coin.mx functioned by way of a so-called “Collector’s Club”, in which customers were considered members of a private organization. Prosecutors allege that this structure was used to obscure the nature of the exchange.  Pastor Trevón Gross, named in a superseding indictment unsealed yesterday, is accused of taking bribes worth more than $150,000 in exchange for allowing the takeover of New Jersey-based Hope Federal Credit Union. Coin.mx staff, including Lebedev, were allegedly placed on the board of the credit union after the bribes were made.  The indictment alleges:  “Trevon Gross, the defendant, who was the Chairman of the Board of Hope FCU, allowed Murgio, Lebedev, and their co-conspirators to take control of t Hope FCU and assisted their efforts in exchange for bribes which Gross directed Murgio to pay to bank accounts under Gross’s control.”  Gross has been charged with one count of corruptly accepting payments as an officer of a financial institution, and if convicted could face as many as 30 years in jail. The trial is set to begin on 31st October.  Gross is currently listed as the the CEO and pastor of Hope Cathedral, which is based in Jackson, New Jersey, according to his LinkedIn profile. He turned himself into FBI custody on Thursday morning, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  According to federal prosecutors, the credit union was used as a means of avoiding scrutiny of bitcoin transactions on the Coin.mx exchange, which the government has alleged was a vehicle for international money laundering.  The National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency that oversees credit union activity in the US, moved last November to liquidate Hope FCU after placing it in receivership a month prior.  As we reported at the time, the investigation and subsequent indictment against the Coin.mx operators also made connections to a string of cyberattacks of major financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase, though those allegations are not included in this particular case.  The full superseding indictment can be found below.    U.S. v.

42378635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwch,1457107214,Arizona Congressman Supports Blockchain 'Revolution' at DC Summit,"Once viewed with fear and uncertainty by lawmakers, bitcoin and blockchain technology were heralded as innovations by US Congressman David Schweikert (R-AZ) at an industry conference yesterday.  The inaugural DC Blockchain Summit, produced by industry trade group the Chamber of Digital Commerce and held in Washington, DC, saw Schweikert and Natalee Binkholder, deputy chief of staff for Congressman Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), speak openly about the technology for the first time.  Representative Schweikert, in particular, presented an optimistic vision for blockchain, discussing how the technology could bring ""unbankable"" people across the world into the global economy.  Schweikert told the audience:  ""This is going to create a revolution. It's so much more than moving microcurrency.""  Throughout the day, panelists and attendees alike took the event as an opportunity to further dialogue about blockchain tech between the government and private sector professionals.  Schweikert identified himself as a vanguard in DC for his early advocacy of cryptocurrency, noting that he was the first to mention the term 'bitcoin' on Capitol Hill. Calling out the knowledge gap between technologists and policymakers, he encouraged the audience to help ensure the blockchain did not fall victim to ""control freaks"" who may harbor misconceptions about the technology.  Standing in for Congressman Mulvaney (who was scheduled to speak but cancelled due to illness), Natalee Binkholder remarked that the Congressman is a ""key advocate"" for blockchain and had planned to give a ""high-level regulatory speech"" about it.  Despite the impromptu nature of her appearance, she communicated Mulvaney’s message, stating: ""The blockchain regulates itself"".  Politically aligned with Representative Schweikert, Mulvaney is evidently more interested in fostering development than in creating barriers that may prevent unforeseen breakthroughs.  Binkholder also noted that he’s in it for the long haul: ""Mick would like to be a leader in this regulatory space,"" she said, indicating that when Congress is called to act, he’ll be on the front lines.  Broader benefits  In the first keynote speech, innovation expert and author of ""Blockchain Revolution"" Don Tapscott struck a visionary tone.""The technology genie has been released from the bottle,"" he said, comparing blockchain tech’s disruptiveness to that of the early web.  Remarking on the digital revolution's financial impact, he stated that although technology may have contributed to economic growth, the number of jobs has not necessarily increased with it.  The value-distributing model of blockchains might even this asymmetric development, he said. He went on to clarify that blockchains do not re-distribute value, but rather can be harnessed to financially assist individuals across the world.  Singling out cases such as musician Imogen Heap's initiative to create a blockchain for musicians and Suber, a concept for a collectively-owned Uber, Tapscott noted that blockchain’s wide variety of applications can help create a ""true"" sharing economy.  As his speech drew to an end, he mentioned the ideal of ""collective self-interest"" multiple times, implying that blockchain tech can and should aid private interest to the greater benefit of society.  Technology debates  The first panel session introduced the audience to smart contracts, a technological advancement that’s been steadily gaining traction among startups and industry leaders.  Vitalik Buterin offered his own snappy, one-line definition of 'smart contract': ""a computer program that protects an asset,"" the Ethereum inventor asserted, before the panel turned to its various use cases.  Panelists soon touched on a well-worn blockchain debate: the question of private versus public blockchains. The overall consensus was that the notion of the argument sets up a false dichotomy.  Speakers agreed that there are benefits and drawbacks to both, and although private chains may feel more comfortable (and be more marketable) to certain businesses, there are unique advantages to the openness of public chains.  This panel was followed by a keynote address from Chain CEO Adam Ludwin, who spoke about why institutions are beginning to develop their own blockchain databases.  Ludwin's company Chain provides enterprises with a blockchain platform, and he was enthusiastic about its variety of uses and encouraged creative thinking about how blockchains can be used.  Regulatory concerns  The business buzz was soon tempered by a panel on law enforcement.  Featuring members of The Blockchain Alliance, a public-private forum created to combat criminal uses of virtual currency, panelists noted the willingness of blockchain companies to comply with government agencies.  ""The level of outreach and coordination is eye-opening,"" said John Beccia, chief compliance officer and general counsel at Circle.  The FBI's C Alden Pelker went on to note that ""there’s nothing inherently illicit about bitcoin,"" though peer-to-peer exchange seemed to elicit anxiety among speakers, particularly international transactions. Noting that some countries ignore virtual currency altogether, Homeland Security Investigations' Kevin Abar spoke of a need for laws to be developed across international boundaries.  On the subject of general compliance with crime-prevention agencies Coin Center’s Jerry Brito indicated that blockchain enterprises are “trying to prevent another Apple vs FBI.”  A later panel found Bill Hartnett of Citi indicating that they were getting ""more questions than answers"" from regulators thus far. At this point “it’s more about education,” said Dominick Paniscotti, associate vice president of Nasdaq.  Indeed, dialogue with federal agencies, clarification, and technological experimentation seemed to be more on the minds of financial service professionals than concerns over regulation, at least for now.  IBM, Digital Asset take stage  The Summit then turned back to business, with Blythe Masters offering a ""fireside chat"" moderated by Chamber of Digital Commerce founder Perianne Boring.  Masters, who is CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, reflected on her career at JPMorgan and the unique opportunities and challenges of working in financial tech.  ""I wouldn’t have left a highly regulated industry to work for a startup that sells products to a highly regulated industry if there weren’t a way through the regulatory maze,"" she said.  Masters and Boring also discussed the need for greater gender diversity in FinTech, with Masters emphasizing that education is critical if young women are to become more actively involved in the industry.  The closing keynote was given by Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research. Krishna took the opportunity to reaffirm IBM’s leadership role in blockchain enterprise solutions, stating that the Hyperledger Project has received ""the biggest response ever for an open source project"".  Later, Don Tapscott offered closing remarks that drove home a unified message to both government officials and industry professionals, concluding:  ""Leadership isn’t necessarily from the top. Leadership is everybody’s opportunity.""

42378646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwpH,1457099449,Japan Proposes Definition for Bitcoin in Bid to Regulate Exchanges,"Members of Japan's national Diet, its bicameral legislature, proposed changes to current legislation today to include a definition for virtual currencies under domestic law.  According to Nikkei, the definition reportedly sought to emphasize their ""asset-like values"" and use in online payments. The text reportedly suggests bitcoin's similarities to fiat currencies such as the US dollar and yen, though, according to Reuters it has been defined as ""property value"".  The change, if passed, would mean digital currency exchanges would have to register with Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's top financial regulator, a move that lawmakers believe will increase oversight of the industry and guard against the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing.  The FSA has been considering the introduction of regulation for digital currency businesses for months. Such conversations have been informed by the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt Gox, then the largest bitcoin exchange in the world.  Following alleged mismanagement and hacking, the firm's global creditors lost total claimed deposits worth around $2.3bn, according to the appointed bankruptcy trustee.  Today's revised legislation also follows calls for cryptocurrency regulation from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – an international organisation that aims to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.  According to a report by NHK Worldhttp://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20160304/k10010430991000.html, the draft amendment will now pass to another Diet, or parliament, session, which will seek to enact the changes before May.  Yuzo Kano, CEO of Japan-based bitcoin exchange BitFlyer, said that, more specifically, the law will now pass to the lower and upper houses of the legislature for review.  Should the proposal be passed, he said exchanges would need to separate client and company assets, regularly audit their finances and satisfy anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.

42378645,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7kwo1,1457096421,KPMG: Blockchain Could Be ‘Antidote’ to High Cost of Regulation,"As institutional interest in blockchain technology increases with bullish market predictions, professional services firms have been among a new wave of companies seeking to adapt existing products and services for the market.  To date, Deloitte and PwC have been perhaps the most aggressive in the space, with the former releasing a blockchain software platform called Rubix, and the latter recently launching a comprehensive Blockchain Solution Portfolio aimed at assisting enterprise clients.  While more quiet than its peers, 'Big Four' professional services firm KPMG is pushing ahead in the industry, adding a blockchain component to its existing line of consultancy services as it moves to court client business.  In a new interview, the firm explained it now believes the technology could come be the ""perfect antidote"" to the increased burdens financial regulators have placed on its clients in the wake of the financial crisis.  Eamonn Maguire, managing director of financial management at KPMG, told CoinDesk:  ""From a perfect storm point of view, having suffered for years from regulation and overhead, this is potentially a light at the end of the tunnel that gives clients relief from costs.""  Today, KPMG estimates it has between 60 and 70 professionals contributing to a global steering community that unites Asia-Pacific, European and North American employees in discussion on blockchain strategy.  These professionals, in turn, help advise clients interested in designing and implementing use cases for the technology, with KPMG focusing more on front- and back-end design, and testing as opposed to coding, he said.  Maguire voiced his belief that this investment of resources is necessary given that blockchain could ""transform"" the way things are done for its clients.  ""Compared to cloud or data and analytics, blockchain technology has the potential to be much more revolutionary in creating new solutions which don’t exist in the marketplace today,"" he said.  This opinion was echoed by KPMG managing director of financial services strategy David Montes, who alluded to the technology’s potentially broad impact:  ""Blockchain tech has the potential to impact all three of our core businesses – advisory, tax and audit.""  Reinventing regulation  A common theme in the conversation was regulation in the blockchain space, with KPMG discussing how this remains a concern for clients, even while global government agencies voice an interest in harnessing blockchain to better police the world’s markets.  Though a promising trend, KPMG believes that regulatory applications of blockchain will need to be developed over time. As of now, Montes believes this means working to ensure know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) considerations can be applied in a blockchain environment.  ""We think at later points, we'll see other regulatory initiatives being built into blockchain solutions that are built for Dodd-Frank and components of the Volcker Rule that influence all types of trading,"" he said.  Estimates suggest that any cost savings here would be of benefit to financial institutions. Research from American Action Forum has suggested banks have so far paid $24bn and allocated 61 million employee hours to comply with Dodd-Frank, passed in the US amid outcry over the financial crisis.  Even smaller banks have been hit with added burdens, with 83% reporting their compliance costs had escalated by 5% following the rule, according to Mercatus Center.  KPMG sees three generations of regulatory upgrades being potentially propelled by the technology, with elements such as counterparty identification, qualification and AML being addressed by 2017.  Sizing up the opportunity  Overall, the KPMG team is impressed with the capabilities of available blockchain technologies, even if the firm itself is seeking to be agnostic in its services, focusing on 'blockchain' as opposed to bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple or other specific forms of the technology.  Both Montes and Maguire alluded to the mounting hype around the technology, but maintained that there are immediate business problems that it can solve.  KPMG contends that the most immediate is in internal office processes, such as the automated calculation of daily profit and loss (P&L).  ""In an ideal world where we begin to solidify the stability of early forms of blockchain, we’ll see other things being built into the blockchain. In later generations, we expect to see middle office processes getting built in that will result in increased automation and the decommissioning of more manual processes,"" Montes said.  The ability of blockchain-based systems to scale to address market demand was one such factor that the KPMG team believes could temper excitement.  For example, Maguire explained that high-volume use cases for blockchain have the greatest ability to cut costs, but that they will likely be delayed by additional complexity.  He predicts that financial institutions will likely prioritize low-volume use cases in an effort to build comfort with the technology, both among its internal divisions and consumers.  ""By having early successes with more limited use cases, you can prepare the groundwork for use cases that are higher volume,"" he said.  Maguire cited Nasdaq’s private markets product Linq as one such example, stating that more projects of its size and scale will likely be released in 2016.  KPMG's approach  As for future developments, KPMG suggested that it is likely to continue to focus on consulting clients looking to tap into the technology and its potential efficiencies.  Montes added that KPMG is also unlikely to form alliances with specific solutions or solution providers, seeking instead to position themselves as advisors that can be more neutral in its recommendations for clients.  ""Regardless of the use case, whether it’s focused on payments, loans or a post-trade application, we see our role as being trusted advisors, who use our expertise in financial services to enable our clients to make the best decisions for their use cases,"" he continued.  Though short on details, Maguire said that KPMG is working on projects with clients that may find it announcing additional news soon.
