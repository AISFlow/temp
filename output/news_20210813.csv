The price of ADA has seen increasing growth in the market. After crashing down close to $1, the digital asset has now bounced back up to reclaim its place on the market charts. The price dips from the last two months have not seemed to have had much of an effect on the price of the digital asset, as the price has now come back up above $2 as if it had not been struggling before.

42424733,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKXh,1628888761,What Does Liquidation Mean and How to Avoid It?,"The crypto market’s high volatility means liquidations are a common occurrence.      Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are renowned for being high-risk investments prone to extreme price swings. But while this volatility makes them a concern for regulators, it also presents an opportunity for investors to generate significant profits, particularly when compared to traditional asset classes like stocks and commodities. Over 2020, amid the coronavirus outbreak, bitcoin ended the year up 160% versus the S&P 500 at 14% and gold up 22%.      Adding to this volatility is the potential to increase the size of crypto trading positions through the use of derivatives products like margin trading, perpetual swaps and futures. Derivatives are contracts based on the price of an underlying asset and allow people to bet on the asset's future price. Crypto derivatives first appeared in 2011 and have gathered huge momentum in more recent years, especially among gung-ho retail investors looking to get the most out of their trading strategies.      With margin trading, traders can increase their earning potential by using borrowed funds from a cryptocurrency exchange. Binance, Huobi and Bitmex are some of the leading examples of centralized crypto exchanges that allow customers to trade on margin.      But there’s something very important to note here. While borrowing funds to increase your trade positions can amplify any potential gains, you can also lose your invested capital just as easily, making this type of trading a two-edged sword.    What is margin trading?    Margin trading involves increasing the amount of money you have to trade with by borrowing third-party funds. Think of it as borrowing money from a stranger to buy bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. But in this case, you are borrowing from a crypto exchange. This allows investors to increase the size of their trading positions, also known as “leverage.”      Naturally, a stranger would not lend you money to trade for free. Similarly, in margin trading, the exchange will require you to put up an amount of crypto or fiat as collateral – known as an “initial margin” – in order to open a trading position. This initial margin is like an insurance fund for the exchange in case the trade goes against the borrower.      It is also worth mentioning that the amount of money you can borrow from an exchange relative to your initial margin is determined by the leverage. For example, if you use a 5x leverage on an initial margin of $100, you will be taking a $400 loan to increase your trading position from $100 to $500.    Read more: Crypto Options Trading, Explained    Each trade has the potential to make or lose more money depending on the size of the leverage. For instance, using the 5x leverage example above, if the price of an asset rises by 10%, you will make a profit of $50 on your $500 trading position, which represents a 50% profit relative to your initial $100 margin. You could then repay the $400 loan you took out and keep $150 for yourself ($50 profit + $100 initial margin.)      However, if the value of the cryptocurrency you’re trading drops by 10%, you would have lost $50 from your initial margin (50% loss.)      There is a simple formula to calculate your potential profits/losses when using leverage.      Profit or Loss = (Initial Margin) x (% price movement) x (leverage)      For clarity, use “plus” to represent positive price movements and “minus” for negative price movements. In general, remember that leverage is how much your initial margin can gain OR lose. Ensure you keep your potential losses to manageable levels.    What is liquidation?    In the context of cryptocurrency markets, liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.) Liquidation occurs in both margin and futures trading.      Trading with a leveraged position is a high-risk strategy, and it is possible to lose your entire collateral (initial margin) if the market makes a large enough move against your leveraged position. In fact, some countries like the United Kingdom consider it so risky it has banned crypto exchanges from offering retail investors leveraged trading products to protect novice traders from being liquidated and losing all their invested capital.      You can keep track of the percentage the market needs to move against your position it to be liquidated by using this formula:      Liquidation % = 100 / Leverage      For instance, if you use 5x leverage, your position will be liquidated if the price of an asset moves 20% against your position (100/5 = 20.)    How to avoid liquidation    When using leverage, there are a handful of options available to mitigate the chances of being liquidated. One of these options is known as a “stop loss.”      A stop-loss, otherwise known as a “stop order” or “stop-market order” is an advanced order that an investor places on a crypto exchange, instructing the exchange to sell an asset when it reaches a particular price point.      When setting up a stop loss, you will need to input:    Stop price: The price where the stop loss order will execute  Sell price: The price at which you plan to sell a particular crypto asset  Size: How much of a particular asset you plan to sell    If the market price reaches your stop price, the stop order automatically executes and sells the asset at whichever price and amount stated. If the trader feels the market could move quickly against them, they might choose to set the sell price lower than the stop price so it’s more likely to get filled (bought by another trader.)      The primary purpose of a stop loss is to limit potential losses. To put things in perspective, let’s consider two scenarios.      Scenario 1: A trader has $5,000 in his account but decides to use an initial margin of $100 and leverage of 10x to create a position of $1,000. He places a stop loss at 2.5% from his entry position. In this instance, the trader could potentially lose $25 in this trade, which is a mere 0.5% of his entire account size.      If the trader does not use a stop loss, his position will be liquidated if there is a 10% drop in the price of the asset. Remember the liquidation formula above.      Scenario 2: Another trader has $5,000 in his trading account but uses an initial margin of $2,500 and a 3x leverage to create a position of $7,500. By placing a stop loss at 2.5% away from his entry position, the trader could lose $187.5 in this trade, a 3.75% loss from their account.      The lesson here is that while using higher leverage is typically considered very risky, this factor becomes very important if your position size is too large, as seen in the second scenario. As a rule of thumb, try to keep your losses per trade at less than 1.5% of your entire account size.    Where to set a stop loss    When it comes to margin trading, risk management is arguably the most important lesson. Your primary goal should be to keep losses at a minimum level even before thinking about profits. No trading model is infallible. Therefore, you must deploy mechanisms to help you survive when the market doesn’t go as expected.      Placing stop losses correctly is vitally important, and while there is no golden rule for setting a stop loss, a spread of 2%-5% of your trade size is often recommended. Alternatively, some traders prefer to set stop losses just below the most recent swing low (provided it’s not so low you’d stand to be liquidated before it triggered).      Secondly, you should manage your trading size and the associated risk. The higher your leverage, the higher your chances of being liquidated. Using excessive leverage is akin to exposing your capital to unnecessary risk. Moreover, some exchanges manage liquidations aggressively. BitMEX, for example, only allows traders to hold BTC as initial margin. This means if bitcoin’s price falls, so too does the amount of funds held in collateral resulting in faster liquidations.      Due to the risk associated with leverage trading, some exchanges have moved to lower the limit traders can access. Both Binance and FTX are among the leading centralized crypto exchanges to slash leverage limits from 100x to 20x.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/13/what-does-liquidation-mean-and-how-to-avoid-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67a493eed230aed0cfb2e33b1d7c55ecc1847fd5-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424735,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKbh,1628886513,Market Wrap: Ethereum Keeps Burning and Price Is Hot,"Bitcoin's price rose Friday, back above $46,000 after dipping as low as $43,800 the prior day.      The largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading close to its highest level in more than two months, sitting on a 60% year-to-date gain after rallying from a low around $29,000 as recently as June.      A key threshold is the 200-day moving average of the price, currently around $45,000.      ""The 200-day moving average is pivotal in the day trader's mind,"" Matt Blom, head of trading for the digital-asset firm Eqonex, wrote in his daily newsletter. ""A deeper dip to $40,900 will signal that the market is shaping up to form a new trading range, with $41,000 and $46,000 as the key levels.""    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $46,847, +4.83%  Ether (ETH) $3,224.2, +5.66%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4468.1, +0.2%  Gold: $1778.3, +1.46%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.294%, compared with 1.369% on Thursday  What lies ahead?    In an interview this week, Blom said the $50,000 price level may prove more difficult for bitcoin to break through than when the cryptocurrency soared past that level earlier this year en route to the all-time high price close to $65,000.      That's partly because some long-time bitcoin investors who missed the opportunity to take profits during that early-2021 rally might choose to do so once the key psychological hurdle of $50,000 is reached, Blom predicts. Such selling might ""limit the upside for several weeks,"" Blom said.      ""As soon as we get to $50K, I think we're going to churn,"" Blom said. ""People are going to take some coins off. I don't care how much of a HODLer you are."" In crypto-trading jargon, a HODLer is an investor who buys tokens under a plan to hold them for a long time.    Cardano announces September release date for 'Alonzo' upgrade    Cardano (ADA) jumped past $2 for the first time in nearly three months as the blockchain’s chief developer announced a September release date for the planned “Alonzo” upgrade – a move that would usher in smart-contract functionality and thus address what critics have described as one of the network’s most glaring deficiencies.      ​​Smart-contract functionality would allow Cardano to incorporate more applications including so-called decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that allow for automated cryptocurrency lending and trading. The improvement could put the network in a better position to challenge Ethereum, currently the leader among blockchains with smart-contract functionality.      The ADA price reached $2.08 at 9:05 UTC Friday, the highest since mid-May, when ADA was trading at $2.31 at its all-time high. Over the past 24 hours it’s up 16%. The recent price rally has pushed cardano’s market capitalization to about $65 billion, vying with binance coin (BNB) and tether (USDT) for the No. 3 rank among all cryptocurrencies by market value after No. 1 bitcoin and No. 2 ether.    Ethereum keeps burning and price is hot    Ether traders are acutely focused on data from the underlying Ethereum blockchain's recent upgrade, known as the London hard fork – and the potential for the refresh to reduce the cryptocurrency's supply growth.      Under Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, a component of the London upgrade that's usually shorthanded as just EIP 1559, base fees paid to transact on the blockchain get ""burned,"" meaning they offset some of the 2 ETH created as miner rewards with each data block.      As of press time, some 38,261 ETH have been burned in accordance with EIP 1559, according to the website Watch the Burn. The amount represents more than $120 million, and has reduced the net issuance of new ether by an estimated 35%.      The big question is whether institutional investors who are creeping into digital-asset markets might start to see ether as an inflation-resistant asset, similar to the way many bitcoin bulls have cast that cryptocurrency.      As bitcoin has rallied 16% in August, ether has outperformed with a 26% gain. On a year-to-date basis, ether has quadrupled in price while bitcoin is up 58%.      FundStrat, the investment-research firm, wrote this week: ""We expect fees moving through the platform to increase concurrent with the recent uptick in market activity and consequently should continue to see further disinflationary and perhaps even deflationary effects on Ethereum's circulating supply, resulting in positive price performance.""      It's notable that Mike McGlone, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who won big plaudits for his (ultimately) accurate call last year that bitcoin would hit $50,000, raised the possibility in a report this week that ether might eventually challenge the larger cryptocurrency for the top spot in the rankings of digital assets by market capitalization.      Crypto insiders often refer to that imagined change in the leaderboard as the ""flippening.""      ""There appears little can stop the process of ethereum 'flippening' to take the top spot by market cap, even it takes years rather than months at current trajectories,"" McGlone wrote. ""Ethereum appears on an enduring path as the go-to platform for the crypto ecosystem and decentralization of finance akin to Amazon Inc. and e-commerce.""    Poly Network exploit update    The drama around the largest hack in decentralized finance (DeFi) history appears to be coming to an end after the attacker returned most of the stolen funds to a multisig wallet set up by Poly Network, with the exception of the $33 million worth of tether that was frozen by Tether, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports.      “What crypto investors and regulators should be concerned about here is that this wasn’t a hack in the traditional sense, where someone gains unauthorised access,” wrote David Janczewski, co-founder and CEO at crypto security company Coincover in an email.      “This appears to have been an exploit, where a user runs public code to take advantage of an undiscovered security issue,” Janczewski wrote. “This type of exploit certainly won’t be the last as funds deposited into smart contracts like this are always exposed to risks associated with how those smart contracts are coded.”    Altcoin roundup:  Polygon Merges With Hermez Network: Polygon, a layer 2 platform on the Ethereum blockchain, is merging with rollup platform Hermez Network in a 250 million MATIC deal. The acquisition was worth about $250 million based on MATIC’s price on Aug. 4, when the deal was struck. Hermez will be absorbed into the Polygon ecosystem under the name Polygon Hermez, where it will become a part of Polygon’s line of products, including Polygon SDK and Polygon Avail. The entire Hermez project – its employees, technology and native HEZ token (which holders will be able to exchange at a rate of 3.5 MATIC: 1 HEZ) – will be integrated into Polygon’s platform. Polygon’s merger with Hermez is the first complete merger of one blockchain network into another.  Kaszek Makes First DeFi Investment: Kaszek, a leading Latin American venture capital fund, made its first decentralized finance (DeFi) investment, leading a $3 million round in Exactly, a startup that is building an open-source, non-custodial credit protocol on the Ethereum platform. “We see a gigantic emerging opportunity in DeFi, which will change the financial landscape in unimaginable ways in the years to come,” Hernán Kazah, Kaszek’s co-founder and managing partner, said in a statement, adding that the investment is part of two recently raised funds totaling $1 billion.

42424723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKBh,1628884772,"IRS, in Boon to Crypto, Will Reportedly Ignore How Bill Defines Broker; Bitcoin Rises","The U.S. Treasury Department is preparing to offer an olive branch to crypto developers, miners and hardware firms spooked by the bipartisan infrastructure bill's tax reporting requirements, according to a Bloomberg News report.      The price of bitcoin, already up on the day, jumped more than $1,500 on the news, hitting a three-month high of over $47,700. In recent trading the price of the leading cryptocurrency was at $47,600, up 8% over the last 24 hours.      Citing an unnamed department official, Bloomberg said Friday that Treasury won’t go after crypto entities that don’t meet the tax code’s definitions of a “broker.” Guidance on the matter could come next week, the report said.      The guidance would attempt to soothe the crypto industry’s biggest fear: that the Senate’s slapdash effort to tax “any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of other persons” could blow the nascent industry to smithereens.      Critics have called the infrastructure bill’s crypto provision overbroad and lobbied for weeks in a fruitless attempt to narrow it down. Many in the industry claimed that developers and miners who meet the bill’s definition of a broker would be forced to provide reporting information they do not have the ability to collect.      The Treasury statement, which is not yet public, could provide a workaround by effectively limiting the bill’s scope to those classified as brokers under the tax code. But it is not entirely clear how that carve-out would combat the concerns of the bill’s staunchest opponents.      According to Cornell Law, the U.S. tax code defines a broker as:    “A) a dealer, (B) a barter exchange, and (C) any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services.”    Treasury is reportedly planning to exempt non-broker parties on a case-by-case basis, a far cry from the more sweeping exemptions the industry had sought.

Nigel Hemsley, head of delivery for Cardano, said in a video released by developer Input Output Friday that the platform would launch the Alonzo upgrade on “Monday, Sept. 12,” though a quick glance at the calendar shows that the date falls on a Sunday this year. The developer later tweeted again saying that the platform targeted simply ""Sept. 12"" for the upgrade.      Started by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is a blockchain that aims to compete with Ethereum and other decentralized application platforms but as an avowedly more scalable, secure and efficient alternative.      “Any growth in the price of cryptocurrencies is either directly caused by positive news driving up sentiments among buyers or a growth in tandem with the overall market trend,” Yuri Mazur, head of data analytics at crypto trading platform CEX.IO broker, wrote via email. “Cardano’s highly anticipated Alonzo upgrade is also a good reason for investors to stack up the coin.”      The optimism has also risen in a prediction market started in July that allows participants to bet on whether Cardano can release smart contract functionality by Oct. 1.      As of press time, the betting contract, which pays out $1 of the stablecoin USDC if Cardano succeeds in meeting the timeline, was trading at 85 cents. That’s up from 30 cents on July 18, when the market was first launched.",POSITIVE,ADA | ETH,ADA | ALTCOIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/13/cardano-jumps-on-signals-smart-contracts-coming-next-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88f71ade34b34932c8caa88d8eaf7826872ba95f-2540x1664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424739,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKhh,1628879409,Money Reimagined: A Turning Point for Crypto,"When the “Conversation” section in last Friday’s newsletter covered the swirling congressional debate over the crypto provision in the U.S. Senate infrastructure bill, it was already a big story. But what happened over the next three days took it to a new level. Officially, the debate ended in a loss for the crypto community, but as this week’s column points out, it actually played out as a positive watershed moment in the technology’s public profile.      As the column highlights, the legislative battle captured a new-versus-old struggle. That’s also the core theme of this week’s podcast episode, whose news hook is the 50th anniversary of one of the most important and most underappreciated events of the second half of the 20th century: the removal of the dollar’s peg to gold on Aug. 15, 1971. With Cornell economic professor Eswar Prasad and CoinDesk podcast managing editor Adam B. Levine as our guests, Sheila Warren and I dig into the legacy of that event and how it frames the coming digital currency war.      Have a listen after reading the column.    Congress gives crypto a gift: the moral high ground    Every now and then a loss can be viewed as a victory.      That’s how I feel about the crypto community’s prodigious but ultimately failed attempt to get the Senate to amend a highly damaging cryptocurrency surveillance provision in its infrastructure spending bill.      The episode, with a made-for-Hollywood plot in which thousands of highly motivated activists were, in the end, obstructed by a single, self-interested senator, has made it easier to tell crypto’s story of inexorable change. The industry is now armed with the same basic narrative that revolutionaries and activists have carried throughout history, one of a persistent struggle that will eventually be victorious when the old inevitably gives way to the new.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    As my colleague Emily Parker noted this week, the crypto community needs to get better at telling its story. Even as Bitcoin advocates keep touting the benefits of a decentralized, peer-to-peer exchange and of a provably scarce store of digital value, the idea has mostly failed to resonate with a large enough swath of the general public. While attitudes are clearly shifting as crypto adoption expands, that mainstream understanding gap makes it possible for the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) to rail against the “dangers” of crypto.      But the past week feels like a turning point.      It started out when Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) inserted a provision into the infrastructure spending bill that would increase the tax reporting requirements of cryptocurrency exchanges and capture an estimated $28 billion in new tax revenue (as a contribution to the bill’s $1 trillion-plus price tag).      The biggest problem with the provision was the sweeping, catch-all language of what constitutes a “broker,” which crypto industry lawyers argued would be prone to wide interpretation, potentially capturing miners and open-source developers in an obligation to report to the Internal Revenue Service. As we argued in an editorial on Monday, the provision as written raised the specter of draconian surveillance of people’s day-to-day transactions, would drive crypto innovation offshore and was quite probably unenforceable.    Grassroots action    Almost immediately, crypto advocacy groups including Coin Center, the Blockchain Alliance, the Digital Chamber of Commerce and the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM) sprung into action. They managed to convince Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) to sponsor an amendment that would narrow the responsibility for reporting to exchanges providing custodial services to their customers and exempt miners and developers from its requirements. The bipartisan nature of that sponsorship was key.      With the aid of some savvy social media campaigning by Fight for the Future, these groups successfully motivated thousands of crypto enthusiasts to call, email and tweet at their senators, urging them to embrace the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment. This mass action made it clear that, while the lobby groups themselves are funded by crypto enterprises, their real power comes from crypto investors and others engaged in the industry who are strongly motivated to participate in grassroots campaigns. It gave it the feel of a popular message, not just one coming from vested interests.      The campaign was immediately impactful. Lawmakers from both houses of Congress and across the political divide started weighing in in support of the amendment and criticizing the original provision as a threat to American leadership in innovation and as a breach of privacy.      Even Portman himself acknowledged that the Senate should look at tweaking the provision’s language to remove its ambiguities.      His first formal attempt to fix it – a competing amendment co-sponsored with Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) in line with the White House and Treasury Department’s wishes – arguably did more harm than good as it tried to distinguish between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake in a clumsy attempt to keep developers of the latter within the purview of the law.      But eventually, the three of them reached a deal with Wyden, Lummis and Toomey, drafting a new amendment Monday that all six senators were happy with and that crypto advocacy groups such as Coin Center said they could support. Just getting to that point was an impressive achievement for the crypto community.    The holdout    What happened next was almost comical.      Put to a consent vote requiring 100% approval, the new amendment won the support of 99 out of 100 senators. The holdout was Richard Selby, a Republican representing Alabama. He refused to sign unless an additional $50 billion defense contracting provision was added to the bill. That was rejected by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and so the do-or-die amendment vote failed, which meant the bill’s original crypto provision remained intact, despite universal recognition of its problematic wording. (Shelby even acknowledged that it was flawed.)      Many in the crypto community speculated that Shelby was more motivated by protecting the interests of his Wall Street donors than the defense industry. After 35 years in the Senate, he is due to retire in 2022, feeding a conspiracy theory that, in doing the anti-crypto bidding of bankers, he was paving the way for his staffers to get jobs on the Street when he leaves.      Whether true or not, the image of a white, elderly man who has occupied his office since the Cold War petulantly refusing to support sensible legislation that’s pro-innovation and designed to maximize long-term tax revenues, all because of his own narrow, special interests, is just what crypto needs.      Juxtaposed against the grassroots campaigning of tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts around the country, many of them many generations younger than Shelby, his stubborn resistance has become the perfect image of the old guard resisting change to protect its own interests. It speaks directly to the very problem of centralized gatekeepers that Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies seek to get around.      If crypto advocates need an image with which to illustrate that problem, what could be better than that of an aged, out-of-touch senator, captured by corporate interests, blocking the wishes of every other senator. In this case, he is literally “The 1%.”    Read more: Money Reimagined: Gensler’s SEC Is the Same Old SEC    Now, as the fight over the bill goes to the House of Representatives, the community is rightfully invigorated. Sure, there’ll be plenty of resistance from other self-interested congressmen, which means this stupidly worded crypto provision could yet still become law.      But even if that happens, the moral victory has been won. The once fringe-dwelling crypto community finds itself legitimized, which will eventually result in a policy environment that is constructive to the industry.      The plot has changed, with a conclusion that looks far more friendly to the industry than that which its opponents have wanted to write.    Off the charts: Penguins and punks    We’re in the midst of a mania, a mania for pudgy penguins, crypto punk and bored apes. I talk, of course, of non-fungible tokens.      Trading volumes on the NFT marketplace OpenSea is the best way to represent this mania. Check this chart that CoinDesk’s Shuai Hao created from data provided by Dune Analytics.      Soaring August volumes on OpenSea show that the NFT craze still has legs. When NFT prices went sky-high earlier this year, only to fall fast, many observers said the market was all hype, but these numbers suggest otherwise. What matters now is less so the prices and more so the volumes.      This is not to say that prices aren’t getting elevated too. We’re not talking about numbers like $69.3 million that Beeple’s “The First 5,000 Days” fetched in March. But the 400 ether ($1.3 million) that someone paid for this image from the Bored Ape Yacht Club series is hardly chump change.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Michael J.

42424736,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKfh,1628878707,Puerto Rico: una isla con impuestos bajos donde el ecosistema cripto prospera,"La última media hora del viaje de regreso de Andrew Keys desde Manhattan a la oficina de ConsenSys en Brooklyn, Nueva York, fue una experiencia transformadora. El padre fundador de la blockchain Ethereum soñó con cómo la cadena de bloques podría mejorar el mundo —desde la digitalización del dinero hasta la descentralización de la web—, antes de salir de un vagón de metro en una mañana gris de invierno. Ahora prefiere llamar desde un paraíso tropical.      Keys se mudó a Puerto Rico en enero de 2018, durante un punto álgido del anterior momento alcista del mercado cripto. Formó parte del grupo de primeros adoptantes de criptomonedas que buscaban aprovechar los generosos incentivos fiscales de la isla. Fue una tendencia que en su día simbolizó los excesos de la industria blockchain, un movimiento que se asentó durante el mercado bajista y que ahora está volviendo a aparecer.    Read this article in English.    La razón es tan clara como las aguas de la isla: Puerto Rico es un paraíso fiscal. Eso es cierto para todo el mundo, pero el enfoque no intervencionista de ese territorio sobre las ganancias de capital, los ingresos y los impuestos a las empresas es justo lo que los pro-capitalistas y escépticos del estado buscan en una residencia. Llámelo simpatía por las criptomonedas, con la ventaja de poder conservar el pasaporte estadounidense.      La última avalancha de emigrantes cripto hacia la isla es la muestra de que el traslado significa un negocio. Pantera, uno de los fondos de cobertura más seguidos en el segmento cripto, se ha trasladado a San Juan. También lo han hecho CoinMint, un gran minero de bitcoins; SuperRare, una consolidada plataforma de tokens no fungibles (NFT); y la legendaria y poderosa pareja cripto conformada por Amanda y Sam Cassatt, ex-ejecutivos de ConsenSys convertidos en gurú del marketing e inversor de capital de riesgo, respectivamente.      Hay hombres de dinero, programadores freelance y quienes prueban suerte en el ultramoderno negocio de las apuestas de ETH. Coral DeFi —una plataforma de gestión de inversiones—, Dex Grid —una startup de energía descentralizada— y el protocolo de finanzas descentralizadas (DeFI) BarnBridge surgieron de la nada en Puerto Rico.      Y son más que bienvenidos: en 2012 Puerto Rico aprobó dos leyes, la Ley 20 y la Ley 22, destinadas a atraer a empresarios y corporaciones. La Ley 20 estableció un impuesto del 4% para las empresas exportadoras de servicios —consultoría de blockchain, por ejemplo— desde la isla.      No obstante, la verdadera atracción es la Ley 22. Aunque oficialmente forma parte de Estados Unidos, la isla se ha aislado del código fiscal de ese país y exime a sus residentes de los impuestos sobre las ganancias de capital. Esto la convierte en el único lugar del territorio estadounidense en donde los ingresos por inversiones, intereses y dividendos no están sujetos a impuestos. Todo lo que hay que hacer es pasar 183 días al año en una isla conocida por sus playas blancas como perlas y sus rones oscuros (residir en un barco dentro de las aguas territoriales también sirve).      “Yo no lo llamaría una laguna jurídica”, dijo Shehan Chandrasekera, contador público y cofundador de Column Tax. ""No creo que sea algo oculto. Puerto Rico y otros paraísos fiscales son lugares comúnmente nombrados entre la comunidad de individuos de alto patrimonio.""      Numerosas jurisdicciones —muchas de ellas paraísos tropicales— compiten por el tesoro ofreciendo impuestos bajos o nulos. Algunas, como El Salvador, atraen directamente a la comunidad bitcoin. Pero sólo Puerto Rico, que está más cerca de Caracas que de Miami, ofrece a los residentes una forma fácil de mantener la ciudadanía estadounidense.      Eso no significa que se encuentren trajes deambulando por las orillas de arena: al fin y al cabo, se trata de cripto. Incluso cuando Keys tomaba el tren L llevaba vaqueros y camiseta. Pero el nuevo movimiento de inmigración está más orientado al sector corporativo que el anterior, aunque sólo sea como reacción ante las pasadas críticas de querer establecer en Puerto Rico una ""isla de blockchain"".    Puertopia para siempre    En 2017 la exestrella infantil y candidato presidencial Brock Pierce presentó al mundo tanto la plataforma de contratos inteligentes EOS como la idea de una cripto-casa llamada ""Puertopia."" Estos últimos planes llamaron la atención de los medios de comunicación, y por una buena razón: Pierce y su equipo compraron hoteles, iglesias e incluso un antiguo hospital infantil para albergar su entorno cripto. Existían planes para constituir una ciudad.      Aunque los ricos han explotado durante mucho tiempo el sistema de evasión de impuestos de Puerto Rico, fue Pierce quien realmente introdujo el concepto en el mundo cripto. “Brock sigue siendo el número uno, por la cantidad de gente que tiene en su red, la cantidad de viajes que hace y la influencia que tiene en la comunidad”, dijo por teléfono desde San Juan Pedro Rivera, fundador de Crypto Mondays.      A cambio de pagar muy pocos impuestos, estos cripto-ricos —en su mayoría hombres, al menos— reinvertirían su capital en Puerto Rico. Ese siempre ha sido el objetivo implícito de cualquier política fiscal favorable a las empresas, y con Pierce se convirtió en una promesa explícita. Y se hizo aún más real tras el huracán María, que devastó la ya frágil economía e infraestructura de la isla.      Pierce, quien ha prometido donar su multimillonaria fortuna en parte para apoyar a la patria que ha elegido, lanzó esfuerzos de reconstrucción en la vida real y dentro de la cadena (on-chain). Es difícil juzgar el impacto de ese trabajo. Se gastó dinero real, pero no fue el renacimiento anunciado. (Pierce no respondió a las múltiples peticiones de comentarios para este reportaje).      Por supuesto, la grave recesión del mercado —y más tarde la pandemia mundial— desbarató muchos de los planes más descabellados de reconstrucción. Pero nunca estuvo claro qué significaba reinventar la economía digital de Puerto Rico. O si se quería.      ""La gente no tiene luz, electricidad, internet... sus techos tienen goteras"", dijo Rivera, quien emigró del Bronx en 2017. ""No les importa el cripto, hermano"".      Si la riqueza cripto tuvo algún efecto tangible en la recuperación de la isla, probablemente se hizo a nivel individual o fue demasiado local para ser notado, dijo. Rivera, por su parte, afirmó que ayudó a recaudar $27.000 para financiar el trabajo en el techo de Poet's Passage, un lugar de referencia local donde se celebran reuniones semanales de cripto. Recientemente, cerró una ronda de financiación de $100.000 respaldada por la comunidad de Crypto Monday para regalar billetera precargadas con $10 en criptomonedas a miles de niños de la organización sin fines de lucro Boys & Girls Clubs.      ""He visto un montón de puertorriqueños que han hecho dinero en cripto invirtiendo en ello"", dijo. ¿Pero qué ocurre con las empresas del sector y la creación de empleos bien remunerados para los habitantes de la isla? ""Todavía no hemos sido capaces de hacer que eso florezca realmente"", dijo.      Para algunos, el vaporware, la evasión de impuestos, la transformación de un monasterio en un hotel boutique, todo se resume en una cosa: la explotación. La intelectual y escritora canadiense de izquierdas Naomi Klein analizó la situación y la llamó ""criptocolonialismo""; Jillian Crandall, investigadora del Instituto Politécnico Rensselaer, la calificó como una forma perversa del ""capitalismo del desastre"". CoinDesk publicó un informe en el que se preguntaba si Puerto Rico podría sobrevivir a ser el ""eterno patio de recreo"", la aproximada traducción al latín del término ""Puertopia"".      ""Si no fuera por el hecho de que Puerto Rico es un Estado Libre Asociado de Estados Unidos, el proyecto [Puertopia] se parecería de manera exacta al colonialismo: la política o práctica de adquirir el control político total o parcial de otro país, ocuparlo con colonos y explotarlo económicamente. Espera... No, en realidad sigue siendo colonialismo"", escribió Bailey Reutzel, de CoinDesk, en 2018. Es un legado difícil de superar.    Creando una isla blockchain    Habían pasado cuatro semanas de unas vacaciones originariamente de una semana en el Caribe cuando Keiko Yoshino se dio cuenta de que no quería irse. Voló de vuelta a Washington, D.C., donde trabajaba en el sector público, para empacar sus pertenencias y atar cabos sueltos. Llegó a San Juan con dos maletas y un nuevo título: directora ejecutiva de la Asociación de Comercio de Blockchain en Puerto Rico.      ""Si me hubieras preguntado en diciembre, habría dicho: 'Bitcoin, eso es como el dinero imaginario, ¿no?’”, dijo. Pero en Puerto Rico todo encajó, y se enamoró de la tecnología y de la isla. “Es un ambiente. Es la energía… Es muy distinto a lo que esperaba"", dijo. ""Aquí es muy diferente. Valores diferentes, prioridades diferentes"".      Yoshino no es la primera persona en la que se piensa cuando se habla de cripto y Puerto Rico. No es rica en criptomonedas y no está buscando crear un colectivo anarcocapitalista. Ayudó a fundar la asociación blockchain para apoyar a la comunidad cripto local y puso a trabajar sus años de experiencia en el gobierno. Paga sus cuentas, pero no se hace rica.      Pero eso no impide que la gente la ataque. ""En el pasado estuve en las redes sociales: escribieron mal mi nombre, me llamaron una cripto colonizadora"", dijo. Como una recién llegada al sector, considera que la idea de que las startups de blockchain son usurpadoras malévolas es tan irrisoria como la de que van a revolucionar la isla en breve.      ""Esa idea está desconectada de la realidad"", dice. En su trabajo de día está organizando una conferencia para este invierno. Los fines de semana juega al voleibol. Mencionó a un miembro de la asociación, Raincoat: una empresa de seguros que está utilizando la tecnología blockchain para ayudar a desembolsar pagos de seguros después de huracanes. Desde su punto de vista, el programa de incentivos fiscales ha ayudado mucho al país, pero no todo el mundo está de acuerdo.      ""Es un poco enfermizo cómo las corporaciones que están allí para aprovechar el impuesto a la exportación del 4% no hacen absolutamente nada para mejorar la economía local"", dijo un trader de criptomonedas que se hace llamar ""PVKT"" en Reddit y pidió permanecer bajo su seudónimo. Se mudó allí en 2019, principalmente por los beneficios fiscales, antes de repatriarse. Viviendo en una ciudad turística dos años después del huracán María se enfrentó a apagones itinerantes que ""no eran muy propicios para el comercio"".      También estaba la pobreza extrema que se veía: las casas de hormigón, las infraestructuras en ruinas, la falta de agua o de servicios básicos. Era difícil cuadrar su estilo de vida y el de quienes le rodeaban con la experiencia de la población local. ""Se cambia mucho por los incentivos. Si lo único que te preocupa es el dinero y nada más, entonces puede que te convenga"", dijo PVKT.      JSON, un usuario de Twitter con ese seudónimo, también planeaba mudarse a Puerto Rico antes de enfrentarse a un dilema moral similar. ""Cuando lo analizo en profundidad, hay muchas cosas que no son deseables. La gente rica se muda allí pero hace poco para contribuir a la economía local. La gente de la isla es muy amable, pero algunos sienten que se aprovechan de ellos"", dijo.      Si existe una comunidad cripto en Puerto Rico, es probable que se haya desarrollado debido al principio de proximidad. La mayoría de los cripto expatriados con los que hablé vivían en los mismos barrios de San Juan o Dorado, un enclave costero rico. Hay restaurantes de categoría mundial en donde los anfitriones hablan inglés y colegios privados a los que enviar a sus hijos.      ""Lo que ocurre es que hay una gran concentración de estas personas en zonas pequeñas"", dijo Rivera. Aunque vive en un barrio mayoritariamente hispanohablante, prefiere relacionarse con la clase alta. ""Todos vamos a los mismos sitios. No hay tantos lugares de alto nivel en Puerto Rico"".      Eso no es necesariamente algo malo: aunque los ricos se libren de pagar impuestos sobre las plusvalías, siguen contribuyendo al Estado. Keys señaló que paga el impuesto de sociedades, el impuesto sobre la propiedad y el impuesto sobre las ventas. ""Hay infinidad de impuestos que la gente seguirá teniendo que pagar. Aunque potencialmente más bajos"", dijo.      A veces, los expatriados se han enfrentado a más presión por su decisión de mudarse a Puerto Rico que por apostar por el dinero descentralizado de internet. Pero, en cierto sentido, mudarse al extranjero para escapar de la carga fiscal es similar a salirse del sistema monetario actual a través de las criptomonedas. Ambas son formas de dejar atrás al estado e intentar construir un sistema alternativo.      ""Nadie va a pagar todos esos impuestos"", dijo Rivera sobre la factura fiscal comparativamente alta que le esperaba si se hubiera quedado en el Bronx. ""Si tienes la oportunidad de no pagar, no es que nuestro gobierno necesite el dinero, hermano. Pueden imprimir dinero cuando quieran"".",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,"Daniel Kuhn, Andrés Engler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/13/puerto-rico-una-isla-con-impuestos-bajos-donde-el-ecosistema-cripto-prospera,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf2f44221f09c3390756d12f2320cb4ee84a5688-1414x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424727,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKHh,1628878006,"Founder of Alleged $95M Ponzi Nabbed in Russia, 3 More Sought","Russian police officials are investigating one of the biggest alleged Ponzi schemes in the country involving cryptocurrency. One of the founders is under arrest, while others have reportedly left Russia. Victims’ losses might be up to $95 million.      The company, named Finiko, offered lucrative investment options using a network of promoters who pulled in new users for referral fees. Investors were supposed to put in bitcoin and get the native token of Finiko in return.      In July, Kirill Doronin, one of founders of Finiko, was arrested under fraud charges. Before the arrest, he obtained Turkish citizenship under a different name, Onur Namik. On Wednesday, Finiko’s other co-founders – Marat and Edward Sabirov and Zygmunt Zygmuntovich – were put on a wanted list by the Russian police.      Edward Sabirov was also a co-founder of a firm led by Nikolay Nikiforov, a former Russian minister of communications, which planned to build homes in Kazan, the city where Finiko was founded. Now, other partners are trying to expel Sabirov from the owners’ list by court action, according to data in the Russian arbitration court system.      About 100 people reported Finiko to the police, officials said, and the amount of claims totaled to around 70 million Russian rubles, or slightly less than $1 million. However, Russian business publication The Bell cited an anonymous source at the Bank of Russia that said Finiko might have accumulated up to 7 billion rubles, or close to $95 million.    Money siphoned out    Finiko operated between 2019 and 2021, offering investment opportunities via crypto, including a deposit service with 20-30% APY (annual percentage yield), The Bell wrote. Clients invested in bitcoin, which Finiko exchanged for its native token.      In June, Russian crypto new outlet Forklog reported that Finiko halted bitcoin withdrawals from its website, only allowing users to take out the native token FNK, which lost 97% of its value in three weeks.      Then, in July, Finiko stopped all withdrawals, Forklog reported, demanding that users first submit a package of documents, including their income reports, reports on the banking transactions for one year, a confirmation of tax payment for the previous year and a “recommendation letter” from their bank, among others.      The Bank of Russia put Finiko on the list of entities that “have signs of a Ponzi scheme.”      Sergey Mendeleev, founder of crypto exchange Garantex, believes that Finiko’s founders might have stolen even bigger amounts of money than The Bell reported, perhaps up to $1 billion.      “In January, the entire Moscow [crypto market] was on fire when Finiko cashed out about $100 million in just one week,” Mendeleev said.      He also pointed to a particular transaction of 1,023 BTC, which was sent, reportedly, from Finiko’s wallet in December.      “There was a scandal, of course, as people are not crazy about dealing with Ponzi money,” Mendeleev said. “But then it somehow calmed down. You can’t always tell whose money you’re dealing with, and Finiko’s bitcoin still hasn’t been labeled as scam funds [by blockchain tracing systems].”      Most people got involved in Finiko by word of mouth from their friends and relatives, who reaped generous referral fees for that, The Bell wrote. The same people who referred their friends might have been helping them buy crypto for the first time to invest in a lucrative venture, Mendeleev said.      Russian-language crypto Telegram channel Ghost_In_The_Block wrote in July about identifying Finiko’s crypto addresses. According to the summary published by the anonymous authors, Finiko’s USDT wallet processed more than 400 million USDT.      Blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain identified 1.8 million USDC, 111.3 million USDT and 888 ETH tied to Finiko’s digital wallets, as well as 110 million native tokens.

This will mark the iconic brand’s first foray into the NFT market. The collection will launch publicly on Aug. 28 at the start of Dolce & Gabbana's Alta Moda couture show in Venice, with the official auction going live Sept. 6.      Luxury culture is about flaunting expensive items and it is no surprise high-end fashion brands have jumped on the bandwagon as NFTs surge back into the mainstream.      Speaking during a Twitter Spaces livestream Friday, UNXD CEO Shashi Menon said:    “We have a very deep relationship with the house of Dolce & Gabbana and have been working with them for many years. When we proposed the idea to them, we were really enthused by how the team was taken by it. What is important here is that fashion is fundamentally an artistic medium.”    The Venetian-themed Collezione Genesi NFTs will be showcased at upcoming fashion shows Alta Moda, Alta Sartoria and Alta Gioiellleria. The first concept to be highlighted is called “Dress from a Dream.”      ""With this collection, Dolce & Gabbana [is] creating NFTs that bridge their creative work from the physical to the metaphysical,” said UNXD COO Nick Gonzalez. “This will pave the path for more brands to join the space as they see the power of digital ownership to create opportunities that align with their underlying ethos and core brand and business.""

42424732,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWKTh,1628875210,"50 Years After Bretton Woods, the US Dollar's Throne Is in Play","This Sunday, Aug. 15, will be the 50th anniversary of the end of the Bretton Woods currency system. After World War II, major nations essentially agreed to peg their currencies to a gold-backed dollar. But by 1971, faith in the U.S. dollar was eroding, forcing President Richard Nixon to end the dollar’s convertibility to gold. This ushered in the current status quo of relatively free-floating “fiat” currencies.      That long-ago decision still has major implications today. Over the past few months, massive coronavirus pandemic relief spending in the U.S. has triggered worries that faith in the dollar’s soundness could be shaken again as it was 50 years ago. The dollar’s share of central bank balance sheets is still a dominant 59%, but has been slowly declining – threatening to take with it a number of economic and political advantages.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    To better understand the road ahead, I’ve been examining the viability of various currencies as central bank reserves, including the euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, as well as bitcoin or other digital instruments. That analysis will be published soon, but I wanted to hit on a few highlights of what I learned talking to currency experts.      First, despite high anxiety about the yuan’s rising influence, China faces a deep, possibly unsolvable conflict between its global currency ambitions and its domestic economic agenda: The Chinese Communist Party maintains tight currency controls to encourage domestic investment, but a reserve currency must be freely tradable.      Between that conundrum and the inconsistency of Chinese regulation, experts are generally skeptical that the yuan can climb much in the global reserve rankings anytime soon. Japan, meanwhile, doesn’t sell enough debt abroad for its bonds to take up a large share of global reserves.      Among current options, the euro seems to be the most serious competitor to the dollar, thanks to the large eurozone economy behind it and the relatively open and responsible management of the European Central Bank. A major recent step that makes this more plausible was the ECB’s decision to issue eurozone-wide bonds to fund pandemic relief programs.      That’s ironic given that rising global debt levels are also a pillar of the case for central banks to hold bitcoin as part of their reserves. The coronavirus has fueled a massive surge in global debt, which as of earlier this year stood at 365% of global GDP.      If the world were a single country, that ratio would be a five-alarm fire – especially because so much of it is held by central banks of the countries that issued the debt, which economists including Eswar Prasad argue amounts to money printing. The case for individuals to hold bitcoin rests on the idea that central banks are inevitably tempted to debase their currency through this sort of inflationary policy.    Read more: The Currency Cold War: Four Scenarios | Jeff Wilser    The same argument could be made for central banks: that the debt of other countries presents a large and rising risk. Bitcoin, by contrast, is effectively a commodity rather than debt, making it safer from some perspectives. For now, however, bitcoin’s price volatility remains a major obstacle to national adoption.      Nonetheless, interest in the idea has exploded since El Salvador first dipped its toes in. Much of that has been from countries with weak currencies, such as Argentina, where President Alberto Fernandez this week expressed a degree of openness to using bitcoin.      This, I think, is where to watch for the next major wave of bitcoin adoption: smaller nations with troubled currencies or histories of monetary mismanagement. For them, bitcoin is something entirely novel: a store of value that’s not dependent either on their own central bank, or a potentially hostile third nation. It’s clear they’re paying attention to the possibilities.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,David Z.

Let us take a look into what&apos;s coming up next. What is an NFT? Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) derive their name from one of the properties that can make up a crypto asset. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or ERC-20 tokens are fungible, which means that all units in the supply are interchangeable with one another and retain their value if they are divided. In essence, when you hold 1 ETH in your wallet, you generally do not care which one out of the over 117 million ETH currently in existence it is. NFTs on the other hand have special properties that make each token unique. In essence, an NFT gives you cryptographic proof that you are the sole owner of whatever virtual asset the NFT is associated with. These assets can for example be digital images, videos, music, but even more abstract things like intellectual property, digital usage licenses, or insurance policies. Depending on the type of NFT, you can freely list the token on an online marketplace, or transfer the token to somebody else&apos;s wallet. Influencers can turn their content into NFTs One of the use cases for NFTs is the monetization of content. For example, influencers can convert their Tweets, YouTube videos, TikTok clips, or Instagram posts into NFTs and sell them.

42424717,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWGxh,1628871752,What Blockchain Oracles Do Not See,"Blockchain promises an immutable history of on-chain data. But the “ledger of record” is merely the newest version of an old trick – the manufacture and distribution of certainty.      This pattern of manufacturing certainty (laying claim to truth) and then distributing it (demanding conformity) I call the “certainty-industrial complex,” and it has always been fundamental to maintaining social order.    Mike Elias is the founder of Ideamarket. Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.    For thousands of years, organized religions have laid claim to absolute truth and then demanded conformity from the people. Today, mainstream scientific culture expresses similar confidence and demands similar conformity, shaming heretics. The certainty-industrial complex even shaped most of our childhoods, as public education frames teachers as authorities and requires students to conform.      In all cases, the implication is clear: You are dependent on an authority for the truth. Your only hope of knowledge is to stop thinking and start obeying.      Given that certainty is the most resolutely nonexistent thing in the universe (see Heisenberg, Godel, Wittgenstein, et cetera.), its manufacture and distribution has traditionally required a lot of lying.      “Bitcoin is dead.” Uh-huh.      “It’s just the flu.” Uh-huh.      In the coming years, decentralized oracles will cryptographically verify a wide variety of data points and save them on-chain, creating “definitive truth” – a ledger of record.    Read more: An Interview With Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov    While the intent is noble, the execution is merely the next evolutionary step of the certainty-industrial complex – an innovation in obedience mongering. The ledger of record lays claim to the truth, and you must conform.      Ironically, technologists like Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and billionaire investor Mark Cuban fail to grasp what the internet means for public discourse: Access to facts is not the problem anymore – trusting their interpretation is. The bulletproof certainties blockchain provides don’t make it safe to start trusting institutions again. A central authority – like the World Health Organization (WHO) or the New York Times – can still impose an accepted interpretation of the facts, even if the facts themselves are available for everyone to view.    Moral Kombat    The internet revealed that behind every authority is a choice between authorities.      Having a choice between authorities means authoritative certainty is now a mere data point for our own uncertainty, our own judgments.      The internet cemented free choice about whom we trust as the decisive factor in whether we agree with a given narrative.      This new freedom kills the certainty-industrial complex.      It’s dead.      And there’s no going back.    A town called Panic    The certainty-industrial complex knows something is different, but it doesn’t know what. The tactics of manufacturing and distributing certainty have simply stopped working. The old authorities gasp for a breath of their former stature, feebly flashing credentials at the incredulous throng.      Ledger of record advocates believe that by manufacturing certainty at a level of purity unseen in human history, the ledger will make certainty effective again – that soon we’ll live in a world where authorities say, “look, it’s on-chain!”and everyone will agree and live happily ever after.      They’re wrong – and there’s proof.    Fact consensus =/= narrative consensus    Even if we assume for practical purposes that facts exist, consensus on facts does not produce consensus on narratives.      Social media feeds are a perfect example. When Donald Trump tweeted on Nov. 16, 2020 “I WON THE ELECTION,” 80 million people would agree on the literal text content.      But what it means – what story it tells about the world we live in – remains the subject of endless debate. While the Associated Press called the American presidential election for Joe Biden, skeptics, frustrated by court-demonstrated Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) collusion with the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and years of corporate media censorship, remained distrustful.    The internet cemented free choice about whom we trust as the decisive factor in whether we agree with a given narrative.    Public discourse is divided by interpretations of data, not data itself. Cryptographically verified datadoesn’t even touch this problem.      Consider The DAO hack of 2016. How did the Ethereum Core team respond? Depending on who you ask, they rolled back the chain, intervened in-state, performed a hard fork, et cetera. Yet, all the relevant data is on-chain – shouldn’t we all agree on what happened if it’s all on-chain?      Advocates trumpet the ledger of record as the savior of public discourse, but we’ve already seen cryptographically verified data fail to produce a cryptographically unified narrative – even after five years, with a technically sophisticated audience.      The DAO hack is proof it doesn’t matter how justified one person’s certainty may be; convincing others of that certainty is an entirely different problem.    Due diligence    Before reconstituting all of humanity’s knowledge on a new technical foundation, it seems reasonable to conduct some due diligence. Here are three key questions which ledger of record advocates rarely answer satisfactorily:    1. What’s the plan for when data consensus fails to produce narrative consensus?    Throughout history, when certainty is manufactured, the next step is always the same: Impose it.      When the historical church failed to persuade, it responded with crusades. When corporate media fails to persuade, it responds with censorship.      What’s the plan for when “cryptographic truth” fails to persuade?    Read more: Chainlink Integrates Weather Data From the Google Cloud  2. What’s the plan for ensuring public trust is well-placed?    The public will never have the technical knowledge to distinguish a secure oracle from a compromised one, relevant data from irrelevant data or honest interpretations from dishonest ones.      Here’s why this matters: To the precise extent the ledger of record becomes important, power brokers will subvert it technically while praising it politically. They’ll corrupt oracles, migrate to insecure sidechains and cherry-pick data to manufacture circumstantial evidence.      When they finally say “look, it’s all on-chain,” only a tiny cadre of politically outcast experts will be able to spot the fraud.      How will the public know it’s being defrauded, let alone meaningfully protest?    3. Are you prepared to have your minds blown?    If decentralized oracles indeed produce “definitive truth,” they will quickly elevate a subset of fringe ideas to paradigm-shattering prominence. Why aren’t ledger of record advocates talking about this all the time?      These are the kinds of sentences I’d expect to hear from people who are seriously interested in discovering and mainstreaming suppressed ""truths"":    “I can’t wait to 3D print my UFO.”  “I can’t wait to time travel in my spirit body.”  “I can’t wait to find my reincarnated parents.”    Getting revenge on the media for lying about COVID-19 is nothing compared to this stuff. So why is that the main symptom of ledger of record fever?      The absence of wonderment in the face of unbounded discovery makes me worry that ledger of record advocates might already expect to cherry-pick on-chain data that fits their preferred narrative and vindicate their personal narrative vendettas.      They expect you to unquestioningly obey on-chain data and to change your mind when confronted by “definitive truth.”      But will they?",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | TRADING | WALLET | FORKS,Mike Elias,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/13/what-blockchain-oracles-do-not-see,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21adf32b339ca907603f570e9b862bd22bf12a26-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a letter sent on Wednesday to institutions under its supervision, the authority called bitcoin a speculative asset with no intrinsic value, Calcalist reported.      According to Calcalist, Wednesday’s letter was issued in response to (and only a day after) digital currency investment house Silver Castle and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) announced the country’s first bitcoin-linked bonds will trade on TASE UP, the exchange’s trading platform for private companies.      Financial authorities in the country have been tightening regulations around crypto. At the end of July, the Ministry of Finance introduced a bill that would require all crypto holdings worth $61,000 or more be reported to the tax authority. A recently released report by the Justice Department said a new anti-money laundering order that also applies to virtual currency service providers will come into effect in November. Financial regulators, including the Capital Market Authority, were involved in preparing the legislation, the Justice Department report said.      In its announcement, TASE said the new bonds will expose institutional investors to bitcoin “with significantly reduced operational risks and product holding costs.”      “The capital raised in the [issuance of the bonds] will be used solely in the purchase of bitcoin and the monies will be fully exposed to the exchange rate of the bitcoin,” the press release said.      TASE and Silver Castle did not respond to requests for comment by press time.      According to Calcalist, the letter from the Capital Markets Authority focused specifically on bitcoin-related investments by the institutions in question, such as pension company Altshuler Shaham’s $100 million investment into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust earlier this year. It doesn’t apply to crypto trading at large.      “To be clear, we're not talking about investments in cryptographic currencies in general, nor in the related technologies, which have an alternative economic rationale and might even enhance the market,” the letter said.      The authority will also require institutions to submit the minutes of the discussions and meetings in which they discussed these investments, along with all materials that supported the investment decisions, Calcalist reported.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/13/israeli-financial-authorities-double-down-on-bitcoin-linked-investments-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6f244b7eec35002f7806da69bcf7a9c40a4c525-2120x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424718,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWGvh,1628838434,Bitcoin Back Above $46K on Low Daily Volume as Altcoins Outperform,"Bitcoin has clawed back lost ground from Thursday's 2.4% sell that saw the crypto reach a low of around $43,800.      The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value was up 1.5% over a 24-hour period by press time and is currently changing hands for around $46,100.      Bitcoin is beginning to edge closer toward analyst's projected $50,000 price tag, as CoinDesk reported Thursday.      ""We were seeing many investors taking advantage of recent market movements by taking profits,” said Asher Tan, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinJar. ""There's a trend of conservatism among users who jumped into crypto around similar price levels earlier in the year, with users slightly trimming their holdings.""      Indeed, bitcoin's total daily volume across major exchanges, including Bitstamp, remains flat when compared to previous months, particularly towards the end of May.      ""While the recent price movements have seen an increased amount of activity in the markets, trading volumes globally are nowhere near where they were the last time the price was at $45,000 - they’re much lower,"" said Janine Grainger, co-founder of Australia-based exchange Easy Crypto.      The co-founder points toward new investors remaining cautious ever since they had a taste of the crypto market's volatility when the sell-off in May saw bitcoin prices drop 50% from $56,700 to around $30,000 in a little over a week.      Yet seasoned investors, Grainger argues, are increasingly active with data hinting at a strong uptake in altcoins, beginning Aug. 9. ""In particular, ether has picked up significantly against bitcoin and that is starting to trend again as of today,"" she said.      ""Some folks are worried we’re about to repeat history with this year’s $60,000-$30,000-$45,000, but this time it really is different,"" BCB Group CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie told CoinDesk via Telegram on Friday. ""There is a ton of institutional money in the system, which behaves very differently from retail money; the ecosystem has evolved significantly with hundreds of thousands of man hours of innovation; and regulation has gained much greater definition.""      Ether isn't the only crypto trending higher on the day with cardano, stellar and solana posting the highest gains. Zooming out to a seven-day period, most altcoins in the top 20 by market cap are outperforming bitcoin while most decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptos are trending higher in the green, up between 6%-90% over the same period.      ""In terms of altcoins, many cryptocurrencies, especially DeFi coins, have been lagging in comparison to bitcoin and ether,"" said Tan. ""However, we're starting to see a trend of users swapping bitcoin for DeFi coins, which has been a catalyst for the recent appreciation in their price.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/13/bitcoin-back-above-46k-on-low-daily-volume-as-altcoins-outperform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e2c6c5b99b1995e89ee619eb7ac82ced53708a3-1500x917.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
