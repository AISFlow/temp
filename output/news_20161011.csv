42378880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJhl,1476221905,Bitcoin Gets its Groove Back as Price Resistance Breaks,"Bitcoin prices surged on 11th October amid what analysts say was a sharp change in market confidence.  The digital currency rose to as much as $639.97 at the time of report, roughly 4% higher than the daily low of $615.87. While not the largest of increases, however, the development followed several weeks where bitcoin traded in a tight range following the high-profile hack of Hong Kong exchange Bitfinex.  But the market is now recovering on stronger liquidity, Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk.  After experiencing this period of sideways trading, bitcoin markets have ""broken to the upside,"" bitcoin trader BTC VIX confirmed.  This break past resistance took place at a time when traders are bullish about bitcoin, a development which is supported by Whaleclub data. Figures provided by the investment platform reveal that the market's speculative positions have been more than 80% long since 21st September.  ""The overwhelming majority of traders on Whaleclub are long,"" said Zivkovkski.  He added that he's seen a noticeable increase in buy-side liquidity, something he sees as a positive should the news cycle continue to provide support.  He concluded:  ""This rise is perhaps a testament to a return to stronger confidence.""

42378883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJj1,1476214407,Augur's Troubled Token Launch Highlights 'Appcoin' Pitfalls,"The crypto markets didn't respond well to the launch of Augur's digital asset.  The ethereum-based prediction market came out of the gates strong last week, with its reputation (REP) tokens quickly getting listed on markets like Poloniex, Bittrex and Kraken. However, the market value of those tokens fell sharply in post-launch trading.  Since then, some market observers have moved to voice their concerns about the blockchain token's long-term viability, and the viability of 'appcoins' in general.  Intended to act as an incentive for prediction market users who provide reliable reports on the Augur platform about real-world events, Augur raised roughly $5.3m in a sale of its REP tokens last year. The platform launched its public beta in March, but until last week, they weren't able to be freely bought or sold.  The public release is a notable test of the appcoin model, in which tokens are issued via a blockchain to both spur adoption and provide a mechanism for supporting a project. While advocates say the model represents a new way for startups to raise cash and build momentum, critics have argued that an appcoin is little more than 'snake oil' with a new name.  As for how traders see it, the answer is less clear, though Augur provides a valuable data point.  The price of REP took a sharp hit soon after launch, falling 52% from an opening price of $13 on 4th October to a low of $6 on 6th October. REP prices are currently reported at an average of roughly $6.50, Poloniex data show.  Amid these sharp declines, Whaleclub’s Petar Zivkovski expressed his concerns that the REP launch was largely beneficial for those who bought in early.  He told CoinDesk:  “[REP] has rewarded accumulators, its founding team, the early buyers, much more than it is likely to reward anyone buying now.""  Early moves  The digital currency quickly broke into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and was the eighth-largest currency at press time, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.  While REP commanded a market capitalization of $71m at the time, this figure represented a steep decline from the all-time high of $119.7m on 5th October.  Most of the currency’s early trading took place on Poloniex, and Zivkovski noted that the majority of the initial REP/BTC volume going through this exchange was sell volume. His take was that the initial stage of trading was driven by ""early accumulators...looking to liquidate their REP in favor of [bitcoin].""  Arthur Hayes of BitMEX argued that, despite the decline, the release was largely a success because its price remains above what early adopters paid last fall.  ""I would say that it isn't a setback at all,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The token still trades well above its ICO price.""  Looking ahead  What happens from here on out to the REP token depends largely on two factors: adoption and regulatory scrutiny.  Some argue that Augur could potentially enter rough regulatory waters like the ones that doomed Intrade, a prediction market that closed in early 2013 amid pressure from the US government.  ""Any prediction market that takes off is likely to attract unwelcome and possibly fatal regulatory attention for sports betting,"" said Jacob Eliosoff, who runs Calibrated Markets LLC, a cryptocurrency investment firm.  He went on to argue that, even if the platform manages to steer clear of such regulatory risks due to its decentralized management, Augur's decision to forego ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – and to launch its own appcoin could potentially undermine its ability to keep users for the long-term.  ""To me that's the name of the game,"" he told CoinDesk.  At least one analyst in the market had an alternative perspective on the launch, suggesting that REP wouldn't be the last ethereum-based appcoin to see a similar launch.  ""REP is the first major ethereum subtoken to gain traction on exchanges,” noted Olaf Carlson-Wee, founder of digital asset hedge fund Polychain Capital, adding:  ""It won't be the last.""

42378875,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJcj,1476198166,Momentum Grows for Blockchain Gold Markets with 'Big Four' Partnership,"Global consultancy EY and New York blockchain startup Paxos have announced that they are co-developing new technology solutions for the gold market.  Aimed at providing new tools for the clearing and settlement of gold transactions, the partnership will see the two firms leveraging Paxos’ blockchain-based network, Bankchain, as a basis for the services.  David Williams, EY’s partner for capital markets innovation, said in a statement:  ""We believe that the future of capital markets requires ever stronger and more innovative ecosystems, and expect this to be a key early example of the type of collaboration between FinTech firms and existing market participants that will truly transform the marketplace.""  The idea of using the technology to reshape how gold markets function has gained traction in the past year and a half.  Paxos, which rebranded to focus on blockchain solutions in tandem with its bitcoin exchange, announced this past summer that it was working with Euroclear on a similar project. The startup has moved in recent months to reposition itself amid growing interest in blockchain solutions among the world’s banks and corporations.  Established names in the capital market sector are also looking at the tech for use in the gold trade. Last month, the brains behind the exchange that inspired the Michael Lewis bestseller Flash Boys announced that they were looking to blockchain as they build a next-generation gold exchange.

42378919,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJo3,1476193079,Why Tech Giant Ericsson Wants Blockchain 'Fingerprints' in the Cloud,"Swedish telecom networks company Ericsson has built a system for ensuring data integrity, leveraging blockchain to underpin its growing presence in the cloud.  Erik Forsgren, the company’s director for portfolio management, said that the company has had its system up and running since January. It grew out of a partnership with GuardTime, a data security startup, first inked in 2014.  The company, which dates back to the late 1800s and employs over 100,000 people worldwide, is a major player in the global telecom solutions marketplace, reporting over $6bn in second-quarter sales for this year.  However, competition from China and a growing need to innovate in a fast-moving ecosystem has put the company on the defensive, pushing it to slash jobs and look to places like the cloud for new paths to growth.  But Ericsson is far from alone in exploring the technology in a bid to keep data honest. Blockchains have long looked at as a means for providing a record of how data changes over time, with startups and individual developers focusing on the question of data integrity using both the bitcoin blockchain and other implementations.  The state of Vermont even passed legislation earlier this year to provide a legal basis for blockchain-based information after toying with the idea of developing a record-keeping system that uses the technology (which was ultimately scuttled). It’s an area that has also attracted interest in the banking sector as well.  Forsgren explained that someone using the system is signing “fingerprints” of data, an approach that allows for efficient processing while still maintaining a mechanism for ensuring that information is timestamped and recorded whenever any change happens.  He told CoinDesk in a recent interview:  “What we are doing is running this global blockchain infrastructure. It is a private blockchain that you can then subscribe to and access and sign any time of data, you as a company. You can verify and sign any kind of data toward this blockchain.”  What Guardtime and Ericsson refer to as a “blockchain” isn’t one in the bitcoin sense, but is rather based on what the two firms call “keyless signature infrastructure”. It’s a technology application that has drawn interest from parties such as the government of Estonia.  “Instead of putting all of the data up in the blockchain, we only take fingerprints of the data,” he explained.  Cars on the blockchain  According to Ericsson, the technology holds the most potential in uses cases for which data needs to be trusted in real time. In a world that's growing more connected by the day, there's a corresponding need to keep all that data secure – and truthful.  In conversation, Forsgren pointed to the example of a connected car – plugged into a broader Internet of Things network – as one that illustrates how the technology can be leveraged to ascertain the veracity of certain types of data. Put more bluntly, blockchain might be the key to keeping your car's computer from lying to either you, its manufacturer or whoever maintains it.  Take the case of the software being run inside the car. Whichever company is delivering that code to the car will want to keep track of when and where it is deployed, in order to maintain a history of updates delivered to a particular vehicle.  According to Forsgren, this also helps keep track of whether that software may have been tampered with somewhere along the way.  Forsgren explained:  “First you develop software for the car, and you need to protect that supply chain, the software supply chain, all the way to your sub contractors, all the way to where your software is delivered to the car. Once the info is in the car, you want it to be verifiable in real time whenever you go out driving.”  This also applies to the concept of receiving (and storing) information received from a vehicle.  “It’s also important that this data is also the correct data and has not been manipulated in any way by the owner of the vehicle or anything external,” Forsgren explained. “Typical cases can be insurance cases, any claims made by someone when you have a dispute situation. You should be able to prove that your data is authentic at any time.”  Not bitcoin’s blockchain  The backbone for the system employed by Ericsson, through its partnership with GuardTime, is known as “keyless signature infrastructure”.  It’s not a blockchain like the one underpinning bitcoin, but according to Martin Frojd, head of product for cloud and data platforms for Ericsson, it provides a commercial-scale way to back up the integrity of critical information used by its clients.  “We are not storing customer information in our blocks. We are storing a fingerprint of that data, which is mathematically linked to the previous hashes in the hash tree,” he explained. “We see that as a huge benefit, especially in industrial uses, because it has the speed and it has the value of it, and you’re not exposing any customer data in the ledger.”  While the use of the term “blockchain” may be somewhat driven by marketing, the technology has attracted interest beyond Ericsson.  The Estonian government announced in 2015 that is is working with GuardTime to back up health records. Last month, the US Department of Defense, though its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), announced that it was awarding a $1.8m grant to GuardTime and a second firm, Galois, to pursue applications of its technology.  The fruits of the partnership with GuardTime has extended to Ericsson's client base, which has expressed interest in the technology, according to Forsgren.  As a result, the company is pursuing a series of proofs-of-concept focused on applications in supply chain and cloud-based data management, for example. Forsgren also said that Ericsson is working with US tech conglomerate General Electric via its Predix cloud platform on similar applications.  Demurring on when the company might launch a commercial-scale product, Forsgren said that, as it stands, Ericsson is focused on blockchain research and development.  “For us, it’s still in an early phase,” he said.

42378885,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJmn,1476191139,Is Blockchain Beating Bitcoin? TechCrunch's New Series Weighs In,"What is the blockchain? Where did bitcoin come from? And are bitcoin and blockchain still competing?  These are the kinds of questions up for grabs in TechCrunch's new streaming series, ""Trust Disrupted: Bitcoin and the Blockchain"". Launching yesterday, the show explores how global finance is being forced to change and adapt thanks to the arrival of this technology.  Narrated by New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper, the series seeks to answer the all-too-difficult question of what actually makes a blockchain. Taken a step further, it explores how the same entities that bitcoin hoped to disrupt – banks, financial institutions and governments – are now looking at the blockchain as a way of streamlining or improving how they work.  The series, broken into six episodes, is to be released over the rest of the week.  Bitcoin vs blockchain  The series features commentary from well-known industry voices like Gavin Andresen, one of the earliest bitcoin developers; Vitalik Buterin, creator of ethereum; and Fred Wilson, founding partner at Union Square Ventures, with each one giving their own take on the definition of ""blockchain"".  Wilson, in particular, offered a clear-cut reason for his bullish attitude on blockchain tech, explaining that many of the largest companies today control vast bulks of user data, which creates an environment ripe for disruption.  ""Every time somebody amasses one of these big monopolies, something comes along that is a complete and total game changer and I think it's blockchain technology,"" Wilson said.  Yet, as the first episode showcases, there's a real struggle between those that look at bitcoin the currency as the true innovation and those that are looking to leverage the underlying technology for other use cases.  On one hand, there’s Charley Cooper, managing director at blockchain consortium R3CEV, who suggested that moving away from the ""founding principles of bitcoin"" to a focus on blockchain and distributed ledger technology is the right approach.  Larry Summers, former US Secretary of the Treasury, echoed Cooper's points, suggesting that those that believe bitcoin is going to become a savior currency are wrong, but that the blockchain could help reduce financial frictions.  But then there’s Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor, who believes that these non-bitcoin focused projects are actually a sign that bitcoin, itself, is winning.  He said:  ""Now this many other people are interested in this technology ... that’s pretty exciting. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Western Union are here and in this space, that means we’re winning.""  Mining deep dive  In the second episode, Popper introduces the history of the growth of bitcoin mining from ""the fanatics who had fallen in love with this idea [bitcoin]"" to the ""specialized profession"" its become today.  But what's essentially occurred, Popper explained, is that only people that have access to cheap computer hardware and access to cheap electricity are those that can mine bitcoin profitably.  ""Right now, the place where those things are easiest to find are China,"" he said.  The episode then takes users into an unknown bitcoin mine in the Szechuan province, where 15 people work and live to keep an eye on the bitcoin miners that are always running. Due to the perfect storm that Popper described, these remote parts of southwestern China are seeing a huge explosion in new mine launches.  But with 60-75% of all mining power done in China, there are some that have expressed concern in the episode, including Dave Carlson, founder of US-based MegaBigPower.  ""Think about the possibility that, due to a governmental ruling or something, no transactions originating in the US for bitcoin should be accepted to any of the blocks in China,"" he said, adding:  ""That’s a very scary, scary concept.""  Luckily, for now, the show succeeds in making it entertaining.

42378884,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJlX,1476187314,Digital Asset Latest to File Blockchain Patent Application,"Digital Asset Holdings (DAH) has joined the growing number of startups and incumbents looking to file patents related to distributed ledger tech.  The patent application for an ""Intermediary Electronic Settlement Platform"", filed in April and published by the US Patent and Trademark Office on Friday, is for a method of trading a wide range of traditional digital assets on a distributed ledger, including, but not limited to, a blockchain.  Among the key differentiators between DAH's solution and more traditional open-source blockchains are an attention to regulatory demands and a diverse set of demands upon the network's nodes.  From the patent:  ""Some nodes, such as signing servers, for example, may optionally store only a partial copy of the distributed blockchain.""  In addition to providing a modified version of how distributed nodes operate, the patent makes explicitly clear that it is designed to serve as a more regulatory-friendly way to trade a number of assets, including fungible assets, references to title for an asset and other obligations and authorizations.  Specifically, the settlement platform includes some nodes that store a complete version of the data history on multiple interface servers, client machines, a persistence unit, a cache unit and a coordination unit coupled to the data server.  But this isn’t the only difference between Digital Asset’s platform and a public blockchain.  The network also includes multiple provisions to help make it easier for the platform's users to be compliant with required standards of transparency, risk management and regulation.  From the application:  ""By utilizing a digital asset intermediary electronic settlement platform in accordance with the principles of the present inventive concept, trusted third parties can continue to monitor and exercise behavioral control of digital assets without having to be the legal custodian. This allows users to truly control their assets, and trusted third parties to continue to enforce legal behavior and provide settlement efficiencies.""  Fertile territory  Until recently, the New York-based startup that has raised a total of more than $60m venture capital appears to have been focused on using its technology to help other companies build their own proofs-of-concept, including the DTCC back in March, and most recently Six Securities, earlier this month.  But with the publication of the patent application DAH's next steps may now be more clear. (DAH did not reply to request for further comment).  Application number 62178315 was published the same day the office published an application by Nasdaq for a ""closed blockchain"" order book and matching engine. Both patents deal with ways to record data on a blockchain and execute trades.  In August, CoinDesk published an article titled ""The Looming War For Blockchain Patents"" focusing on several instances of what was then more than 60 patents featuring blockchain.  That number is now up to 74, and presumably, still counting. A search for the word bitcoin now reveals 574 pending patent applications.
