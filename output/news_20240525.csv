28453992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609819,1716678002,Why Did CORE Price Surge 20% While The Crypto Market Dumped?,"CORE, the native token of the layer-1 network CoreChain, has surged over 20% in the last 24 hours. This is a notable price increase, considering the downward trend in the broader crypto market with the prices of other major cap tokens, including Ethereum (ETH) dumping. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree Why CORE Soared By Over 20% CORE’s price rallied by over 20% following crypto exchange Coinbase’s decision to add the crypto token to its listing ‘Roadmap.’ That means the foremost US crypto exchange plans to list CORE at some point, although it hasn’t disclosed exactly when that will happen. Regardless, this is undoubtedly a positive development for the CORE ecosystem, given the exposure and mass adoption it could gain from being listed on Coinbase. CORE runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-1 blockchain CoreChain. The network is unique because it adopts a ‘Satoshi Plus’ consensus mechanism. This mechanism adopts Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) and Ethereum’s delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) mechanism to address the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and security. CORE has already had quite a year, considering it is one of the best-performing crypto assets among the top 100 coins by market cap, with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 265%. This feat is more commendable given that only three crypto tokens (Dogwifhat, PEPE, and Arweave) in the top 50 rankings have made more YTD gains than CORE. Interestingly, most of CORE’s price gains came in the weeks leading up to the Bitcoin halving, with the crypto’s price skyrocketing by over 220% in a single week. CORE’s interoperability with Bitcoin also gives it an edge, with the network launching ‘CoreBTC,’ which allows users to bridge their BTC tokens to the network, thereby tapping into the liquidity on the flagship network, Bitcoin. Coinbase On A Roll Coinbase’s decision to add CORE to its list listing roadmap follows its recent listing of XRP and BONK for its New York customers. The crypto exchange’s decision to relist XRP undoubtedly raised eyebrows, considering it had delisted the crypto token in 2021, shortly after the legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple began. Meanwhile, BONK’s listing has caused many in the crypto community to question when the crypto exchange will also list meme coins, Dogwifhat, and PEPE. Coinbase’s hesitation to list these two meme coins continues to be a surprise, given that they are the fourth and third largest meme coins by market cap, respectively. Related Reading: Uniswap Shoots Past $10 On 15% Price Explosion – Here’s The Trigger Meanwhile, Coinbase International Exchange also recently announced that it will add support for Bonk, FLOKI, and Shiba Inu perpetual futures on its platform and Coinbase Advanced.

28449913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609835,1716670845,Shiba Inu On The Verge Of 600% Rally? Analyst Weighs In,"Shiba Inu, known as the “Dogecoin Killer,” is eagerly anticipating a significant price leap. Market analyst Ashish has sparked excitement with a bold prediction: a 600% surge that could catapult the meme coin to an impressive $0.000075. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree This bullish forecast comes after what Ashish describes as a nearly two-year-long slumber within a consolidation pattern. December 2023 saw Shiba Inu finally break free from this price purgatory, breaching a crucial resistance trendline. The breakout ignited a rally that culminated in a 370% surge, reaching a 2024 high of $0.000045 in early March. However, the party wasn’t meant to last. A correction ensued, prompting Ashish to establish strategic buying zones between $0.000022 and $0.000025. Shiba Inu: Enter The Flag Pattern Ashish’s crystal ball sees a bullish flag pattern emerging on the 1-hour chart, hinting at a potential “second leg up.” This technical indicator suggests a period of consolidation following a sharp price increase, often acting as a precursor to another upward movement. Despite a slight price dip today, Shiba Inu appears to have room for growth. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at nearly 48, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral territory suggests potential for upward movement, aligning with Ashish’s prediction of a second leg up. SHIB Price Forecast Meanwhile, CoinCodex’s current Shiba Inu price prediction forecasts a rise of 220%, potentially reaching $0.00008089 by June 24, 2024. CoinCodex’s technical indicators currently show a Neutral sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 76, indicating Extreme Greed. Over the past 30 days, Shiba Inu has seen 12 out of 30 green days (40%) with a price volatility of 4.40%. Given these metrics, it’s clear that Shiba Inu’s market behavior is capturing significant investor interest. The Extreme Greed reading on the Fear & Greed Index suggests a high level of enthusiasm, which, while positive for potential price gains, also warrants caution due to the possibility of rapid sentiment shifts. The coin’s moderate volatility and the occurrence of green days indicate a steady, albeit unpredictable, upward momentum. This combination of factors makes Shiba Inu a fascinating asset to watch in the coming months. Related Reading: Next Big Move For Bitcoin: Analysts Predict A Potential Breakout At $71,500 As of today, the overall sentiment for the Shiba Inu price prediction is neutral. This assessment is supported by technical analysis indicators, where 20 indicators are showing bullish signals, while eight are signaling bearish trends. This balanced sentiment reflects the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. The fact that a significant number of indicators are bullish suggests there is optimism about Shiba Inu’s short-term potential, possibly driven by recent market activities or positive news.

Trump tightened his recent embrace of crypto today, posting on social media, ""I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,"" as both sides in the upcoming presidential election appear to be seeking to win over pro-crypto voters.  ""Our country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place,"" Trump posted on Truth Social prior to his address at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C., later today.  Trump then took a shot at his rival: ""Crooked Joe Biden, on the other hand, the worst president in the history of our country, wants it to die a slow and painful death.""     The sentiment toward crypto has noticeably warmed in Washington since Trump has deliberately sought to woo pro-crypto voters. First, the former president made pro-crypto comments earlier this month at a Mar-a-Lago dinner. Then this past Tuesday, Trump's presidential campaign began accepting crypto donations, making good on the presumptive Republican nominee's pledge to become the first major party candidate to embrace bitcoin, ether and other digital currencies.  Following Trump's pro-crypto rhetoric and actions, the Biden administration's opposition to crypto as well as the attitude of the traditionally crypto-adverse Securities and Exchange Commission appear to have softened. Last Wednesday, the White House issued a statement expressing its opposition to the House of Representatives passing a crypto market structure bill, but Biden didn't threaten a veto. The House proceeded to approve the measure, which now heads to the Senate. Then on Thursday, the ether exchange traded funds (ETF) took a major step toward becoming available in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved key regulatory filings. Such an approval was seen as extremely unlikely just a month ago.

Brandt boldly predicts that this catastrophe will be linked to cryptocurrency staking and the people involved in it. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree Staking Could Lead To Crypto’s Greatest Disaster In an X (formerly Twitter) post on May 24, Brandt labeled crypto staking as one of the biggest threats to the digital currency space. According to the analyst, staking could become the harbinger of disaster for the industry, potentially causing the decline of the market’s reputation and leading to financial losses for traders. For more clarity, staking is a popular practice in the crypto industry that involves locking assets for an extended period to help support the blockchain. This allows token holders to participate as validators of the blockchain and earn staking rewards. Brandt cautioned that digital currency enthusiasts and traders involved in staking should be careful as it could potentially lead to bankruptcy and loss of fortune. He believes that staking may bring shocking future events that could possibly devastate the space. In a follow-up post, the trader outlined a progression of events related to staking, highlighting its potential negative impacts on the market. He disclosed that crypto staking involves owning, borrowing or leveraging an asset such as Solana and Ethereum. These assets are usually lent out to earn possible revenue, often in the form of interest. As staking becomes more widespread and accepted, it could attract the attention and involvement of Central Banks, government treasuries and other governmental authorities. Brandt reveals that this attention may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of the staking process by the government. Consequently, the introduction of new regulations would have a detrimental effect on the crypto space, fundamentally changing the industry or possibly leading to the end of staking. Crypto Community Up In Arms Before issuing his controversial statement about crypto staking, Brandt disclosed that his opinions may not be well received by supporters of popular digital assets such as Ethereum and Solana. True to this prediction, many community members dismissed Brandt’s warning that staking could potentially bring disaster to the crypto space. A crypto member criticized Brandt for his statement, asserting that the crypto trader was uninformed about staking processes and was overstating the impacts of staking by claiming it would result in a “disaster.” Another crypto member had argued that Brandt’s definition of staking was factually incorrect. He clarified that staking was a process of using coins or tokens to verify and secure the consensus mechanism of a blockchain.

In a recent analysis, Tardigrade expressed a highly optimistic view of Solana’s future price trajectory. According to the analyst, SOL, currently trading at $170, has successfully broken free from its recent consolidation pattern, signifying a bullish charge towards a staggering $1,000 mark. Macro structure $SOL 🔥#Solana has broken out the 2nd triangle from the recent bottom and is heading to $1000 🚀 Have you heard about #socialfi on #Solana?

One such development is the rise of SocialFi applications, a new wave of social media platforms built on blockchain technology. While short-term price fluctuations saw a 4.50% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 1.30% decline over the past week, the overall outlook for SOL remains upbeat. Market observers are particularly enthusiastic about both the immediate and long-term prospects for the cryptocurrency. Ethereum ETF Approval Impact The recent green light for the highly anticipated Ethereum ETF is expected to have a ripple effect, positively impacting the entire altcoin market, including Solana. This market-wide bullish sentiment could propel SOL prices even higher. The Ethereum ETF’s approval not only signifies increased institutional trust in the cryptocurrency market but also paves the way for other blockchain projects to gain mainstream attention. As more investors become comfortable with cryptocurrency investments through regulated financial products, altcoins like Solana are poised to benefit from increased liquidity and wider adoption.

28439123,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609796,1716652240,Bitcoin Spot ETF Records Consecutive Weeks Of Inflows As Investor Confidence Grows,"Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) have been the talk of the town – and rightly so – after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of the investment products during the week. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin spot ETF market continued its resurgence on one side, marked by a second consecutive week of positive inflows. This streak of positive inflows represents a complete shift from previous weeks when investment activity was dangerously low. However, this recent turnaround reflects a rise in investor confidence over the past two weeks. Bitcoin Spot ETF: $252 Million In Net Inflows In One Day On Friday, May 24, the US Bitcoin spot ETF market saw another day of positive inflows, marking the 10th consecutive day of significant investment into these funds. According to data from SoSoValue, the market recorded a total net inflow of approximately $252 million to close the week. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Takes The Lead With 13% Surge Post Ethereum ETF Approval – Key Levels To Watch Breaking this down, BlackRock amassed a substantial percentage of the total daily investment, with the IBIT ETF posting an inflow of $182 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), on the other hand, did not attract any capital on Friday, ending the week with zero daily outflows and inflow. Other ETF issuers, such as Fidelity, Bitwise, and ARK Investment, also witnessed impressive inflows on Friday. Most notably, Fidelity’s FBTC came second to BlackRock’s fund after attracting about $43.7 million on the last day of the week. More importantly, this positive inflow day means that the Bitcoin spot ETF market has amassed significant investment every day for the second week in a row. And after the close of Friday’s trading session, the net inflow in the past week stood at an impressive $1.06 billion. This sustained positive trend in terms of capital inflow suggests that investor confidence in Bitcoin ETFs might be back at an all-time high. The last time there was a consistent positive capital inflow into these products, the Bitcoin price rose to a new all-time high. With Ethereum spot ETFs on the brink of trading in the US, crypto exchange-trade products seem to be in fashion at the moment. And they might just be the catalyst that the crypto market – particularly Bitcoin – needs to resume what is left of the bull cycle. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $68,868, reflecting a 2.5% price increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by 3% on the weekly timeframe.

Bitcoin has lagged behind the stock market's rise to new all-time highs in May, which may indicate a negative shift in market liquidity. The historical trading evidence suggests Bitcoin tends to peak before the S&P 500 index, making it a potential indicator of future stock market direction. Falling Bitcoin prices in June-July would be a bearish development for the S&P 500 and Wall Street generally. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ups and downs in price since inception can almost entirely be traced to two factors - financial system liquidity changes and investor desires to own a ""decentralized"" digital currency as a hedge against fiat money printing. Honestly, without deficit-happy government spending around the world, I doubt Bitcoin would have a good reason to exist. Believe it or not, this makes Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies as a group) an excellent indicator of future stock market action, functioning as a grand risk-on money flow indicator. When you do the research, Bitcoin tends to lead the stock market for trend (both up and down), by varying degrees over its short history from invention in January 2009. In terms of confirming the U.S. stock market's S&P 500 rise to new all-time highs in May 2024, problems are developing. Bitcoin has actually failed to keep pace with equity trading gains since the 2021 top, and has lagged badly for percentage performance since March of this year. What this may be telling investors is net liquidity has been shifting from excessive levels of money floating around the financial markets (which helped propel price above $73,000 in March) to something akin to tightening credit conditions. It could be a signal: (1) consumers have spent all of their COVID pandemic stimulus-check windfall in aggregate, (2) continuing high rates of 4% inflation are sapping wealth and confidence, and (3) the negative effects of an inverted Treasury yield curve over 18 months are finally squeezing bank lending as a whole (measured since October 2022, looking at 3-month vs. 30-year securities). Another worry, 2023-24 Federal Reserve ""promises"" of lower interest rates may prove illusory until a recession sends inflation back to the central bank's 2% stated goal. If anything, inflation rates appear to have bottomed in the 3% to 3.5% YoY range during early 2024, as numerous commodities have jumped in price since March and wage growth remains stubbornly high. So, if the logical trading conclusion is Bitcoin peaks first when system liquidity is highest, the absence of a new record in May with the S&P 500 all-time move should leave observers a little concerned. Looking into the future, Bitcoin ""should"" slide faster in price before the S&P 500 is hit hard by selling over coming months. This trading assumption fits in nicely with evidence of a slowing economy in April-May. Let's review past Bitcoin to S&P 500 patterns. StockCharts.com - Bitcoin in US Dollars, 12 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes The Historical Trading Evidence The main point I want to highlight in this article is Bitcoin has a history of peaking before the S&P 500 index, represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). Unfortunately, it doesn't have much of a track record for predicting exact equity market bottoms. When liquidity conditions are clearly tightening through rising interest rates like in 2018-19 or 2022, Bitcoin has been a horrible investment to own. A cautionary note for Bitcoin bulls is we don't have much trading history on what it will do during a severe and prolonged economic downturn, since its only recession experience was the short-lived 2020 pandemic period. YCharts - Bitcoin $US, Since 2015, Recession Shaded My statistical analysis for this article starts with a longer-term chart comparing trading action between the two asset classes back to June 2017. At this moment, Bitcoin was reaching conversation in the mainstream media on strong price gains. The bottom section is my bread-and-butter focus, where I am graphing Bitcoin price action ""relative"" to the S&P 500 index. YCharts - Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 ETF, Price Changes, Since June 2017 The overriding problem for Bitcoin perma-bulls is the U.S. stock market has bested digital cryptocurrency performance since May 2021 (the majority of cryptos have risen even less than Bitcoin), a good three years ago. Had you sold your crypto positions and exchanged them for an S&P 500 ETF 36 months ago, you would have more money in your pocket today. I am viewing this long-term situation as a liquidity non-confirmation of the 2024 all-time highs in the U.S. stock market. Sure, the S&P 500 is higher than late 2021 (with gains led by a handful of Big Techs), but underlying liquidity in the financial system is the same or lower. Moving short-term bank interest rates from ZERO to 5%+ over this span has something to do with it. 2018 Perhaps more interesting and useful in today's conversation, we can review the month-to-month changes in Bitcoin vs. the S&P 500. If we travel back to late 2017, Bitcoin spiked in price then tumbled throughout 2018. I have marked with a red circle, the ""lead"" time cryptos gave investors to be careful in portfolio weightings to equities. Two months later, the S&P 500 fell -10% in price over a week. Again, during September 2018, the stock market reached new all-time highs, not confirmed by Bitcoin. A -20% bear market ran its course into late December bringing Wall Street back to early 2017 quote levels. For reference, between December 2017 and December 2018, Bitcoin collapsed -85% in price! YCharts - Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 ETF, Price Changes, Sept 2017 to Dec 2018, Author Reference Point 2019-20 Again, Bitcoin peaked relative to stocks in June 2019 (circled in red). The stock market would continue higher for another six months, despite severely tightening credit in the financial system including a minor Treasury yield curve inversion. Then the COVID pandemic showed up, with mandated economic closures creating a recession. The S&P 500 erased several years of gains over two months, imploding by -30%. Bitcoin would end up tanking -70% in price between June 2019 and March 2020! YCharts - Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 ETF, Price Changes, Apr 2019 to Apr 2020, Author Reference Point 2021-22 The pandemic-induced government money printing, debt relief, payroll loans and direct check handouts pushed ""liquidity"" to new modern highs in America during 2021. Both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 welcomed monster bull moves on the bailouts starting in April 2020, that truly accelerated in the first part of 2021. Bitcoin peaked in March of that year (circled in red) on a relative basis (stocks would rise faster after this point), indicating liquidity was getting overcooked. Yet, the S&P 500 would move in a positive direction for another nine months into yearend. What we learned... less aggressive gains in Bitcoin presaged trouble ahead for stocks, while the January-October 2022 period proved quite difficult for Wall Street. The S&P 500 index fell around -25% measured from top to bottom, while Bitcoin was hit with a -75% shellacking from its November 2021 nominal peak. YCharts - Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 ETF, Price Changes, Jan 2021 to Oct 2022, Author Reference Point 2024 (Present) That's why investors need to keep an eye on Bitcoin prices going forward, even if you don't own cryptocurrencies. The March spike in Bitcoin on groundbreaking SEC ETF approvals may have marked another high-water mark for cryptos (circled in red). If Bitcoin and digital cryptos succumb to heavy selling in June-July, the stock market outlook will sour dramatically for the second half of 2024 and early 2025. The "" Sell in May, and Go Away "" calendar-timing mantra may prove very prophetic this year. I guess we will find out soon enough. YCharts - Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 ETF, Price Changes, 6 Months - 2024, Author Reference Point Final Thoughts If you are bullish on U.S. stocks, you should be cheering on Bitcoin, plain and simple. Given immediate-future Bitcoin and crypto market weakness, liquidity in the financial system could be moving into reverse. Assuming liquidity dries up, stock market gains will be incredibly difficult to achieve in my view. Standing near a modern-record 3x price to sales and 5x price to book value ratio for the S&P 500 names, with completely inflated equity valuations as a function of 10-year cycle-adjusted earnings (the Shiller CAPE Ratio), downside potential is exceptionally large for Wall Street the remainder of 2024. Don't kid yourself. Multipl.com - S&P 500, Price to Trailing Sales, Since 2001 Multipl.com - S&P 500, Price to Book Value, Since 2001 Multipl.com - U.S. Stock Market, CAPE Ratio, Since 1870 Different measures of liquidity have been going in the wrong direction all year. Below is a graph of performance from the Dow Jones Transportation and Utility Averages , plus Vanguard Real Estate ETF ( VNQ ), iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ), and Nasdaq Bank Index . The opposite of flashing green on a healthy stock market advance by blue chips in America, lagging performance from these sectors may be hinting a contraction in market liquidity and the economy is close at hand. YCharts - S&P 500 ETF vs. Liquidity Sectors, Since January 1st, 2024 Please don't assume stocks cannot or will not fall hard into 2025. If a recession is next, with quickly falling liquidity in the financial system, the idea of investment ""risk"" should not be discounted lightly. Under this scenario both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin pricing could move backwards in lockstep for many months. Liquidity crunches do not mix well with extended valuations. Just ask investors in 1929 or 1987 or 2000 or 2022 how things worked out. The fascinating part of the 2024 investment equation is we just experienced a similar macro trading setup in 2021. Are major price drops guaranteed for both? No, but further Bitcoin declines from $68,000 today will only add to the argument real trouble is coming for Wall Street, perhaps sooner than most are prepared for. For some peace of mind, I suggest owning hedges like rising gold/silver bullion, above-normal weightings in cash earning sizable yields of 5%+ today, index put options (which are available at the cheapest premiums for downside protection in many years right now), and even some short positions to offset potential macroeconomic headwinds in your portfolio. I personally hold ProShares Short QQQ ETF ( PSQ ) and ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF ( SH ) stakes in my tax-deferred accounts as a way to both earn yield and protect against equity downside. I have talked about their double-duty advantages in the current market setup, PSQ here and SH here . Thanks for reading. Please consider this article a first step in your due diligence process.

28434927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609797,1716645055,Ethereum Price Consolidates: Here Are The Next Key Levels To Watch,"Over some days, the price of Ethereum has been in a consolidation zone, moving between $3,949 and $3,627. This is a result of the rally that happened a few days ago which led to the crypto asset’s price making over 10% movement on the upside. When prices are consolidating, it can only be considered that it is building momentum to either break above the consolidation zone or below it. At this point, we cannot tell the next action the price will take. In this article, we will see the possible outcome if there is a break out from the consolidation. As of the time of writing, the price of ETH was up by 0.66%, trading around $3,752 above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the last 24 hours. Ethereum On The 4-Hour Chart Looking at Ethereum’s chart on the 4-hour timeframe, it can observed that the price is trading above the 100-day moving average, suggesting ETH’s price is on a bullish trend and could break above the consolidation zone. Also, with the help of the MACD indicator, although the MACD histograms are trending below the MACD zero line, these are already showing signs of weakness as the histogram color is becoming faint. The MACD line and the MACD signal line are also seen moving toward the MACD zero line but as long as they are still above the zero line, there could be a possible reverser. With this MACD formation, it could be suggested that the price of Ethereum is still bullish and there is a possibility it could break above the consolidation zone Finally, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also to analyze the price action in the 4-hour timeframe, it can be seen that the RSI line is attempting to back up after failing to cross below the 50 lines, suggesting that the price is still bullish. Possible Outcomes If There Is A Breakout In Either Direction Conclusively, if there is a break out above the consolidation zone, the price of ETH might continue to move upward toward the $4,094 resistance level. Should the price surpass this resistance level, it might move further upward to create a new high for the year. On the contrary, if Ethereum breaks below the consolidation zone, the price might begin to move toward the $3,263 support level. A breakout below this level might cause a continuous downward movement toward the $2,864.04 support level.

28434466,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609816,1716638435,"Terra LUNA’s LUNC Set To Jump 13x, Analyst Reveals The Drivers","Crypto analyst Javon Marks has laid out a bullish narrative for Terra Classic (LUNC). Based on his analysis, the crypto token could eventually see a 13x increase from its current price levels. The analyst alluded to LUNC’s historical pattern as what could drive such parabolic price surge. Related Reading: XRP Declares War On Uncertainty: Analyst Predicts Breakout Fueled By Regulation How LUNC’s Price Could Jump By 1,300% Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LUNC has confirmed a “major bullish pattern,” signaling a continuation of its bullish run to the first price target at $0.00058046. He noted that this move of over 400% was likely to be attained with the crypto token holding above levels that it had earlier broken out from. The crypto analyst then raised the possibility of LUNC making a 1,300% move instead. He claimed that LUNC’s previous breakout and run pattern suggests that three targets could be broken above, meaning that the crypto token rising to the price target of $0.00139122 from here is “possible.” Marks has remained bullish on LUNC for a while now and has suggested that LUNC’s parabolic rally is a question of when and not if. However, he has failed to provide any specific timeframe for when this move will likely occur. LUNC’s fundamentals are also expected to contribute to this upward trend and push its price to such heights. One way that is likely to happen is through the LUNC’s burns, which are carried out regularly. The Terra community has burnt over 113 billion LUNC tokens since the burning initiative came into place following Terra LUNA’s crash in 2022. This has helped reduce the crypto tokens’s circulating supply and could be significant as demand for the token picks up. It is worth noting that LUNC is well below its all-time high of $119. However, this suggests that the crypto token has enough room to move significantly to the upside. Recent Developments In The Terra Classic Ecosystem Genuine Labs, a Terra Classic developer group, recently announced that the latest version of SDK 47 was ready. The proposed upgrade is expected to be put up for governance voting. The upgrade will introduce significant changes to the Terra network, including a fix to the dyncomm decorator. Furthermore, the upgrade will handle peer-to-peer (p2p) storms on the network and add new features to the Terrad client, which connects developers to the Terra blockchain. It is uncertain when the proposal will go live, but it should be soon enough. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree Meanwhile, the Terra community also recently passed a proposal to make Allnodes an official organization for the community. Allnodes will be the official source for information regarding the circulating supply of LUNC, USTC, and other native tokens. At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at around $0.0001151, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

While Bitcoin did rise to $71,443 in the past week, the token soon suffered a retracement falling as low as $66,936. Interestingly, renowned analyst with X handle Rekt Capital has provided an interesting insight into this recent price movement and also predicted the period BTC may finally embark on a highly-anticipated bullish run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters Make Or Break Zone: Analyst Reveals Important Levels To Watch Bitcoin To Consolidate For A Long Time – Analyst In a series of X posts on May 24, Rekt Capital noted that after the halving event, Bitcoin entered the “post-halving danger zone”, a period during which the token lost about 11% of its value. Following this phase, the most-priced cryptocurrency attempted a breakout which encountered a rejection at the range high zone ($71,500) of the macro re-accumulation range. #BTC Since the Bitcoin Post-Halving “Danger Zone” ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71500 However, ~$71500 is where the Range High resistance of the Macro Re-Accumulation Range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from The consolidation continues and history suggest it will… https://t.co/YjZzimnFj9 pic.twitter.com/JGji7ZYOSe — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 24, 2024 For context, this range represents a long-term consolidation phase where Bitcoin accumulates value before potentially breaking out to new highs. Rekt Capital states that Bitcoin being rejected at the $71,500 price region is quite expected as BTC never breaks through the high side of the re-accumulation range on the first attempt after halving. Based on historical price data, Rekt Capital anticipates Bitcoin will now remain in consolidation for multiple weeks until 160 days after halving before finally experiencing its major price breakout in September. During this time, the premier cryptocurrency is expected to trade between $60,000 and $70,000 which will result in variations in the portfolio valuation for long-term investors. However, this price consolidation can also present opportunities for these investors to buy Bitcoin near the lower boundary of the range thus consistently accumulating at relatively stable prices. Meanwhile, short-term traders such as swing traders or day traders are likely to capitalize on these expected price fluctuations between an established support and resistance which could result in significant profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Gain Breathing Room As Long-Term Holder Activity Eases – Glassnode BTC Price Overview Bitcoin is currently trading at $68,720, marking a 2.27% gain in the last day, a 2.31% gain over the past week, and a 6.90% increase in the last month.

This bullish run comes amid positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and Uniswap’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Tiny Pepe, Big Dreams: Memecoin Explodes, Eyes Dominance In The Dog House Riding The Ethereum Wave Beyond the legal battle, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is also propelling UNI’s price upwards. On-chain data reveals significant whale withdrawals from crypto exchanges following news of a potential spot Ethereum ETF. Another fresh wallet withdrew 213,166 UNI($1.96M) from #Binance just now.https://t.co/u15CE864hm pic.twitter.com/kyOBv0TB5G — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 24, 2024 This flight to safety, coupled with the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, is creating a ripple effect that benefits UNI, a key player within the Ethereum DeFi landscape. From a technical standpoint, UNI’s breakout from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Both technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential 25% price increase for UNI. The token’s recent surge indicates a potential bull run, with analysts eyeing a price target of $12.80 if the current momentum continues. Adding fuel to the fire is Santiment’s Age Consumed index, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. Spikes in this index often precede price rallies, and the latest uptick by the latter part of April seems to have foreshadowed UNI’s current uptrend. This on-chain metric reinforces the bullish outlook for UNI, suggesting that investors are awakening to its potential. Short Sellers Get Burned As Bulls Take Charge The recent price rally has also been accompanied by a significant rise in trading activity. Data from Coinalyze reveals over $1 million in Uniswap liquidations in the last day. The majority of these liquidations (over $750,000) were short positions, indicating that traders betting against UNI are feeling the heat. This surge in open interest, with more traders going long on UNI, further strengthens the bullish control over the token’s price. Uniswap Takes A Stand Against The SEC This display of defiance has instilled confidence among investors, who view it as a positive sign for Uniswap’s future. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) recently received a Wells notice from the regulatory body, alleging that UNI is a security. However, Uniswap has vowed to challenge this claim, asserting that the SEC’s case is weak. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree The SEC case against Uniswap remains unresolved, and a negative outcome could dampen investor sentiment.

The company is focusing on efficiency gains through measures such as acquiring more data center capacity and using more efficient mining rigs. Volatility should persist in the short term. Marathon has the financial capacity to finance its expansion plans and enough Bitcoins to cover operational expenses, putting it in a strong position to tackle Bitcoin halving. Since I covered Marathon ( MARA ) on February 19, it went up from $24.5 to $31 one week later which was in line with my bullish position, but subsequently slid to $15. As charted below, it has partly recovered since the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) halving event dating April 19 and is trading around $21, but this upside is not likely to be sustained in the short term given crypto supply coming from miners likely to put prices under pressure. Data by YCharts However, this thesis aims to show that it remains a fundamentally strong miner as progress is being made on the efficiency front to tackle halving which will dent revenues and profits. Also, it has enough capital to scale rapidly to attain growth objectives. Therefore, I have a Buy position and start by detailing why my initial bullish thesis was not sustained in the medium term. Volatility Caused by Mining Difficulty and ETF-Related Demand First, I had warned about the increasing mining difficulty likely to result in volatility. The reason for this is since halving reduces mining rewards by half, or from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for each new block produced and added to the blockchain, miners generally boosted production in the period before the event. Now, given this is a highly competitive space where miners use the Proof of Work mechanism to solve an encryption puzzle, the mining process only got more difficult (or time-consuming). Thus, as shown in the chart below, average difficulty peaked at 87 in early May, a new record compared to 77.6 in February. Data by YCharts For investors, each time a peak is reached, there is volatility, both for crypto and miners as shown in the charts below which illustrate such an episode that occurred in December-January. This was a relatively short period as demarked by the two blue lines with Marathon recouping its losses versus BTC within a month. Based on this, I had anticipated the volatility period for February to be of a short duration too. However, I was proved wrong as the volatility episode whose start is marked by the brown line has persisted even today with the stock still underperforming BTC. Charts were prepared using data from (seekingalpha.com) The reason seems related to the pent-up demand for ETFs as investment vehicles since the Security and Exchange Commission approved ten spot ETFs in January. Thus, with investors benefiting from more choice, there was some rotation out of miners into the ETF space which is also likely to continue as more wealth advisers offer crypto products to clients like retirement pension accounts. The question is whether, after the assets (under management) held by ETFs increase over time, money flows could again normalize benefiting the miner. For this to happen, Marathon needs to have solid finances that enable it to increase production capacity while at the same time exhibiting efficiency gains, These are important to face halving, which, depending on what extent the miner boosts production, could see its revenues decrease by half. Also, from the profitability standpoint, the industry average break-even and post-halving price for Bitcoin mining is expected to surge to around $43K compared to only $23K in March. Focusing on Efficiency Gains First looking at the income statement for the first quarter of 2024 (Q1) which ended in March, the miner reported a net income of $337 million or an 184% YoY increase. Noteworthily, this increase does not reflect the effects of Bitcoin halving that occurred on April 19. It was mainly driven by a favorable Bitcoin price which reached a record 73K at the end of March, combined with higher production. However, during the same period, G&A (General and administrative) expenses increased by 91% YoY to $21 million, incurred mostly to scale up the business. This means that the margin gain was achieved mostly on the back of strong revenue growth of 223% YoY, but, looking ahead, the company has been taking the following measures to increase efficiency. First, it has been shifting away from an asset-light strategy as it acquires more data center capacity rather than leasing. In this way, it has increased energized capacity from 584 megawatts to 1.1 gigawatts, with the primary benefit of such a move being a reduction in operating costs, namely in terms of the energy required for mining rigs. This can be potentially reduced from 0.02 KW-hour to $ 0.01-$0.015 KW-hour, resulting in 25% to 50% of cost savings, and this is for 54% of its mining portfolio. This depends on factors including location and the cooling method used where Marathon has developed the 2PIC immersion technology. Second, it plans to add more compute power to the mining pool or 50 exahash by year-end compared to the 27 exahash at the end of Q1 which means a larger scale of operations to spread fixed costs resulting in higher gross margins. For this purpose, its gross margin of 44% is already 2.5 times higher than Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT ), another large miner, while it has grown revenue faster during the last three years. Comparison of Metrics (seekingalpha.com) Third, more efficient mining rigs like S21 machines from Bitmain could be available at “essentially” the same price (as older ones). The reason is the halving paves the way for reduced mining participation caused by smaller miners who have not cut costs on time being forced out thereby causing an oversupply in mining rigs. Fourth, it has restructured operations to grow in a more agile way with its core business to be known as Utility-Scale Mining. At the same time, to better monetize its expertise, two other business units have been created. One of them is Technological Innovations involving the development and sales of advanced technologies like 2PIC. The other is Energy Harvesting which aims to use renewable energy like collecting methane from landfills to power Bitcoin miners. Now, as the world's largest Bitcoin miner, both on a market cap and production capacity (hash rate) basis, scaling further while at the same time, gaining in operational efficiency puts it in a strong position to tackle halving, but, having a strong balance sheet is key. Ability to Finance Expansion Now to finance the expansion of its energized facilities and acquisition of new sites, it had recourse to its ATM program in Q1 which saw it offering securities worth $200 million. In this respect, it acquired two sites in Texas and Nebraska for $179 million to more than double its hash rate from 11 exahash to 27.8 exahash. This aggressive acquisition strategy also distinguishes it from other miners in an industry where the tendency is to lease compute. Now, its treasury held 7,320 Bitcoin worth around $512.4 million considering a price of $70K per coin. Additionally, the balance sheet boasted $324.3 million of cash. Also, as per the CFO, it disposes of its crypto assets only to fund operating expenses . Therefore, during Q2 which will cover halving, one can expect the sale of more Bitcoins than usual to cover the revenue deficit, especially since it will have to incur more operating expenses after scaling rapidly. Still, for risk-averse investors, according to Marathon's CEO during Q1's earnings call on May 9, there was ample capital to scale to 50 exahash, implying that there was neither need to tap the debt market nor raise capital for the purpose. To achieve its production target, the company can also rely on the energized space left when the leases of hosted customers currently occupying the newly acquired expire in Q2, and they vacate. Now, the company expansion strategy may be helped by smaller miners ceasing activities as they find it impossible to cover operational costs because of lower Bitcoin prices, which puts pressure on them to dispose of their assets. They may also be insufficiently capitalized and find it difficult to refinance at the higher prevailing interest rates. In consequence, troubled assets would represent an opportunity for Marathon to expand at a relatively lower cost, but there have been no signs of miner capitulation yet and Bitcoin only briefly touched the $57K level. A Buy Amid Crypto Volatility Now, miners not yet capitulating or ceasing operations means that the production level has not been impacted, signifying that supply has not been reduced. On the contrary, depending on their cash positions, miners will most probably have to sell more coins on the open market to make up for their post-halving revenue deficit. This possibly explains why despite a much-anticipated surge in the price of Bitcoin driven by ETF-related demand, it has remained largely range-bound since March as illustrated below. This means that the supply has risen enough to balance the demand from fund managers for the newly launched ETFs in January, a possibility confirmed by analysts at 10x Research who also predict that around $5 billion worth of BTC could be liquidated by miners after the halving. Chart prepared using data from (seekingalpha.com) As a result, and depending on the speed with which miners dispose of their HODLed coins, the demand-supply equation could tilt more toward supply thereby pressuring Bitcoin's price. This is why Marathon could suffer from further volatility in the short term. However, looking at the longer term, it is a buy. In this case, while Marathon's trailing price-to-sales exceeds RIOT, it still deserves better thanks to its superior growth and profitability metrics. Another reason is it trades at a trailing price-to-sales of 8.84x, much lower than 16.5x in February, or a 46% ((8.84-16.5)/8.84) discount. Therefore, after miners have adjusted to the 2024 halving, supply levels have normalized, and they again start to HODL coins, there could be an upside. Considering a 15% upside out of the 46% possible, I estimate the stock could rise to $24.15 based on the current share price of $21. This target is about the same as Wall Street's average rating and factors in that much of the upside in crypto that was to take place has already occurred, led by the January ETF approval . Also, news that U.S. regulators have approved the first spot Ether ( ETH-USD ) ETF, has been galvanizing cryptocurrencies, but this may only be a temporary upside as it does not favor the demand for Bitcoin itself. In conclusion, this thesis has shown that Marathon is progressing on efficiency gains while disposing of enough cash to expand its mining infrastructure. Also, with $837 million of liquidity (cash plus crypto) versus $340.5 million in debt, it can weather the volatility provided that BTC stays above the $43K level.

One such story is that of an anonymous crypto trader who recently managed to turn a portfolio of $23 million into $65 million over the course of a year, according to insights from Lookonchain, a crypto analytics platform. This $42 million profit highlights the trader’s smart money move in the volatile crypto market. The trader leveraged strategic investments in tokens such as PEPE, ONDO, and BEAM to achieve substantial gains. Related Reading: Tiny Pepe, Big Dreams: Memecoin Explodes, Eyes Dominance In The Dog House Maximizing Returns Through Precise Market Timing This trader’s journey began with a strategic crypto investment in PEPE, which alone yielded a return of $60 million. The trader demonstrated a deep understanding of market trends and token potential by capitalizing on market timings and price fluctuations. Notably, the trader’s investment in PEPE resulted in a 1203% return in gains. Initially investing 2,434 ETH (valued at approximately $5 million) to acquire 3.97 trillion PEPE, the trader sold 125 billion PEPE for 350 ETH, or around $1.27 million, at peak prices. The remaining holdings in PEPE were valued at $56.43 million, according to data from Lookonchain. What a smart trader!

The investment in ONDO resulted in a $5.8 million profit with 288% return on investment (ROI), showcasing effective diversification and asset selection strategies. While BEAM provided the least returns among the three, it still contributed positively to the trader’s portfolio. An initial investment led to a 72% ROI, which, although smaller relative to PEPE and ONDO, demonstrates the importance of portfolio diversification. It is worth noting that such diversification in crypto helps balance the risks and enhance the overall stability of investment returns across different market conditions in the crypto market. The 3 Crypto Tokens Performance Overview Among the three tokens the trader utilizes to secure substantial returns on investment, PEPE has emerged as the leading performer, followed by ONDO and BEAM. Recently, PEPE has achieved notable milestones, ascending to new all-time highs. Over the last week, the asset has experienced a surge of over 40%, and an additional 4% increase in the past day, reaching a new peak at $0.00001526. Despite this recent uptick, PEPE’s value has receded by 6.8% from its highest point, now trading at $0.0000144. Meanwhile, ONDO marked a new all-time high earlier today at $1.15 but has since retracted by 2.7%, with its current price at $1.12. This represents a substantial 15.8% increase within a single day, cementing a week-long upward trend that has seen the token’s price climb by nearly 20%. Related Reading: Ondo Finance Joins BlackRock Tokenized Fund As Inflows Surpass $160M BEAM, however, has shown more modest gains compared to the other two.

The Commission has determined that proposals from notable entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark Invest/21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton fulfill the requirements to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and safeguard the public interest. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Spot ETFs Approval Will See “Animal Spirits” Reignite Crypto – What This Means Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, commenting on the Ethereum ETF approval on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the new index funds approval has led to two sectors emerging as clear winners. One of these sectors is Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) coins, with Lido at the forefront. Lido provides staking support for the Ethereum blockchain without the need to lock tokens or maintain infrastructure, allowing participants to engage in on-chain activities such as lending and farming. Key Levels To Watch For Lido During the early hours of Friday, LDO reached a peak of $2.49 but has since retraced to its current trading price of $2.35. Large investors are interested in the token, as Spot On Chain data reveals that six fresh wallets/whales withdrew 4.3 million LDO ($9.59 million) from crypto exchange Binance over the past 24 hours. This indicates a growing interest in holding the token, as sentiment suggests a potential increase in price parallel to Ethereum once the newly approved index funds for the second-largest cryptocurrency enter the market in the coming months. Moreover, CoinGecko data shows that Lido has experienced a trading volume of $350 million within the last 24 hours, marking a 78.60% increase compared to Thursday’s. However, the token remains 68% below its all-time high (ATH) of $7.30, achieved during the 2021 bull market.

28407705,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609652,1716598802,Bitcoin Price Enters Make Or Break Zone: Analyst Reveals Important Levels To Watch,"The Bitcoin price is now back down to $67,000 after touching above $71,000 earlier in the week. Given the circumstances surrounding the price recovery and subsequent decline, it has led to crypto analysts breaking out the technical indicators to figure out where the price is headed next. One crypto analyst, in particular, has identified that the cryptocurrency has entered a crucial zone, with important levels to watch that could tell where the price is headed next. Bullish Scenario For Bitcoin Presently, the break below $70,000 has sent the Bitcoin price into a perilous situation, making the current level just above $67,000 crucial to its next steps. Crypto analyst The Signalyst highlights this in their latest Bitcoin analysis where they identified that the BTC price is at a ‘make or break zone.’ Related Reading: Non-Empty USDC And USDT Wallets See 13.9% And 15.7% Spike, Why This Is Good For Crypto As The Signalyst points out, Bitcoin had been able to break above the accumulation level between $60,000 and $62,000, which had allowed investors to get in. Despite its decline in the last day, the price has maintained its position in the upper bound of this range. For the bullish scenario to continuation, the crypto analyst explains that BTC must go ahead to break the upper bound of this range completely, which is the $72,000. This is the major resistance for bulls. If this happens, then The Signalyst believe that the Bitcoin price will move toward the next major resistance at $80,000. Bearish Scenario For BTC Similarly the to bullish scenario, the bearish scenario for Bitcoin could possibility play out at this level. As the The Signalyst points out, even though the price is currently still in the upper bound of the range, it risks being brought down by bears. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts Shiba Inu Competitor Dogwifhat Will Reach $10 Amid Short liquidations In this case, the level to watch is the lower trend line, which currently sits around $62,000. Much like the resistance at $72,000, the support at $62,000 is what bears must break to pull the price further down. If this scenario were to play out and the bears successfully broke the lower trend line, then the analyst’s chart shows that the Bitcoin price could fall as low as $56,000. This would mean an over 20% decline from its current price. BTC Price Currently, the Bitcoin price is still seeing some bullish momentum, with its daily trading volume rising over 40% in the last 24 hours alone. This suggests that investors are still actively engaging with the cryptocurrency, something that could drive the price higher. At the time of writing, BTC is hovering around $67,300, with a 3.29% loss in the last day, but still holding small gains of 1.68% on the weekly chart.

As the asset struggles to reclaim its March all-time high of over $73,000, with recent attempts peaking above $71,000 earlier this week, the price has since receded to approximately $68,231 at the time of writing. This retracement marks a 7.3% drop from its March peak, signifying a volatile period for the cryptocurrency, influenced by various underlying market factors. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Network Strengthens: Mining Difficulty And Hash Rate Spike Amid ETH ETF Buzz Long-Term Holders Lessen Selling, What This Spell For BTC Glassnode, a renowned market intelligence platform, highlights a significant development in Bitcoin’s market behavior. According to a recent analysis of the platform, there has been a notable decline in the distribution pressure from Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs). Glassnode’s “Long-Term Holder Binary Spending Indicator” tracks the sell-off activity of long-standing Bitcoin holders, and its recent data points to a marked reduction in this group’s selling pressure. Historically, when long-term holders reduce their selling, it alleviates downward pressure on the price, potentially giving rise to more bullish market conditions. Further insights into Bitcoin’s price behavior come from prominent crypto analyst RektCapital, who noted on social media platform X that Bitcoin typically faces resistance at the range high post-Halving and suggests a prolonged re-accumulation phase. As the crypto asset trades just below $69,000, RektCapital discloses that Bitcoin might only break out from its current re-accumulation range around 160 days post-Halving, projecting a significant breakout as late as September 2024. This analysis is crucial as it sets expectations for investors looking for signs of Bitcoin’s next big move. #BTC Historically, Bitcoin has always rejected from the Range High on the first attempt at a breakout after the Halving Moreover, history suggests this Re-Accumulation should last much longer Bitcoin tends to breakout from these Re-Accumulation Ranges only up to 160 days after… https://t.co/Jw7FcQui2Q pic.twitter.com/beLdOPqZOi — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 24, 2024 Meanwhile, recent price action from Bitcoin has led to substantial losses for some traders, with Coinglass data showing about $41.68 million in liquidations for Bitcoin long traders and $14.34 million for short traders over the past 24 hours. Overall, the crypto market has seen total liquidations amounting to $292.07 million during the same period, affecting 78,874 traders.
