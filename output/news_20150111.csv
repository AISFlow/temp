42398124,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSzw,1420998918,The Strangest Altcoins of 2014,"The past 12 months have seen a veritable explosion in the number of alternative digital currencies, otherwise known as altcoins.  The numbers for exactly how many altcoins are in existence vary depending on the measure. CoinMarketCap.com lists 554 cryptocurrencies at the time of writing – up from around 67 a year ago.  According to some estimates, however, thousands of altcoins have seen some level of circulation since the bitcoin protocol first became available for use and adaptation.  Many altcoins set out with legitimate uses, strong communities and active development teams. Some have descended into parody, with collapsed values and eerily quiet forum pages. Yet others were heavily pre-mined scams, or joke coins that never seriously aimed to have a real future as a digital currency.  One could argue which altcoin is the most innovative, the most noteworthy or the most notorious of 2014 until you were blue in the face. And many altcoin fans love to do just that. It's perhaps more fun, though, to take a look at some of the more unusual coins we encountered in the past 12 months.  In that spirit, here are some of the weirdest altcoins that appeared in 2014.  Goldenloaf  When the Ukrainian government led by Viktor Yanukovich collapsed in February, the presidential palace Yanukovich resided in at the time was seized by protestors and its contents made known to the world.  Those who took over the grounds quickly found that the now-ex president possessed a vast collection of antique cars, crystal-encrusted chandeliers, incriminating documents and a full-size replica Spanish galleon.  What they also found was a 2kg piece of gold shaped like a loaf of bread, an object that briefly became the focus of media attention and speculation.  Some months later, the now-infamous golden loaf served as the inspiration for the aptly named goldenloaf (sign: GLY) altcoin, which also circulated under the name goldenloafyanukovichcoin.  As explained in the alt’s Bitcoin Talk thread, GLY ostensibly tied its value to the loaf’s weight of 2 kilograms of gold.  Some of the replies in the thread dismissed the project as a scam, and later posts suggest that those concerns were valid. GLY saw a brief period of trading activity mid-summer before the price crashed at the end of August. The thread hasn’t been updated since September.  Robot Sex Nickels  What’s in a name? For robot sex nickels (RSN), the name implies just about everything you need to know about this altcoin.  With a self-described “bouncy bouncy coin distribution” and a 600-year mining cycle, robotsexnickels had all the trappings of a coin built to be strange.  As the project’s Bitcoin Talk thread explained:  “Robot Sex Nickels is a secure anonymous cryptocurrency with a primary purpose of providing slick lubrication for frisky robot jiggy-jiggy. There is a 1% premine to cover bounties and web hosting costs. No humans.”  RSN saw most of its development over the summer. Activity dropped off in October, but by the looks of things, the few who stuck around with the coin appear to have been throwing hashes at the network for fun.  Cantorcoin  Former House Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s primary election loss in June was one of the United States’ notable political upsets of 2014.  Cantor lost to a more conservative opponent during the election, and stepped down from his leadership post shortly after the loss. Long considered the Republican Party’s strongest link to the Wall Street giants that finance the party, Cantor resigned from his seat in August and has since taken a position at a New York investment bank.  Cantor’s loss – which stunned the conservative political establishment in the US and catalyzed the Tea Party movement – was immortalized by cantorcoin (EIC), a short-lived cryptocurrency that tied its hardcoded properties to the occasion and sported the tagline “Moderately Rare – Conservatively Secure”.  Pitched as a commemorative coin marking the event, the coin never gained traction as an asset, but certainly provided a brief, if not utterly strange, way to bid farewell to Cantor’s tenure in office. The short-lived alt went quiet in July, according to its CryptoCoinTalk forum thread.  Confessioncoin  The search for that so-called killer app of the Bitcoin protocol could be a defining factor in 2015, though whether explorations of this idea conducted in 2014 have any bearing on new developments remains to be seen.  One strange application CoinDesk came across was confessioncoin, an alt that essentially gave users an outlet to pseudononymously imprint their sins on the confessioncoin blockchain.  The cost: a fee of confessioncoin determined by a so-called ""confession wizard"" mechanism. As the developer noted about the project in May:  ""Peace of mind is surely worth the small price! In exchange for your penance, your confession will be stored anonymously in the blockchain, immortalized forever.""  Forum posts suggests that development may have dropped off in early December after suffering block processing problems in October. According to posted pool stats, it appears that at least some miners are keeping the compendium of confessions alive.  Watcoin  A plethora of so-called ""memecoins"" took to the proverbial stage in 2014, as developer sought to ride the same level of enthusiasm sparked by the memecoin supreme, dogecoin.  Watcoin was a peculiarity among peculiarities given its rather unusual coin image, as well as the stated determination by its then-active development team to seek out the eponymous Wat Lady in order to grant a cryptocurrency gift.  ""Wat"", for those not in the know, has become, among some, an effective way to declare confusion, resignation or alarm in a digital setting.  Indications on Bitcoin Talk suggest that watcoin was the subject of a community takeover over the summer, which resulted in a brief rebranding effort that saw the coin dubbed ""Wanted Attainable Traded"", or WATcoin. However, the thread seems to have gone silent in August.  Which altcoin(s) do you think stood out in 2014? The most innovative? Disruptive? Notorious? Bizzare?

42398104,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSShF,1420987840,5 Cryptocurrency Caricatures You'll Meet on r/Bitcoin,"Calling Reddit a community is a bit like calling Los Angeles a community. It is actually a network of countless sub-communities (conveniently called 'subreddits') held together by an absolute respect for anonymity, free speech and the democratic process.  If you post what you want, upvote what you like and downvote what you don't like, what will emerge is an aggregate of what the community finds valuable. That's the idea, anyway.  Reddit's radical libertarianism works quite well in bringing together large groups of people with niche interests to experiment with new ideas. Redditors can hash out novel concepts well before the mainstream media has had the time or the incentive to formulate a uniform take.  In particular, in the last few years, Reddit has lit up with discussion and controversy surrounding new digital currencies.  Its largest subreddit dedicated to cryptocurrency, r/bitcoin, was a vital part of the bitcoin scene well before the cryptocurrency inspired widespread public fascination.  Anyone can post or comment on /r/bitcoin, but a few recognizable stock characters often dominate the conversation.  Here are the five most common cryptocurrency caricatures you'll meet wandering the pages of r/bitcoin.  1. The Booster  It takes a certain degree of enthusiasm to invest time, for free, in sharing knowledge, ideas, and jokes on Reddit. Needless to say, /r/bitcoin draws a disproportionate number of active members who are really, really psyched about bitcoin.  While the Booster has played an important role in publicizing bitcoin and encouraging its use and development, he can sometimes be more than a tad embarrassing.  For example, witness the people who thought the Silk Road bust and the collapse of the Russian Ruble were good news for bitcoin. Or the guy who got banned from his favorite Chinese restaurant for trying to tip in bitcoin, behaving like a violent jackass when it wasn't accepted, and bragging about it.  2. The Early Investor  It's easy to mistake the Early Investor for the Booster, and it's important to examine all posts closely and maintain a healthy skepticism about their underlying motives.  Like the Booster, the Early Investor sank a lot of time and money into bitcoin before it was cool. But the Early Investor sometimes has more cynical motives for pumping everyone's enthusiasm.  Since bitcoin is a deflationary currency that rewards early adopters over latecomers, it is in the Early Investor's interest to encourage ongoing risk. Early Investors will drive up bitcoin's price to dangerous levels in hopes of cashing out at newcomers' expense.  3. 'John Galt'  When bitcoin is in crisis, such as it was after the collapse of Mt Gox, a 'John Galt' will check in with a pompous pep talk. A John Galt is often a worried Early Investor or a cozy VC who can sustain a loss that might cripple less well-padded users. Or he may just be a random dude who enjoys speaking in lofty, imminently mockable proclamations. The nickname is likely a reference to a character in Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.  4. The Altcoiner  While bitcoin alternatives such as litecoin and dogecoin have their own tightly knit communities on Reddit, sometimes altcoiners check in at /r/bitcoin to see what's going on.  Many /r/bitcoin denizens harbor a disproportionate animus for altcoins, particularly dogecoin. This can lead to dark comedy when, for instance, a dogecoiner finds a recently washed-out former bitcoin millionaire and offers a doge tip, the equivalent of tossing pennies.  Dogecoin was largely satirical from the get-go, and its adherents derive a lot of laughs from their feud with bitcoin. Light tussles can escalate quickly when Boosters take dogecoin as an existential threat and leap into comedy quicksand. A lot of dogecoin's inside jokes have taken on added life in /r/bitcoin. If you were wondering what the deal is with the 'To the Moon!' guy, there you go.  5. The Troll  There is some overlap here with the Altcoiners, but the most adamant /r/bitcoin trolls have no faith in bitcoin as a currency or an investment, and consider it their moral mission to debunk the hype surrounding it.  They get a lot of traction because Boosters, Early Investors, and particularly John Galts fall so easily into their negativity traps. More level-headed /r/bitcoin users often waste hours and hours explaining to them, again and again, that their community's most over-the-top elements are more visible than they are influential.  The only way to get much out of the valuable ideas and discussion on /r/bitcoin is to maintain a strict don't-feed-the-trolls policy.

42398121,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSxy,1420974626,Payments Veterans Seek to Unlock Blockchain's Power With Align Commerce,"The bitcoin blockchain can be utilized to store transaction records in its public ledger database, but that is far from its only use case.  Novel real-world applications in the fields of smart contracts and intellectual property rights have begun to surface, providing a glimpse of the kinds of future technologies many believe cryptocurrencies can help society unlock.  Still, the most immediate use for the technology has been for payments, and with this is mind, startup Align Commerce intends to use bitcoin as a ‘container’ to move fiat currency quickly and easily across borders.  Relying on bitcoin's blockchain, this could offer businesses itimproved efficiency, transparency and, quite possibly, electronic payment ubiquity across the globe.  Adding to Align Commerce's potential is that CEO and co-founder Marwan Forzley has a background in the payments industry. Speaking to CoinDesk he said he decided to go all-in on bitcoin and blockchain tech in order to disrupt what he considers outdated business transaction systems.  Forzley explained:  “The interesting thing about the blockchain is its ability to essentially outsource payment processing to endpoints – removing intermediaries.”  The idea  The intermediaries Forzley plans to bypass are the arguably complex tangle of banks that international fiat payments are currently forced go through when crossing borders.  Previously, Forzley founded a company called eBillme, an alternative payment method that plugged into shopping carts and connected directly with users' online bank accounts.  The firm boasted Sears, Buy.com and Tiger Direct as customers, and was sold to Western Union in 2011.  Forzley said that in his ample time studying payment networks, he kept coming back to one realization: the banking system was highly antiquated.  “These systems are very domestic in their construction, designed pre-Internet,” he said.  For example, SWIFT, a payment order network used by banks across the world, is one of the systems that today powers the global payments system.  Forzley believes that payments don’t necessarily have to be beholden to SWIFT, though, that they can use newer technologies. “These systems can be tied together through a different protocol called the blockchain,” he said.  Forzley added:  “The reason why [Align Commerce uses] the blockchain is, if you look at flows of funds around the world, the most difficult transactions, the most expensive with the most friction, are basically cross-border transactions.“  Bitcoin as a container  What Align Commerce is doing can be compared to a shipping container that moves goods from different countries – point A to point B.  “It’s a container that has value,” explained Forzley.  For example, a payment sender can have US dollars at point A and a euro receiver at point B. To facilitate this type of transaction, Align Commerce uses bitcoin in the middle of the transaction as the container.  Forzley added:  “We are using the blockchain as a way to carry the transaction. This transaction would have gone through correspondent banks; this is a simpler way to carry the transaction from the sender to the receiver.”  Real-world benefits  This concept improves over existing models used for cross-border payments in terms of higher transparency and efficiency, Forzley argues.  “[Payments] end up being recorded as transactions on the blockchain. You’ll see [Align Commerce transactions] just like any other transaction,” he said.  The Align Commerce system, in essence, requires the use of bitcoin exchanges with liquidity to move various denominations of fiat. Along with improved transparency, Align Commerce believes bitcoin is a faster and more efficient method of moving money because it avoids the complex foreign exchange currency market.  “We work with all the [bitcoin] exchanges in the market that have volume. [The] transaction comes in, it hits our account. We then move it to the exchange, convert, move, convert again,” Forzely said.  Align Commerce was part of the Boost VC Tribe 5 group of startups, and already has a number of investors backing its ideas, including the Bitcoin Opportunity Corp.  In addition, Align Commerce already has customers, according to Forzely:  “We have accountants, lawyers and exporters and importers. Different e-commerce merchants. These are all different markets.“  Regulation and overall cost  Align Commerce clearly depends on bitcoin wallets, exchanges and blockchain API companies in order to operate, but it largely avoids the existing payments system – meaning a reliance on the still-nascent bitcoin economy  So, the question remains, at a time when Western Union indicates its service is expensive because of regulation in regular payments, how will Align Commerce deal with that issue when it ultimately comes to bitcoin?  “There will be regulation,” Forzley said. “You will need to run know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulation. You need to run risk management and you need to have a business and you need to make money.”  Align Commerce’s strategy centers on providing expedited service and improved tracking ability compared to what banks offer right now. The company is steadfast in its resolve that the blockchain will help it compete in cross-border payments, even if increased regulation means higher expenses.  Forzley said:  “When all these [regulatory] costs pile up, they will add up. Despite all this I do still think you can operate at a cost structure that is more efficient than what exists today.”  As a result, the issue of payments-based regulatory compliance is not going to disappear just because of cryptocurrency's emergence.  Still, Forzley believes Align Commerce will be able to obtain customers looking for payments solutions with the bitcoin and blockchain value-add of global transparency and efficiency.  Sell global, get paid local  With his previous company, Forzley was able to add online banking to e-commerce shopping carts. But, what about implementing that concept globally?  Along with business-to-business payment invoicing, Align Commerce is executing on that idea with a product called Payinlocal.  Using the aforementioned bitcoin container concept, Payinlocal allows an e-commerce merchant the ability to accept many different types of currency.  Accepting electronic payments is one of the biggest problems businesses have in some regions. This is especially true in places where credit cards or other digital payment solutions are not very good options.  Forzely said:  “Payments are a difficult thing to do if you’re growing your business and you need to collect money from around the world.”  With Payinlocal, Align Commerce allows an e-commerce site to receive local currency as payment. By using bitcoin as a transport method, these payments can be completed even if customers are located across the globe – and using a completely different currency.  In essence, Payinlocal allows ecommerce businesses worldwide access to potential customers. In the end, this is all possible because of the borderless potential of using bitcoin as container and its blockchain technology as a device for tracking.  Align Commerce is currently operating in a private beta.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/11/payments-veterans-seek-to-unlock-blockchains-power-with-align-commerce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99fe6bbf9956a4b525466e455c45c5ffe40184f2-1770x1242.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
