42381210,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Ljb,1537092025,Could This ICO Model Let Anyone Sell Tokens Legally? Civil Thinks So,"Civil, the blockchain startup looking to disrupt media, will be offering its crypto token to investors of all kinds – both accredited and unaccredited – next week.  As a spoke of ConsenSys, the ethereum startup incubator and business all its own, that decision runs counter to most of the common wisdom about token sales these days.  The much maligned initial coin offering (ICO) has come under intense fire recently for everything from sinking ethereum's price to scuttling whatever hard won credibility the industry managed to gain before mania built up around tokens.  The original idea, funding a new decentralized platform by pre-selling crypto tokens to anyone who wanted to buy them, is being looked at more skeptically in many circles, especially as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators debate what rules (and make some rulings) need to be put in place to protect investors.  Because of that, this year, founders, especially U.S.-based founders, have stuck to only raising money from people defined by securities regulators as accredited investors, that is, people wealthy enough to take on some serious risk.  That's why Civil's choice to open their token sale to anyone and everyone could seem like a good way to get them in trouble.  ""There's a lot of things that keep me up at night but when you work in a space as uncertain as this, there's a lot of uncertainty that goes beyond just regulatory uncertainty,"" Matthew Iles, the CEO of Civil, told CoinDesk.  This statement could have something to do with the fact Civil thinks it's got the right framework – the consumer token framework created by the ConsenSys-initiated Brooklyn Project – for running open token sales.  The framework was announced on September 7 and has already been used by the hotly-anticipated decentralized world map project, FOAM.  It's very explicitly not a how-to so much as recommendations and discussion points. Based on its guidelines, Civil is, for example, demanding participation in the network before token holders can sell their coins.  Speaking to this idea, Iles told CoinDesk:  ""We're going to be providing ways, easy ways, for people in the first days of the network launch to essentially learn how to vote with their token, use our dapp and become trained. And in that process of training, they will prove use and unlock those tokens.""  Use not speculation  The first way Civil is gearing its token sale towards an actual use beyond speculation is by explaining within the registration that the sale is for ""reach"" users.  Participants will have to complete a quiz that demonstrates their knowledge of how crypto tokens and blockchain works as part of the onboarding process through Token Foundry.  Plus, buyers won't be able to sell their tokens from a wallet until that wallet has shown some level of use, which Civil calls ""proof-of-use."" In this way, the holder then demonstrates some level of understanding of the protocol. Small-scale purchasers will have to use 25 percent of their tokens on the platform and large purchasers will have to use 50 percent in order to unlock their tokens to sell or giveaway.  And it shouldn't be tough for token holders to participate since the Civil protocol will be ready soon after the sale. This is different from many token entrepreneurs who raise money on token sales without a protocol built, seeing the money as a way to pay for the development.  But for Civil, according to Iles, the real focus is on creating a new business model for journalism.  And that means not just inviting everyone who cares about journalism to participate in the project but also having a platform for them to participate on from day one.  Iles said:  ""I think what drives us most is I'm trying to create the right kind of community to power this thing and for us that meant necessarily finding a way for us to allow average people to participate.""  After raising $5 million in venture funding from ConsenSys Ventures last year, the token sale aims to hit a hard cap of $24 million, selling 34 million of its 100 million tokens to the public. The sale will run from September 18 to October 2 (or till the hard cap is reached), with the Civil protocol going live shortly after.  The soft cap – the amount the company needs to hit to even go through with the ICO – is $8 million.  Building newsrooms  The new framework will debut under harsh market conditions.  With the crypto markets down, and more specifically ETH (the native currency of ethereum, where the Civil token is being housed) down dramatically, it's unclear whether buyers are still eager to snatch up crypto tokens.  Although, because of the token's immediate utility, Civil might still prove attractive.  Once users have the tokens, there are a number of things they can do with them.  For one, they could start a newsroom. Users need to stake 1,000 tokens to start one. Newsrooms that are created on the protocol all have to adhere to Civil's constitution for ethical journalism, and must be listed on its token-curated registry.  Already, a bunch of newsrooms have already been announced, with everything from local journalism to cultural reporting.  In perhaps the biggest news for the startup so far, it is partnering with the AP to license content.  After a newsroom is started, token holders can challenge any newsroom's adherence to the constitution at any time, but they'll have to stake a lot of tokens, which they might not get back should they be proven wrong, to do so. Other token holders will be able to vote their tokens in these challenges.  And soon, users should be able to tip writers or pay for other services from newsrooms in civil tokens.  Underneath the hood, the Civil protocol will also help with archiving and establishing the origin of any given piece of content, since it'll be posted to the ethereum blockchain. This mechanism is touted as being a solution for the messy licensing environment of the internet.  That said, any experiment needs a pretty large sample size to understand whether the hypothesis works, which is why Civil needs to sell to the wider public. As of this writing, TokenFoundry shows 1,510 interested parties listed on the Civil sale.  Useful and compliant  While the Civil white paper was released last summer, Iles told CoinDesk, the company waited to raise money until it had something – the protocol – to show for it.  According to Iles, the last year of building felt like a ""dead sprint.""  At the same time, another ConsenSys-affiliated project, the Brooklyn Project, was studying securities law and trying to find an argument, an approach that it believed could justify a sale of crypto tokens to regular people.  Pat Berarducci of Consensys Legal, who was one of the attorneys that helped craft the guidelines, told CoinDesk:  ""Traditionally security laws typically don't apply to sales of a kind of consumptive goods for consumptive purposes.""  Yet, it's one thing to use precedence to predict that, but it's another thing to convince regulators that the logic applies.  It's unclear whether regulators will agree with the approach. And this means that Civil (and others that use the framework) is taking quite the risk, since entrepreneurs will not know if regulators are going to let the idea fly until they sell some tokens and either wait to see if regulators do anything or if courts side with entrepreneurs when regulators pounce.  Still, Iles said, ""Hopefully through approaches like ours and others we can start to demonstrate that not only is this stuff compliant, but, more importantly, useful and valuable to people.""  And if nothing else, the oft repeated lawyerly line that everything comes down to ""facts and circumstances"" will have something to point back to in the Brooklyn Project framework.  Berarducci said, ""It's been about an eight-month process of trying to develop a framework that allows, I think projects – as well as lawyers and perhaps regulators and policymakers – to kind of think through the important issues and important topics when it comes to a token project.""  Telling CoinDesk he sees a path to compliance even if some of the loudest voices in the industry don't, Berarducci concluded:  ""There's still a lot to learn. There's still lots of experiments left.""

42381191,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LPT,1537089302,EVM 2.0: Inside the Race to Replace the Heart of Ethereum,"At the heart of ethereum lies a virtual computer.  Stored across tens of thousands of nodes that make up the platform, the ethereum virtual machine, or EVM, is responsible for executing the countless tokens, dapps, DAOs and digital kittens of which the blockchain is comprised of.  It's an engine on top of which the entirety of ethereum operates, and it speaks in a language named ""EVM bytecode"" — raw, 256-bit strings of information that can deliver any conceivable equation (providing it falls within the platform's self-imposed limit, gas).  Sounds powerful and important huh? Something not to be messed with too much?  Yet, that integral part of ethereum's infrastructure is gearing up for a complete rewrite.  ""I would make the case there wasn't an enormous amount of design thinking put into it at the beginning,"" Lane Rettig, an ethereum developer, told CoinDesk about the EVM. ""It was kind of like a tool – a swiss army knife is the way I would describe it – it does a bunch of things but not incredibly well.""  As such, the current EVM will be replaced by a new virtual machine called eWASM.  EWASM is just ethereum's version of the WASM (which stands for WebAssembly) code, created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the team of developers responsible for maintaining and standardizing the web.  ""There are many highly paid, very experienced engineers, and many thousands of professional engineer hours that went into the conception of [the WASM] construction set – compared to EVM,"" Rettig, who contributes to eWASM development, said.  Indeed, eWASM will allow developers to code in multiple programming languages — not just the ethereum-specific language, Solidity — and is said to come with a host of performance enhancements as well.  And leading credence to the decision, ethereum will join several competitors, including EOS, Tron and Cardano, who have each deployed (or plan to deploy) project-specific virtual machines to handle decentralized computation using the WASM code.  For ethereum, the switch is set to execute alongside a couple other updates now nicknamed ""Shasper,"" which includes scaling solution sharding and mining rewrite Casper, in the next few years. And while an exact timeline for the switch isn't fixed, eWASM development is making rapid progress, and is gearing up to the launch of its testnet at Devcon 4, the ethereum developer conference, in Prague in October.  Speaking to the decision to replace the existing machine, Rettig summarized:  ""Ethereum is at the point where it's transitioning from a clunky homebrew custom build job that we've been riding around our farm to a real racecar that we can take out on the highway and open up.""  A 'warty' way  Underlying the switch is the realization that while the EVM is an innovative technology — for the first time, providing a solution to attack-resistance decentralized computation — it's not as clean as it could be.  Case in point, most dapps developers program in ethereum's Solidity, a high-level programming language which automatically compiles into an EVM bytecode compatible form.  Because the EVM relies on ""very large, wide instructions,"" Rettig said, even the smallest kinds of computations, such as basic arithmetic, would need to be converted into 256-bit strings – a complex process for simple math – for the EVM to process them.  This is just one of several operations built into the system code that Rettig contends shouldn't be there. Another includes the popular hash function SHA-3.  Because of this, Rettig describes the EVM as ""warty.""  And Nick Johnson, an ethereum core developer, agreed, telling CoinDesk that when he joined ethereum, it was immediately obvious to him that the EVM was built by developers with a deep understanding of computer science, but without much experience building broadly useable products.  As a tool, Johnson emphasized, the EVM has been ""optimized for theoretical purity, rather than practical use.""  ""It has these enormous registers, but they're all the same, and it's very internally consistent and so on,"" he said, ""but it's not built with real-world implementation in mind.""  'Closer to the metal'  The WASM code, on the other hand, was built with production in mind.  For one, Rettig said, it's built ""closer to the metal,"" meaning that the code it runs is close to actual hardware instructions, so there's less effort spent on translating different coding logics.  ""The instructions very closely mimic actual hardware instructions,"" Rettig continued. ""These instructions can map one-to-one directly to the instructions the actual devices run, so you can, in theory, get pretty exciting performance improvements.""  For instance, developers building on ethereum will be able to code using multiple languages – whatever they're most comfortable with – including those with additional security benefits.  Another key advantage — which Rettig said some developers are citing as the ""key motivation behind eWASM"" — is that it potentially does away with what is called a ""precompile.""  Because the EVM is comprised of unwieldy code, certain operations need to be built inside the system — otherwise, the operations would exceed the gas costs associated with them. Called precompiles, to make such operations available on a network, a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, is required; and such upgrades have proved risky and complicated to orchestrate.  With eWASM, though, developers maintain that operations can simply be written as smart contracts and deployed, skipping the hard fork scenario.  ""With eWASM, it's efficient enough at doing compute stuff that most of those precompiles could be done away with and replaced with just eWASM contracts,"" Johnson said.  Broken heart  Still, like any substantial change in a decentralized ecosystem, the push to deprecate the EVM is not without its critics.  For one, ethereum core developer Greg Colvin, who's been devoted to the EVM's upkeep for years, is reluctant to let the old code go.  Colvin had been designing a newly improved version of the EVM code himself, named EVM 1.5, which was originally intended to be the future of the ethereum virtual machine. However, without warning, his funding was cut by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation.  ""I was pissed,"" Colvin, who helped form the Council of Ethereum Magicians, a discussion group devoted to furthering the technical proficiency of ethereum, after the experience, told CoinDesk. ""I was like wait a minute, you won't pay me $8.40 an hour when you've already decreased my hours to 20 from 35, so why am I doing this. And then for the rest of the year I could no longer afford to volunteer time.""  Yet, Colvin's reason for opposing aWASM isn't only pride.  According to him, there are technical issues with eWASM as well. For example, because eWASM allows multiple language support, the code relies heavily on what is known as ""compilers"" — something that Colvin maintains could be a single point of failure for attackers.  He's also unconvinced that eWASM smart contracts could replace the need for precompiles.  Plus, Colvin has further design-orientated critiques that even Rettig agrees with. According to both the developers, for some reason more inefficient tech usually wins out. Take Javascript for example, which is one of the most widely used programming languages, but is known for being particularly ugly.  ""There seems to be a pattern in technology and computer science where the best-designed things, not only do they not necessarily win, but they seem to not do very well,"" Rettig argued.  Not to mention, according to Colvin, for all the development work behind WASM, the code is still relatively untested in the wild.  Colvin told CoinDesk:  ""I didn't understand why we wanted to be early adopters of an experiment, when we were already early adopters of our own experiment.""  Unpredictability  Conflicts aside, eWASM is gaining steam among many ethereum developers.  Indeed, the plan planning is to deploy it as a testnet prior to the ethereum developer conference, Devcon4, in November.  Yet, that doesn't mean the new virtual machine will get deployed any time soon.  Because eWASM will first be brought out on a shard, or a sidechain, before replacing the EVM itself, the rollout of eWASM is closely bound to the Shasper upgrade. And in terms of timing, that means developers will need to attend to the research that underpins those changes, before moving on to eWASM.  Unfortunately, the progress of such research can be unpredictable.  Indeed, the ambiguity involved with code upgrades of this sort has been a source of confusion for a wide group of ethereum developers building on the platform.  ""If you're in the process of building a new client there's a lot of confusion: Should I be building eWASM? Should I be building EVM? Should I be building both? Should I be building something else,"" Rettig told CoinDesk.  The lack of clarity was one of the key frustrations for Colvin, because when it comes to the current EVM, there are some performance issues that would be easy to improve on, yet those have been side-barred by the sudden shift in the roadmap.  ""It's been a frustration of mine for a while, eWASM was clearly over the horizon, but without too much resources EVM 1.5 was on the near horizon. And now, it's still doable, but it got pushed, a whole year got wasted,"" Colvin told CoinDesk.  The more, the merrier?  Still, both Rettig and Colvin admit that this uncertainty is just a part of contributing to an open-source project without any central leadership.  ""The community aspect is so important. If this was a company I'd be long gone,"" Colvin told CoinDesk.  Plus, Rettig was quick to argue that when it comes to ethereum improvements, there's no wasted work.  Indeed, he continued, because of the nature of the sharding upgrade — which splits ethereum up into smaller, more manageable chunks — multiple virtual machines could eventually be supported on ethereum.  On an updated ethereum, Rettig said, ""There is no single ethereum, there is no single roadmap, there is no single authority, it's a community, it's a family of technologies, and I do not believe that the future is just one chain to rule them all.""  In line with that, eWASM will unlock new levels of interoperability as well. For one, it's built in a language that has been standardized for the World Wide Web, so adding in-browser support for an ethereum light client would be trivial.  And it could pave the way for undiscovered interoperability between different blockchains as well.  ""Maybe you have quadratic sharding over here, and Plasma over here, and maybe they overlap in places, and maybe we have a Dfinity chain talking to an ethereum chain talking to bitcoin through Cosmos and Polkadot,"" Rettig said, suggesting:  ""We just don't know, so don't get so caught up in the official canonical roadmap, whatever that may be.""
