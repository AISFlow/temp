42424995,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXO9h,1372254220,Bitcoin: The next rewards-based economy?,"Cryptocurrency advocates are cheering on the adoption of bitcoin by merchants. You can now buy everything from online dating accounts to a pint and a pie using the system. But could bitcoin also be the next basis for company rewards programs, targeting both employees and consumers?  Recognize  , an employee reward system that includes a mobile app, has announced that it is considering support for bitcoins as a form of monetary reward for workers. Yet, at the same time, it argues that cash rewards are less productive than non-cash rewards. So, why consider bitcoin as part of an employee reward system?  Employee rewards have a lot in common with gamification systems, which use game-like concepts to motivate employees and improve performance. But gamification theorists have long disparaged the idea of simply paying employees more money to excel at certain goals.  ""Tangible rewards like money can lead to disengagement,"" warns Mario Herger, who designs enterprise gamification schemes, and is the CEO of the Austrian Innovation Center in Silicon Valley. Money may be financially beneficial, but it doesn't necessarily encourage engagement. ""There are a lot of scientific examples where giving people money rewards other than salary means that people are interested in going the last mile."" (You can find one of them here, if you fancy some light bedtime reading).  This is why many gamification systems in the enterprise use points as the basis for motivation. Points and badges alone won't motivate employees (in fact, they may feel patronized by them in some cases). But when those points are tied to intangible rewards that have real world relevance, they can be powerful incentives, argues Gabe Zichermann, founder of Gamification Corp., which gathers gamification news and resources.  ""It's about status and recognition,"" Zichermann says, adding that points and badges awarded for going the extra mile take on huge meaning when they become redeemable for something that employees truly care about. ""They are giving meaningful virtual rewards for exceptional work,"" he says, describing companies that adopt this approach. ""They deliver what employees and consumers actually want, which is emotional reward.""  What does that look like? An intangible benefit could be the chance to trade in points for lunch with the president of the company, for example, or perhaps even upgrading to a corner office. Or perhaps you simply get to display your point score on a company scoreboard, or use it as capital to unlock certain areas on an internal social network.  That's not to say that employees don't like something with monetary value, though – we could all do with a few extra bucks in our pockets. So where does bitcoin come in?  Bitcoin is a strange mix of both money and points, argues Alex Grande, founder of Recognize. ""Research has shown that cash rewards can lower people's internal motivation to complete tasks,"" he agrees. ""But at the same time in a workplace, people really like money. To find a middle ground, we can offer points or bitcoins in an attempt to shield people from losing motivation.""  Bitcoins attraction is that it straddles both worlds, Zichermann agrees. On the one hand, it is redeemable for fiat currency. On the other, it is abstract enough – separated enough from fiat currency – to be used as a points system in its own right. This gives it merit both as a unit of currency for gamification, and as an easy gateway to traditional cash. In short, says Zichermann: ""Bitcoin is interesting, because it's both money, and not money.""  Altcurrencies enable companies to walk a fine line between offering something loftier than money as a reward for good performance, while also offering something spendable. ""It's a shared delusion,"" says Zichermann,"" where everyone comes out ahead because psychologically, employees don't know the monetary value. And companies have to keep that abstract.""  This obfuscation enables an altcurrency to jump between two roles, as money used for tangible goods, and a currency used for intangible rewards. Those two things are normally best kept apart, because you don't want to sully one with the other. You can pay for lunch with the president of the company using points that you earned by performing well at your job, but cash is awkward. ""Lunch with the president is worth $50? That's a problem,"" Zichermann says.  Another benefit of a reward system that can hop between abstract points and hard cash is the appeal to different kinds of workers in a company, who may have different motivations. It may be an overgeneralization, but executives in a company may be less interested in physical goods such as a new iPad or an Xbox than blue-collar workers, Zichermann suggests, whereas they may be excited by the prospect of ranking higher in the corporate hierarchy, or getting privileged access to a motivational event. On the other hand, Larry in the warehouse may not really care about having lunch with the head honcho, but he might really want a new stereo system.  This portability extends beyond internal company economies, and creates the potential for employee incentive programs to bridge with, say, customer loyalty programs from third party companies. If customer loyalty programs began supporting bitcoin, then it could become a means of porting value between the programs.  Why would companies operating points-based customer loyalty programs want this to happen? One of the biggest problems for any points-based program is that they can be hard to sustain economically. They can suffer from inflation, meaning that the number of points needed for a reward goes up over time. There’s an example here, and another here.  “By being more convertible, you’d create more opportunities for deflation to occur,” Zichermann says. “If you could take points and spend them on a wider array of things, it would keep inflation under control.”  Zichermann speaks to many companies in the incentive program space, both for employees and for customers, and says that there is strong interest in using bitcoin as the basis for their loyalty and engagement programs. Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, came to speak at Gamification Corp.'s GSummit conference in San Francisco this year. The likes of Murck speaking at a gamification and employee incentive conference indicates the potential for a crossover between both internal and external incentive programs, and the cryptocurrency world.  Would companies running their own non-interchangeable points reward programs want to begin accepting bitcoin? Possibly not. After all, by controlling their own points in a closed system, they get to set the value of a room, or airline flight, for points holders. But if bitcoin makes enough inroads into the employee incentive space, and establishes a foothold in the customer loyalty world, they may not have a choice. Increased portability between other loyalty programs would eventually decrease the attraction of a closed loop system, forcing their hand.  We’re already seeing some interesting developments. Perk, a rewards system that offers points and prizes to consumers when they search and shop using its web browser, is now offering bitcoin rewards, for example.  We have a long way to go before you'll be converting bitcoins earned in one loyalty program into Aeroplan points, but Zichermann believes that over time, the cryptocurrency will eat away at 'walled garden' points programs currently dominating both employee and customer incentive and loyalty schemes. Many may argue that this is unrealistic. But then, they probably said that about bitcoin and gift cards, before Gyft’s deal with BitPay made that a reality, too.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/26/bitcoin-the-next-rewards-based-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/346b7bfcb1e5af5ce418cae989419165b3cd3046-668x448.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425006,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXOXh,1372250993,Review of Blockchain bitcoin wallet for Android,"The Blockchain.info website can be used as a mobile wallet thanks to its Android app. Blockchain.info is best known as Bitcoin's block chain explorer, but it also has a wallet feature where you can send and receive bitcoins. With the Android app, you can access all this while you're on the move.  The app opens up asking you either to create a new account or to pair with your existing wallet. Registering on the website is better as there are a few pieces of data to keep a record of. Pairing with the website involves opening your account details on the blockchain.info website, and clicking on the devices section, and there you'll find an option to display a QR code. This can then be scanned by the app on your phone, then the pairing is complete. As far as the app design goes, it is easy to pair, it just takes a little digging to find the QR code on the website.  Once paired, you are shown a summary of your wallet, including balance and a list of transactions. Besides the balance is a small icon of a QR code. Tapping this reveals a larger QR and your wallet address. Other bitcoin users can scan this to send you money.  Additionally, tapping the leftward arrow on the app's toolbar lets you generate a QR code request. Here, you need to configure the QR code with the amount of BTC you wish to receive.  Tapping on each transaction lets you see extended information, such as the amount, value, and how many confirmations it has received from bitcoin nodes.  You can send money too by tapping the rightwards arrow on the toolbar. The app supports Quick Send, Custom Send, and Shared Send. It's all straight forward.  The app also lets you view exchange rates, via the main menu, which also gives access to the app settings. The settings pages actually redirects you to a web page, where you can establish how to receive notifications of new transactions. By default, notifications will appear in your Android status bar. Strangely, there is also an option to buy bitcoins on the main menu, but the web page that it directs you to is just blank.  We'd recommend this app as a decent starting point for handling your bitcoin wallet on a mobile device. If you were expecting, from its name that you'd be able to use the app to explore the blockchain then you'd only be half right. The app only shows your transactions and contains hyperlinks that break you out into your phone's browser to show the corresponding page on the blockchain.info website.  As a mobile bitcoin wallet, this app works as seen by our story about buying beer for bitcoins!  You can find the Blockchain.info app on the Google Play Store.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/26/review-of-blockchain-bitcoin-wallet-for-android,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f75dc9c16ea6079d4d21fd6dd5244ed37a0a1662-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425005,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXOTh,1372249928,What to expect at Bitcoin London 2013,"Digital currency enthusiasts will head to England's capital next week for the inaugural Bitcoin London conferencehttp://www.btclondon.com/.  Organised by st-ART, the one-day event will take place at Level 39, One Canada Square in Canary Wharf on Tuesday, July 2. Registration is between 08:00 and 09:00, with the final speaker finishing at 17:50.  Those scheduled to speak at the invitation-only event include Stefan Thomas of Ripple, Jered Kenna of Tradehill and our very own Shakil Khan (founder of CoinDesk).  There will be a number of panel discussions covering topics such as 'The rising stars of the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem', 'Regulatory and legal challenges' and 'Investment opportunities in the Bitcoin space', plus plenty of opportunity to network.  Attendees will learn more about bitcoin as an asset class, the world of decentralised finance and Sveinn Valfells, of Bitcoin Investor, will explain why he believes Iceland should adopt bitcoin as its national currency.  Gulnar Hasnain, one of the event organisers, anticipates around 200 people will attend the event, travelling from the US, Canada and Eastern and Western Europe.  ""Most of the bitcoin events so far have been grass roots meet-ups with a strong focus on tech and libertarian politics. We wanted to do something that was purely focused on the business and investment opportunities around bitcoin,"" she explained.  Hasnain said the event provides an opportunity to connect bitcoin entrepreneurs, angel and venture investors as well as hedge fund and financial services professionals.  ""We want to promote understanding of the digital currency space, and develop the start-up ecosystem through our events so bitcoin and digital currencies become the norm for the masses,"" she added.  Tuur Demeester, editor of financial newsletter MacroTrends, will be sharing his views on Bitcoin at 09:15. He believes Bitcoin London will be ""one of the most high-powered networking occasions for bitcoin entrepreneurs and investors"" to date.  ""The quality of both speakers and attendees is excellent, and so everyone there will get the opportunity to build new business relationships, as well as to hear the latest news straight from the horse's mouth,"" he added.  Demeester went on to say he is looking forward to meeting more of the people involved in the digital currency world and hearing the new ideas they have to offer.  ""I'm curious to learn how everyone in the space is moving forward after the hugely successful Silicon Valley conference last month, and the recent regulatory challenges in the US,"" he said.  Jered Kenner, CEO of Tradehill, is also looking forward to the event, where he will share his experience in building a bitcoin business focused on servicing professional investors at 'The rising stars of the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem' panel discussion at 09.55.  ""Events like Bitcoin London are important because they provide a collaborative meeting space for the Bitcoin community where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Attendees are naturally more creative, more innovative, and more excited about Bitcoin when feeding off the energy of other guests,"" he said.  Event organiser Pamir Gelenbe, venture partner at Hummingbird Ventures, believes cryptocurrency is the biggest invention since the internet and will ultimately be adopted by the masses.  ""While I have no doubt that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will become huge eventually, it's a long-winded road to get there and these events are an important part of the journey,"" he said.  Gelenbe hopes this will be the first in a long line of Bitcoin London events, but said, for now, his focus is making this first event a success.  While the conference is an invitation-only event, there is an open application process on the Bitcoin London web page, where entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin space, as well as investors and other participants in the ecosystem are encouraged to apply.  CoinDesk  will of course be reporting at the conference all day. Conference videos will be available after the event on the conference website and YouTube.

42424985,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXNxh,1372233629,Bittylicious makes buying bitcoins fast in the UK,"Buying bitcoins is one of the trickier parts of dealing with the virtual currency. That's a pretty fundamental problem to solve. At the moment, many of us have been jumping through the hoops of sending international payments to the likes of Mt. Gox, before we can start trading. A new UK business seeks to change all that by providing a fast way to purchase bitcoins. That business goes by the unlikely name of Bittylicious. We spoke to the company's founder Marc Warne to find out more.  Bittylicious provides a service to anyone with a UK bank account to quickly purchase bitcoins. It does this by taking advantage of the UK's fast inter-bank transfer protocol. We've tested the service in the CoinDesk office and received our BTC within an hour of making the transfer.  We spoke to the person running the show, Marc Warne, from his London office to find out more about the service.  CoinDesk: What is your background in bitcoin?  Marc Warne: More than anything else, I find it a fascinating experiment in pure supply and demand economics. This encouraged me to accept bitcoins through a hosting company I also run and in turn spin it into its own, bitcoin dedicated site.  CD: What difficulties have you faced in buying and spending bitcoins before Bittylicious?  MW: In the UK, it's pretty difficult. The main issue is getting money onto a market such as Mt. Gox. In fact, there aren't any UK markets available at all at present, although we do hope this changes soon. It is very difficult to buy bitcoins in the UK, especially with OKPay pulling out of the bitcoin industry. For those few sites that are around, the process can be very tricky, especially for those that just want to play with a small amount of bitcoins. Bittylicious was created to improve this situation.  CD: How did you come up with the name?  MW: I wish I knew! I had been wondering what to call the site for a while and then BAM! It came to me one evening. There was no turning back.  CD: Who is behind your company and how many people do you have on the team?  MW: It's a Limited company, initially funded personally.One main person really runs it, but we have lots of contacts and close help with other bitcoin businesses in the bitcoin world.  CD: What is the process of fulfilling an order?  MW: 1. You choose how many bitcoins you want and provide a bitcoin address. 2. You make the payment using online banking. 3. You click 'Payment sent'. 4. We see the payment. 5. We transfer the bitcoins to you.  CD: Your website states: ""Promise of a full refund if the payment arrives late"" – what constitutes late?  MW: After two hours have passed.  CD: Is there a limit to the size of transactions you can handle?  MW: Not so much that we can handle, but that we are prepared to do. Know Your Customer rules mean we need to keep amounts low until we can validate customers.  CD: Where do you buy and convert bitcoins for Bittylicious?  MW: Mostly it's selling bitcoins generated from another business, but there are some instances where we have bought in bulk from other providers.  CD: How much of a profit do you make on transactions and do you keep profits in BTC or GBP?  MW: Hardly anything at the moment while we get started.We're not sure about how we will store the profit in the future.  CD: What measures do you take to protect customers' privacy?  MW: More than anything else, a sensible and secure infrastructure is in place and modern programming practices are used. When we come to accept verification documents, these will be strongly encrypted.  CD: Which countries do you plan to serve next?  MW: It's a tough question really and we need to take it on a country-by-country basis depending on what the government in power thinks (or doesn't think) of bitcoins at any time. Probably Western Europe in general to begin with though.  CD: What do you think needs to happen for bitcoin to have mainstream adoption?  MW: Its legal situation needs to be clarified and it needs to be accepted in more places. Banks are clearly anti-bitcoin (whether for 'high risk' concerns or anticompetitive concerns) and that makes things pretty difficult to begin with.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/26/bittylicious-makes-buying-bitcoins-fast-in-the-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3aae96731630f668e50b7c2a65afc1392c5010e9-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
