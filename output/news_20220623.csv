Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether surge after Fed chair's defiant tone.  Insights: Institutional interest in digital assets remains strong.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $21,082 +5.6%  Ether (ETH): $1,143 +9%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC +21.8% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +14.5% Smart Contract Platform Avalanche AVAX +12.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin and Ether Surge After Fed Chair's Defiant Remarks  In the tug of war between the forces driving bitcoin over $20,000 and those dragging it below, the drivers won in Thursday trading.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $21,100, a more than 5% increase over the past 24 hours that helped the largest cryptocurrency regain much of the ground lost the previous day. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at over $1,140, an 8% gain. Other major altcoins assumed various shades of green with STORJ and POLY assuming two of the darkest hues, rising more than 30% and 20%, respectively at one point.  Crypto increases dovetailed with equities gains as investors relaxed at least temporarily from their risk-averse crouches. The tech-focused Nasdaq, which has increasingly mirrored digital assets' performances, rose 1.6%, and the S&P 500, which contains a heavy tech component, climbed almost a percentage point after a second day of testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose defiant tone about inflation and frank acknowledgement that the Fed's monetary hawkishness might lead to a recession soothed markets craving clarity.  Still, analysts are pessimistic about the staying power of Thursday's crypto surge amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. ""Bitcoin remains a risky asset and probably won't trade on crypto fundamentals until a firm bottom is agreed upon for U.S. stocks,"" Oanda Americas senior analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email.  Crypto markets absorbed a mix of good and bad news, mostly bad. Among the more encouraging events, Solana Labs, the main stakeholder in the Solana blockchain network, announced that it was building a Web3 mobile phone called ""Saga.""  And Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao wrote in a blog post that his firm would remain committed to helping crypto projects with fixable problems and strong potential. ""With our position as one of the largest industry players with healthy cash reserves, we have a duty to protect users,"" Zhao wrote. ""We also have a responsibility to help industry players survive and hopefully thrive.""  But physical futures crypto exchange CoinFLEX paused withdrawals, citing the same “extreme market conditions” that other firms in the crypto sector, including Celsius Network, have blamed for their troubles. CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb said in a blog post Thursday that the decision tied to a certain counterparty, although he added that it was not the struggling crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital or “any lending firm.”  Late Wednesday, cryptocurrency broker Voyager Digital reduced its daily withdrawal limit to $10,000 from $25,000 after detailing its exposure to Three Arrows Capital earlier this week. Voyager shares plunged by more than 60% Wednesday after the company said it had exposure of $720 million to Three Arrows Capital in the form of stablecoins and bitcoin. And ratings agency Moody’s has downgraded Coinbase’s corporate debt and also placed its debt ratings for the crypto exchange under review for further downgrade.  Even as Oanda's Moya was upbeat about bitcoin's longer-range future, he noted for the present that ""no one is confident that the bottom is in.""  ""Bitcoin will remain a volatile trade and the correlation with equities seems like it will last for quite a while,"" he wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,795 +0.9%  DJIA: 30,677 +0.6%  Nasdaq: 11,232 +1.6%  Gold: $1,822 -0.7%  Insights  Hong Kong’s OSL: Institutional Interest Remains Strong in Crypto, Despite Luna-Induced Volatility  It’s no secret that retail volume on crypto exchanges is down significantly from around 12% at Binance to 44% for Coinbase for the first quarter from the fourth quarter, but the same isn’t being felt at institutional exchanges.  For example, OSL is on pace in 2022 to set a record for trading volume.  “Our global platform volumes are higher than our average volumes of 2021, and 2021 has been our biggest year,” Fernando Martínez, OSL's head of Americas, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Luna’s collapse has affected some exchanges, which have suspended withdrawals, and in turn shaken market confidence, even if some of the exchanges were victims of technical issues.  Martínez points to growing institutional anxiety with these issues as a reason for the increased volume on OSL.  “They are actually afraid of the counterparty risk because of everything that's happening,” Martínez said, sharing the perspectives he’s heard from OSL clients: “I cannot trust this or that exchange because you're blocking withdrawals. I cannot trust this or that counterparty because they're not regulated, or because I know that they had some exposure to these types of uncollateralized lending type of activities.”  Institutions continue to want to double down on crypto assets because they understand that the current correction is merely cyclical, just like any other drawdown. Retail investors are backing away after so many of them got rekt and because of anxieties about inflation and the prospect of a recession.  “From the TradFi institutions that have already entered the market, we're already seeing them turn up the heat,” he said.  In contrast, Martínez points to the recent sharp spike in outflows from the Toronto-listed Purpose bitcoin ETF as an example of the shaky confidence retail has in the market.  Indeed, Glassnode data shows that on June 17 there was an outflow of 24,500 bitcoins from the exchange-traded fund. A similar trend can be observed with the 3iQ Bitcoin ETF, which saw an outflow of 8,400 bitcoins a few days earlier on June 14.  “It's a combination between retail that has lost confidence and crypto participants that are not managing risk carefully,” Martínez said.

26189,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=493964,1656025209,Bitcoin Perpetual Open Interest Suggests Short Squeeze Led To Crash,"The Bitcoin crash of last week was a brutal one for the market. It saw the digital asset lose its footing from where it had been trending just below $30,000 to crash to the mid $17,000s before a recovery had begun. With the new week, the market had started to emerge into the green. But as bitcoin struggles to hold above $20,000, the question remains what had triggered such a crash. A Short Squeeze The bitcoin open interest in perps had been up over the last couple of weeks. This has continued to be the case through the market crash and the subsequent recovery.

Scaramucci said investors may look back and recognize bitcoin being a “very cheap asset that we can take advantage of because of certain people being over-levered in the system.”  He said he was initially skeptical about bitcoin, though discussions years ago around digitizing the U.S. dollar spurred his interest in blockchain technology.  Scaramucci was philosophical about recent crypto debacles, including the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and the luna token that supported it, and the liquidity problems afflicting crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. “I’ve seen those mistakes made several times,” he said.

Coinbase's corporate family rating debt was downgraded by Moody's to Ba3 from Ba2, while its guaranteed senior unsecured notes was dropped to Ba2 from Ba1. According to Moody's, Coinbase had $2 billion in senior guaranteed notes due in 2028 and 2031. Moody's didn't indicate how much corporate family rating debt Coinbase had.  Moody’s said the downgrade reflects “Coinbase's substantially weaker revenue and cash flow generation due to the steep declines in crypto asset prices that have occurred in recent months and reduced customer trading activity.”  Moody’s said it expects Coinbase’s profitability to remain challenged despite announcing the layoffs of around 1,100 employees on June 14.  According to Moody's, as of March 31, Coinbase had $6.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which it called ""a healthy position"" relative to the company's $3.4 billion in long-term debt, which includes the $2 billion in senior guaranteed notes.  Coinbase's shares were down 0.3% to $58.88 after hours on Thursday after rising 13% during the day. The stock is down almost 77% year to date.

42374417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZS03,1656016062,Market Wrap: Crypto Assets Stabilize as BTC Retakes $20K,"Crypto assets stabilized on Thursday and regained ground after Wednesday’s volatile trading saw bitcoin tumble below $20,000 and altcoins drop.  Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back to $20,900 by Thursday afternoon, recovering from its 24-hour low of $19,764, while ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up about 5.5% at above $1,100.  Stocks gained Thursday, with the S&P 500 up 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 1.5%, a sign of improved sentiment toward riskier assets.  Some altcoins benefitted from the positive sentiment and surged during the day on positive news.  MATIC, the native token of Ethereum-scaling platform Polygon, jumped 19% in the last 24 hours after Polygon introduced improved privacy for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on its network. The Cosmos network’s token, ATOM, gained 12% after decentralized exchange dXdY announced it would build its own blockchain with Cosmos, ditching Ethereum.  Further downside could squeeze exchanges  The $20,000 price point for BTC remains pivotal for the crypto market as analysts debate whether the largest cryptocurrency will see further declines akin to 2013, when BTC fell by 85%, and to 2017, when it plunged 84%. If bitcoin experiences a similar fall this time around, the prices would fall close to $10,000.  Low prices for a sustained period of time might spell trouble for crypto exchanges, crypto data firm Kaiko warned in a research note Thursday.  “As prices remain low, volumes decrease, hedge funds unwind and fees compress, exchanges will be put to the test,” Kaiko analyst Riyad Carey wrote in the note.  “Those that have enough volume and spent responsibly through the bull market will likely be able to weather the storm, while those that played fast and loose with risky staking products and investments may go under if they aren’t acquired or bailed out by FTX or Alameda,” Carey added, referring to two companies led by billionaire entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried.  For example, futures crypto exchange CoinFLEX announced that it’s pausing withdrawals because of “extreme market conditions” and uncertainty around a certain counterparty.  Earlier this week, crypto exchange FTX supplied crypto lender BlockFi with $250 million in credit. Last week, Bankman-Fried’s trading outfit Alameda Research bailed out crypto broker Voyager Digital.

Fed warms to digital dollar  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. central bank plans to recommend to Congress how to advance a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC).  When asked about the Fed’s next steps regarding the rollout of a CBDC, Powell told U.S. lawmakers in a Thursday monetary-policy hearing that “it's something we really need to explore as a country” and that “it should not be a partisan thing.”  “It's a very important potential financial innovation that will affect all Americans,” he said. “Our plan is to work on both the policy side and the technological side in coming years and come to Congress with a recommendation at some point.”  The Fed issued a report on the question of a digital dollar earlier this year, and officials are still combing through the responses from the crypto industry, traditional financial firms and investors. Those answers are likely to inform the Fed's eventual recommendation.  Read the full story here.

Over time, we’ll add support for more tokens and more networks,” Coinbase said in a blog post.  The cost of using Ethereum is driving users towards cheaper overlay systems or alternative networks. (It can cost over $10 in ""gas,"" or transaction, fees to send small amounts of crypto from the Coinbase exchange to a self-custodial wallet, Coinbase pointed out, and it can cost over $100 in gas to lend out larger amounts of crypto on protocols like Aave.)

42423053,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy26jlh,1656012600,US Banking Watchdog Says Crypto Turmoil Reinforces Cautious Approach,"Michael Hsu, acting chief of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), said the recent fireworks in the crypto industry have further cemented his resistance to allowing lenders unfettered exposure to the digital assets markets.  Hsu is one of the top U.S. banking regulators, and his reluctance to open up the wider financial system to crypto has been a significant hurdle in the industry’s push toward regulation. That view isn’t about to change, thanks to what he’s been seeing.  “There are some vulnerabilities and risks in that space that do warrant a cautious and careful approach,” Hsu told reporters on a call about his agency’s Semiannual Risk Perspective (released Thursday), which again highlighted digital assets as a space that could pose dangers to lenders in the U.S. The agency has been closely watching what’s been going on in the sector, including the sudden collapse of TerraUSD, officials said.  “It kind of reinforced where we've been this whole time,” Hsu said, pointing to earlier OCC guidance that instructed bankers to get approval from the agency before they get into new crypto activities. He said he’ll continue pursuing a “deliberative, cautious and careful approach to crypto.”  Other OCC officials on the call said that watching the meltdown of the algorithmic stablecoin and other industry troubles has taught regulators a lot about crypto – especially the confusing use of language in this space. When it comes to the custody of customer funds, the OCC has noted exchanges trying to explain themselves on what custody means for them, which is very different from what it means for banking. They added that industry disclosures continue to be a concern, because customers may not understand what they’re getting into.

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Continues To Be At High Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC whales are sending their coins to exchanges at the moment. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten transactions to exchanges and the total Bitcoin exchange inflows. In simpler terms, this metric tells us how the whale transactions (that is, the ten biggest transfers) compare with the total amount going into exchanges. If the value of this ratio is high, it means whales are making up for a large part of the inflows right now. Such a trend can be a sign of dumping from these whales, and thus can be bearish for the crypto&apos;s price.

42421526,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYSD,1656010404,The Risks and Benefits of On-Chain Credit Protocols,"There’s something of a truism that the real work of industry gets done during bear markets. In fact, just today a Bank of England deputy governor said that crypto projects that survive this “crypto winter” could become “tomorrow’s Amazons and eBays.”  ""A lot of companies went [following the dot-com crash], but the technology didn’t go away,” BoE’s Jon Cunliffe said. Crypto certainly has its believers – even as dollars hemorrhage out of the markets, people are still taking jobs in Web3, announcing protocol redesigns and hiring for the future.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But if crypto wants to create another Amazon or eBay, it’s going to have to find ways to build products that people want to use. Right now, the industry is incredibly circular – a bit like a bubble. Many popular products were essentially mechanisms to recirculate and relend capital across a range of yield-generating, blockchain-based platforms.  Most, though not all, of the distressed lending platforms and hedge funds today were caught off guard when their undercollateralized bets went into the red as prices dropped. The problem is rooted in unaccountable speculation but also the fact that much of crypto’s activities never left the internet.  Or, as billionaire investor Mark Cuban said, “companies that were sustained by cheap, easy money – but didn’t have valid business prospects – will disappear.”  Crypto, which once thrived at the far end of the risk curve, benefited from the loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. Now that interest rates are rising, and a recession looms, it’s likely investors will be wary of crypto’s purely digital thesis playing out.  But, as Cunliff said, crypto still offers a unique opportunity. Open protocols enable open innovation and invention. And it’s likely that crypto will produce something that has purpose beyond speculation. A growing sector of crypto – credit-based, unsecured lending – might offer a safer way to bet by bringing in more of the outside world.  The Defiant, a crypto-focused publication, recently wrote about the nascent field of crypto-native “credit protocols.” These applications “are using new methods to set credit ratings to would-be borrowers in the crypto space and release lending.” Essentially, these protocols offer crypto-based loans if you’re willing to reveal something of your on-chain, or sometimes, real-world identity.  Credit protocols like Centrifuge, Maple Finance and TrueFi also sell themselves by offering “unsecured” lending opportunities. While this might seem to be a repeat of the flagrant lending that blew up Celsius and Babel, for instance, the difference is these tools are attempting to tie their offerings to “off-chain assets.”  In traditional finance, credit scores are used to determine if loans should be issued and at what price to a borrower. The field is dominated by a handful of firms, is consolidating among a few and is known for making catastrophic judgment calls.  “Decentralized credit scores” – for degens and white gloves like Alameda Research alike – take the classically crypto approach of using “algorithms” to determine creditworthiness. In theory, this means unbiased and accountable decisions.  See also: The 5 'Unsolved Problems' of Crypto According to Dragonfly's Haseeb Qereshi  There are various approaches to this problem – perhaps including the “soulbound token” Vitalik Buterin proposed as a way to establish long term reputations on-chain – and if done right could be a way to address the backroom trading and rehypothecation of customer assets that blew up crypto recently.  Some look only at a user’s record of on-chain transactions, while others look off-chain. The problem is multiplied in that many traders and outfits spread their credit history across chains. Some of the most sophisticated options are using artificial intelligence and NFTs to establish a user's identity.  Right now, the safest options in DeFi offer over-collateralized loans. MakerDAO, for instance, issuer of the DAI stablecoin, requires borrowers post more crypto than they take out to account for price risk. Maker is attempting to establish rails to the traditional world of finance, even proposing something like a mortgage so people can invest in the housing market.  Critics say Maker’s approach is “not capital efficient” because the collateral it requires just sits there idling. Leverage brings risk, which “unsecured lenders” are looking to lessen by bringing in know-your-customer requirements and legally binding loan terms. Some, like Teller, look at someone’s credit card payment and banking history.  That said, apart from the growing spate of venture capital financing in unsecured, credit-driven lending protocols, there’s little reason to trust these systems and scores. So do your own research. In an odd twist, one of the principal risks to crypto lenders – regulation – might be the easiest solution to actually establish trustworthy reputations on-chain.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/23/the-risks-and-benefits-of-on-chain-credit-protocols,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8b842842192467ec7073bef33ec43ce0a3ae51a-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $20,314, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours.  The $20,000 price point remains pivotal as analysts debate whether bitcoin (BTC) will see further declines akin to 2013, when BTC fell by 85%, and to 2017, when it tumbled 84%. If bitcoin experiences a similar fall this time around, it could see prices drop close to $10,000.  Ian Harnett, co-founder and chief investment officer of Absolute Strategy Research, warned in a CNBC interview that bitcoin could fall to as low as $13,000, which would be almost an additional 40% decrease from the current price.  “We would still be selling these kinds of cryptocurrencies into this environment,” Harnett told CNBC.  FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said that declines similar to 2013 and 2017 are unreliable because of BTC’s muted strength in the most recent bullish cycle. In 2013 and 2017, bitcoin saw prices increase 90-fold and 20-fold respectively, while in 2021 bitcoin saw only a 10-fold increase in price.  “In our view, it is much more reliable to estimate that bitcoin finds a long-term bottom near the highs of the previous four-year cycle,” Kuptsikevich said.  Some analysts say that bitcoin’s volatile prices amid wider economic conditions have caused less demand from long-term holders.  Kuptsikevich said that investors should wait before buying, even though bitcoin may be approaching a stable price point.  “It may not be the best time to buy, as it may take considerable time before the crypto market digests the recent turmoil and enters a new phase of sustained demand from broad segments of investors, not just stressed asset hunters,” Kuptsikevich said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jimmy He,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/23/bitcoin-climbs-back-above-20k-as-analysts-debate-whether-its-good-time-to-buy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cba9ee4b1407719ee92b567213b77981e543ad5-677x345.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A high volume close above $5.8 may propel UNI to March 2022 highs in a bullish breakout formation. Past Performance of Uniswap Uniswap crypto prices are maintaining an upward trajectory when writing, retesting a critical resistance level. From the UNI token performance in the daily chart, buyers are in control, unwinding recent losses as prices print welcomed higher highs. At spot rates, Uniswap is up 17 percent against the USDT, BTC, and ETH in the past 24 hours. Uniswap Technical Analysis Uniswap token prices are up an impressive 76 percent after sinking to 2022 lows at $3.2. The coin is bottoming up and is currently retesting a critical liquidation level at $5.8. As bull bars ride the upper BB signaling growing momentum, traders may load the dips in anticipation of a refreshing close above this line. Even still, this week&apos;s expansion is with comparatively low trading volumes questioning the strength of Uniswap buyers. Accordingly, bulls may wait for a clean break above $5.8 before loading with targets March 2022 lows at $8. What to Expect from UNI?

42374429,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZSBN,1656006475,Solana Labs Is Building a Web3 Mobile Phone,"The Solana network is getting its own mobile phone called “Saga,” an Android handset by the blockchain’s key stakeholder, Solana Labs.  The upcoming device – a modified OSOM handset with specialty crypto wallet functions and the “Solana Mobile Stack (SMS)” software development kit for Web3 programs – was announced Thursday at an event in New York. It will cost about $1,000 and be available for delivery in early 2023, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko said.  The phone marks Solana’s biggest bet yet on mobile-focused growth. It will feature a Web3 dapp (decentralized app) store, integrated “Solana Pay” to facilitate QR code-based on-chain payments, a mobile wallet adapter and a “seed vault” that will store private keys deep within the recesses of the phone.  “Everything is going mobile. In most countries, most of the access happens through mobile phones,” Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX and a key Solana backer, said at the event. “But crypto mobile is behind the times,” he said, noting how clunky accessing dapps on mobile devices is now.  “The best solution for this is having the actual wallet built into your phone,” Bankman-Fried said.  Solana Labs said it will work with other companies to power the ecosystem to build the phone, including Magic Eden, the top NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace, Phantom, the biggest wallet provider, and Orca, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. Executives from all three were on hand to discuss the upcoming mobile experience.  The executives contrasted the Solana phone app store with the marketplaces from Google and Apple, which take a cut of sales. “There will be no extractive fees,” Yakovenko said of the SMS-fueled store.  The Solana Foundation pledged $10 million toward spurring the development of mobile apps on its SMS.  “We live our lives on our mobile devices – except for Web3 because there hasn’t been a mobile-centric approach to private key management,” Yakovenko, a Solana co-founder, said in a press release. “The Solana Mobile Stack shows a new path forward on Solana that is open source, secure, optimized for Web3 and easy to use.”  It’s not the first Web3 smartphone gambit. Sirin Labs pursued plans in 2018 to ship a blockchain-native phone but faced layoffs and litigation as the product failed to gain traction.  When asked about the shortcomings of past attempts to bring crypto-friendly phones to market, Yakovenko, a former Qualcomm engineer, said the Solana phone was better positioned for success because there are more crypto developers in the space relative to 2018.

When asked about the Fed’s next steps regarding the rollout of a CBDC, Powell told U.S. lawmakers in a Thursday monetary-policy hearing that “it's something we really need to explore as a country” and that “it should not be a partisan thing.”  “It's a very important potential financial innovation that will affect all Americans,” he said. “Our plan is to work on both the policy side and the technological side in coming years and come to Congress with a recommendation at some point.”  The Fed issued a report on the question of a digital dollar earlier this year, and officials are still combing through the responses from the crypto industry, traditional financial firms and investors. Those answers are likely to inform the Fed's eventual recommendation.  In March, Powell said that the Fed wouldn't continue exploring the launch of a CBDC without congressional intervention.  On Thursday, he noted that if the U.S, were to roll out a digital dollar, it would have to be issued by the government rather than by a private company.  “One question around CBDCs is do we want a private stablecoin to wind up being the digital dollar? I think the answer is no,” he said. “If we're going to have a digital dollar, it should be government-guaranteed money, not private money.”  Powell testified before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services as part of the central bank’s semiannual monetary policy report to Congress.

With the digital asset reaching as low as $17,600, it triggered massive sell-offs across the space. However, not everyone in the space had seen the declining prices as a signal to sell.

42423064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy28axh,1656001920,"Stablecoins Could Still Dominate Post-Terra, S&P Says","Stablecoins could become a systemic feature of the financial world in spite of the recent high-profile collapse of the Luna Foundation’s terraUSD, analysts at credit agency S&P Global Ratings said in a webinar Thursday.  Staffers at one of the world’s top-three rating agencies believe the technology, a supposedly stable source of value that offers a bridge to more volatile crypto assets, could still transform international finance and global trade – even if recent market turbulence has shown some coins are more stable than others.  For S&P Global Chief Economist Paul Gruenwald, the dramatic devaluation of terra – supposedly equal in value to the U.S. dollar at one time, but now essentially worthless – was proof that crypto issuers need to jump through the same hoops as conventional finance.  'The same sort of rules apply'  Traditional financiers will ruthlessly exploit any currency that makes spurious promises about its ability to maintain value, and crypto markets are no different, he said.  “The same sort of rules apply – the same centrality of credibility applies” in crypto as in traditional finance, Gruenwald noted, saying assets linked to the dollar “are going to need sort of high quality, liquid U.S. dollar assets in some sort of backing portfolios to make sure that regime is credible.”  That pretty much does it for terra-style algorithmic models – in which the asset is supposedly backed by an algorithm designed to ensure supply tracks demand, said Mohamed Damak, S&P's senior director for Middle East and African Financial Institutions.  “I think people have realized to some extent that this type of stablecoin cannot really be called stable,” Damak said. Even for those coins that seek to assure value through actual assets, “they are not all equal because the question mark is on the quality of the assets backing them, whether it's audited frequently or not, and by whom.”  Stablecoins still have a future, however, not least because international payments using the conventional banking system are so slow and expensive, said Harry Hu, a senior director responsible for S&P’s ratings of Chinese financial institutions.  “Stablecoins have the potential to become systemic, primarily because traditional finance has not really kept up with innovation,” Hu said.  Damak also reckons that countries issuing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could change how they trade.  “For example: A country helps another country to develop its financial infrastructure as long as the second country would use the CBDC of the first country in order to transact internationally,” Damak said. “That could definitely change some of the ways international trade is conducted today.”  What else is needed  These remarks imply a future generation of digital coins becoming vital to the financial system – a success that would likely come at a cost as regulators seek to stamp out any risks that could cause a 2008-style crash.  “The credibility of this stablecoin industry going forward is going to have to involve some sort of external, credible, regular audit of the asset side of the balance sheet,” Gruenwald said, so investors know that any pegged currency has a portfolio of assets to back it.  While some stablecoin issuers already hold those audits voluntarily, Gruenwald also pointed to a recent bill from Sen. Pat Toomey (R–Penn.) that would have mandated them.  Read more: US Stablecoin Law Could Actually Pass This Year, Lawmakers Say  Regulation could also seek to protect consumers, given that, if there is a crash, crypto whales with large holdings might end up getting a better deal, leaving smaller investors to carry the cost.  “Not every holder of stablecoin is white-listed for fiat conversion… this creates an un-level playing field and opens the system up for potential manipulation,” Hu said.  Under the current system, those with inside access could still trade at the advertised price even as it crashes for the rest of the market – creating an arbitrage opportunity that regulators might need to put a stop to, Hu said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/23/stablecoins-could-still-dominate-post-terra-sp-says,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The government-owned bank's Institute of Research and Expertise entertained the idea in a report titled ""Global Payments Under the Sanctions: Current State and Perspectives"" (PDF in Russian) that says the Ministry of Finance must create a framework for how Russian companies under sanctions can use cryptocurrencies.  The report, presented Wednesday during the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, proposes measures to allow Russia to trade internationally, evading sanctions aimed at isolating the country from global capital markets.  Gold can be a useful tool to compensate for the loss of most of Russia's export revenue, the authors say. For one, the country can sell its reserves to buyers in countries that don't support the sanctions. The deals would be hard to track, because they would take place over the counter, the report says.  The metal can also serve as backing for a “golden ruble” stablecoin. “Americans won’t have any means to block operations with the crypto-golden ruble because the price will be tied to the price of gold on the global market,” the report reads. The stablecoin would be used exclusively for settling import and export transactions, not for payment inside Russia, it says.  One drawback: The stablecoin will need to exist for seven to 10 years before it establishes a track record as a reliable cryptocurrency, the authors note.  The authors also suggest increasing collaboration with China, India and other BRICS countries, Brazil and South Africa, including the creation of a blockchain-based settlement system. Alternatively, each country could issue its own digital currency circulating on national markets that would be connected by “corridors” for settlement.  The report mentions the popularity of crypto mining in Iran, saying that the country is successfully using cryptocurrencies to circumvent U.S. sanctions. Iran’s case “shows that cryptocurrencies can be a real alternative to the U.S. dollar in certain circumstances.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/23/gold-backed-stablecoin-can-help-russia-circumvent-sanctions-government-owned-bank-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a798accae446c315927b734763f88c14e8eeae77-1499x1124.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Bitcoin trades flat and Polygon's MATIC surges 25%. We take a look at why MATIC is outperforming BTC.  Market moves: A dive into how Fed Chair Powell was challenged by senators on Wednesday on inflation and crypto regulation.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading flat over the last 24 hours, currently around $20,500. Altcoins outperformed BTC overnight, with MATIC, ATOM and AVAX all gaining ground.  Polygon’s MATIC rallied 25% on the day after a series of announcements and product launches. On Wednesday, Polygon announced the launch of Polygon ID integration. Polygon ID is a self-sovereign identity solution powered by ZK cryptography that brings huge potential for DAO governance, according to the company.  Polygon, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has also recently claimed to have obtained a major carbon neutrality (a balance between emitting and absorbing carbon) milestone, which could be contributing to the price uptick. Polygon announced earlier this week that it had partnered with KlimaDAO (a decentralized collective of environmentalists, developers and entrepreneurs) as part of its environmental initiative.  Polygon’s MATIC has been trading in an upward trajectory over the past seven days.  Some analysts are also attributing MATIC’s recent rally to a few weeks of whale accumulation. Santiment, the on-chain data provider, tweeted that sharks and whales holding MATIC have been in a large accumulation trend for the last six weeks.  “The tiers of holders ranging from 10K to 10M coins held have collectively added 8.7% more to their bags in this time span,” tweeted Sanitment.  Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk that the rallies for MATIC, ATOM and AVAX are being held up on low volume.  “Because of this we would expect that any decent drop in equities will lead to a sell-off in alts,” said Dibb.  He also noted that bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), or how much of the total market cap of crypto is comprised of bitcoin, has dropped considerably in the past few days from its high at +48%.  Dibb explained that this is because there has been relative strength in ether as well as litecoin versus bitcoin that has led to BTC dominance losing some ground.  “Our expectation is that should a further sell-off occur, we will see BTC.D continue to head north to short term highs,” added Dibb. “We see this as a temporary situation.""  Market moves  By Helene Braun  Fed Chair Powell Says Soft Landing Will Be 'Challenging,' Calls for Crypto Regulation  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the U.S. central bank must ""go ahead"" and keep raising interest rates to get inflation down, even if that means that the economy faces higher unemployment and a potential recession.  During a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, Powell said that a soft landing “is going to be very challenging,” and that a recession is “certainly a possibility.” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) called Powell the “most powerful man” in the world right now.  Three senators, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), challenged Powell with questions on crypto, specifically regulation, accounting treatment of digital assets and the current crash in the crypto market.  “We are tracking those events very carefully,” said Powell, but the central bank is “not really seeing significant macroeconomic implications, so far.""  He also repeatedly highlighted that there’s a need for a better regulatory framework for crypto.

In a statement, the London-based company advised its customers in Venezuela to “remove funds from the platform as soon as possible.” Trading service in the country will be available until July 31, and accounts will be fully restricted as of Sept. 30.  “After this date, the process to withdraw assets will be slower since you’ll have to go through our customer service team,” the company said.

42423068,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy28b5h,1655994115,Marathon Digital Cut to Neutral at B. Riley on Bitcoin Price Declines,"Due to the sharp fall in the price of bitcoin (BTC) in recent weeks, Wall Street firm B. Riley is reducing its price estimates for the digital asset and is also cutting price targets for the digital mining stocks it covers, it said in a report Thursday.  The broker downgraded Marathon Digital (MARA) from buy to neutral and slashed its price target from $34 a share to $9. The shares closed at $6.75 on Wednesday. Marathon Digital shares were falling 2.3% to $6.59 in early trading on Thursday.  B. Riley said its new rating, lower price target and reduced estimates for Marathon are due to a combination of lower bitcoin prices coupled with “repeated delays in the energization of miners outside Montana.”  B. Riley cut its estimates for the number of bitcoins Marathon will produce in June to 169, a drop of 60% from averages seen in the first quarter and a decline of 36% year over year, due to delays at the firm’s facilities in Texas.  For second quarter estimates, the broker forecasts BTC to average approximately $32,522, which is based on an average quarter-to-date price of $33,805 and assumes a $22,000 price for the rest of the quarter. For the third quarter and fourth quarter, B. Riley forecasts BTC to average $25,000 and $30,000, respectively. For 2023 and 2024, it is estimating an average bitcoin price of $34,000 and $45,000, respectively.  Given these updated BTC price expectations, the broker’s financial estimates fall significantly for the digital miners, the report says, noting that TeraWulf (WULF) is the most impacted by the updates as the company “has not scaled relative to other miners” in its coverage.  Riot Blockchain (RIOT) is best-positioned during the current crypto market volatility as it has no debt, has long-term access to cheap power and the company is already operating at scale, according to B. Riley.

Gucci has acquired $25,000 worth of RARE tokens to join the SuperRareDAO. With its buy-in, Gucci is launching the “Vault Art Space,” an exhibition that will include a selection of NFT artworks by 29 artists.  “We approached SuperRare for this knowing we could rely on our mutual effort to amplify the vision of this multifaceted group of artists,” Gucci Vault CEO Nicolas Oudinot told CoinDesk. “We were fascinated by SuperRare’s ability to provide [artists] with a platform to showcase their work in an innovative way, one that is built on a sense of community and that enhances interactions and decentralization as key tools to support both artists and collectors.”  The initiative comes as many luxury brands introduce NFTs and look for other ways to use blockchain technology. In February, Gucci dropped 10 NFTs through a collaboration with cult toy brand Superplastic.

Oudinot said that through the partnership, Gucci is looking to participate in a more “interconnected and decentralized economy.”  The exhibition will be on display and auctioned off directly on Vault’s website, which is housed by Gucci, in three drops.

42421527,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYVJ,1655988600,How Financial Advisors Should Think About the Crypto Crash,"The last several months, and especially the last couple of weeks, have been unkind to crypto markets. The downturn in prices – and the torpedoing of the store-of-value and non-correlated-asset theories about crypto – have turned many in the public square against digital assets as both an investment and a new financial system. Financial advisors who were thinking about adding crypto to their practices several months ago are likely taking a second look, and rightfully so.  Downturns aren’t fun, but often they’re also opportunities. Contrary to conventional wisdom, could this be a good time for financial advisors (FAs) to learn about and potentially implement digital assets into their practices? Let’s discuss.  First, what happened?  Without going back too far in the annals of crypto lore, we can look to November of 2021. With the world opening back up following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the realization that we now have trillions more dollars in circulation, not to mention supply-chain and production issues, tech stocks started finally falling in value. Bitcoin and crypto also started falling from their all-time highs.  At the time, this was just seen as healthy overall, even with a 40%+ drawdown in bitcoin price.  Then, in May, Terra happened. The $40 billion layer 1, or base layer, network lost almost all its value in a few days, pushing the price of bitcoin down through forced selling in an effort to remain solvent. This drastic fall highlighted some negatives related to crypto, specifically the centralization, poor incentive mechanisms and adherence to propped-up yield as a tool.  While the prices leveled out, the overall economy kept looking worse. With 40-year highs in inflation, more supply chain issues and record energy prices, talk of a coming recession began, which has brought a flight to liquidity and safety from all risk assets.  Read More: Where Should Advisors Go for Crypto Education?  The Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and crypto all fell. The multiple steep drops in bitcoin and ETH, led to the liquidation or near collapse of several hedge funds and lending platforms, such as Celsuis and Three Arrows Capital. More forced selling, more falling prices.  Bitcoin fell below $20,000, and ETH below $1,000. For the last couple of years we thought we would never see these levels again … but here we are.  As an advisor, you could choose to just ignore crypto for a few years, or altogether. Based on recent events, price action and narratives, I wouldn’t blame you. You have plenty of possible investment options for your clients.  If, on the other hand, you’re still determining which direction to take, here are some points for consideration.  Networks in use  While the prices of the crypto assets are way down, the networks and protocols underlying those assets are still being used. A recent report from the Fed (yes, that Fed) shows that possibly 40 million Americans are using cryptocurrency in some form. Up to 6 million of those people are using it for payments of some sort, and 60% of them have an income below $50,000.  The very people who need a new financial system are using it as intended. And the use of the networks will eventually drive the infrastructure, adoption and value of the assets.  Also, the most recent price downturn due to liquidation happened in a very traditional finance way. Centralized entities were using leverage with crypto as the collateral. For the most part, they were not using the decentralized financial system. The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols built for lending and trading have held up just fine so far, even with the extreme volatility and liquidations.  Increasing our understanding  While in the up-only, speculative mode, most people just pour money into tokens and protocols that produce the highest return or have a chance at an outsized return. There is maximum FOMO, or fear of missing out, at this stage, and we seldom look at the risks investors are taking to achieve those returns, other than the volatility of the assets.  When we’re in a situation like we’ve seen in the past several months, we start to better understand the risks of the interconnected system, leverage, lack of transparency, etc. We have seen the poor incentive system which could be gamed in Terra, and the rehypothecation and leverage of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital.  As an industry, we are increasingly understanding the risks inherent in the system, and how we can identify them before they negatively affect us and our clients. What are the risks of holding digital assets on an exchange, or even lending them to a centralized company, and is the return you receive enough to compensate for the risk?  We are getting better at comprehending the value of transparency as well, as we can predict the level at which major liquidations will happen, and even identify the parties that can be liquidated.  The increased understanding of transparency and value flows is also contributing to the better potential analysis of the value of certain protocols and their requisite tokens.  Regulation is coming  Even before the downturn, the growth in value and popularity of crypto had pushed U.S. regulators and legislators to talk about increased regulation. The recent events have given them even more to talk about.  U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a bipartisan bill to Congress, and it followed the executive order from the Biden administration, which gave various agencies marching orders with regard to regulating crypto assets.  Read More: How Advisors Can Add Value to Clients With Crypto  We will likely see more guidance and regulation in the coming 12 months, partially to protect investors and partially to protect the dollar. This will make advisors, wealth managers, institutions and investors feel a bit safer allocating to crypto.  What this all means for advisors  The growth in value and notoriety of the crypto industry in the past few years created tremendous growth in the infrastructure, while building a wall of cash in venture capital funds waiting to be deployed into the decentralized finance ecosystem.  As an advisor, this is a great opportunity for you. The decentralized financial tools of crypto will continue to be used and grow. More money will be poured into the applications, driving even more adoption.  Your clients, and prospective clients, will need you to be the expert to help keep their money safe, have intelligent conversations around risk and reward and educate them on the value of these assets and protocols.  They will need help from someone versed in finance to explain why the potential to earn 20% is still bad if the risk is too much.  They will need help from an expert to determine how and where to custody their assets.  They will need help understanding how they can earn yield using the DeFi system, and do so in a safe manner.  In the early 2000s, tech stocks experienced a severe crash. But the years after turned out to be the best time for investing early in the technology.

MATIC traded at more than 50 cents in European hours Thursday, up from 40 cents early Wednesday, hitting resistance at those levels. The tokens could surge to the 58-cent level if buying demand persists.  Polygon ID, a system that verifies a user's identity while allowing the user to maintain anonymity, went live on Polygon DAO on Wednesday night.  The system differs from current systems, whereby user data is stored on centralized servers and shared with a company. Instead, Polygon ID uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to make this possible. ZK proofs are an advanced cryptographic method allowing one party to prove to another that a statement is true while the prover avoids conveying additional information.  In a DAO, community members vote on protocol decisions using tokens and signatures from their personal wallets. Because such data exists on a blockchain, other users can trace previous transnational activity from voter wallets – thus reducing privacy.  “Old blockchain-based voting systems link voting behavior to public identifiers like wallets,” explained Polygon in a tweet. “Polygon ID lets DAOs allow only those that have received valid attestations to participate in voting.”",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING | ZK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/23/matic-jumps-as-polygon-introduces-improved-privacy-for-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7553eca8e7b74cc4cdafaf80d37a36a87ffa2ea-2286x1311.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423082,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy28bXh,1655982000,Brussels’ Fledgling Crypto Industry Flexes Its Muscles,"The crypto community in the city of Brussels is attempting to amplify the voice of its fledgling crypto ecosystem, as European Union negotiators reach the closing stages of landmark licensing laws for 27 countries.  As capital of Belgium and, in effect, of the European Union, Brussels hosts a small Web3 community that's attempting to get its act together in have its voice heard – as neighboring capitals such as Paris have already done.  The inaugural Brussels Blockchain Week, which began Monday, saw repeated vows to not let the current bear market get in the way of optimism about the sector.  “Some, and many at the European Commission, will see the recent crypto market downturn as the evidence that this was just one big Ponzi scheme, that this was bound to end in tears, that we're seeing the beginning of the end,” said Peter Kerstens, a policy adviser at the EU’s executive arm, in a speech Monday. “I don't see that.”  Kerstens said that, given the transformational potential of the underlying distributed technology, he personally remained “very, very bullish about blockchain, crypto and Web3.”  Recent crypto market turbulence has spelled trouble for initiatives some thought of as the future of crypto finance – like lender Celsius and stablecoin terraUSD. But some in Brussels’ crypto industry argue that this is a mere filtering out of the froth, allowing markets to discover the businesses that add genuine value.  “What is amazing about this market today is that all the sugar is gone,” Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, told the audience, comparing the hype about Bored Ape and currencies going to the moon to the eye-catching frosting on a donut.  Read more: EU's Crypto Activism Gets Mixed Reception at Paris Blockchain Week  With the crypto crash, “you only see the real thing, which means that you actually did what makes sense … what actually has value in the long term and what doesn't. And that is basically the promise of blockchain,” he said.  The crypto world is becoming increasingly positive about Europe. Germany topped a recent list of the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions; Binance is now suggesting recent registrations in France and Italy could be the start of something bigger.  “I can imagine a situation where if things keep going the way they are going, we might eventually end up with headquarters in Europe,” Martin Bruncko, the executive vice-president for Europe of Binance – the world’s leading crypto exchange – told the conference attendees.  For companies like Keyrock, Belgium itself may not be the draw. Although his company, and around half of its 70 staffers, are based in the country, de Patoul is open about the fact that it’s not the most dynamic of locations for crypto.  Brussels sprouts  As a blockchain company in Belgium, “you're one of the one of the few,” de Patoul told CoinDesk. “Brussels is not one of the financial centers of the world.”  But the company – a market-maker that helps traders secure liquidity in favored crypto asset markets – can still serve its global market from a Belgian base, aided by cooperation from the national central bank and regulator Financial Services and Market Authority, he says.  The attitude of regulators has “very positively evolved since we started in 2017,” de Patoul said. “Now it's a lot more positive and they really know their stuff.”  Belgium appears to be following in the footsteps of its neighbor France, where the crypto industry has gathered together to make its political voice heard, and which annually hosts the equivalent event, Paris Blockchain Week.  But maybe Brussels has one thing Paris doesn’t. As seat of the EU institutions, it also offers the company proximity to policymakers, he said – people like Kerstens, and the lawmakers and negotiators developing the legal framework that could last for years to come, such as the EU’s flagship Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA).  In terms of political influence, “clearly being here does have a positive impact,” he said, adding that rules like MiCA are “going in the right direction, simply a bit too slow for our taste.”  Talks on MiCA – which lets crypto issuers market across Europe if they publish a white paper of information for investors – are reaching their final stages, with key questions still hanging about how to treat areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).  “We have many bad ideas” on how to regulate DeFi, said Kerstens, because it overturns conventional financial-regulation norms that usually identify a central entity to hold responsible. “If you have good ideas … don't be shy, come and see us.”  Read more: NFT Issuers Could Have to Centralize and Register Under EU's MiCA Rules, France Warns  But Kerstens, adviser for technological innovation and cybersecurity at the European Commission’s financial-services arm, does want to regulate at least some aspects of NFTs.  Despite crypto industry protests against treating Bored Ape differently from offline art markets, officials believe they need to deal with financial-market abuses such as wash trades, in which brokers and traders collude to manipulate prices.  “We accept that it's silly to do a white paper for every non-fungible token,” Kerstens said. “But when you look at the service provisions – the custody of non-fungible tokens, the exchange, the brokerage, the advice – what really is the difference between custody of an NFT and custody of bitcoin and custody of Ethereum? It's the same thing; it's the same service.”  Tax woes  How those issues are resolved could prove crucial to the future of Web3 in Belgium, and the EU’s 26 other member countries too. But in many cases, Belgian crypto companies’ woes stem not from the supranational bloc, but from homegrown problems like taxes.  Belgium takes the highest labor taxes of all developed countries measured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – a problem for any entrepreneurial startup looking to hire – but also there’s uncertainty over how to tax crypto gains, which depends on whether trading is deemed professional or mere household budget management.  Others, like Florian Ernotte, an associate at law firm Avroy Avocats and founder of the site cryptomonnaie.be, also point to the lack of legal recognition for decentralized autonomous organizations, the groups that set up DeFi applications, a lacuna that he says may hamper competitiveness.  One of the lawmakers who might try to change all that is Christophe De Beukelaer, a crypto enthusiast who is also a member of the Brussels Parliament for the centrist Les Engagés party and co-founder of Brussels Blockchain Week.  In January, De Beukelaer tweeted that he would take his salary in bitcoin (BTC) in a bid to raise awareness of innovative assets as a store of value.  Since then, the currency’s value has halved – though he says he’s unmoved by the rises and falls in the market. That may also be because, in practice, he takes a conventional euro paycheck that he then converts into BTC each month, partly insulating himself from market swings.  While originally inviting hostility from colleagues, some of whom De Beukelaer says branded him an “anarchist,” he also believes his advocacy has begun to raise awareness and curiosity about the potential of crypto – which he remains convinced can make finance fairer.  “My entry point is the realization that we are in a very unfair financial world: Many people don't have access,” he told CoinDesk, adding that crypto offered transparency and the same rules for everyone. “In Belgium and also in Europe, you have very few people who have access to the financial markets.”  As a lawmaker in what is effectively the city administration for a capital of around 1.2 million, De Beukelaer concedes he has limited powers to effect change. But he hopes Belgium can use its forthcoming EU presidency, during which it will chair meetings of the bloc’s member states in the first half of 2024.  “I want to work with other members of Parliament on that to be sure we … have a real impact on important legislation at a European level, to make two or three breakthroughs on Web3,” he said.  As to whether he has the support of the federal government – or the country’s other, bigger regions of Flanders and Wallonia – to pursue that goal, he is candid.  “Not yet,” he said. “But I'm working on it.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/23/brussels-fledgling-crypto-industry-flexes-its-muscles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a34ce5aa460923b3ec8fe048a96c75282d49e959-3487x2615.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If approved, the tax will be implemented in addition to the 30% crypto income tax already in place. 28% GST Tax on Crypto According to a local media report, an Indian ministry panel, comprising federal and state finance ministers will meet next week to discuss a 28% goods and services tax (GST) on cryptocurrency transactions. Starting June 28, 2022, it has been said that the panel won&apos;t be able to finalize a rate during the two-day meeting, reportedly. However, it is certain that they&apos;ll discuss placing cryptocurrency in the highest tax slab of 28%, the report added.

As per the new tax regime that went into effect on April 1, all gains from the sale of VDAs will face a tax of 30 percent.

42423065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy28b1h,1655978400,Solar-Powered Bitcoin Miner Starts Operations Despite Difficult Market,"Despite the bear market for crypto, Aspen Creek Digital Corp., a new bitcoin miner, has started mining at a six-megawatts solar-powered facility in the western part of Colorado.  Aspen Creek was founded in January, and its mining operation is co-located at a solar farm that has a capacity of 10 megawatts. The company wants to start with mining bitcoin at its data center and eventually offer computing services to other businesses, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk.  The Colorado data center will run S19 bitcoin mining machines and be co-located with a 75,000-square-foot research-and-development center and fulfillment facility. The facility will serve as a centralized testing, maintenance, storage and training hub for Aspen Creek's computing infrastructure.  The miner is entering the industry at a time when existing miners are finding it difficult to remain profitable with the decline in crypto prices, hashrates that are near all-time highs, a tightening capital market, higher power costs and supply chain issues.  The company, however, was able to raise enough cash to secure the required switch gears and transformers for 240 megawatts of capacity, CEO Alexandra DaCosta said.  “We wanted to make sure that we had the appropriate infrastructure on hand to build out our first phase. So for our projects, now we actually have more than enough,” she told CoinDesk.  ‘Power first’  Crypto-focused financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY) was impressed enough by the miner’s management team and “power first” approach that it allocated some of Galaxy’s own miners to be hosted at Aspen Creek's Colorado site.  “The best time to build is a bear market and people shouldn't be afraid of the market conditions, they just have to make sure that they're doing it appropriately and effectively,” Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy, told CoinDesk.  Fabiano said that she has seen many miners try to raise money first and then try to find operation sites and power sources. Aspen Creek, however, did the opposite by figuring out the power and infrastructure first.  “She [DaCosta] took the problem of mining and spun it on its head and looked at it from a different perspective, which is really special,” Fabiano added.  Aspen Creek is also developing bitcoin mining sites across Texas. Its second facility, which is on track to be operational this summer, is a 30-MW data center capable of hosting 10,000 ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners co-located behind-the-meter with an 87-MW solar farm. And a third project is a 150-MW data center, also co-located behind-the-meter, with a 200-MW solar farm.  Although the miner’s operations will be powered by solar energy, they will still be connected to the grid to have the option to provide power back to the grid. When asked about the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT) latest requirement for new large-scale miners to seek permission before connecting to the grid, DaCosta said that her company had already successfully completed the procedural requirements for its second site and is doing the appropriate work for the third site.  Aspen Creek said it was able to figure out the power sources with the help of its partners that have experience in building renewable energy power infrastructure. The renewable power developers are also part of the miner’s founding group and equity investors in the company.  The move to use solar as a power source comes as more miners are looking to use renewable sources of energy for their operations as lawmakers around the world scrutinize miners' energy consumption. Most recently, Blockstream and Block (SQ) said that they are building a pilot crypto mine in Texas that will be powered by a Tesla (TSLA) solar installation and batteries.

In an interview with the newspaper, Sopnendu Mohanty said Singapore has enforced a “painfully slow” and “extremely draconian due diligence process” for licensing crypto businesses in order to protect the wider economy.  In April, Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund that has suffered heavy losses in the recent market downturn, said it will leave Singapore for Dubai, as the regulatory environment in Singapore sours. Earlier, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, shut down its Singapore unit and dropped its application for a license after MAS told it to stop all crypto transfers.

The 24-hour trading volume of Sandbox is $433 Million, indicating a hike of 40%.

USTC (formerly UST) was among the largest stablecoins by market cap and the single largest stablecoin on the Cosmos blockchain. This is not the first time an algorithmic stablecoin fell below the point of recovery. So much so that the head of the IMF even suggested that stablecoins that are not backed by physical assets are similar to pyramid schemes. However, a crash as biblical as that of UST was a first for a stablecoin. While history seemed to have indicated this to be an obvious outcome, the utility of UST and the communities around LUNC-UST indicated otherwise. The Death Spiral - Here&apos;s What Went Wrong Stablecoins are digital assets whose value is pegged to a fiat currency or other asset. USTC is one such stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar by not backed by it. LUNC maintained USTC&apos;s price algorithmically, using a mint and burn mechanism. When USTC&apos;s demand-to-supply ratio was high, more LUNC was burnt. Contrariwise, more LUNC was minted when USTC&apos;s supply-to-demand ratio was high.

Is that even possible? Voltage, a bitcoin infrastructure provider, makes a great case for it. Granted, their &apos;Identity and brand on the Lightning Network&apos; article is in itself a branding effort by the company. That doesn&apos;t mean the information it contains is invalid, though. In fact, they probably hit the nail on the head with this one. The company&apos;s CEO, Graham Krizek, is the piece&apos;s author. &apos;One of the interesting things about the Lightning Network is that you as a node operator have a &apos;billboard&apos; (an alias) with which to advertise your node. The alias is a human-readable, and changeable value that people interacting with your node can see,&apos; he says going straight to the point. The other factor here is time. Companies that start their branding efforts now will reap the most benefits in the future. Let&apos;s let Voltage explain what their thesis is about: &apos;The Lightning Network is still in the Innovator to Early Adopter phase of the Adoption S-Curve. Despite rapid growth, participants continue to have a unique opportunity to use minimal effort to capture a large potential upside in value. The creation of a node in under 2 minutes allows companies and individuals to have a stake in the Lightning Network and leverage this to build differentiating brands.&apos; The keywords here are &apos;minimal effort&apos; and &apos;under 2 minutes,&apos; but don&apos;t let Voltage fool you.

26674,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=240608,1655944241,When Will the Current Crypto Bear Market Come to an End ?,"The main trigger of the 2021 bull run was the third Bitcoin halving event in May 2020. After two years of mass dump and bear market, the post-crypto bull cycle attracted a lot more attention internationally in 2021. However, the sentiments have now changed, and as per retail investors, the bear market or the crypto winter is here. Moreover, there are no definite indicators that can help in finding out when the crypto bear market will finally come to an end. Every few years, the cryptocurrency and virtual asset sector enters an extended bear market. Bitcoin and Ethereum drop by double digits, while some other assets are completely wiped out. That is what we are again seeing in 2022. Assuming that the cryptocurrency sector will continue to be as cyclical as it has in the past, investors must wonder how long this crypto bear market will last. Here&apos;s a Glance at the Bear Markets Conditions Over the past 3 months, with inflation spiking and recession issues spreading, Bitcoin has dropped from an excess of $48,000 to roughly $18,000. The current Bitcoin price is a long way off from the latest all-time high it hit in November 2021, when it went over $68,000. But even with the recent decline in price, Bitcoin is still more than twice as valuable as it was just a couple of years ago. For Bitcoin, these kinds of ups and downs are nothing new. A few top traders assume we&apos;re in for another painful, extended period of low prices.
