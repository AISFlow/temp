34430241,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646668,1728342028,"Ethereum Could Reclaim $2,700 As Key Data Signals Reduced Selling Pressure","Ethereum (ETH) currently trades approximately 11% below its local highs of around $2,730. Investors are optimistic about a potential price surge in the coming days, driven by encouraging on-chain data. Key metrics from Glassnode indicate a decline in ETH inflows into exchanges, suggesting that investors are holding onto their assets rather than selling. This trend typically points to increased accumulation and could foreshadow a bullish breakout. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Pattern Could Ignite A Breakout: Analyst Sets $15 Target As the broader crypto market evolves, Ethereum investors remain vigilant, anticipating a bullish reclaim that could propel prices higher. The decrease in exchange inflows could signify that traders are positioning themselves for a potential upward movement, as they seem more inclined to retain their holdings during this crucial phase. Should Ethereum successfully break above critical resistance levels, it could reignite bullish momentum and attract further investment. The next few days will be pivotal for ETH, as traders closely monitor price action and on-chain metrics for signs of a resurgence. With the right conditions, Ethereum may set its sights on new highs, reinforcing the overall positive sentiment in the market. Ethereum Exchanges’ Net Position Change Decreases Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a crucial price level following a 15% dip from its local highs. The broader crypto industry is brimming with anticipation for a massive rally after the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates a couple of weeks ago. However, despite the optimistic outlook, prices have struggled to climb higher, leaving many investors on edge. Fortunately, on-chain data from Glassnode suggests a reduction in selling pressure, which could improve market sentiment and pave the way for a potential ETH rebound. One key metric to consider is the Ethereum Exchanges’ Net Position Change indicator, which has been downward since mid-September. This indicator tracks the flow of ETH into and out of exchanges, and its recent decline signifies that inflows have dropped significantly. Lower inflows typically indicate reduced selling pressure, as fewer investors are moving their assets onto exchanges to sell. This shift in momentum reflects a positive change in market sentiment, suggesting that investors may be less inclined to liquidate their positions at current price levels. As selling activity decreases, Ethereum could gain some much-needed breathing room to recover from its recent decline. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Moreover, increased confidence among investors might lead to upward price movement in the coming days. Ethereum may be positioned for a resurgence if this trend continues, potentially setting the stage for a bullish breakout as market dynamics shift in its favor. As traders remain vigilant, all eyes will be on ETH to see if it can capitalize on this improved sentiment and regain upward momentum. ETH Testing Crucial Supply Levels Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,448 after facing rejection at the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,516. The price also struggled to maintain momentum above the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,458, indicating a critical moment for ETH. If Ethereum fails to reclaim both of these key levels in the coming days, it may be at serious risk of dropping towards the $2,200 area, potentially triggering a deeper correction. Conversely, if ETH manages to break above and hold these crucial indicators, it could signal a bullish trend reversal, opening the door for a surge toward the $2,700 resistance area. The outcome in the next few days will be vital for determining Ethereum’s trajectory. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? Traders and investors will closely monitor these levels, as the ability to reclaim them could provide the momentum needed for ETH to regain strength and attempt to test higher price levels. The current price action reflects the uncertainty in the market, making it imperative for ETH to assert itself decisively to inspire confidence and drive a rally.

According to data from TokenUnlocksApp, millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies will flood various ecosystems this week, which could further amplify the prevailing selling pressure. Of these cryptocurrencies, Aptos (APT) dominates the token unlocks, with almost $100 million worth of APT set to be unlocked in the next seven days. Explaining The Token Unlocks Token unlocks refer to the release of a predetermined number of tokens that were previously locked or vested during the cryptocurrency’s launch. When these tokens become available, they can be traded on the market, which often leads to increased liquidity. However, a potential downside is that a sudden surge in supply can lead to price volatility as recipients of unlocked tokens might decide to sell, causing downward pressure on prices. As such, new buyers are used as the exit liquidity for early investors, team members, or project developers who are given these unlocked tokens. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year According to data from TokenUnlocksApp, this week’s crypto market activity will see a significant release of tokens across three major projects: Optimism (OP), Aptos (APT), and Taiko (TAIKO). These upcoming unlocks are particularly noteworthy because they follow a cliff unlock mechanism, where a large number of tokens are released in one go. Interestingly, these unlocks come just a week after SUI, another prominent blockchain project, unlocked 64.19 million tokens valued at approximately $106 million. Among these three projects, Aptos stands out with the most significant unlock. A total of 11.3 million APT tokens, collectively worth approximately $99.75 million at the current price of APT, are set to be released. The second most notable unlock comes from Optimism, which will release 12.47 million OP tokens valued at around $21 million. Taiko, a project focusing on zk-Rollup technology for Ethereum scaling, will also unlock 12 million tokens with a total value estimated at $20.28 million. What Next? Should You Buy Or Sell? Cliff token unlocks have more profound effects on the price of cryptocurrencies than linear unlocks. Of the three ecosystems, Taiko’s unlock seems to be the most important, as a larger part of its circulating supply (15.62%) is going to be unlocked in a single event, which could dramatically influence its price action. In comparison, Aptos and Optimism will see smaller portions of their total circulating supply unlocked. Aptos is set to unlock 2.3% of its circulating supply, while Optimism will release 1% of its circulating supply.

This is especially true for retail investors, as they could bear the risk of the liquidity as these tokens are unlocked. They could be used as exit liquidity once the owners of the unlocked tokens decide to sell or reduce their exposure.

42407464,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqnd,1728334251,Delaware Judge Approves FTX Estate’s Bankruptcy Plan,"A U.S. court approved FTX’s bankruptcy plan on Monday, which will see the majority of the crypto exchange’s customers get the equivalent of their 2022 losses, and then some.  The decision confirms the FTX estate’s second amended bankruptcy plan, which was filed in September and met with the approval of 96% of voting creditors by headcount, and 98% of creditors by amount. According to the plan, customers can expect to receive cash repayments worth an average of 118% of the value of their holdings at the time FTX filed for bankruptcy in November of 2022, though some could get up to 140%, lawyers for the estate said Monday. While more than creditors expected to receive two years ago, the funds will not match the gains bitcoin {{BTC}} and other cryptocurrencies saw over the course of FTX's bankruptcy.  During the nearly six-hour long hearing, Judge John T. Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware heard arguments from creditors about the remaining objections to the plan, including objections from companies like Celsius and Layer Zero, as well as objections from a number of individual creditors (some represented by attorneys and some representing themselves) who expressed concerns with the estate’s decision to repay creditors with cash instead of in-kind crypto distributions, the valuation of FTT tokens (which the estate put at zero), and their alleged property rights granted by FTX’s terms of service. Dorsey overruled them all.  Despite a lengthy discussion during the hearing about the FTT token’s inherent lack of value, the token price jumped 55% on the news that Dorsey had given FTX’s bankruptcy plan his stamp of approval.  Brian Glueckstein, an attorney for the FTX estate and a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, argued Monday that the correct valuation of the FTT tokens held by creditors was, in fact, zero, and there was “no basis” for a revision to this decision.  “Experts explained that FTT has no fundamental value. There's no utility outside of an operating FTX.com exchange,” Glueckstein said. “There is no and there will be no restarted FTX.com exchange.”  The so-called “property rights” objections – including that creditors should be able to get their holdings back in-kind, rather than in cash, and that creditors are entitled to the other property of the estate – were also overruled after FTX’s lawyers and expert witnesses, including Edgar Mosley, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez and Marsal, testified that it would be impossible to return their crypto in-kind because the estate simply did not have those assets.  The exchange’s ability to repay customers is due to the liquidation of certain investments made by FTX and Alameda, including an 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic (sold for $884 million), the dramatic rise in crypto prices since the exchange’s collapse two years ago and clawback efforts by the estate. When current FTX CEO John J. Ray III took over from former CEO and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, the exchange’s coffers were nearly empty, containing only a sliver of the crypto it owed its customers – for example, only 105 bitcoin (worth about $17,000 at the time) remained on the exchange, compared to the nearly 100,000 customers had deposited.  To go out and purchase the correct amount of cryptocurrency owed to creditors on the open market, at current valuations, would also be impossible, lawyers argued. Dorsey concurred.  Though in-kind crypto distributions are out of the question, lawyers for the FTX estate did say that they were still considering making a stablecoin distribution for creditors an option, and confirmed that they are in discussions with at least four companies who could handle such a distribution if necessary. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has objected to this aspect of the repayment plan.",POSITIVE,BTC | FTT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FTT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/07/delaware-judge-approves-ftx-estates-bankruptcy-plan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51f6e4c4cfce2eb39ab01c781d7662f4a50de559-7659x5108.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407455,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqaP,1728334141,MicroStrategy Surges to 6-Month High as Bitcoin Wrestles With Key Moving Average,"The S&P 500 and Nasdaq tumbled over 1% and closed the day near their lows, possibly pushing down crypto prices, which shed much of their earlier gains.  Over $215 million in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated during the day, hitting longs and shorts equally.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) surged 5.5%, its possible overvaluation to bitcoin rising even more and maybe setting the stage for more debt offerings, creating a continued positive feedback loop with its stock, 10x Research noted.  The crypto rally stumbled during the Monday U.S. trading session with bitcoin {{BTC}} slipping to $62,800 from near $64,000 within an hour along with an abrupt nosedive in the stock market.  The quick volatility burst happened without any immediately apparent reasons, sending the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq tumbling over 1% during the afternoon session, while the volatility index VIX spiked 19% to its highest reading in a month.  Stock indices closed the day around their lows, but bitcoin quickly recovered some of the losses, recently changing hands at $63,300, up 0.7% over the past 24 hours, but down nearly 2% from its daily high of $64,400. The broad-based benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index gained 0.3% over the same time period.  Ether {{ETH}} underperformed with minor losses, while tokens of Near Protocol {{NEAR}}, Uniswap {{UNI}} and Aptos {{APT}} showed relative strength with 5%-8% advances.  The rollercoaster in prices hit bulls and bears equally, liquidating over $210 million worth of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $110 million of liquidations were longs betting on higher prices, while $105 million worth of positions were shorts anticipating price weakness.  What may have helped cryptocurrencies to recover quicker versus the stock market is that a U.S. judge approved FTX's bankruptcy plan, opening the way to repay creditors of the imploded crypto exchange.  Still, Monday's price action meant that BTC briefly reclaimed the 200-day moving average, which currently sits at $63,575 per TradingView data, but ultimately failed to hold above it. Moving and holding past that key level would reaffirm bitcoin's uptrend since the lows of around $52,000 hit in the first week in September.  Digital asset investment product issuer ETC Group – recently acquired by Bitwise – noted that bitcoin's rise over the past few days coincided with increasing odds of Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election in November. Bettors on blockchain-based prediction marketplace Polymarket see 53.5% odds for a Trump win versus Kamala Harris, up from equal chances on Friday.  MSTR is overvalued vs. BTC, but could rally more  MicroStrategy (MSTR) was a notable outlier amid a weak stock market, with shares surging to $190 for the first time since late March and closing the day 5.5% higher. The company is the largest public corporate owner of bitcoin, holding nearly $16 billion of the asset.  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, noted in a report before Monday market open that a breakout above the $180 price level could beget more strength, even though his regression analysis showed the stock was already 44% overvalued versus BTC.  ""Market makers may be forced to hedge their short gamma exposure as they likely sold calls to retail investors), and hedge funds holding $4.6 billion in short positions on MicroStrategy shares could face pressure to cover those shorts if the price surpasses the $180 mark,"" Thielen wrote.  The rally could induce MicroStrategy to raise even more debt for acquiring bitcoin, as demand for the company's notes have been strong with consistently upsizing the issuance, Thielen said in the report.  ""Raising even more debt to purchase bitcoin seems logical,"" he wrote. ""A breakout in MicroStrategy’s stock could have a 'tail wags the dog' effect, where the momentum in its shares positively impacts Bitcoin’s price, creating a feedback loop.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/07/microstrategy-surges-to-6-month-high-as-bitcoin-wrestles-with-key-moving-average,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5782e0142b0e923183df9c44dad8538e4a52909b-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34426325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646832,1728333186,"FTX Bankruptcy Plan Approved: $16 Billion In Assets To Be Repaid, FTT Price Soars 20%","A US bankruptcy court has officially approved crypto exchange FTX liquidation plan, paving the way for it to repay customers using $16 billion in recovered assets, according to Reuters, which reports that the ruling was made by Judge John Dorsey during a court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. Court Approves FTX Settlements The approved plan includes a series of settlements with FTX customers, creditors, US government agencies, and liquidators tasked with managing the company’s operations outside the United States. Related Reading: Here’s Where We Are In The Bitcoin Bull Cycle According To The Wall Street Cheat Sheet These settlements prioritize the repayment of customers before addressing claims from government regulators, allowing FTX to utilize its assets effectively in the repayment process. Under the approved plan, FTX customers will receive at least 118% of the value of their accounts as of November 2022, the month the failed crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy. Customer Reactions Remain Mixed According to Reuters, FTX has characterized this outcome as a triumph for its creditors, attributing it to the successful recovery of cash and crypto assets that had initially gone missing amid the chaos surrounding the company’s collapse. Additionally, FTX has raised further funds by liquidating other assets, including its investments in various technology firms, such as the artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential However, customer reactions to the repayment plan have been mixed. Many former users of the exchange have expressed disappointment, feeling that the collapse of FTX prevented them from taking advantage of a significant rebound in cryptocurrency prices since the market hit its lowest point in 2022. Some customers have voiced objections to the plan, arguing for higher repayments that reflect the recent increases in crypto values. FTX has maintained that it cannot simply return the cryptocurrency assets originally deposited by customers, as those assets were misappropriated by founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for defrauding FTX customers, has since appealed his conviction, further complicating the aftermath of the exchange’s failure. At the time of writing, the exchange’s native token, FTT, has jumped 20% to the $3 mark for the first time in nearly 8 months amid the first quarter of the year’s uptrend. CoinGecko data also shows that FTT has seen a notable 176% increase in trading volume in the last few hours, but is still down nearly 97% from its all-time high of $84, reached in September 2021.

After several weeks of volatile market movements marked by sharp ups and downs, the entire crypto market is at a turning point. Many believe this week could set the stage for a massive rally. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Path To New Highs: Analyst Eyes $160 As Critical Breakpoint Top analysts and investors are weighing in, with prominent crypto analyst Ali sharing compelling data that projects a significant surge for Dogecoin in this cycle. According to Ali, if DOGE can break its resistance levels, it could spark a positive trend for the meme coin. This information has impressed many in the crypto space, as Dogecoin has been known for its explosive movements in past cycles. With so much on the line, the next few days could be pivotal for DOGE’s future. Dogecoin Testing Crucial Resistance Dogecoin is testing a crucial resistance at $0.115, with bulls waiting for a breakout that could trigger a new rally. According to crypto analyst Ali, Dogecoin potentially repeats a familiar historical pattern, as shared in his technical analysis on X. Ali’s chart reveals that DOGE has consistently followed a bullish cycle pattern: a breakout from a multi-year descending triangle, a massive 200% surge, followed by a 60% retracement, and then an eventual bull run. Dogecoin has recently experienced a significant 65% pullback, which many believe could set the stage for its next explosive rally. If this pattern holds, DOGE may be on the brink of another major upward movement. Ali suggests that history often repeats itself in crypto, and Dogecoin appears poised to follow the same path. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand If Dogecoin starts pumping, the price action could be fast and aggressive, as has been the case in previous cycles. Investors are encouraged to closely monitor DOGE in the coming days. A breakout above the $0.115 resistance level could signal the beginning of the next bullish phase. This potential rally could bring significant opportunities for those tracking the market closely. Technical Analysis: Key Levels Dogecoin is trading at $0.111 after a modest attempt to test the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.117. The price now faces a potential for a retracement if it fails to reclaim this key indicator. If DOGE cannot break above the 200 EMA, the price will drop to $0.10, signaling a deeper correction. On the bullish side, if Dogecoin manages to push past the $0.12 mark, it could spark a new rally. The next significant supply level to test would be around $0.14, presenting a crucial target for bulls looking to gain momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers As the market remains uncertain, the coming days will determine whether Dogecoin will continue its upward trend or face further downside pressure.

42407449,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHq9x,1728326452,"My Friend, Satoshi?","An HBO documentary coming out Tuesday has reopened speculation that my late friendLen Sassaman was Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin. The filmmaker claims to have confronted the person he believes is Satoshi face-to-face, which would make it unlikely Len, who committed suicide in 2011, is his suspect. Nevertheless, others have written convincingly and at length about Len’s technical chops that made him a logical Satoshi candidate.  Whatever the film claims, I’d like to share the Len that I knew, and why I, too, think it's plausible that he was Satoshi.  Justin Newton is the CEO of Netki, a provider of identity validation services. This article is adapted from a post published on LinkedIn.  When I met Len Sassaman, he was wearing a rumpled jacket and tie. We were in history teacher Thomas Ruth's living room at the Hill School, a boarding school in Pottstown, Pa.. Len was in his junior year, and I, an alumnus working in the data center business, was back from the San Francisco Bay Area to visit Tom for a long weekend.  Len sat on the couch. I was in a nearby chair. Tom, one of my mentors, was known for taking kids under his wing who had a difficult upbringing or a hard time fitting in. Len was one such kid. He was having trouble keeping regular eye contact and would greatly downplay his achievements.  Even though he was only 16, Len showed great promise as a computer scientist, and Tom asked if I would be willing to be a friend in the field who could help Len find his footing and his way. I owe a lot to Tom, so of course I agreed. That first day we spent about two and a half hours in Tom’s living room, drinking hot tea that was the equivalent of Jolt Cola, because it had all of the sugar, and twice the caffeine that you would expect in a teacup.  As I look back on that conversation, I remember a number of things we discussed that day, and in retrospect, Len's ideas aligned well with who Satoshi Nakamoto was (or is).  Another mentor of mine had pointed out to me how technology and history influenced each other in cycles, and how great inventions change society and change the world. I shared this eureka moment with Len: that great skill in tech could be the lever that, if pulled hard enough, can move the world in the direction we want it to go.  This was the moment in the discussion when Len went from being passive, shy, and reserved, to passionate and deeply engaged. Until that point, he had lived in a world that was shaped by the popular kids; seeing a path where he could help shape the future, without having to be in the limelight, caused a striking and immediate change in his posture, from slouching to erect and leaning forward and his eyes from downcast to wide open and looking directly at me.  At this point, Tom sat back in his chair with a knowing smile on his face, occasionally getting up to make sure Len and I both had full cups of his infamous rocket fuel to keep the conversation going. We spent the next several hours talking about the importance of freedom of communication, online anonymity, and democratization of information. The conversation included developing open source software and standards, expressing our values through code, and creating software that could change the world, and predicting some of those impacts.  Read more:Polymarket Bettors Say HBO Documentary Will Name Len Sassaman as Satoshi Nakamoto  The Silicon Valley Years  Shortly after I moved to Los Angeles to work at NetZero, an internet service provider, Len moved to San Francisco. I introduced him to my friends in the North American Network Operators' Group (NANOG) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) communities, connecting him to my tribe on the path to him finding his own.  We stayed in relatively close contact for about 10 years after that. We wouldn’t talk for a while, and then I’d get an email or a text message asking “Do you have time for a call?” with no context. Some of those calls were quick questions about career advice as he was considering job offers, or whether he should stay at a role that wasn’t fully engaging to him. Those were usually quick calls because he just needed someone he trusted in the field to validate what he was thinking or seeing.  The longer calls were similar to the conversations on Tom's couch. We spent hours talking about the value of open and permissionless innovation, and how important the networks were that allowed people to build without having to ask permission.  We talked for hours about the trade-offs of allowing bad actors to do bad things versus the benefit of letting good actors move quickly without waiting for slow, conservative institutions to say yes.  Ultimately, we agreed that the networks themselves should be completely open, and that the controls should be built at other layers, either with technology, whenever possible, or with law when absolutely necessary.  This principle sits at the core of Bitcoin, and is perhaps its most valuable and enduring characteristic.  Read more:HBO Is Joining Search for Bitcoin's Satoshi. Past Attempts Haven’t Turned Out Great.  Satoshi? Maybe  There are many people who give logical reasons that Len could not have been Satoshi, but in my view, those people don’t know who Len was. Here are my responses to their points:  ""Len wasn’t rich, and his family isn’t rich now."" Len believed that the purpose of working in technology was not to get rich, but instead to create the future we all want to live in. This would tie in well with the fact that Satoshi never profited from Bitcoin the way he or she or they could have, given that the coins mined by Bitcoin's creator haven't moved. I can 100% see Len destroying the private keys to his mining wallets to ensure he or anyone else couldn't cash in on what he did.  ""Len was a Bitcoin skeptic and critical of it on Twitter."" Len was frequently highly critical of the projects he was deeply involved in. One of the ways his personality played itself out was to believe that his work wasn't good enough, even when it was incredible. Publicizing those criticisms would be a good way for him to keep the anonymity and distance he would have sought if he were indeed Satoshi.  Read more:Len Sassaman Gets the Memecoin Treatment Ahead of HBO Bitcoin Creator Documentary  Some other points:  Len was a strong believer in building open and permissionless networks for innovation. It was this feature of Bitcoin that originally drew me to it, and I would not be surprised if Len built a network like that.  Len was 100% a believer in the rights of the individual over the power of authority. At the same time, he was not the type of libertarian who flocked to the early Bitcoin community. I can definitely see that if he were Satoshi, watching his creation get co-opted by get-rich-quick types could have led him to walk away from the project and possibly heighten his depression.  To be clear: Len and I never discussed Bitcoin and if he was Satoshi I can readily see why he wouldn't want to discuss it with me or any of our friends. At the end of the day, I have no idea if he was Satoshi. He certainly could have been, considering both his skills and who he was as a person.  In any case, Len was a wonderful person who deserved better than the world treated him. His memory shines brightly in my heart.

34422883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646683,1728325842,Crypto Analyst Predicts Hedera (HBAR) To Skyrocket 2900% This Bull Run,"Crypto analyst Egrag has once again shared a bullish analysis of Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), predicting a potential 30x increase (2,900%). His latest chart analysis (HBAR/USD) presents a view where HBAR stands in the current market cycle, highlighting key Fibonacci retracement levels and critical price points that could guide HBAR’s movement in the months ahead. At the time of Egrag’s analysis, HBAR is trading at approximately $0.0553, with a recent low marked around $0.0355. This price action in the 2-week chart is taking place along a key upward trendline that has acted as strong support multiple times since 2020. This trendline, which stretches over multiple years, has held HBAR’s price during dips and corrections, except for one instance in December 2019. Egrag also pinpoints several Fibonacci retracement levels, a popular tool used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance levels. These levels are derived from the Fibonacci sequence, where each level corresponds to a percentage of the price movement between a significant high and low. Related Reading: Hedera (HBAR) Q2 Update: Market Cap Climbs, Daily Transactions Boom, Revenue Follows In Egrag’s analysis, the chart showcases a range of Fibonacci levels, from Fib 0 at the absolute low of $0.0355 to Fib 1.618 at $3.27. Each of these levels indicates critical price points for HBAR as it moves through this market cycle. And according to Egrag, HBAR’s fundamentals are extremely strong and a 2,900% price surge is the absolute minimum. “Last cycle, ADA skyrocketed a mind-blowing 17,000%! To put this into perspective, with HBAR’s bottom at 0.036c, a 170X move would take it to around $6! That’s why I’m all-in on HBAR! Backed by a powerhouse Governing Council, Hedera is leading the charge with cutting-edge tech for seamless tokenization, delivering top-tier performance, rock-solid security, and unmatched compliance,” Egrag notes. Key Fibonacci Levels For Hedera (HBAR) In This Bull Run Fib 0 – $0.03555: This is the lowest price on the chart, representing the local bottom that HBAR recently established. According to Egrag, this could be seen as the long-term support level and a significant historical low. Fib 0.236 – $0.0687: Currently, HBAR is trading just below this Fibonacci level. It has acted as a resistance point over recent weeks, making it a crucial zone to break through for upward momentum to continue. Historically, breaking through the Fib 0.236 level often signals the start of a bullish move towards higher retracement levels. Fib 0.382 – $0.1034: The next critical resistance level is Fib 0.382. A sustained move above this zone would indicate growing bullish momentum and a possible continuation towards even higher Fibonacci levels. Related Reading: Hedera Developer Community Remained Vibrant In Q2 2024: When Will HBAR Turn The Corner? Fib 0.5 – $0.1438: The Fib 0.5 level is one of the most closely watched by traders. It represents a psychological midpoint between the asset’s high and low. According to Egrag, $0.14-$0.15 is a critical range for HBAR. “Until HBAR breaks above Fib 0.5 (0.14c-0.15c), everything else is just noise—time to accumulate for what’s coming!” Egrag claims. Fib 0.618 – $0.2004: Known as the “Golden Ratio,” Fib 0.618 is one of the most important levels in Fibonacci analysis. A break above this level often signals the end of a retracement and the resumption of the primary trend. For HBAR, a move above $0.20 could generate significant bullish interest, paving the way for a move towards new highs. Fib 0.702 – $0.2529: Egrag marks this level as a significant profit-taking zone. If HBAR reaches $0.25, it would represent a substantial 4.5x increase from current levels. This is a key target for traders looking to lock in profits before the next significant leg up. Fib 0.786 – $0.3199: Fib 0.786 is often the last line of resistance before an asset retests its all-time highs. Egrag identifies this as a crucial level, where many traders may choose to sell some of their holdings. Fib 1.0 – $0.5819: This level represents the previous all-time high (ATH) for HBAR. Breaking past $0.58 would indicate a complete recovery from the previous market cycle and set the stage for a potential new bull run. Egrag marks this as a key psychological level where his profit-taking area begins. Fib 1.272 – $1.2447: This is one of the extended Fibonacci levels, representing a point where HBAR could see additional gains in a bullish market scenario. Egrag mentions that breaking beyond ATH could push HBAR toward this level, making it another key profit-taking zone for long-term holders. Fib 1.414 – $1.8513: If HBAR continues its bullish momentum, it could climb towards this level, representing a major price extension. This level, according to Egrag, is where traders may choose to exit significant portions of their holdings, expecting a slowdown after a major uptrend. Fib 1.618 – $3.27: The ultimate profit-taking zone marked on Egrag’s chart is Fib 1.618, also known as the “Golden Extension.” A move to $3.27 would represent a near 60x move from the current price and a staggering 170x increase from the local bottom of $0.03555. Egrag views this as the maximum upside potential for HBAR in this cycle. Egrag concludes, “With its killer fundamentals and cutting-edge tech, a 30X gain is right on the horizon, making HBAR my top macro play!” At press time, HBAR traded at $0.0504.

The cheat sheet shows different stages of each market cycle, using sentiment to track where in the cycle a particular asset is. With the Bitcoin market seeming to be stuck in limbo, a crypto analyst has applied the information from the Wall Street Cheat Sheet in an effort to show where we are in the bull cycle. Bitcoin Cycle Moves Into Belief The different stages of the Wall Street Cheat Sheet represents different sentiment in the market and it could help to predict where the Bitcoin price is headed next. According to the crypto analyst Mags who has over 89,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), the Bitcoin market has currently entered the ‘Belief’ stage. Related Reading: 72% Of ETHUSDT Traders On Binance Go Long – Is This The Buy Signal You Need? Belief is the stage that comes after Optimism, which the crypto analyst puts at around the time the Bitcoin price hit its $73,000 all-time high earlier in the year. The drawdown was expected, leading to this next stage, which is now Belief. What this means for the Bitcoin price is that there could be a continuation of the bull rally. This is because with Belief comes more confidence in the market, and as investors take more bets, the BTC price will rise as a result from here. Basically, the crypto analyst’s post suggests that the Bitcoin bull market is far from over. If the Wall Street Cheat Sheet is anything to go by, then the BTC bull run could only be in its beginning stages with a long way to go as Belief drives its price toward $90,000. BTC Price Could Touch $300,000 Using the Wall Street Cheat Sheet shows that Belief is far from the top of the Bitcoin bull cycle. If anything, it is the confirmation of the ongoing bull market. The next stage is the ‘Thrill’ where investors are making a lot of money from their trades. At this point, more money is flowing into the market to sustain the rally. Related Reading: ‘FLOKI Master Plan’: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2,000% Jump For The Shiba Inu Competitor The last stage of any Bitcoin bull cycle according to the Wall Street Cheat Sheet is the ‘Euphoria’ stage. This is when investor are completely on board with the Bitcoin bull market and is a time of peak bullish sentiment. At this stage, the analyst’s chart suggests that the BTC price could touch as high as $300,000. However, this stage often marks the top of the market and the euphoria will often not allow investors to realize that the run is over. Once this stage is completed, the Bitcoin price could turn really quickly and lose over 50% of its value as it has done in the past.

42407451,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqQU,1728319185,Ethereum Proposal Could Increase Throughput by 50%,"The new Ethereum improvement proposal, officially EIP-7781, would increase throughput by 50%.  The submission from Illyriad Games co-founder Ben Adams follows earlier proposals by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and others for improving the blockchain's overall processing capacity.  Ethereum has faced growing criticism that it has failed to scale the main blockchain, since it has mainly pushed in recent years to enable the proliferation of affiliated layer-2 networks that are optimized for higher transaction execution.  Drawbacks include the possibility that validators might need additional resources to support the higher throughput.  A new upgrade proposal for Ethereum could improve network throughput by 50%, enhancing its ability to compete with speed-focused blockchains like Solana.  Initially proposed on Oct. 5 by Ben Adams, co-founder of Illyriad Games, the Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) would reduce slot times from 12 seconds to eight seconds, allowing the network to process more transactions over time.  The upgrade, officially designated EIP-7781, would also ramp up the blockchain's capacity to handle blobs, which are dedicated data-storage chambers used by affiliated layer-2 networks to stash transaction records. The change would effectively increase the number of blobs per block to nine from six, providing more space for layer-2 chains like Arbitrum and Optimism to post data to Ethereum.  In Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, slots refer to specific time intervals during which a block can be proposed. A validator is selected for each slot to propose a block, and if successful, the block is added to the blockchain.  The upgrade proposal will need to work its way through the Ethereum open-source development system, but it's already earned some key supporters.  Vitalik Buterin's proposal  Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake noted on Github that reducing block times to eight seconds would make decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms like Uniswap 1.22 times more efficient. The change could help close pricing gaps between on-chain and off-chain trading venues, saving users up to $100 million per year, according to Drake.  The Ethereum blockchain is praised for having strong security and a high degree of decentralization relative to most other blockchains, but its benefits have historically come at the cost of relatively high fees and slow speeds – at least in comparison to newer blockchains like Solana.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed in January to increase the blockchain's ""gas limit"" – the total size of transactions that can be squeezed into each block – as a way of boosting the overall network throughput.  EIP-7781 would be tantamount to an ""effective increase to a 45M gas limit and 9 blob limit,"" which ""roughly aligns with the proposed 40M gas limit by pumpthegas.org and the 8 blob limit by Vitalik and others,” according to Drake.  Over the past few years, upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain have primarily focused on paving the way for the development of third-party layer-2 ""rollup"" networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. These independent blockchain networks officially settle their transactions on Ethereum's ledger, but they offer users higher speeds and lower fees and have rapidly become the primary venue through which users interact with the Ethereum ecosystem.  Data blobs were added to Ethereum in March to allow the blockchain to hold arbitrary bits of data in a separate, dedicated space that's cheaper than regular block space on the network. Compared to regular transactions, blobs are better optimized for layer-2 networks, which bundle together big groups of transactions and post them to Ethereum all at once.  EIP-7781 could help make it faster (and cheaper) for layer-2 networks to post data to the chain by increasing the number of blobs, but it is also the first upgrade in some time to focus directly on improving speeds on the base Ethereum blockchain.  Reducing slot times to eight seconds from 12 would directly translate to faster transactions for end-users, but it risks adding strain for validators, who might need additional hardware resources.

34417988,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646667,1728315020,Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months,"Max Kaiser, a famous Bitcoin backer, recently caused a stir by saying that Cardano (ADA) could lose 90% of its value against Bitcoin in the next six months. His prediction has gotten a range of responses, from doubt to fun, especially from people who support the ADA like the Cardano Whale. Some people see this prediction as a chance to buy at a lower price, while others are more wary because the crypto market is so unstable. Related Reading: Starknet: Long Positions Liquidated Lead To 16% Losses It’s easy to see why so many people are sticking with Bitcoin: it keeps looking like the best asset for long-term buyers. Bitcoin has a good brand associated with their value and a decentralized nature that gives it the push. It’s also a relatively stable cryptocurrency compared to many, with the sheer size of the network effect, an infrastructure firmly supported by institutional players, and high liquidity. Cardano (ADA) will lose another 90% vs. Bitcoin over the next 6 months. pic.twitter.com/jQHhJg1m59 — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 5, 2024 What Makes Cardano Stand Out Although Kaiser made a somewhat negative forecast, Cardano is demonstrating that cryptocurrencies are a real competitor. By offering a solution that can last longer and expand with the demands of the society, it seeks to be superior to Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. Cardano focuses on scalability, energy efficiency, and building a strong base for decentralized applications and finance projects. It uses a peer-reviewed academic method and proof-of-stake consensus. But things haven’t been easy for ADA. Some market observers say that the fact that it is taking a long time to catch on and grow is a big problem. Many investors are confused as to whether ADA is going to maintain its edge in the smart contract platform space post the price going down quite sharply over the last year. Cardano has to step up the act as it is playing against stiff competition in a game by renowned companies. A Mixed Bag For The Short Term Even though there are problems, Cardano has a small chance of getting a boost in price. CoinCodex recently made a price prediction that says Cardano’s price will go up by 17% and hit about $0.42492 by November 6, 2024. The current mood of the market is neutral, and the Fear & Greed Index also has a score of 50, which means it is balanced. In the last 30 days, there have been 63% “green days” for Cardano, and the price has changed only 6%. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? These details imply a level of stability that could lead people to invest. Thus far, Cardano has done well, which is an indication that it could well catch on, notwithstanding its remaining concerns. Analysts feel that these are the best times to buy-in since the probability of going up is consistent with the general trend of the market.

The BGB token slid to as low as $0.54 from $1.14 in 15 minutes at around 02:30 UTC.

Flash crashes aren’t unusual in cryptocurrencies, although it is often difficult to explain why many holders of an asset suddenly decide they want to sell. In BGB's case, the catalyst was likely “overall market sluggishness” stemming from holidays and Golden Week in Asia, among other factors, said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, in an email.  Holders who suffered losses as result of the plunge will be repaid fully, Bitget said in a statement on X. It pledged to provide a compensation plan within 24 hours and that repayments would process within 72 hours.  “Occasional price dips are expected in any asset ...

42407452,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqNB,1728310179,Memecoin Moodeng on Ethereum Jumps 480% After Vitalik Buterin's Mention and Donation Sales,"The MOODENG token, inspired by the Thai baby hippo Moo Deng, experienced a nearly 500% price increase in 24 hours.  Vitalik Buterin mentioned the memecoin on his social media post and sold 10 billion MOODENG tokens for 308.69 ETH, donating the proceeds to charity.  Buterin also said ""... best thing for memecoins is if they can be maximally positive-sum for the world.""  A memecoin themed after viral Thai zoo hippo Moo Deng zoomed nearly 500%, before paring gains, in the past 24 hours as traders viewed a social media mention by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as a positive catalyst.  Buterin sold 10 billion MOODENG for 308.69 ether {{ETH}}, worth $762K at current prices, and transferred 260 ETH, or $642,000, to the charity Kanro earlier on Monday. His publicly-known Ethereum address vitalik.eth still holds 40 billion MOODENG tokens, worth over $8 million at current prices.  The team sent Buterin a portion of its supply when it was first issued in September. On Oct. 5, Buterin sold over $50,000 worth of MOODENG, alongside other tokens, for ether. Buterin regularly receives memecoins and tokens unsolicited as a marketing gimmick first popularized by Shiba Inu (SHIB).  Read more: Vitalik's Regift of Unsolicited DOGE Knockoffs Sends Memecoin Prices Plunging  The sales aren’t to fund his lifestyle and proceeds are usually donated to charity.  “I appreciate all the memecoins that donate portions of their supply directly to charity,” Buterin said in an X post. “Anything that gets sent to me gets donated to charity too (thanks moodeng! The 10B from today is going to anti-airborne-disease tech), though I truly prefer if you guys send to charity directly, maybe even make a DAO and get your community directly engaged in the decisions and process.”  Traders apparently took the sale and a token mention on Buterin’s X post as a positive sign as MOODENG prices surged right after Buterin’s donations, adding to a rally from last week. This brought the seven-day gains for the memcoin to over 2,700% as per DEXTools data.  Moodeng on Ethereum, alongside a separate version on Solana, is a token inspired by Moo Deng, a baby Thai hippo at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo near Bangkok. She’s the first Thai memecoin to rise over a $100 million market capitalization owing to her global appeal.  The donations come as memecoin mindshare - or social attention - marked a yearly high earlier on Monday. Some traders are calling for a “memecoin supercycle” where cultish behavior, virality, and attention serve as the fundamental backing for a meme token in favor of venture capital-backed tokens, which are perceived as a losing bet for retail traders.  But it’s not all money, with Buterin seeing memecoins as a positive sum that could ultimately help the planet.  “I've said before that I think the best thing for memecoins is if they can be maximally positive-sum for the world, so it's great to see moments when that actually happens,” he said.  Moodeng's team, meanwhile, claimed they had set up a wallet to continue similar initiatives.  ""Our community greatly agrees with how you've given real-world value to cryptocurrency and used it to help others,"" the team said in an X post. ""This is something we've also been working on. In fact, we are a CTO-led project (our community took over after the original developer left).

34415726,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646648,1728309603,FET Gears Up for Gains: Bullish Momentum Eyes $1.8 Breakout,"FET is showing renewed positive strength, with recent price action suggesting a breakout toward the $1.8 resistance level may be on the horizon. After bouncing back from key support zones, the cryptocurrency has caught the attention of traders as upward pressure begins to build. With buying interest growing and technical indicators showing signs of strength, the stage is set for FET to potentially reclaim higher price levels, positioning $1.8 as a crucial target for bulls looking to extend the rally. The aim of this article is to analyze FET’s recent bullish momentum as it approaches the $1.8 resistance level. By examining key technical indicators, price patterns, and market sentiment, this piece seeks to assess the likelihood of a breakout and the potential for further upside movement in the near term. Indicators Point Toward More Upward Movement For FET On the 4-hour chart, FET is exhibiting bullish signs as it aims to break above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A push above this key technical indicator successfully could attract large buying interest, indicating that the bulls are regaining control and setting the stage for additional gains toward the $1.8 resistance level. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a renewed bullish potential, as the RSI has climbed above the 50% threshold and is currently sitting at 58%. This upward shift indicates increasing buying pressure. If the RSI continues on this trajectory, it could signal more upward movements for FET, paving the way for new highs, and reinforcing the bullish trend. Related Reading: FET Price Targets $3.4 After Breakout, Here Are The Key Levels To Watch After successfully avoiding a drop below the daily 100-day SMA, FET has positioned itself firmly above this key level, indicating that buyers have regained control. Holding above this crucial technical indicator suggests that FET may continue its upward trajectory, with the 100-day SMA now acting as a solid support level, further reinforcing the potential for continued gains. Also, the RSI on the daily chart is currently sitting at 54%, after a previous dip to 44%. The rise from lower levels indicates that FET may be regaining strength, with the potential for more growth if buying interest remains consistent. What Could Happen Beyond $1.8? FET is currently on an upward trajectory, eyeing a breakout above the $1.8 resistance level. A successful push beyond this mark could pave the way for further gains, with the next target set around $2.5. Should FET surpass $2.5, increased buying interest could fuel additional momentum, driving the price higher toward the $3.4 resistance level. Related Reading: Fetch.AI (FET) Surges 21%: Why This Rally Is Just Getting Started However, failure to sustain momentum and break below the $1.8 resistance could lead to a pullback toward the $0.966 support level. If the price drops below this critical point, it may trigger additional declines, potentially opening the door for deeper price corrections.

After reaching a local high of $66,587 on September 27th, Bitcoin’s price fell sharply, particularly after losing the key $65,200 level, triggering cascading long liquidations. This resulted in a decline to $60,000, which aligned with our forecasts expressed in last week’s Bitfinex Alpha, for a 5-10 percent pullback given the high levels of open interest (OI) and lack of spot market buying. Indeed, spot market selling last week was exacerbated by escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, which intensified de-risking and led to long liquidations amounting to $450 million on October 1st. As Bitcoin experienced its first consecutive series of four red days since early August, the market saw a healthy realignment, with OI decreasing from overheated levels above $35 billion to $31.8 billion. This reduction in OI suggests that market conditions are relatively stabilised, with the risk of abrupt price movements now lower. Bitcoin rebounded to $62,500 on October 4th, following positive labour market data, and rose to as high as $64,027 in early sessions on October 7th when some amount of spot buying aggression returned, however, it is still too little too soon to make definitive conclusions about short-term market direction. Several altcoins also showed significant volatility , with large-cap assets like XRP and APT moving 15-20 percent in either direction. As the market remains reactionary, clues for future direction for BTC and the market, in general, may lie in any positioning seen in early-week trading sessions, particularly in the US. The labour market data which had buoyed the market showed that in September, it had seen its strongest job gains in six months, with unemployment dipping to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent in August, signalling the resilience of the economy. However, while labour remains robust, other sectors have yet to feel the benefit of loosening monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates again in November, yet the manufacturing sector continues to feel the pressure of higher rates, along with reduced demand compared to last year. Despite challenges in manufacturing, the US service sector saw a sharp rise in new orders in September, reaching its highest activity level in 18 months. This surge suggests ongoing economic strength through the third quarter of 2024, even as different sectors experience varying strain levels. In terms of newsflow last week, the International Monetary Fund has urged El Salvador to reduce its exposure to Bitcoin, recommending adjustments to its Bitcoin law and advising enhanced regulatory oversight to minimise public sector involvement. These discussions are part of broader efforts to stabilise the country’s economy. While domestic adoption is growing slowly, President Bukele still sees Bitcoin as a net positive for El Salvador’s long-term growth. Meanwhile, Metaplanet Inc. recently generated $1.46 million through selling Bitcoin options, further strengthening its Bitcoin reserves. With a total of 530.717 BTC now held by the company, CEO Simon Gerovich emphasised how Bitcoin’s inherent volatility provides opportunities for yield generation, complementing their direct holdings. In a separate development, David Carmona, founder of IcomTech, was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for running a Ponzi scheme that promised profits from cryptocurrency-related ventures.

Why A 200% Surge To $0.2 Is Possible,"Crypto analyst CobraVanguard has suggested that the Solana-based meme coin MYRO could be the next to reach a $1 billion market cap. This follows his prediction that the meme coin could enjoy a 200% price surge from its current level. Why MYRO Could Enjoy A 200% To $0.2 CobraVanguard mentioned in a TradingView post that the meme coin is forming a falling wedge on the daily timeframe. He claimed that MYRO could enjoy massive upside moves if it breaks out from its current resistance. The analyst added that he expects the price to go up to the Fibonacci line of 0.618, which is at $0.2. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Hit New All-Time High If It Breaks This Level A rise to $0.2 means that the Solana meme coin could rise above a market cap of $200 million. Based on CobraVanguard’s prediction, MYRO will likely enjoy further moves to the upside, potentially placing a $1 billion market cap in sight. Crypto analyst SwallowPremium also provided a bullish outlook for the mem coin, stating that a breakout above the $0.2 level will lead to further moves to the upside. It is worth mentioning that MYRO’s current all-time high (ATH) is at $0.4, a price level reached in March earlier this year. As such, a run up to its current ATH will likely be on the cards if the Solana meme coin reaches $0.2. A run to its current ATH will put it above a $400 million market cap, further strengthening the community’s belief that the coin could reach a $1 billion market cap. The Price Breakout Will Soon Happen Crypto analyst Yzzz also stated in an X post that the MYRO price breakout will soon happen. The analyst noted that if Bitcoin moves to the upside, the meme coin will surely “run hard.” He added that the chart has been primed for a while, seeing as it bottomed and the time-based capitulation has happened. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Fall Increases Buying Momentum, Pushes Exchange BTC Balances To 6-Year Lows Meanwhile, Yzzz also cited that MYRO was already listed on Binance and Bybit for perpetuals trading. He noted that this is the Solana meme coin with the lowest market cap to achieve this feat. As such, he expects the coin to go higher, seeing how much attention it already has through the largest centralized exchanges (CEXs). Interestingly, the crypto analyst boldly claimed that MYRO would soon outperform the foremost Solana meme coin, Dogwifhat (WIF). He revealed that both meme coins have traded closely for some time now. However, he expects that to change soon enough, with MYRO coming out on top. In line with this, he advised market participants to place their bets and believe in something. At the time of writing, MYRO is trading at around $0.08, up over 15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42407458,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqh1,1728302460,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Tests $64K Ahead of Busy U.S. Economic Data Week,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,950.34 +1.51% Bitcoin (BTC): $62,977.62 +1.55% Ether (ETH): $2,451.18 +1.29% S&P 500: 5,751.07 +0.9% Gold: $2,656.7 +0.22% Nikkei 225: 39,332.74 +1.8%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose to near $64,000 ahead of a busy week for economic data out of the U.S. It subsequently dropped back to $63,000, around 1.6% higher over 24 hours. The broader digital asset market rose about 1.5%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes and key economic figures are due on Wednesday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release inflation data for September and the number of initial jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 5.  Memecoins rose over the weekend as social sentiment and riskier behavior among crypto traders grew. Talks and posts of the so-called “memecoin supercycle,” a prediction that the tokens will lead the next crypto bull market, trended on social app X. Solana-based popcat (POPCAT) and Ethereum-based mog (MOG) jumped over 12% in 24 hours, while BNB Chain-based simon’s cat (CAT) rose 10%. Cat-themed memecoins continue to lead their dog-themed counterparts and remain the preferred choice for riskier memecoin bets. Interest in memecoins comes amid low market volatility in more serious crypto sectors, such as layer-2 blockchains, and rising negative sentiment around tokens backed by venture capital funds – which are increasingly perceived as overpriced and a bad bet for retail traders.  Metaplanet said it bought another $6.7 million worth of bitcoin to take its stash to 639.5 BTC, worth approximately $40.6 million at current prices. The Tokyo-listed company purchased around 108.8 BTC at an average price of just under 9.2 million yen ($61,900) per coin. It has now spent just shy of 6 billion yen on the largest cryptocurrency by market value, paying an average price of 9.3 million yen apiece. The company has the second-largest bitcoin holdings among Asia-listed companies, behind Hong Kong-based technology firm Meitu. Metaplanet shares rose 7.9% to 988 yen and are over 500% higher year-to-date.  Chart of the Day  The bitcoin put at the $40,000 strike price expiring on Nov. 8, when the U.S. presidential election result will be announced, is the most traded option on Deribit in the past 24 hours.  Traders seem to be preparing for heightened volatility on results day, with potential implications for crypto regulation.

42407446,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHq6e,1728300401,The Notion of Aggressively Dovish Fed Fades as U.S. Inflation Report Looms,"Traders are pricing in less than 50 basis points of Fed interest-rate cuts by year-end, down from 75 bps early last week.  Bitcoin's rally stalls as Treasury yields and the dollar index rise.  Though crucial, Thursday's U.S. inflation data may not cause tectonic shifts in the market.  About three weeks ago, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered an outsized 50 basis point interest-rate cut, interpreted by many analysts as signaling more easing ahead. The move triggered a wave of optimism across financial markets, with analysts predicting 75 bps of additional cuts and a $100,000 price for bitcoin {{BTC}}, currently around $63,000, by year-end.  That euphoria's taken a knock as last week's stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs and PMI services reports forced traders to reassess the supposedly bullish expectations for bigger and faster rate reductions.  Traders are now pricing in less than 50 basis points of easing in November and December, according to data tracked by trading platform Pepperstone's senior research strategist, Michael Brown. The reading is consistent with the Fed's dot plot chart published in September, which showed quarter-point rate cuts or one half-point cut by the end of the year.  Recall that the year began with traders expecting over 100 bps of rate cuts and a bitcoin rally that saw prices hit record highs above $73,000 on the back of optimism over the approval of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S. Later, markets trimmed the bets to three 25 bps rate cuts for the second half.  The recent hawkish repricing of Fed rate expectations is also evident in Treasuries. Early Monday, the yield on the U.S. two-year note rose to 4%, the highest since Aug. 23, amounting to a cumulative gain of 50 basis points since Sept. 25. The 10-year Treasury note also tapped the 4% mark, data from charting platform TradingView show.  Meanwhile, the dollar index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro, has risen over 1.5% to 102.62.  Other things being equal, the hardening of Treasury yields and a stronger dollar often lead to financial tightening and reduced investor appetite for riskier investments like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks.  After the Fed cut rates on Sept. 18, BTC picked up a strong bid, rising over 10% to $66,500 by Sept. 27, CoinDesk data show. Since then, the rally has stalled, with the cryptocurrency trading below $63,000 at press time.  Focus on Thursday's CPI  All eyes are now on Thursday's U.S. September consumer price index data, according to QCP Capital.  ""With the recent strong U.S. wage and jobs numbers, the market will be paying close attention to this [CPI] print for any signs of an uptick in inflation. Fed rate cut expectations have shifted from 50 bps to 25 bps in just a week and this week's data may determine if further cuts are priced out,"" the Singapore-based firm said in a market update.  According to RBC Economics, the report is likely to show the cost of living decelerated to 2.2% year-on-year in September from 2.5% in August. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food components, likely edged down to 3.1% from 3.2%.  Even so, the report may do little to stall or reverse the ongoing DXY recovery and hawkish repricing of U.S. rate cuts, meaning markets may favor defensive USD positioning ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, according to ING.  ""Again, 0.1% or 0.3% [CPI] should not trigger tectonic shifts in markets now that the focus is on the Fed's employment side of the mandate, but some dollar volatility should follow any out-of-consensus print,"" analysts at ING said in a market update.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/07/the-notion-of-aggressively-dovish-fed-fades-as-us-inflation-report-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c7cc940bb8d37d1d28af672e7a55271883cfde9-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) fresh appeal in its continuous action against Ripple is driving the price drop. Investors are left wondering about XRP’s future as the legal question of whether it qualifies as a security looms over the token like a dark cloud. Related Reading: Starknet: Long Positions Liquidated Lead To 16% Losses Hope is mixed with skepticism, as some analysts are nearly optimistic about recovery, considering the dire forecast. Indeed, there have been whale activities identified through recent data from the Whale Alert platform, monitoring large cryptos transfers. 🚨 30,380,000 #XRP (15,993,939 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitsohttps://t.co/NWSMKsIZJy — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 3, 2024 Over the past 24 hours, 153 million XRP tokens were transferred and some of them, undoubtedly, to the exchanges. This has elicited some interest on the side of traders about future prospects for XRP, though the token’s future leans considerably on the outcome in court with the SEC. 🚨 19,220,000 #XRP (10,122,908 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitstamphttps://t.co/GNObmOWzeZ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 3, 2024 Whales Are Migrating XRP Whale Alert reports that a whale wallet transferred over 30 million XRP tokens equivalent to almost $16 million into the Bitso exchange. Such activity on part of whales is usually deemed to be a precursor where traders are either bracing for more losses or are seeking profits. Everyone keeps guessing whether this spate of activity from whales bodes well for another leg down of XRP ahead of the SEC appeal. 🚨 🚨 🚨 104,384,848 #XRP (54,662,653 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/ggwKSmRD9z — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 3, 2024 In spite of these substantial token transfers, there are those who anticipate that XRP may experience a rebound. Jack The Rippler, a renowned crypto analyst, identified a historical descending triangle pattern on the one-month chart of XRP. This pattern implies that the token may be consolidating prior to a potential breakout. In 2016 and 2020, comparable patterns resulted in precipitous rallies following the breach of resistance levels, providing optimism to those anticipating an additional increase in the price of XRP. XRP down in the last week. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? Is There A Possibility Of A Breakout? XRP is currently at a juncture from a technical standpoint. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 39, a value that suggests bearish momentum. Typically, an RSI below 50 indicates that the asset is under pressure, and if it falls below 30, it may enter oversold territory. However, the analysis from Jack The Rippler reveals that XRP might break out of its current trend since this is the case after a similar consolidation in the past. Analysts expect that this token might continue its pursuit of the next resistance level if such is the case. Meanwhile, the SEC lawsuit is the elephant in the room, though, and cannot be ignored either. The result of this court struggle will significantly affect XRP’s next action. Should the SEC be successful in showing that Ripple’s secondary XRP sales broke US securities rules, the token may suffer more losses; some analysts predict a sharp decrease from its present price to $0.11.

34409210,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646633,1728293411,Crypto Analyst: Why Memecoins Are Still The Next 100x Opportunity,"Over the past weekend, there was a notable rise in memecoin prices, driven by heightened social buzz and increased risk appetite among crypto investors. The concept of a “memecoin supercycle,” which posits that memecoins will lead the upcoming crypto bull run, gained traction on X. In this context, crypto analyst Kai (@Kaiwen0x) released a widely-shared article explaining the ongoing allure of memecoins as a viable investment choice. The Case For Memecoins In The Crypto Bull Run 2025 Kai argues that memecoins are poised to outperform the market by 2025, suggesting that owning a “curated basket of memecoins” could allow investors to surpass 99% of market participants. “Outside of Bitcoin and stablecoins, memecoin is the only category that has found a clear product-market fit. They combine the best features of an ICO (capital formation) and an NFT (community building) in delivering a killer product: global, permissionless speculation,” he states. The analyst emphasizes that traditional crypto projects often juggle both product development and token management, whereas memecoins focus solely on the token itself. “Memecoins removed the product and made the token its entire business, with the value of the token deriving from the attention generated by its community,” Kai explains. Citing data from crypto analyst @MustStopMurad, Kai notes that in 2024, 16 of the top 20 tokens within the top 300 that outperformed Bitcoin were memecoins. Related Reading: RIP Altcoin Seasons? Crypto Analyst Debates Whether They’ll Ever Return Kai identifies two main external factors which are crucial for a memecoin surge. First, the macro liquidity and interest rates need to be favorable for the entire market: “The macro setup points to higher liquidity and lower interest rates in the next 12 months. Memecoins act as levered beta on Bitcoin, allowing you to capture maximum upside in a risk-on environment,” Kai explains. Second, the analyst references financial nihilism, a term popularized by Ikigai Investment CEO Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling). This theory suggests that a rise in financial nihilism and the “YOLO” mindset is drawing more participants into speculative markets. Internally, memecoins have shown they possess a clear product-market fit and benefit from what is known as the Lindy effect—where the future life expectancy of some technologies or ideas is proportional to their current age, suggesting that memecoins are here to stay. Additionally, memecoins are particularly adept at creating and maintaining compelling narratives, a critical aspect in a market driven by speculation and investor sentiment. The Art Of Memecoin Selection Kai delves into strategies for selecting promising memecoins, emphasizing the importance of nuanced analysis: Emotional Resonance: “I’m looking for memes that generate a strong emotional reaction. Is it funny, relatable, catchy, powerful, or memorable? The average retail investor is going to be the last marginal bidder of our magic internet coins, so you need to buy and hold what they emotionally resonate with,” Kai explains. Ticker Simplicity: Favoring simple and powerful tickers, ideally 3 to 5 letters long, such as WIF, GIGA, and BULL. Holder Count Growth: Monitoring steady growth in the number of holders as an indicator of increasing adoption. Wide Token Distribution: Preferring coins with broad distribution to avoid centralization risks. Resilience to Drawdowns: Identifying coins that have survived multiple significant price drops and rebounded, indicating strong community support. Active Community Engagement: Looking for an “active army of reply guys getting engagements on X,” which signals a vibrant and engaged community. Exchange Listings: Noting that announcements of centralized exchange (CEX) listings can significantly impact a token’s valuation. Absence of Insiders: Being cautious of coins with insider involvement, such as pre-sales or venture capital backing, which can lead to uneven playing fields. Potential Risks and Invalidation Scenarios Kai acknowledges the risks associated with investing in memecoins: Macro Regime Change: A significant rebound in inflation or a reversal of monetary easing could invalidate the macro thesis for being long on risk assets. Idiosyncratic Events: Events like major exchange hacks, regulatory shifts, or significant market collapses could disproportionately affect memecoins. US Election Outcomes: “Counterintuitively, memecoins could underperform this cycle if Trump wins the election,” Kai speculates. Emotional Attachment: He cautions against becoming too emotionally invested in any one community, as this can cloud judgment. “Identity can create emotional ties that cloud your judgment as an investor.” Related Reading: Crypto Guru Warns: Only 6 Years Left To ‘Make As Much Money As Possible’ Kai emphasizes the importance of understanding investor psychology in the crypto market. “Ultimately, the question returns to: ‘What does the average crypto investor actually care about?’ It’s not the tech. It’s not the product. It’s the token—embodying greed and the expectation of greater profit—that ultimately consumes this investor,” he writes. However, the crypto analyst advises investors to remain vigilant and adaptable: “To avoid getting wrecked, we need to monitor macro conditions for any signs of a regime shift. We must also keep an eye on idiosyncratic events that could invalidate the thesis for investing in any specific token.” Kai concludes, “Good luck, and for the love of dogs, don’t mid-curve this (still) 100x opportunity.” At press time, WIF traded at $2.67.

42407448,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqGZ,1728292898,"Bitcoin Miner Marathon's Anduro Unveils Tokenization Platform, Starts With Whiskey","Marathon-incubated Anduro has developed a platform for issuing and investing in RWAs on Bitcoin.  Like various use cases of blockchain technology, tokenization has been largely absent from Bitcoin.  Marathon's incubation of Anduro may speak to a trend whereby mining companies are seeking to find more and more sources of transaction fee revenue in response to the block reward halving every four years.  Multichain layer-2 network Anduro, incubated by mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), has developed a platform for issuing and investing in real-world assets (RWAs) on Bitcoin.  The platform Avant, developed alongside tokenization specialist Vertalo, is planning a pilot project to tokenize whiskey barrels, according to an announcement shared exclusively with CoinDesk.  Tokenization refers to the issuance of digital representation of RWAs as tokens that can be traded on a blockchain. Tokenized Treasury notes traded on networks like Ethereum and Solana exceeded a market cap of $2 billion in August.  ""As traditional and decentralized finance continue to converge, we believe Vertalo’s work with Anduro will provide comfort to their partners that the durability of the Bitcoin blockchain extends beyond BTC and into real-world assets,"" said Dave Hendricks, co-founder of Vertalo.  Like various other uses of blockchain technology, tokenization has been largely absent from Bitcoin. This has begun to change in recent years, however, through developments that have introduced smart contracts or facilitated the minting of tokens.  Avant may pave the way for this to happen with RWAs as well, but with a certain Bitcoin spin on it, according to Anduro's product lead, Jullian Duran.  Anduro wants to avoid taking a RWA play that exists on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains and simply cut and paste it to Bitcoin, but instead is looking to offer something that ""a bitcoiner would understand,"" he said.  ""A bitcoiner who wants tokenized Treasury bills can easily access that via Ondo Finance. Why would we create an Ondo Finance competitor?"" he said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We see the opportunity being in these traditional, hard industries that are immediately recognizable, such as American whiskey.""  Marathon's Bitcoin RWA Play  Marathon's incubation of Anduro may speak to a trend whereby mining companies are seeking to find new sources of transaction fee revenue in response to the block reward halving every four years.  Bitcoin miners compete to solve mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the network and, in turn, are rewarded with new BTC. The amount received is halved every four years, last doing so in April this year, when the reward fell to 3.125 BTC.  While this process helps to underpin bitcoin's strength as a store of value, it presents a challenge for the miners, given that their source of income is effectively cut by 50% every four years.  ""Specifically in the case of Marathon being a publicly listed miner whose stock price is highly correlated to the bitcoin price, we need to find new ways to drive up that price and drive forward adoption,"" Duran said. ""A world in which more people use bitcoin is a world in which there are more transaction fees and a world where the entire ecosystem gets lifted up.""

Japanese investment adviser Metaplanet (3350) said it bought another 1 billion yen ($6.7 million) worth of bitcoin {{BTC}}, pushing its holding to 639.5 BTC, worth approximately $40.6 million at current prices.

However, he still trails in Nevada, one of the key states that have historically predicted the outcome.  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading Democratic rival Kamala Harris by 2.5 percentage points in Polymarket's election contract after Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, endorsed him at a rally over the weekend. Trump still trails in one of the states that have, historically, 'called' the election.  “As you can see, I am not just MAGA, I am Dark MAGA,” Musk said on stage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the first assassination attempt on Trump in July. “The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms. They want to take away your right to vote.""  Musk also endorsed prediction markets, calling them more accurate than polls.  While Trump leads in the national presidential election poll, he trails in a number of swing states.  A Polymarket contract asking if Trump will win every swing state gives only a 19% chance of that happening. That said, a contract asking if Harris will do the same puts her chances at the same level.  Critically for the Republicans, Trump trails in Nevada based on a Polymarket contract. According to data compiled by not-for-profit, nonpartisan civic initiative USAFacts, the state has been predictive of the overall election result in eight of the last nine contests.  Data from Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin election aggregator shows that Democrats have strengthened their hold on Nevada over the last month.  Nevada was one of the states where Robert F. Kennedy Jr polled highest, and a recent Wall Street Journal report profiled some of his supporters who are now voting for Trump, albeit reluctantly.  But not all are marking their ballots for a Republican. A number of former RFK supporters profiled by the Journal are so dissatisfied with the major party options, particularly after Kennedy’s exit, that they’re considering abstaining from voting altogether.  On the other hand, the historical elections data aggregated by USAFacts says that Ohio is another state that typically 'calls' the election.

MSTR's intelligent use of convertible debt to monetize amplified BTC volatility enables superior financing for increasing BTC per share. The recent $30.6 million interest expense reduction signals MSTR's possible debt servicing limits, impacting future BTC purchases and convertible issuances. Despite risks, MSTR's strategy and software business support its BTC acquisition, making it a strong buy for BTC bulls. Presented is a model for valuing MSTR based on BTC Yield, MSTR's beta against BTC, and MSTR's ability to service further debt loads. In the last month, there were a few numbers pertaining to MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) which I think deserves some serious attention. To understand the first number, you need to understand MSTR’s new BTC Yield key performance indicator, which they unveiled in their last earnings call. I wrote a comprehensive article covering the concept of BTC Yield from that earnings call. The introduction of this metric is, in my view, a groundbreaking moment in corporate finance which makes the last earnings call the most important MicroStrategy earnings call ever. I encourage you to read the article to gain full context and also to listen to the Q2 earnings call . In general, BTC Yield is the percentage change in the amount of BTC per diluted share over a given period of the time. MSTR computes diluted shares using the conservative assumption that all convertible debt is converted to shares. So here is the first number: 17% YTD BTC Yield on 13 September. Then a week later on 20 September: 17.8% YTD BTC Yield . The year is only about 75% complete. A 17.8% BTC Yield explains perfectly why MSTR shares trade at a 2x premium to the BTC it holds in reserves. For every 1 BTC you owned through your shares of MSTR on 1 January 2024, you would have 1.178 BTC without doing anything except holding those same MSTR shares as of 20 September 2024. So if these are the raw facts, why should MSTR be trading 1:1 with its BTC holdings? MSTR is clearly not equivalent to holding BTC directly. For every 1 BTC I owned via holding BTC on 1 January, I still only have the same 1 BTC, assuming I did nothing except hold. There is no BTC Yield in holding real BTC. MSTR, however, has a positive BTC Yield. That is all we need to understand the MSTR premium. Breaking It Down Further At the most basic level, let’s just compare the YTD performance of BTC and MSTR. The chart is shown below. MSTR and BTC-USD (Seeking Alpha) There is a positive BTC Yield of 17.8%. So another 17.8% at the very least should be added to the performance of BTC to get to the performance of MSTR. But in practice a lot more than 17.8% will be added by the market because there is the ongoing possibility of BTC Yield increasing even more from here. We can treat the YoY BTC Yield almost like a “floor rate” for YoY growth, assuming nothing else changes. The fact that BTC per share increased needs to be reflected as a source of an outperformance when comparing BTC and MSTR. Also consider that MSTR is leveraged. It currently has about $3.8 billion in long-term debt with a market cap of $35 billion. This means its equity value is around 1.1x levered to its assets value. As it turns out, when you plot the BTC and MSTR daily returns, the regression line has a coefficient (beta) of 1.1 . Therefore, we should see MSTR outperform BTC in bull markets by the leverage alone. Furthermore, there is a software business that, though mediocre, still generates $111 million in quarterly revenue and is clocking in YoY subscription revenue growth even as total revenues have declined YoY. Revenues (MSTR Q2 Presentation) This component of the business is rarely talked about (generally because it isn’t impressive), but it should be noted for its contribution to the overall MSTR BTC acquisition strategy. The revenues allow MSTR to service the debt that is used to purchase more BTC and generate a positive BTC Yield. The last thing to remember is that the “debt” being serviced is not normal debt. It is convertible debt. And as of the last raise of $1.01 billion in convertible notes, the last tranche of “normal” debt was paid off and replaced fully by convertible debt. It's actually difficult to overstate how significant this point is. Convertible notes have a long history of being used by companies to finance operations in a creative way that minimizes cash liabilities. The weakness is that it is dilutive. But the real miracle of using convertible notes is that you are able to monetize the second moment of the distribution of projected ROI. You see, when you issue equity or debt, you are strictly touching the first moment of the distribution of projected ROI – this is simply what is the expected return of your operation, based on a dollar-weighted average across the market. When you issue convertibles, you are attaching a call option to a normal debt issuance. Because options are always protected from one side of an asset’s price action, they are a way to gain access to the variance of that asset. Variance is the second moment of the distribution. Its square root is called “standard deviation,” which is the mathematical name for the financial term we call “volatility.” See how it’s coming together? Selling options, in the form of convertibles or warrants, is a way to pull cash out of the second moment because selling options is selling the volatility of the underlying equity. Put differently, it is drawing funds out of a different dimension from traditional capital markets. This is extremely potent when you add Bitcoin to the mix. Bitcoin is the most volatile trillion-dollar market cap asset the world has ever seen. When you put BTC on your balance sheet and lever it up, your equity now absorbs and magnifies the volatility of BTC. Currently, MSTR options are pricing in an IV of 80-150. This is 5-8x the IV of the S&P 500. And selling call options on your stock is great because as the company, you can always create more shares out of thin air. So this is exactly what MSTR does: Buy BTC with leverage, injecting massive volatility into MSTR shares Sell this volatility in the form of convertibles Take the proceeds to buy even more BTC on leverage (convertibles are still debt) Stock gets even more volatile Sell more volatility in the form of convertibles Repeat All of this— the leveraged capital structure, the software business, the convertibles issuances, the BTC purchases, and the resulting positive BTC Yield— works together for MSTR to outperform every single stock in the S&P 500 since Michael Saylor had the idea to prioritize buying BTC. MSTR vs SP500 ( FactSet / Saylor ) The Second Number Is An Object Of Some Concern The first number was BTC Yield and understanding everything that went into generating a positive BTC Yield. This next number is easier to understand, and I think it is something to watch out for. MSTR completed an upsized $1.01 billion offering on 20 September, which allowed them to boost BTC Yield from 17% to 17.8%. (As a quick aside, this was upsized from a $700 million offer , which just shows the market demand for these convertible issuances. A lot of institutional bond funds cannot purchase BTC or equity, but they can use these convertible notes to gain exposure to something that generates much better returns than normal corporate bonds.) Now, many people might assume that the billion dollars went straight into buying more BTC. This is not what happened. MSTR redeemed $500 million of debt that had a 6.125% interest rate, which was due in 2028. You can see that tranche over here in the Q2 presentation . Principal Debt Maturities (MSTR Q2 Presentation) This has an annual interest expense of $30.6 million, which is the second number of significance that I’m bringing to your attention. Meanwhile, the convertible was issued at 0.625%, which means that the annual interest expense is a bit more than a tenth of the expense on the “normal” debt, assuming the same principal. MSTR made the decision to pay off the “normal” debt by basically refinancing it via convertibles. But… why? Why not just buy BTC with the full $1.01 billion and hold the $500 million to maturity, since BTC’s expected CAGR far exceeds the 6.125% cost of debt? The answer is that MSTR is likely approaching its carrying capacity for servicing debt. This is a hard cap given its revenues. That $30.6 million annual expense had to be removed so that it can be replaced with 5 more issuances of $1 billion in convertibles at 0.625%. Ideally, they would have just kept the $30.6 million annual expense, serviced it with operating cash flows, and proceeded with several more billion dollar convertible note issuances. This would have maximized BTC per share. The fact that they used more than half the proceeds to reduce the interest expense indicates that MSTR is approaching its carrying capacity. Here is another capital structure slide from their presentation, which nicely tabulates the liabilities. Capital structure and intelligent leverage (MSTR Q2 Presentation) That $30.6 million is more than half of the expenses. Now that it is gone, MSTR will likely try to fill the gap with convertible issuances. But because MSTR is already so deep in on monetizing the second moment, raises likely won’t get significantly better from where they are now. It would certainly take a lot to reduce interest expenses even more, now that the last bit of “normal” debt is gone. What's more concerning is that total revenues are actually going down. This further narrows the gap. Unless BTC rises significantly and the subsequent surge in IV allows MSTR to issue convertibles at even closer to 0% rates, we might not see more than $5 billion in BTC purchases from MSTR until after 2030. The other possibility is that MSTR starts to explore creative ways to generate income from its BTC holdings, supplementing the software business revenues and increasing the carrying capacity of interest expenses. This is an inflection point, and it's why the $30.6 million number is important. Valuation Discussion While both numbers and their respective dynamics are very important to be aware of, I think the primary driver of returns is still the fact that MSTR is putting up an impressive BTC Yield. As I covered in the last article , MSTR is projecting a 4-8% BTC Yield per year for the next three years. This year’s 17.8% YTD BTC Yield is therefore a massive anomaly. I think the projection of 4-8% comes from the interest expense carrying capacity and from expectations that BTC will probably be a lot higher over these next few years. Each subsequent $1 billion raise purchases less BTC (also the denominator gets larger as you purchase more BTC, so the percent change in BTC must go down over time, even if the BTC price stays constant). I will assume that the carrying capacity is another $5 to $10 billion of convertible notes proceeds used to buy BTC, spread out over the next 4 years. I think $10 billion could be possible if they can raise at 0.25% interest rates. With the Fed cutting rates and MSTR volatility increasing into a BTC bull run, this might be feasible. We can treat it as a bull case. Now it’s just a question of turning those dollar raises into a BTC Yield metric based on where we think BTC might be over the next few years. Once we have the BTC Yield metric, we can back out a dollar denominated growth for the equity value of MSTR because the BTC Yield is like an alpha on the performance resulting from MSTR’s beta against BTC. There is one last important component to this. The $500 million secured loan’s annual $30.6 million interest expense will be replaced with about $5 billion of convertible debt, issued at varying times over the next few years, with an annual total interest expense of $30 million. This means the leverage ratio goes much higher. We started this article with $3.8 billion in long-term debt. Add another $5 billion and we will have around $9 billion. If the market cap remains where it is, the beta will have increased from 1.1x to 1.3x. So you can do the following exercise yourself with your assumptions, but here are my assumptions: I assume BTC has a CAGR of 45% over the next 5 years I assume MSTR will “front load” capital raises to buy more BTC sooner I assume that each time convertibles are issued, the dilution offsets the BTC per share increase by 20%. So if the amount of BTC held by MSTR increased by 10%, BTC per assumed diluted share would increase by 8% to make up for the dilution of existing shareholders. I assume that the MSTR YoY performance would be the BTC CAGR times the beta for the year, plus the BTC Yield for the year. This is congruent with the observation that BTC Yield should be a “floor” level of growth or the “alpha.” My model looks like this. The yellow areas are filled in with stuff I assumed. The 20% dilution offset is hardcoded into the sheet, so it doesn’t appear in a yellow cell. After 5 years, at 45% BTC CAGR, the model predicts the price to be 972% higher than it is now assuming only $5 billion of convertible issuance is possible. If MSTR can raise $10 billion, then the model predicts a 1170% growth in 5 years. See the orange area in the bottom right. Model (Author) Assuming a 10% BTC CAGR, the numbers come out to the following. Still impressive, but nothing like the first one. This strategy rests mostly on the shoulders of Bitcoin. Model (Author) There are many issues with this analysis. It is very, very rough, to say the least. BTC will certainly not move up in a straight line. Even worse, MSTR will likely be forced to buy more during relative highs and less during relative lows because investors will likely have less appetite for the convertibles during bear markets. The approach to the YoY MSTR stock price growth is also very simplistic. A strong case can be made that beta should stay at 1.1 if BTC is rising too. So perhaps the beta is artificially large in this model, leading to an overestimate of growth. That said, I do think there are many conservative assumptions too. A 20% haircut for dilution is conservative. MSTR is constantly issuing far OTM call options on these convertibles. The last issuance had a 40% conversion premium. There is no reason for the dilution haircut to stay at a flat 20%. $1 billion of new shares (at a premium, too) will eventually be less dilutive as the share count and market cap grows. Secondly, the assumption that BTC Yield will just be added to the product of beta and BTC’s YoY growth is also very conservative. So far, it seems that many multiples of BTC Yield are added to the beta. You will notice that this is a much more realistic way to think about and value MSTR than as a mere “leveraged BTC holding company.” It factors in the actual economic realities and nuances of the Bitcoin strategy and explains why the premium will persist rather than taking the stubborn angle that the market is simply wrong. Also, it includes the impact of the software business, which is the ultimate source of funds to service the debt that buys the BTC. If you believe the software business will shrink, you can reflect that by making the $5 billion convertible notes figure smaller. If you think it will grow, you can bump the $10 billion convertible notes figure higher. Lastly, the model covers how the increase in leverage might affect the stock’s price action. You can go a step further by thinking about how an increase in beta will increase the IV of MSTR and therefore decrease interest expense on convertible issuance and possibly increase BTC Yield. Risk Discussion If BTC collapses in value, the leveraged strategy will lead to enormous capital destruction. Convertible note holders will choose to get the principal back and without the ability to refinance, MSTR shareholders will effectively be liquidated. This was always the core risk of MSTR. And technically, it is the risk of anyone who is fully on the Bitcoin standard. A more nuanced risk is that MSTR severely overestimates its future revenues and cannot service some of its interest expenses. This could put MSTR in the awkward position of having to sell BTC to pay down expenses. If this scenario unfolds, it could get messy. BTC traders might panic sell because it looks like MSTR has finally capitulated and is about to dump more than 1% of the BTC supply on the market. Shareholders might panic sell because it might look like the music has finally stopped. But this scenario would only incur significant volatility— it wouldn’t be a death blow the way a total collapse in BTC’s value would be. One very misplaced risk which I’d like to dispel here is that MSTR’s BTC being held in a subsidiary called MacroStrategy is not an indication that MSTR shareholders don’t actually own the BTC that MicroStrategy reports. I first saw this accusation in an article here on Seeking Alpha. MacroStrategy is shielded from certain claims from debt holders. The logic then goes that because debt holders take priority over equity holders and MacroStrategy assets are shielded from debt holders, it means shareholders don’t actually own the BTC. This logic is totally absurd and probably just comes from a bad place of trying to create sensationalism to catch attention. Ultimately, the BTC is held by various institutional custodians and shareholders can easily enforce their legal claims over the BTC held under MacroStrategy if needed in a lawsuit. If there were really some obscure clause against this, every equity analyst on Wall Street and short seller fund covering MSTR would have sounded the alarms. There’s a reason Kerrisdale’s short thesis had nothing to do with MacroStrategy and everything to do with their misunderstanding of MSTR’s premium. Conclusion I rate MSTR a Buy. It should go a lot higher because it is able to intelligently increase BTC per share. I have many reasons for believing BTC will go a lot higher, but those are covered in other articles. I think the approval of IBIT options is particularly important . I also think the macro setup featuring an imminent surge in fiat liquidity is quite fantastic. That naturally points me towards equities which can passively increase my BTC holdings by increasing BTC per share. If you are bullish on BTC, you should consider a MSTR position because this stock has a very high chance of continuing its outperformance. You shouldn’t feel weird about taking a position: it has outperformed everything in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.

34407048,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646630,1728288020,"Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year","Crypto analyst Ash Crypto has outlined several reasons why the Bitcoin price is poised to reach $100,000 by the end of the year. This price level is one that other market experts like Standard Chartered have predicted that the flagship crypto could hit even before year-end. Why The Bitcoin Price Can Reach $100,000 By Year-End Ash Crypto stated in an X post that the answer to whether Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in the fourth quarter of this year lies in the past halving cycles. He noted that BTC usually goes through a consolidation phase of around six months after each halving. In 2016, the flagship crypto is said to have witnessed 161 days of consolidation before a price breakout. Meanwhile, in 2020, Bitcoin recorded 175 days of consolidation before its price broke out. Related Reading: ‘FLOKI Master Plan’: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2,000% Jump For The Shiba Inu Competitor In line with this, Ash Crypto noted that the flagship crypto has consolidated for 161 days since the Halving event in April earlier this year. Therefore, the analyst claimed that there is a high probability that the Bitcoin price could witness a breakout in the next two to three weeks. He then went on to outline fundamentals that could spark this price breakout. Firstly, Ash Crypto stated that China is printing $280 billion to boost its economy. This is about the People Bank of China’s announcement of a stimulus package to help revive the country’s economy. China’s monetary easing policies have been bullish for Bitcoin, historically leading to price surges for the flagship crypto. Furthermore, the analyst noted that the US Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates. The Fed announced a 50 basis points (bps) rate cut at its September FOMC meeting. There are also expectations that there could be another 50 bps rate cut before the year ends. This is also bullish for the Bitcoin price since more liquidity could flow into the flagship crypto with US investors having access to more capital. Another macro factor that the analyst cited is the fact that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) looks to have turned dovish and is, in the meantime, no longer considering rate hikes. The Bitcoin price crashed below $50,000 in the infamous August 5 crypto market following the BOJ’s decision to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years. Therefore, the BOJ’s decision not to hike rates further is positive for Bitcoin. Doing otherwise could revive the ghosts of the yen carry trade as Japanese investors liquidate their positions in risk assets like BTC. Other Factors That Could Spark The Rise To $100,000 Ash Crypto also listed other factors that could help the Bitcoin price reach $100,000. The analyst noted that Donald Trump is again leading in the opinion polls and looks likely to win the US presidential elections in November. A Trump victory is considered a win for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market because the former US President has declared his support for cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: 72% Of ETHUSDT Traders On Binance Go Long – Is This The Buy Signal You Need? The analyst also cited the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have started to accumulate again. The Bitcoin flow to exchange has also reached a very low level, which indicates that investors are choosing to hold for the long term, meaning less selling pressure. FTX customers are also expected to receive their repayments this quarter, which could cause more liquidity to flow into Bitcoin. Lastly, Russia plans to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for cross-border payments starting in November, while the global money supply has reached new highs. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is currently bullish. Interestingly, Ash Crypto claimed that the crypto market has still not factored in all these bullish fundamentals. He stated that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high (ATH) when that happens.

The change further legitimizes the virtual assets sector, one legal expert said.

The change, which takes effect Nov. 15, applies retrospectively to transactions from as far back as Jan. 1, 2018. The Arabic version of the Federal Tax Authority's update was made public on Oct. 2, 2024, and the English translation was made public on Oct. 4, 2024.  The exemption makes clear for the first time that the tax doesn't apply to digital assets. It covers the exchange of and transfer of ownership of those assets, which means all cryptocurrency transfers and conversions will now be exempt from paying the 5% levy.  ""The UAE has essentially classified virtual assets in the same bucket as traditional financial services – several of which are already exempt from VAT.

42390240,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu3BV,1728282264,Len Sassaman Gets the Memecoin Treatment Ahead of HBO Bitcoin Creator Documentary,"The upcoming HBO documentary ""Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery"" has sparked significant interest and speculation in the cryptocurrency community about the identity of Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  In anticipation of the documentary, various memecoins themed around Len Sassaman and his cats, Sasha and ODIN, have emerged on Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin networks.  The suspense around who will be revealed as Bitcoin's {{BTC}} apparent creator on an upcoming HBO document is making rounds in crypto circles, but some have found a way to make money with tokens amid the drama.  Memecoins themed after cryptographer Len Sassaman – whom Polymarket bettors believe to be revealed as Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto – have started to populate the Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin networks in the past week.  LEN tokens on Solana and Ethereum were issued by opportunistic traders in the past week, running to a market capitalization of a few million before paring gains. Another LEN token issued over four months ago that claims to be the first be issued on Solana saw a price boost last week and sits at over $1.6 million as of Monday.  Some even learned about Sassaman's cat Sasha and created memecoins around her. Others claim that another cat, ODIN, was Sassaman's first, as his wife Meredith L. Patterson tagged on her blog.  SASHA tokens on Ethereum and Solana have reached market capitalizations of over $5 million in the past week. Crypto users have contacted Patterson on X asking about memecoins and receiving a Solana address for token donations in return.  Memecoins are often created as a form of internet culture or to celebrate a meme. They leverage the power of community, where the shared humor or interest in a meme can create a strong, supportive base that drives value for the token.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on the BSC (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  Some say that memecoin bets on tokens themed after Sassaman or his cats could be an underpriced market opportunity.  ""But I know if HBO releases a documenter and tells everyone that @lensassaman is satoshi, then every crypto mfers and every big media will say/write its name and talk about him,” said crypto X user @ariesyuangga. “If Len Sassaman is named as Satoshi Nakamoto this cat is going to fly,” said @dametime_tradez, another crypto X user.

42390244,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbu3Ll,1728281902,"Bitcoin, Asian Equities May Be Losing Capital to China Stocks","Since late September, BTC has held largely flat amid the stimulus-led 20% surge in the Chinese stocks.  The rebound in the battered Chinese equities could be sucking out capital from crypto and Asian equity markets.  The capital rotation may be short-lived.  China's battered stock market has experienced a resurgence since late September powered by the barrage of stimulus by Beijing.  But this surge could be sucking capital out of the crypto market, capping the upside in bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, and other Asian markets, according to observers.  ""The current surge in Chinese stocks, driven by the stimulus package and investor activity during the national holiday week, represents a calculated risk-reward trade for savvy investors. Even with a 3-5% cost to convert [stablecoin] USDT into equities, the potential upside of 50-70% makes this a strategic move,"" Danny Chong, co-founder of multi-staking protocol Tranchess and co-founder of Digital Assets Association Singapore, told CoinDesk in an email.  Since Sept. 24, the Shanghai Composite Index has jumped over 20%, reaching its highest since May 2023. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which constitutes Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, has jumped over 25%, according to data source TradingView.  The rally follows stimulus announcements that included interest rate cuts, liquidity support for stocks, banking system capital injections, and a promise to support property prices. The enormous stimulus, estimated to be over 7.5 trillion yuan (CNY), has been widely perceived as uber-bullish for bitcoin and other risk assets. Bitcoin, however, remains flat-lined at around $64,000 in the wake of the China stimulus, extending a six-month-long consolidation between $50,000 and $70,000.  Beijing's Bazooka is also drawing capital from other Asian equity markets. ""We are trimming our long positions across Asia to fund China purchases,"" Eric Yee, senior portfolio manager at Atlantis Investment Management in Singapore, told Bloomberg.  Temporary shift  According to Chong, the capital shift is likely to be temporary and investors will eventually refocus on cryptocurrencies.  ""This shift is likely to be temporary. Once the peak of the recent upward move in Chinese equities stabilizes, we can expect to see a redeployment of capital back into crypto. This is a prime example of the maturing mindset of investors who are willing to move across asset classes to optimize their returns,"" Chong said.  Traditional market analysts believe Bejing's latest stimulus falls short of addressing the real economic issues and may not lead to a long-lasting rally in Chinese stocks.  ""Looking beyond the near-term sentiment boost, the effectiveness of the measures could fade unless some fundamental issues are addressed. The key one is fixing damaged balance sheets – especially those of the banks. Until that happens, any attempts to boost borrowing and leveraged risk-taking are likely to fail,"" TS Lombard said in a note to clients on Oct. 2.  The firm added that the latest measures are only 1.5% of China's gross domestic product, as opposed to 32% in 2008 and 22% in 2015-16, saying the spillovers from the stimulus are unlikely to be large this time.

The unexpected movement caused the token to fall by nearly 16% causing a whopping $87k wipeout of STRK long positions in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? The market’s current positioning puts many investors at risk with big losses for the bulls if investor sentiment does not flip bullish in the coming days. With no solid backing for a bull run this week, STRK starts weakly as investors continue to be cautious of the market’s volatility. Surprise For Investors Despite the market’s bearishness, STRK bulls pulled a small win in the shape of a localized breakthrough on the $0.3891 resistance level which might translate to big gains in the coming days. However, this can only occur if the token stabilizes above $0.3891 in the short to medium term. With the token possibly entering a crucial crossover point hinted at by STRK’s relative strength index, a bullish reversal might be around the corner for investors. But this may only come if the market flips on the side of the bulls. As of writing, Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency in the world, is currently moving in the same zone as well. The broader financial market’s current bullishness might leak to the crypto market through Bitcoin’s correlation with major finance indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones index, both are up a few hundred points in the past 24 hours. But with investors split between investing or pulling out of the market, it might take a while before STRK experiences a jump in price that will wipe out last week’s losses. For the current losses to be completely reversed, the token needs to attempt a breakthrough on the $0.5083 resistance level. However, STRK’s current trajectory may only permit a move above the $0.3891 support level. Once the token stabilizes on this support level, STRK bulls might find new strength, targeting $0.4628 in the medium to long term.

BTC rose 3%, putting in motion a market-wide jump that saw majors from ether {{ETH}} to dogecoin {{DOGE}} jump as much as 4%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid fund tracking the largest tokens, added 3.26%. Frog-themed Pepe (PEPE) rose 14%.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the unadjusted CPI annual rate in September, the PPI annual rate in September, and the number of initial jobless claims for the week ending October 5.  Asian stocks rose on Monday, with the tech-heavy Hang Seng index jumping 3% and Korea’s KOSPI adding 1%. The People’s Bank of China, the nation’s central bank, has announced several stimulus measures over the past two weeks, boosting sentiment in the region. China is expected to announce further measures to stimulate the economy at a press conference on Tuesday morning local time.  Bittensor’s TAO led gains among mid-cap tokens of less than a $5 billion market cap with a 14% jump in increased social sentiment and growth in artificial intelligence tokens over the past week. Overall, the category on CoinGecko is up 7.5%, with AI tokens like {{NEAR}} and Internet Computer {{ICP}} also in the green.  Memecoins rose higher over the weekend as social sentiment and riskier behavior among crypto traders grew. Talks and posts of the so-called “memecoin supercycle,” a prediction that memes will lead the next crypto bull market, trended on social app X.  Solana-based popcat (POPCAT) and Ethereum-based mog (MOG) jumped over 12% in the past 24 hours, while BNB Chain-based simon’s cat (CAT) rose 10%.  Smaller tokens GIGA, SPX6900 (a parody of the U.S. index S&P500) and Fwog surged more than 20%.  Cat-themed memecoins continue to lead over their dog-themed counterparts and remain the preferred choice for riskier memecoin bets, as CoinDesk flagged previously.  Interest in memecoins comes amid low market volatility in more serious crypto sectors, such as layer-2s or storage, and rising negative sentiment around tokens backed by venture capital funds – which are increasingly perceived as overpriced and a bad bet for retail traders.  One market participant known as Kaiwen0x, who penned an essay on the memecoin supercycle, noted that they are bearish on memecoins if Donald Trump wins the 2024 election as it might bring regulatory clarity to the U.S, causing ""capital to rotate toward utility tokens.""",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | MOG,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MOG,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/07/bitcoin-nears-64k-memecoin-supercycle-trends-as-mog-popcat-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72b4aefe2e525485bcd72be071ac70cf6b576cce-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ETH is rising and might aim for a move above the $2,550 resistance. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,350 and $2,420 levels. The price is trading above $2,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,435 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,525 and $2,550 resistance levels to continue higher in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,300 level and started a fresh increase. ETH was able to clear the $2,350 resistance to move into a positive zone like Bitcoin. The price was able to climb above the $2,400 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,656 swing high to the $2,310 low. Finally, the bulls pushed the price above the $2,500 resistance. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,435 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,525 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,656 swing high to the $2,310 low. A clear move above the $2,525 resistance might send the price toward the $2,550 resistance. An upside break above the $2,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,650 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,720 level or $2,740. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,525 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,450 level. The first major support sits near the $2,420 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $2,420 support might push the price toward $2,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.
