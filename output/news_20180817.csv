CBP Division of Business Transformation and Innovation head Vincent Annunziato said the agency was beginning a ""live fire testing"" of a blockchain platform to certify that imported products originated where they claim during CBP's 2018 Trade Symposium in Atlanta, according to the American Shipper.  The new system, which will launch in September, is going to help CBP verify information about imported goods and check how foreign suppliers act toward American importers, he said. The system can also be used to authenticate trademarks and check on an item's physical properties.  ""I can even go in and say, 'hey, I need a little information on the stitching,' or, 'I need information on what colors are viable,'"" Annunziato said.  Annunziato said the blockchain system could be used in a mobile app, which would replace a paper-based manual process for verifying such information, thereby streamlining the agency's work.  He also provided an update to the agency's work with the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC). As previously reported by CoinDesk, COAC formed a special group advising the Secretaries of Treasury and Homeland Security on the agency's commercial operations last November. The body was said to focus on emerging technologies in general and on blockchain in particular.  This week, Annunziato confirmed that the committee was working to develop a proof-of-concept blockchain platform to verify intellectual property by confirming the relationship between licensees and licensors. The technology could ultimately eliminate paper processes, manuals and databases, CPB hopes.  The CBP press office did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Motherboard reported  Friday that Ai – well-known for his criticism of China's Communist government as well as his art installations and photos – is working with Irish conceptual artist Kevin Abosch.  Together, Ai and Abosch have created two new tokens, freely distributable, in an effort to (as they describe it) illustrate how worth is perceived and imbued within modern society. And it's an area that Abosch has already been working in – bridging the worlds of art and cryptocurrency through his work – as the New York Times previously reported.  The project, dubbed PRICELESS (ticker symbol: PRCLS), involves twin tokens, one of which is made publicly available to the extent that, in theory, every person on the planet could own a fraction. The other token, according to Motherboard, is locked away and inaccessible to anyone.  ""It's not about a potential for creating art, but, rather, to question the existing system and the potential to create a new system outside of the established one,"" Ai told Motherboard.  As Abosch said to the publication:  ""From the moment we're born, people try to ascribe value to us — 'Oh, that boy is so full of potential, or oh, that girl is worthless' — it's something society does to us and it's something we do to ourselves ... Our project is just another thing to engage people in the hope that they will spend a little bit more time reflecting on the perversity of how most of us ascribe value to things.""  Wallet addresses holding nominal amounts of the PRCLS token have already been printed on paper and sold to buyers, with each wallet address representing different ""priceless moments"" shared between Ai and Abosch, illustrating how the token can represent value.  Ai revealed in an interview with Motherboard that, for him, blockchain represents ""an opportunity to set up a new system that could dismantle the old system, or at least offer a new possibility for communication.""

Kryptovault, a crypto mining firm with facilities in a number of cities in Norway, reported receiving threats after a local paper reported on its work, according to Yahoo Finance.  The bomb threat said ""if you are expanding crypto mining and filling the country with noise, then you will be sabotaging the peace. I am threatening to send you some explosives,"" according to the report.  Kryptovault managing director Gjermund Hagesaeter said the anonymous notice was immediately sent to local authorities, who are ""taking the whole issue very seriously indeed.""  Noise complaints over the sound level of mining operations from local residents has been a reoccurring issue for Kryptovault. Back in June, Vakdalposten newspaper reported that the company hosted consultation meetings with neighbors in the city of Dale as an attempt to remedy ongoing frustrations.  However, given the recent turn of events, new assessments are being drawn on the course action needed to be taken to ensure the safety of both Kryptovault facilities and employees.  In fact, speaking with Yahoo Finance, Hagesaeter revealed that among their three cities of operation, ""Dale is far more accessible"" to potential intruders. As a result, employees in the city have been warned to ""be on their toes"" in case of any abnormal activity moving forward.

Zcash version 2.0.0 was released Thursday, according to a blog post penned by Sean Bowe, an engineer with the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, which develops the zcash cryptocurrency. The company is ""encouraging all users and miners"" to upgrade to the new version ""as soon as possible,"" he said.  The hard fork itself is expected to occur on October 28, when the first Sapling block will be mined at block 419,200. Prior to the live launch, Sapling will run on a test network (or testnet) from block 280,000 – an event Bowe said should occur sometime next Thursday.  He wrote:  ""Sapling had previously activated on testnet, but because changes were made to the consensus rules your node will automatically roll back and proceed on the Overwinter testnet branch until Sapling activates again at the new height.""  The v2.0.0 software upgrade includes experimental support for remote procedure calls – by which code can execute on a remote computer as if it was called locally – although full support will not be available until the 2.0.1 release.  It also fixes a bug which slowed some nodes syncing to the network when banning peers. The function ""was introduced to mitigate against a class of [denial of service] attacks from Sprout nodes,"" Bowe wrote. The new software instead just ignores invalid transactions.  The Sapling upgrade is intended to significantly reduce the storage requirements for private transactions and update the blockchain's zk-snarks cryptography to make it more secure, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  A two-part ""ceremony"" to produce the parameters required to encrypt the blockchain was completed Tuesday, having run since November of last year. Announced in another blog post, the team stated that completing the process concludes ""the largest multi-party computations ever performed.""  The zcash team began releasing software patches for Sapling earlier this year.  Zcash's previous Overwinter hard fork, executed in June, was expected to be a sort of trial run for Sapling, and included a number of software improvements.

According to a news release from the United States Attorney's Office, an FBI investigation found that an individual, later alleged to be Martin Marsich, had illegally breached the gaming firm's network, gaining access to around 25,000 accounts through which users could buy in-game items.  As well as allegedly using stolen information to buy and sell in-game items, Marsich is also accused of selling access to the accounts on dark market websites, in total causing claimed losses of $324,000 to the company. The firm apparently closed the affected accounts after the intrusion was discovered, the report says.  The accused made an initial appearance at a federal court in San Francisco on Aug. 9, after reportedly being arrested at San Francisco International Airport while trying to board a flight to Serbia.  At the hearing, Magistrate Judge Corley said Marsich could be released to a halfway house on the condition that he hands over bail of cryptocurrency to the value of $750,000.  According to a report from The Daily Post, Assistant District Attorney Abraham Simmons said it was likely not the first time cryptocurrency had been allowed to be put up for bail, since judges can accept other assets such as real estate.  Simmons was quoted as saying:  ""It really is quite broad. The judge could order just about anything. What the objective is is to get the defendant to comply with an order to appear later.""  Marsich faces a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000 if found guilty, the Attorney's Office says.

In a continuation of a patent application submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) back in June 2017, Capital One sets out a blockchain system that will receive, store and retrieve encrypted user authentication data, according to a filing released Thursday.  The proposed idea is described as ""a distributed, non-reputable record of authentication interactions"" that allows users to authenticate themselves across multiple platforms, but limits how much personal information is shared between them.  In effect, the method retrieves identification data on a user when they commence the authentication process (assuming the user has a profile set up). The system will authenticate or reject the user based on the received authentication information, but the user data itself is kept securely on the blockchain.  The claimed invention is said to potentially reduce ""time and resource burdens"" for institutions when on-boarding new clientele. Furthermore, the filing adds, it would be a boon for users that may ""resent"" having to repeatedly authenticate themselves as they move between different institutions.  Thus, Capital One says, both institutions and clients ""may therefore benefit from a collaborative authentication system that handles authentication interactions for multiple institutions.""  One business-focused use case for the invention is stated as fulfilling ""statutory or regulatory requirements, such as 'Know Your Customer' requirements,"" which most financial institutions around the world are legally mandated to abide by to reduce the risk of money laundering.

42401791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2UB8,1534503603,3 Charts Suggest Bitcoin Prices Could Be Headed Higher,"For bitcoin (BTC), the path of least resistance is to the upside, according to technical charts.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,430 on Bitfinex – up 9 percent from the Aug. 14 low of $5,859.  However, BTC has failed three times in the last 72 hours to hold on to gains above $6,500, with the latest attempt to scale the psychological level failing a couple of minutes before press time. This may force investors to question the sustainability of the recent rally.  But such concerns may be unfounded, as the bullish bias has only strengthened in the last 24 hours, as seen in the technical charts below. As a result, BTC could rise toward $7,000 (psychological resistance) over the weekend.  4-hour chart: Bull breakout confirmed        BTC scaled the channel resistance (top end) earlier today, confirming a bullish breakout, that is, the sell-off from the July 25 high of $8,507 has ended and the bulls have regained control.  A closer look at the chart reveals the top end of the channel has been playing a spoilsport since Wednesday. Hence, it seems safe to say the bulls are feeling emboldened, having crossed a key hurdle.  The cryptocurrency has also found acceptance above the 50-candle moving average (MA) and looks set to test the 100-candle MA, currently located at $6,725.  1-hour chart: Bull flag breakout on the RSI  The relative strength index has witnessed a bull flag breakout – a bullish continuation pattern – which indicates BTC could soon pick up a strong bid and jump to the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,715.  Acceptance above that level would open the doors to $7,500 (target as per the measured height method).  Daily chart: Short-term MAs adopting a bullish bias  The 5-day MA is beginning to rise in a bull-friendly manner and has almost crossed the 10-day MA from below (bullish crossover). This change of direction by the 5-day and 10-day MA points to a short-term bullish setup.  View  BTC remains on the hunt of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $6,715. A bullish breakout, if confirmed, would validate the bearish-to-bullish trend change suggested by the 4-hour chart and allow a sustained move above $7,000.  On the downside, a break below $6,213 (low of the right shoulder of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern) would abort the bullish view.

According to a release on Friday, JD.com said the application moves invoice data for Pacific Insurance onto a distributed network at each step of the issuance cycle, automating the process and making it visible to all participants.  Invoices, or more commonly known as ""Fapiao"" in China, play an important role among businesses in the country both as a reference for bookkeeping and for taxation purposes.  The goal of the app, as explained by the e-commerce giant, is to boost issuance efficiency and to streamline the accounting process by keeping the invoice data updated on a distributed ledger.  The application comes as the first use case for JD.com's Blockchain Open Platform which was also announced today.  The blockchain-as-a-service product – rolled out months after the firm announced its plan for the project in April – is designed to aid enterprises wanting to develop their own blockchain applications, including those for tracking supply chain information, charity donations, certificate authentication and property assessment.  JD.com has previously announced several blockchain trial programs within its own business divisions.

42401792,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2U9A,1534496440,An Uncanny Correlation: Overstock's Stock and the Bitcoin Price,"At a time when it's hard to find a correlation between cryptocurrencies and just about any other asset class, it may come as a surprise that a fairly public stock would be tracking bitcoin.  However, that's exactly what appears to be the case with the share price of Overstock.com (OSTK) and the BTC/USD exchange rate. What's more, it's not exactly a short-term coincidence at play.  Ever since 2014, the technical price charts between the two assets have developed a striking similarity, one that not only seems to grow stronger as times goes on, but that saw its latest example late last week amidst crypto market turmoil.  At first this may seem like comparing apples and oranges, but Overstock was actually the first major retailer to accept bitcoin as a form of payment in 2014.  As Overstock's operations have expanded (the company now has a dedicated blockchain subsidiary, tZero, which hopes to publicly trade blockchain-based traditional assets in 2018), it seems investors in the U.S. public markets are using it as a proxy for an asset they're not easily able to acquire exposure to via something like an ETF.  In short, in the eyes of traders, it seems that what's good for bitcoin is good for Overstock's value, and vice versa.  Act I: 2013 bubbles burst  Both OSTK and BTC experienced tremendous growth coming into 2014, and both reached a climax and began a steep descent just before the new year.  Their respective crashes developed with a few notable coincidences:  The first day Overstock accepted bitcoin payments (01/09/2014) marked the end of the first relief rally, a.k.a ""dead cat bounce,"" for both bitcoin and OSTK. Both began a more than 50 percent decline hereafter (first white block).  In May 2014, both stabilized in a sideways fashion, followed by a minor upswing (second white block).  From mid-September to mid-October, both fell more than 20 percent and formed ""V"" shaped recoveries at the exact same time, give or take a couple days (third white block).  The fourth white block features BTC's official capitulation that took place on Jan. 14, 2018 when price dropped more than 30 percent in a single day. Two weeks later, OSTK fell more than 20 percent in a single day.  BTC went on to break its downtrend in June 2015, much earlier than OSTK, but their bear market structures remained very similar.  Act II: The 2017 bull runs    The correlation gets a bit more interesting when BTC finally began a new uptrend above its 2013 peak.  As seen in the above chart, BTC started this uptrend in May of 2017, which set the stage for a more than 1,500 percent bull run up to the end of the year. OSTK followed suit and broke its downtrend just a couple months later which lead to a surge of more than 400 percent by the end of the year.  Act III: Correlation tightens    In 2018, the correlation became so exact it arguably could no longer be ignored.  The precise occurrence of events began after OSTK and BTC ended their 2017 bull runs in a bubble-bursting fashion. At the time, each achieved all-time highs almost exactly one month apart.  Precise correlations:  After the bubbles burst, both fell to their first bottom on the exact same day, February 6.  Both would go on to experience a relief rally of which both peaked on February 20.  The rallies were temporary and eventually bottomed out again with just days of each other  Last but not least, both prices fell to their lowest prices of 2018 on the exact same day, June 28.  Conclusion  Could it be an elaborate coincidence? Perhaps.  However, it's equally as likely that Overstock is now seen by investors more as a cryptocurrency company than an online retailer. With few, if any, ways for the traditional finance world to invest in cryptocurrencies, perhaps investing in OSTK is Wall Street's way of investing in the wild world of cryptocurrencies...

The firm announced Friday that it was launching the contract on its platform, which is regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. Trading of the bitcoin cash future will begin at 4 p.m. British Standard Time (BST).  The contract joins the company's existing bitcoin, ethereum, XRP and litecoin futures contracts. Investors can take long or short positions on bitcoin cash, ""allowing them to broaden investment opportunities and hedge risk more effectively,"" according to the company.  Crypto Facilities CEO Timo Schlaefer told CoinDesk that ""bitcoin cash is a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap so it was a logical next step to add BCH to our BTC, ETH, XRP and LTC futures offering.""

42401770,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2TtQ,1534485649,Mark Cuban-Backed Unikrn ICO Hit by Class Action Lawsuit,"Unikrn, a Seattle-based e-sport betting startup that conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) last year, is now facing a class action suit accusing it of violating securities law in the U.S.  Las Vegas resident and lead plaintiff John Hastings filed the case at a court in Washington State on Aug. 13, alleging that Unikrn and its founder Rahul Sood sold unregistered securities to the public via the ICO for its blockchain-based UnikoinGold Tokens (UKG).  Hastings, a participant in the ICO, argued that the UKG tokens should be treated as securities since investors were led to expect that the tokens ""would increase in value and become worth more than the virtual currencies invested.""  He further claimed that Unikrn has ""crafted a flimsy façade that UKG Tokens are not securities by claiming they are 'utility tokens.'"" Sood said in a news report from Geekwire on Thursday that Unikrn is ""aware of the lawsuit,"" but declined to give further comment on the case.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Unikrn collected 112,720 ether via its token sale between September and October 2017, an amount worth around $31 million at the time.  Based on a file submitted by Unikrn to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Oct. 6, the firm also raised at least $16 million from accredited investors through an investment contract known as a SAFT – Simple Agreement for Future Tokens.  Founded in 2014, Unikrn planned last year to launch its own token for a blockchain-based betting platform and subsequently conducted the ICO to raise funds for the project's development.  The ICO was notably backed by ""Shark Tank"" VC Mark Cuban, who confirmed with CoinDesk his participation in the offering – a first for the owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise. ""High risk. High reward,"" he commented at the time.  Following the token sale, UKG was listed for trading on several crypto exchanges including U.S.-based Bittrex.  The case was filed at a time when the price of UKG declined from its all-time-high around $2 early this year to $0.05 as of press time according to data from CoinMarketCap.  The case comes as the latest class action lawsuit filed by investors against an ICO project they had invested in.  Just last week, a court in California blocked a move that sought to dismiss a class action alleging that the ICO conducted by the Tezos Foundation violated securities laws in the U.S.  Read the full Unikrn complaint below:    Unikrn by CoinDesk on Scribd    Justice image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/08/17/mark-cuban-backed-unikrn-ico-hit-by-class-action-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ea64ee2391e0bf89e8fbdc08e32954e5110ea0f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2U6D,1534478793,Unstoppable Scams? Ethereum's Gambling Problem Is Only Getting Worse,"Ethereum has a gambling problem.  Since July, products resembling Ponzi schemes, a fraudulent form of investment promising high returns for little cost, have topped the charts among decentralized applications (dapps) running on the world's second-largest blockchain, outpacing even the popular CryptoKitties.  But if user counts and transaction volumes observed on these applications are high, so too is the level of concern over the risks consumers face when using them. Already mounting are warning cries from technologists who aren't exactly known for their risk reticence, a group that includes gambling dapp developers themselves.  Such was the case for Team JUST, the group of anonymous developers behind the infamous gambling dapp FOMO 3D, who warned last week that what looked to be a near identical copy of its game was eating up one-third of the network's total computational power, raising over $7 million in ETH within the span of seven days.  Team JUST has gone on record both publicly and in private communications with CoinDesk to allege the imposter game as being a Chinese mobile app called LastWinner supposedly created to ""trick"" users by displaying false, bot-driven game activity.  To elaborate, Team JUST purports that the game essentially uses its own ether, 200,000 to be exact, as a means of fueling thousands of transactions that are carried out by computer bots. The goal is to give the appearance of a highly popular and legitimate gambling dapp, thereby luring users to engage with their own ether in the hopes of winning big.  One of the lead designers in Team JUST, who goes by the pseudonym ""Justo_Bot,"" went so far as to issue statements in a channel-wide Discord post Tuesday, warning users that LastWinner might be run by criminals.  He wrote:  ""The scale of this wallet, the scale of these bots. The amount of sheer gas being used. I genuinely think you're probably looking at a crime syndicate running this in China to scam people on a scale the ethereum network has never seen before ... It's very bad.""  The limits of analysis  But it isn't just the developers who are concerned.  Users and analysts alike raised alarm bells on several different online channels over the frenzy of transaction activity caused by the new gambling dapp, said to be LastWinner. First, though, there was the matter of figuring out just what exactly was occurring.  In the days after the launch, comments on Etherscan affirmed that the activity was noticeable, with users noting how the app was outperforming even those it was designed to mimic. As one user attested at the time in what amounts to an eye-witness report, ""It is definitely the most popular F3D clone so far, beating the original very easily.""  Indeed, the activity was quickly identified as an anomaly by data providers.  Amberdata  , a blockchain monitoring and analytics firm, explained to CoinDesk that as a result of ""the clone of the FOMO 3D gambling app"" the ethereum blockchain has been under a heavy load.  ""Overall, about $50.7M of value (Incoming: $29,000,000 and Outgoing: $21,750,000 together) has transmitted through this contract,"" the firm estimated as of August 16.  Dr. Aleksandra Sokolowska, head of research and analytics at Validity Labs, also picked up on the activity, agreeing that the ""highly coordinated and automatic"" interactions of the dapp are suggestive of computer bots.  Still, she concluded in an email address to CoinDesk that the true nature of the dapp, whatever its true name, cannot be fully ascertained, explaining that:  ""As we don't see the source code, it is very hard to tell what the purpose of the code is. It is possible that someone knowingly encourages honest users to play such a game by generating artificial traffic with Sibyl accounts in order to withdraw some or all funds. ""  Friend or foe?  With the abilities of analysts limited, the urgent warnings put forth by Team JUST have sparked a degree of suspicion pointing back to the true nature of the original FOMO 3D application itself.  Because while both gambling dapps have clear instructions on the rules of their game, the source codes responsible for actual game deployment have yet to be fully disclosed and verified.  As far as users are concerned, though, this actually adds to the risk.  Scott Bigelow, a blockchain developer for the dapp Augur, explained in a post on Medium that when it comes to unverified source code, the potential for ""malicious intent and bugs"" cannot be discredited. He further explained how FOMO 3D's ""unverified contract"" might just lead to a shutdown of the entire game one day, ""allowing a single player to claim the jackpot for themselves.""  What Bigelow is describing here can be typified as an ""exit scam"" whereby game creators pull off an orchestrated attempt to hijack raised funds. The same vulnerability lies with the alleged LastWinner dapp given it also runs in part on unverified source code.  And of course, this is not the only potential danger that exists for users engaging in gambling dapps like those described above.  PeckShield, a blockchain security firm, reports in an email to CoinDesk that the alleged LastWinner dapp possesses a common ""airdrop vulnerability"" whereby small amounts of user funds can be intentionally skimmed from airdrop prizes. This was reportedly originally flagged by ethereum developer Peter Szilagyi as a way to ""PWN"" FOMO 3D, though Team JUST claims they knew of the vulnerability in advance.  As such, elements of scam accusations put forth by Team JUST against the alleged LastWinner dapp have raised lines of questioning that lead back to the intentions of the original game.  One Reddit commentator asked:  ""If this is a clone, and the clone owner has the ability to exit scam, doesn't this imply that the original owner also has the ability to exit scam?""  An unstoppable force  Nevertheless, just because something looks like a scam, that doesn't mean it is. (Bitcoin has, after all, been labelled by its most severe critics as a Ponzi scheme).  Even for ethereum developer Lane Rettig, such determinations about the nature of activity generated by the alleged LastWinner dapp can't be certain. He wrote in email addressed to CoinDesk that without ""the contract code"" it would be ""impossible to say more.""  What can be said, at least on the part of Amberdata CEO Shawn Douglass, is that gambling dapps and their respective clones don't seem to be going away anytime soon given their allure to a growing base of users on ethereum.  Douglass asserts:  ""If there has been a demonstrative mechanism that you can enlist a lot of participation and accrue a large amount of money, I think you'll see more of these ... I don't think the ethereum foundation can control it in that it's a decentralized organization.""  Put a different way, Sokolowska likens ethereum to ""a free market"" in which ""anyone who can make a return of investment in any way will use their opportunity.""  As such, it doesn't come as much surprise then that despite growing concerns over user safety in games of chance on ethereum, there's fierce opposition in the community from stopping them entirely.  As one user on Reddit argues: ""It's fascinating how people want decentralization, until it works against them...people are playing the game/gambling and paying high gas prices to do so. It's an egalitarian model, and it's successful because people...can't pick and choose what to censor.""  It seems the mantra of the ethereum platform, at least for the time being, when it comes to user appetites for risky gambles is to live and let live because ultimately, the choice to engage remains in the hands of users.  And that, as with most decentralized platforms, is a pretty dicey gamble.

42401778,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2TzK,1534467643,Coinbase Wins Patent for Secure Bitcoin Payments System,"A newly published Coinbase patent seeks to protect a way of making bitcoin purchases more secure for customers.  In the filing, published August 14, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange outlined how it could develop a payment portal which would allow users to pay using bitcoin directly from their digital wallet.  ""It may be a security concern for users that the private keys of their bitcoin addresses may be stolen from their wallets,"" the patent stated. ""Existing systems do not provide a solution for maintaining security over private keys while still allowing the users to checkout on a merchant page and making payments using their wallets.""  The system as described sets up a ""key ceremony"" that creates key shares that are combined into an operational master key – encrypted with the users' passphrases – that can be made publicly available and deleted after use.  The operational master key is used for private key encryption during checkout, as well as for transaction signing when a payment is made.  What the filing calls ""freeze logic"" is also employed in the process, a security measure that automatically halts transactions if an administrator chooses to suspend the system.  The patent explains:  ""At any point in time after the master key is loaded, the system can be frozen. The system can be unfrozen after it has been frozen using keys from the key ceremony. The checkout process can be carried out when the system is frozen and when the system is unfrozen. The payment process can only be carried out when the system is unfrozen.""  The patent goes on to note that the system also includes an API key, meaning different websites would be able to launch their own version of the portal.  The API key would have two parts: one would be specific to the host server, while the other would be stored on the system developed by Coinbase. The two keys would have to match for a transaction to go through, adding another layer of security for customers.
