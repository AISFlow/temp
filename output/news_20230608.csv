While liquidators based in the Bahamas argued that a Bahamian judge should preside over part of the bankruptcy case, FTX’s restructuring advisors, who took over the exchange after the company’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested on fraud charges last December, argued against the request.  The judge ultimately sided with FTX’s advisors, adding: “The [courts in the Bahamas] may have concurrent jurisdiction,” Dorsey said. “But as a practical matter, they don't have access to the assets.”  While Dorsey made his point of view on the issue clear, he has not yet made an official ruling on the matter.

13631794,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537125,1686261651,"Crypto.com’s CRO Firm Despite SEC Lawsuit Fears, Time To Watch The Token?","CRO, the native token of the Cronos blockchain, an open-source, interoperable, and Cosmos-based platform, a centralized crypto asset exchange, is steady despite some community members fearing that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the primary securities regulator in that country, could soon target Crypto.com, the crypto exchange and developer of the blockchain. CRO Stabilizes Despite Fears The SEC Might Sue Crypto.com As of writing on June 8, CRO is trading at $0.05889, stable in the last 24 hours against the USD, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. All the same, with the CRO average daily trading volumes at $9,098,498, it is down over 25% in the last trading day. The double-digit contraction in the previous 24 hours comes less than 72 hours after the SEC sued Binance, a dominant cryptocurrency exchange, alleging that it has been facilitating the trading of unregistered securities and illegally allowing Americans to access the platform. The SEC has filed 13 charges against the Changpeng Zhao-led exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Dormant 1,433 BTC Moves After 10+ Years The regulator also sued Coinbase in federal court in New York, claiming that, like Binance, the crypto exchange had listed and profited from the trading of unregistered securities. Tokens the SEC claim are securities include ADA, the native currency of Cardano; MANA, the token behind Decentraland; SAND, the ERC-20 token priming The SandBox; ALGO, the native currency of the Algorand proof-of-stake blockchain, and MATIC by Polygon. Stablecoin, BUSD; NEAR by the NEAR Protocol; CHZ by Chiliz, are some of the tokens mentioned and which the SEC alleges are unregistered securities. Even so, there was no express mention of CRO in any of the two lawsuits filed by the regulator against the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges. At the same time, it should be noted that Crypto.com also allows the trading of most tokens that the SEC alleges are unregistered securities. What’s Common in All Tokens The SEC Alleges Are Securities? Within the Cronos blockchain, CRO is used to pay gas fees. Also, because the platform uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, users can stake CRO and receive rewards. Moreover, users can access the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem in Cronos by holding CRO. In 2018, Crypto.com completed its initial coin offering (ICO), raising over $26 million, which also saw the launch of the CRO token. Observers have noted that of all the tokens the SEC claims are securities, they all conducted successful crowdfundings. Additionally, the projects accused of issuing securities also pledged to their respective communities that they would continue improving the underlying protocol via ongoing development.

Factors supporting higher Bitcoin prices include the erosion of fiat currency values, growing acceptance by businesses, and increased demand for assets outside government control. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) offers a regulated investment option for those looking to participate in potential Bitcoin rallies. After reaching a $68,906.48 high in November 2021, Bitcoin ran out of its incredible upside steam, leading to a 77.5% plunge to the $15,516.53 November 2022 low. The decline was ugly, but it was not the first time the leading cryptocurrency tanked, and previous declines since 2010 were even more significant on a percentage basis. Bitcoin is a protocol implementing a public, permanent, decentralized ledger that revolutionizes traditional finance. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that acts as money and a form of payment outside the control of any person, group, or entity operating in a global environment. In late 2017, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rolled out futures contracts on Bitcoin. While physical Bitcoin is mostly unregulated, the futures fall under the CFTC's supervision. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF product ((BITO)) tracks Bitcoin futures prices higher and lower. Bitcoin rallies from the November 2022 low The decline from the November 2021 high was ugly. With some crypto devotees calling for $100,000 per token or higher, Bitcoin plunged, causing latecomers to the asset class more than a little pain. Physical Bitcoin Price Chart (Barchart) The chart highlights the 77.5% fall from the record peak. Meanwhile, the leading crypto nearly doubled at the most recent $30,970.16 mid-April 2023 high before settling into a trading range at over $25,000 and below the $30,000 level. Consolidation is a cleansing A significant price move often leads to a quiet period in markets, and Bitcoin has been no exception. Short-Term Physical Bitcoin Chart (Barchart) The six-month chart illustrates that the short-term trend is marginally bearish, as Bitcoin has made lower highs and lower lows since April 14. However, the price action has been consolidating far above the November 2021 low. Technical support below the bottom end of the current trading range is at the $20,000 level, with a wall of resistance at $30,000 per token. While this may seem like a wide range for an asset, in Bitcoin, it is narrow, considering that the top crypto was as low as five cents in 2010 and as high as nearly $69,000 in late 2021. Consolidation periods cleanse markets of weak longs or shorts, and cryptos have many passionate participants on both ends of the spectrum. The case for higher Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices The following factors support an eventual break to the upside: Fiat currencies derive value from the faith and credit of the countries that issue the legal tender. Economic and political factors that could lead to de-dollarization have eroded fiat currency values over the past years. Debt and geopolitical tensions have challenged the U.S. dollar and other fiat reserve currencies, role in the worldwide financial system, opening the door for alternatives. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have filled the void for some technologically savvy investors and traders. More businesses are accepting Bitcoin and the other leading cryptos as a means of exchange. Growing acceptance favors higher prices. Responding to customers' requests, the leading financial institutions have allowed for investments in the burgeoning asset class. Memories of the appreciation that took Bitcoin from five cents in 2010 to nearly $69,000 per token in late 2021 support speculative activity in the asset class. The loss of faith in governments has increased the demand for assets that transcend the money supply control. Bitcoin's value is a function of bids and offers in the market, without government intervention to control or determine price levels against fiat currencies. Cryptos have become an alternative asset class with growing participation for these reasons and more. Moreover, futures, ETF products, and crypto-related companies trading on stock exchanges have allowed market participants to invest in the asset class without cryptocurrency wallets or holding cryptos on unregulated exchange platforms. While the regulated products provide some sense of security, they continue to provide volatility and correlation when prices move higher or lower. The case for lower Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices On the extremes, crypto devotees like Jack Dorsey believe that Bitcoin will "" change the world ."" Others, like Charlie Munger, think Bitcoin is "" disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization ."" The case against Bitcoin and cryptos includes: There is no intrinsic value other than the prices buyers and sellers establish. While prices are transparent, ownership is not, leading to a utility for nefarious purchases. The potential for systemic risks has caused regulators to crack down on cryptos. The SEC sued Binance and Coinbase for operating as unregulated exchanges. In both civil cases, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler called the crypto industry the "" Wild West ,"" undermining investor trust in the U.S. capital markets. China has banned Bitcoin and other cryptos as it plans to roll out a central bank-issued digital currency. While the potential for systemic risk is low, with the market cap of the entire asset class at $1.122 trillion on June 8, it rose to over $3 trillion in late 2021. The higher the market cap, the more the risk of destabilizing the financial system. While blockchain revolutionizes finance, and many private and public sector financial institutions have embraced the technology, many view cryptocurrency as an unwanted offshoot of blockchain that increases speed, efficiency, and record keeping. Money is power, and governments have rejected innovations that limit or deny their control of the money supply. Governments will likely embrace their digital currencies, but cryptos are another story. The debate will likely continue, with the temperatures rising with Bitcoin's price. The boom-and-bust history suggests that the odds favor another boom period of speculative frenzy. BITO for Bitcoin bulls Bitcoin bulls or speculators looking to participate in the next rally if Bitcoin breaks above the $30,000 level have investment options. The most direct route is through the physical market, which involves holding Bitcoin in a computer wallet or an unregulated exchange with additional risks. The wallet requires a password, which risks hackers stealing the cryptos. The exchanges can go belly-up after a hack, government shutdown, or other reasons. Exchange customers can lose all their cryptos without recourse. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF product ( BITO ) offers two levels of regulatory supervision. BITO's fund summary states: Fund Summary for the BITO ETF (Seeking Alpha) BITO holds futures contracts regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC regulates futures markets. As BITO trades on NYSEARCA as an ETF, the Securities and Exchange Commission offers another regulatory level. While regulators or governments can ban Bitcoin, crushing the price, the ETF will likely go along for the ride if Bitcoin takes off on the upside. Bitcoin nearly doubled from the November 2022 low to the April 2023 high. Chart of the BITO ETF November 2022 low and April 2023 high (Barchart) The chart shows the BITO ETF rose from $9.48 to $18.39 per share, or 94% from late November 2022 through mid-April 2023. BITO did an excellent job tracking Bitcoin's price. At around $15 per share on June 8, BITO had $843.838 million in assets under management. The ETF trades an average of over 7.25 million shares daily and charges a 0.95% management fee. When it comes to Bitcoin, BITO, or any crypto-related investment, only use the capital you are willing to lose, as risk is always a function of the potential reward. In the boom-and-bust cryptocurrency world, the potential for incredible profits comes with the risk of a total loss. Bitcoin and BITO are sleeping in a narrow range, but the price history tells us that another explosive or implosive move is right around the corner.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4610396-bito-etf-offers-regulated-way-to-ride-next-bitcoin-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13631660.jpeg

42393401,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTQoN,1686258739,NFT Inspect Introduces New PFP Discovery Tool for Twitter,"If you've seen a popular non-fungible token (NFT) on Twitter and wondered who else has shared it or who owns it, there's a new tool to help you answer that question.  NFT Inspect, a popular NFT analysis and community tool recently brought back to life, has launched a new Chrome browser extension that provides real-time data on popular NFT collections commonly used as Twitter profile pictures (PFPs).  The Twitter NFT Search tool, which is also available in beta as a web version, allows users to search for different ways an NFT is used on Twitter, either as a profile picture or shared as a tweet. The tool can also analyze individual wallet addresses by crawling through publicly-available blockchain data to determine the usage of any NFT in the wallet. The browser extension can also display rarity traits of individual NFTs.  ""Twitter has emerged as the central communication platform for all things crypto and NFTs, where industry news, project updates and community discussions take place in real-time,"" president of NFT Inspect Oliver Cohen told CoinDesk. ""However, we noticed a lack of comprehensive tools that could harness the power of Twitter and provide users with a complete solution for tracking, analyzing and engaging with the crypto and NFT ecosystem.""  Cohen explained that the tool utilizes ""AI algorithms"" to power its Chrome extension and detect NFT-related content on Twitter. He added that the tool can be used to track the popularity of different NFT collections and the growth of particular communities around an NFT project. ""These insights help users make informed decisions about NFT investments and community engagement.""  The browser extension recognizes NFTs on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains and does not support video or GIF files.  NFT Inspect was resurrected under new ownership in March after announcing its reluctant shutdown in January. Post-acquisition, it has continued to build out its suite of tools to help NFT traders monitor market trends, establishing a community council of notable NFT influencers including waleswoosh, Elanaaeth, wabdoteth and Franklinisbored.

Earlier this week, the SEC filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase, which charged the exchanges with trading crypto asset securities, including SOL.  “The Solana Foundation strongly believes that SOL is not a security,” the Solana Foundation told CoinDesk in a statement. “SOL is the native token to the Solana blockchain, a robust, open-source, community-based software project that relies on decentralized user and developer engagement to expand and evolve.”  At Solana’s Thursday hacker house event in New York City, New York it appeared the Solana community wasn’t overly concerned with the chain’s regulatory nuisances.  “I don’t think any of the developers give a shit,” a developer told CoinDesk at the hacker house on Thursday. “SOL being a security doesn’t really affect anyone building on top of Solana.”  In its Binance.US and Coinbase lawsuits, the SEC also identified tokens issued by foundations and companies or tied to protocols Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Sandbox (SAND), Filecoin (FIL), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Flow (FLOW), Internet Computer (ICP), Near (NEAR), Voyager (VGX), Dash (DASH) and Nexo (NEXO) as securities.

In the last 24 hours, the altcoin attempted a slight 0.2% increase, but the weekly chart showed a 13% depreciation, indicating a strong bearish dominance from a technical standpoint. Both demand and accumulation indicators were negative, despite some buying strength attempting to recover. As Bitcoin surged above the $26,000 mark, many altcoins, including MATIC, are also attempting to move upward on their respective charts. Related Reading: “XRP Very Important,” Top Analyst Predicts Which Tokens Could Profit From The SEC War However, for the altcoin to reverse its price action, it is crucial for Bitcoin to maintain a price above $26,000. Additionally, buying strength needs to enter the market during the immediate trading sessions. MATIC faces an important overhead resistance level that it must surpass in order to experience a significant rally. The decline in MATIC’s market capitalization indicates a low buying strength on the chart. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.77, which is close to its multi-month low of $0.75, recorded 6 months ago. The coin is facing overhead resistance at $0.80, and if it manages to break past that level, it might attempt to reach $0.93. Notably, the coin has formed a descending wedge pattern, which is typically associated with a bullish price reversal. In the event of an upside breakout, MATIC could potentially rally as high as $1.50. However, there is a possibility that the altcoin may find support at the $0.76 level. Failing to remain above this level could result in MATIC trading below the $0.74 price mark. It is worth noting that the amount of MATIC traded in the last session was low, indicating a higher selling strength on the chart. Technical Analysis Following the rejection at the $0.84 resistance level, buyers have lost confidence in MATIC. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits below the half-line and below the 30-mark, indicating that the coin is oversold at the moment. Additionally, the price of the coin has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This suggested low demand and sellers driving the price momentum. However, if MATIC makes an attempt to rise above the $0.84 mark, it could attract renewed demand and bring back the bulls. This would increase the likelihood of a further rally in the price of the asset. Based on the technical indicators, the coin formed sell signals at the current time. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures price momentum and reversals, displayed red histograms associated with sell signals on the chart. This suggests a potential downward movement in price.

42393399,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTQjF,1686254819,Can Binance Survive the SEC's Charges?,"After news broke that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing Binance, the Chief Executive of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), took to a familiar strategy: tweeting. CZ’s first Twitter communiqué was just the number “4,” posted around the same time SEC Chair Gary Gensler was likely cleaning up for the first of several TV interviews.  That might be a head scratcher to most of us. But to many of CZ’s 8 million followers, the tweet was a message, a joke and an attempt at reassurance they’ve heard before.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In CZ’s own words, “4” means ""ignore FUD, fake news, attacks, etc."" FUD is short for fear, uncertainty and doubt – a popular acronym in the cryptocurrency scene. It’s telling that regulatory attacks on crypto have become so common that one of the industry’s most influential players can give a rote response. Further, CZ’s tweet suggested that the firm’s strategy towards regulation will largely stay the same, even now that it is being sued by two of the top U.S. finance watchdogs.  And indeed, that has largely been the case. In the days since the lawsuit was announced (during which the SEC also sued rival U.S.-based exchange Coinbase), Binance has stuck to its long-held talking points: the SEC is wrong for regulating by enforcement; customer funds are and always have been safe; and the exchange’s previous attempts of “coming into compliance” were thwarted by an uncooperative SEC.  “While we take the SEC’s allegations seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis. We intend to defend our platform vigorously,” Binance said.  Of course, some things are different this time around. First, the company named a new “head of regional markets” – the former top regulator in Singapore, Richard Teng – to run the exchange in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and everywhere else it operates except in the U.S. Several crypto strategists have said this was a good public relations move, strategically, as it may have helped the exchange dampen an otherwise deafening blow by the SEC that would have dominated “the discourse.”  See also: Are Centralized Exchanges in the U.S. Doomed? | Opinion  Second, Binance.US, the exchange’s nominally independent U.S. operation, is facing a very live concern about its ability to function, as the SEC has requested to “temporarily restrain” its assets. It’s already mass-delisting tokens, too, likely cutting into trading volumes that weren’t being faked.  And so, the question is whether Binance can continue business as usual, and whether it can really be – in the long term – a going concern.  It’s an odd question, in a way, at least in my limited perspective, given the seriousness of the allegations in the SEC’s suit. Over-and-above the bog-standard “you didn’t get the appropriate license to operate, sir” complaints that Coinbase also faces, Binance and CZ have been accused of endangering customer funds, enabling if not facilitating wash trading on Binance.US, improperly moving customer funds without consent and a host of other issues.  In other words, Binance’s legal troubles are in a category above Coinbase’s. The charges focus not just on the question of whether its listings are unregistered securities, but also around whether it misled customers about how their funds were deployed, and whether it was implicitly encouraging U.S. citizens to trade on a non-U.S.-based platform to which they were not supposed to have access.  Of course, Binance’s reputation was already down. Two months ago, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed suit against the exchange for improper licensure and offering U.S. consumers the wrong financial products. It disclosed some leaked documents and internal conversations that showed Binance to be an almost comically inept company at some times and a cut-throat competitor that put customer funds at risk for the sake of growth at other times.  Experts are now seriously wondering whether Binance will survive as a brand. Here, it’s worth mentioning the worst isn’t even over yet. Binance currently faces two civil lawsuits, but is also under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which could launch a criminal investigation that, if successful, could potentially put a Binance executive or two behind bars. Asked by CoinDesk whether just the SEC’s lawsuit will lead to Binance shutting down, securities lawyer and conceptual artist Brian Frye said “it’s a very real possibility.”  [T]here’s an army of people speaking CZ’s language, willing to 'ignore fake news, uncertainty and doubt.'  If the SEC wins, in a case widely expected to run past Gensler’s tenure, it could levy major fines against the exchange; disable or diminish key parts of Binance’s operation, like labeling its in-house BNB token and subjecting it to strict oversight; and permanently ban CZ from operating his exchange or running a financial firm. And given that the SEC is claiming Binance.US is putting $2.2 billion of presumably U.S.-based clients’ funds “at significant risk,” those funds could be disgorged if they’re found to be connected to illicit activity.  The SEC has pretty wide latitude to ask firms to “cease and desist” certain activities and prevent them from dealing with securities, which would be bad news considering Gensler thinks all cryptocurrencies, bar Bitcoin, are securities. Worse still, as Willkie Farr & Gallagher’s Michael Lewis suggested, it seems like the SEC Enforcement Division agrees with Gensler. In its recent court filings, it has willing to call out all the top 10 tokens except for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) – which spells bad news for any exchange with U.S. customers that wants to offer more than bitcoin for trading.  But, dear reader, you don’t come to The Node just for doom and gloom. Sure, a lot of money has been withdrawn from Binance, but at least at this point it’s clear we’re not dealing with FTX redux, where the money simply wasn’t there. Binance’s auditor may have warned the firm against commingling funds as far back as 2019, but it seems the money was at least kept safe even if mislabelled. Binance has publicly denied mixing customer deposits and company funds, and it’s still unclear exactly what Binance shell companies connected to CZ like Merit Park and Key Vision Development Limited were doing with the funds.  Speaking on the “Unchained” podcast, Tarun Chitra, the CEO of Gauntlet, suggested that outflows have been slow because users globally, like your average hodler in Chile or Abu Dhabi, simply are not concerned about what’s happening with Binance and the U.S. For many, Binance is the most trustworthy option when it comes to crypto exchanges, which is why it has grown to be the largest crypto exchange, and by a longshot. The accusations against the company and its chief executive are gross, but that doesn’t mean you suddenly trust your small-time, domestic crypto exchange any more.  See also: Uniswap DEX Trading Volume Outpaces CEX Coinbase  Does the average crypto user care that Binance used underhanded tactics to attract “Crypto Whales” or that it recommended that high-net worth clients use VPNs to bypass firewalls to trade on the exchange? No, they probably think it’s funny. (And even though the CFTC found evidence that a significant amount of Binance’ revenues were coming from U.S. customers they weren’t supposed to serve, the company still has a massive global user base.)  I’d argue that if the allegations against Binance are true, a boycott would be justified. CZ is accused of personally enriching himself at the expense of his users (at the height of the recent bull market, it was credibly proposed the CZ had become worth more than Elon Musk). But trust in the crypto industry is based on a different metric than elsewhere in finance. If banks used to have to build stolid, cathedral-like headquarters to show prospective clients the institution was there for the long-haul, in crypto, trust is more ephemeral. Binance became big because it had the tokens people wanted to trade and seemed resistant to hacks.  Jake Chervinsky, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, said that there’s a pathway for Coinbase where, even if it loses the SEC suit, it still won’t have to register as a securities exchange. Instead, it would do what it’s been doing since a former Coinbase executive was booked for insider trading, and delist only the tokens proven demonstrably to be securities. It’s a point echoed by Willkie Farr & Gallagher’s Michael Lewis, who said it’s “unlikely that the current situation will result in laws or regulations that effectively ban crypto assets within the U.S.”  Binance, too, may end up delisting tokens cutting into revenues and it might lose its founder/CEO as a figurehead and trusted voice of the exchange (though he’d likely hang around as majority shareholder). The exchange might be forced to institute expensive controls that also sweep out a number of potential users. Binance.US may be doomed (though it seems like no one was using it anyway). It’s within the realm of possibility that the combined fines from the SEC and CFTC bankrupt the firm, and that U.S. Senators like Liz Warren (D.-MA) compel the DOJ to get involved.  In a way, Binance has transcended. If the worst crimes it committed was faking the trading volume of fake internet money, then I think users will forgive it. It all depends, of course. Binance is now a whipping boy for the SEC’s wrath, which in its hubris tried to bring an exchange with no headquarters within the bounds of U.S. law. And it may actually bend the company into following laws it always should have.

13628927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537095,1686254436,"Bitcoin Forms Bullish Butterfly Pattern, Targets $32,000","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, is currently trading sideways after showing signs of recovery in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. Although BTC managed to briefly recover the $27,000 level on Tuesday, it has failed to consolidate above it and is now stuck in a narrow range between $26,300 and $26,600 over the last 24 hours. The question on everyone’s mind now is whether Bitcoin will be able to regain its bullish momentum or if it will test its 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $25,200 once again. Bitcoin Pattern Points To Further Bullish Momentum Bitcoin traders and investors have reason to be optimistic, as the cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish butterfly pattern. According to technical analysis expert Mags, this harmonic reversal pattern is a strong indication of further potential upward movement for Bitcoin. Related Reading: UK Financial Conduct Authority Clamps Down on Crypto Marketing The bullish butterfly pattern is a type of harmonic reversal pattern that is often used by traders to identify potential trend changes in the markets. It is characterized by a series of price movements that form the shape of a butterfly, with a distinct “M” pattern followed by a smaller “W” pattern. The pattern is considered bullish because it suggests that the price of the asset is likely to reverse its previous downward trend and begin moving upward. In Bitcoin’s case, the bullish butterfly pattern is signaling a potential target of around $32,500. This projection is based on the historical price movements of Bitcoin, as well as the shape and structure of the butterfly pattern itself. While no pattern is foolproof, the bullish momentum of Bitcoin in recent months lends further support to this target. However, Bitcoin faces a potential challenge ahead, as it struggles to surpass its nearest resistance level at $27,500 and consolidate above it. If BTC fails to break through this price point, it may be vulnerable to retesting its 200-day Moving Average. This key support level is crucial for BTC’s short-term bullish momentum, and failure to hold above it could lead to further price drops. In such a scenario, the $24,000 and $23,000 marks may become the next trading range for BTC. Currently, the bulls’ threshold in the short term is the 200-day MA, which will need to hold if BTC is to maintain its upward trend. Short-Term BTC Liquidations Favor The Bulls Recent data provided by ‘The King Fisher’ indicates that most Bitcoin liquidations are skewed to the upside, signaling possible upside movements in the near term for BTC. As seen in the chart above, the majority of Bitcoin positions in the past few days have been short positions, with 87% of traders betting on a price decrease, compared to only 12% who are bullish on an upward movement. However, this situation may not favor BTC bears in the long run, as institutional investors historically take advantage of high levels of liquidations, which could lead to what is known as a “short squeeze,” to further fuel a movement in the opposite direction. This dynamic could potentially fuel the bullish momentum that Bitcoin needs to break through its nearest resistance and regain the $30,000 level that was lost in April.

The deal is preliminary, and still requires regulatory approval, according to one source.  Prime Trust had been the subject of some speculation with people online suggesting the firm was facing bankruptcy. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed by the other source.  BitGo declined to comment. Prime Trust did not respond to requests for comment, though the Wall Street Journal reported that a representative confirmed the sale to it.  After the publication of this article, BitGo confirmed in a blog post that it had signed a term sheet to acquire Prime Core Technologies, Prime Trust's parent company.  In a statement, Prime Trust Interim CEO Jor Law called the move ""a significant enhancement for the industry.""  ""No other company will have the breath of product and services nor depth of experience that this combined company would have. We are excited to offer our world-class infrastructure within a broader ecosystem and revolutionize the future of crypto,"" Law said.  BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said the move would position the firm ""to enhance its best-in-class, trusted solutions and to service the combined customer base.""  The need for safekeeping and storage of cryptocurrencies, particularly for institutional customers and high net worth individuals, has driven digital asset custody to prominence, with many flavors on offer and firms commanding high valuations. The issue has also drawn the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has put out proposed rulemaking on custody issues.  Las Vegas-based Prime Trust raised $107 million in funding midway through 2022, before the crypto bear market really began to bite. But the news of late has not been good, with the firm shedding a third of its workforce at the end of January this year and announcing it would cease operations in Texas where the firm was pursuing a money transmitter license.

42393403,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTR3l,1686252103,"Jobs Data Offers Faint Hope for Digital Assets Even as Investors Fret Over Binance, Coinbase Suits","Initial jobless claims spike to highest level since 2021  Bitcoin and ether appear unfazed by SEC activity  Location of activity is shifting however. The supply of bitcoin held and traded in the U.S. is declining. Asian markets are picking up the decreased activity  While crypto investors continued to reel from the Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase, they also had some potentially positive jobs data to savor on Thursday.  Initial jobless claims in the United States rose to 261,000 for the week ended June 3, versus expectations of 235K. The four-week moving average of 237,250 jobless claims was 7,000 higher than the prior week, while the prior week average itself was revised higher.  The spike pushed initial jobless claims to their highest level since October 2021, a sign that a persistently tight labor market may be loosening.  Tight labor markets have been viewed as an obstacle during the U.S. central bank’s quest to slow inflation. Data indicating that labor markets are beginning to weaken would indicate that the FOMC’s course of prescribed measures is yielding favorable results.  Such weakening would increase the likelihood of the U.S. central bank pausing its nearly year-long streak of interest rate hikes, which would probably be positive for asset prices.  According to the CME Fedwatch tool, the probability that interest rates will remain at the current target rate of 5%-5.25% is 71.4%, down from 72.5% a day prior.  With the next interest rate decision coming on Wednesday June 14, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics June 13 release of core inflation for May looms large. Current expectations are that prices increased 0.3% in May. Higher inflation would understandably be bearish for BTC prices, and lower inflation would have the opposite effect.  Fear and greed unmoved  Despite the noise of this week’s SEC announcements, markets still appear to be reacting as though they’ve heard it all before.  The “Fear and Greed” index, incorporates bitcoin price volatility, market momentum, market capitalization, and online queries to produce a measure of market sentiment. A value of 0 indicates “extreme fear,” while a value of 100 indicates “extreme greed”.  The current Fear and Greed index value is 50, a neutral reading, essentially unchanged since May.  The same can’t be said for regional activity  While the lack of price action indicates that investors are unmoved by the SEC’s recent actions, the volume of bitcoin traded within the U.S. has shifted geographically, according to Glassnode data.  The bitcoin supply held or traded within the United States has dropped 11% since mid-2022, with much of the balance shifting to Asian markets.  The SEC’s regulatory stance has likely not altered demand for cryptocurrencies. What appears to be impacted instead is where that demand is satisfied.

13627545,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537081,1686250813,"Stablecoin Market Cap Decreases, But Whales Remain Unfazed: Santiment","According to data from leading crypto analytics firm Santiment, a distinct trend has unfolded in the stablecoin sphere. Even as stablecoins designed to maintain parity with a reserve asset like the US dollar, continue to hold their $1 peg, the combined market capitalization of the top five stablecoins – Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), and TrueUSD (TUSD) – has been experiencing a consistent decrease. Santiment reports earlier today that this downtrend began about 15 months ago, following a peak in March 2022. According to Santiment, Stablecoin market capitalization serves as a reliable indicator of the overall health of the crypto market. An upswing in the market cap signifies an increased buying power to purchase Bitcoin or altcoins in the future, often hinting at a potential market recovery. Conversely, a declining market cap could indicate that Bitcoin and altcoins are being liquidated, suggesting that large holders have been banking profits. Related Reading: Sharks & Whales Accumulate Stablecoins, Why This Could Be Bullish For Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Remain Unshaken Among the stablecoin ecosystems, large holders, colloquially known as ‘whales’ or ‘sharks,’ represent an interesting variable. These entities, which typically hold between $100,000 and $10 million in assets, play a crucial role in market dynamics. Despite the decreasing market cap, Santiment’s analysis reveals that these whales are far from unnerved. Specifically, the analytics firm reports that sharks and whales holding Tether, USD Coin, and Dai currently command over 40%, 37%, and just under 40% of the respective supplies. These holdings are the highest they’ve been since November 2021 or February 2023, suggesting that these whales are merely holding their wealth in stablecoin form, biding their time for an opportune moment to jump back into other more volatile assets. Steady Accumulation Amid Dormant Stablecoin Movements While the collective stablecoin market cap has been dropping, Santiment notes a steady accumulation of assets among whales. This pattern lacks any sudden major moves, which might otherwise signify a potential market bottom in a declining environment. The recent weeks have also seen minimal movement among dormant stablecoins, which could have suggested major buys of Bitcoin or altcoins. Although USD Coin has shown some promising dormant movement at the end of May, the activity falls short of the dormant stablecoins surge witnessed in mid-March, which ignited a notable bull rally. Meanwhile, according to data from DeFillama, the total stablecoin market capitalization currently stands above $120 billion, down by nearly 1% in the past 7 days. Notably, out of all the stablecoins, Tether’s USDT holds the most dominance at 64.57%. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Trend Shifts Alongside Stablecoin Flows: Glassnode The stablecoin currently has a market capitalization above $80 billion while Circle’s USDC Coin ranks second in the stablecoin market with a market cap of $28.7 billion. It is worth noting that as the stablecoin market has decreased steadily, larger crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum may be benefitting from this metric. Over the past 24 hours, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown an uptick up by nearly 1% respectively. This uptrend comes despite the regulatory scrutiny in crypto which has recently affected the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.

42393413,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTRdf,1686250206,Optimism Says Ether Now Treated as Native Cryptocurrency Alongside OP Token,"Optimism, a layer 2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, said its “Bedrock” upgrade has ushered in a new era for how the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) is treated in the ecosystem – as a native token.  Under the new setup, ETH functions natively on the network just like Optimism’s own OP token, according to a representative of the project.  “ETH is now being treated as the native token of both the Ethereum and Optimism networks, rather than as an ERC-20 token,” an OP Labs security engineer who goes by “Maurelian” told CoinDesk over email.  CoinDesk spotted the change in blockchain data – in the form of a transfer of more than $550 million of ETH out of the Optimism Gateway - the bridge crypto users use to move assets between the main Ethereum network and Optimism’s layer 2. It was the second-largest transfer of ETH in the past 14 days, data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows.  The ETH, which belongs to users who had deposited the Ethereum cryptocurrency into Optimism, was transferred out of the bridge into a new smart contract on Optimism.  “The ETH balance of the Optimism bridge was moved to a new address,” according to Maurelian.  The $550 million transfer came on the same day as Optimism’s “Bedrock” upgrade, which included a series of changes ultimately designed, according to project officials, to help morph the layer 2 network into a “Superchain” of interoperable and composable blockchains, all built with Optimism’s OP Stack. The U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase is building its own layer 2 network called Base on Optimism.  The new resting place for the $550 million of ETH is the Optimism Portal, a smart contract responsible for passing messages between the main Ethereum blockchain and Optimism, serving “as both the entry and exit point to the Optimism L2,” according to Optimism’s GitHub page.  The “ETH in the portal represents all of the ETH on OP mainnet,” Optimism’s head of communications, Lynnette Nolan, told CoinDesk.  “With Bedrock, we’ve added a new method of making deposits via the new Optimism Portal contract. This approach treats ETH as a native token, so that an L1 to L2 transaction can have both ETH and data associated with it,” said Maurelian. “To achieve this, we needed to decouple the storage of ETH from the rest of the ERC-20 tokens in our bridge, and move it into the Optimism Portal.”  The Optimism Gateway, which doesn’t hold any ETH now, currently has more than $576 million worth of tokens, including USDC, USDT, WBTC and rETH, according to block explorer Etherscan.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | OP,Sage D.

Dirk Röder, the head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom, was quoted by DL News as saying that “supporting the Polygon network as a validator is a big milestone in this objective”. Polygon not a layer 2? Deutsche Telekom has decided to support the Ethereum ecosystem and its scalability solutions, and Polygon, known as the leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform, aligns with that focus. While Polygon was initially marketed as an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, it has since discontinued that terminology due to concerns about misrepresentation. Polygon is a sidechain, independent from Ethereum for its security, although it commits its transaction history to Ethereum. The company's assets are secured by a multi-signature wallet controlled by a small group of individuals or entities. Deutsche Telekom also runs validators for other major and minor blockchains, including Ethereum, Q, Celo, Flow, and Energy Web. Trad telecom company branches into cool new tech The company's strategy for running validators remains unclear, with Röder highlighting that blockchain technology presents a valid business case and Deutsche Telekom receives percentages of the rewards. However, another representative clarified that the company does not stake its own crypto assets but relies on others to do so while taking a cut of their rewards. While some might speculate that Deutsche Telekom's involvement with blockchains could be a marketing strategy to appeal to a younger user base, overall, Deutsche Telekom's foray into node validation demonstrates its commitment to web3 infrastructure and its interest in the Ethereum ecosystem's scalability solutions.

13626337,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537073,1686247257,"Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Dormant 1,433 BTC Moves After 10+ Years","On-chain data shows a large amount of Bitcoin older than 10 years has suddenly moved today, a sign that could be bearish for the price. Bitcoin Dormant From More Than 10 Years Ago Has Abruptly Moved As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this movement of dormant coins may be a sign of selling. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which tracks the movements that the different age bands are making on the blockchain right now. The “age bands” here refer to groups of coins divided based on the total amount of time that they have been sitting still on the network for. In the context of the current discussion, the 10+ years age band is of interest, which is a cohort that includes all coins that haven’t moved from a single address in more than 10 years. The SOAB metric, when applied for this particular age band, would naturally tell us about the number of coins that investors belonging to this group are transferring at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Contrarians Win As Rebound Occurs Against Crowd Expectations: Santiment Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOAB for the 10+ years age band over the past couple of days: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent hours | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOAB for this specific group has registered a large spike during the past day. In total, this surge in the metric has corresponded to around 1,433 BTC moving across wallets on the network. The general cohort for all investors that have been holding their coins since more than 155 days ago is called the “long-term holder (LTH) group.” Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. Due to this reason, the LTHs are considered the resolute hands of the market. As the movement in question is coming from an investor who had been holding for more than 10+ years, the holder would have been one of the oldest ones among even these LTHs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Loss Remains Low Despite Volatility, What Does This Mean? Such old supply, however, is usually considered to have been lost due to wallet seed phrases becoming inaccessible. This means that there is a big chance that the wallet activation today may have come because of a user rediscovering a previously lost wallet. While movements from the LTHs are usually a bad sign for the market, as they show that even the diamond hands may have lost their belief in Bitcoin, this latest transaction wouldn’t be reflective of the general sentiment, considering the special circumstances around it if it’s truly coming from a lost address that has now been recovered. Nonetheless, the transfer is still a probable sign that the coins are being moved around for selling-related purposes, so it’s possible that the asset may face some bearish impact from the move.

The company launched a public beta version of its NFT platform in November. Initially, it offered support for a curated selection of 70 NFT collections on Ethereum and Solana.  As part of its public launch, the platform has pledged to include not only blue-chip projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, but also more affordable collections that can be bought for under $100.

13625155,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537010,1686243603,Cardano Price Threatens Multi-Month Low Unless Bulls Defend This Support,"The Cardano (ADA) price experienced a decline, breaking below the $0.33 level. This downward movement has resulted in bears gaining control of the market. ADA has lost around 4% of its value in the past 24 hours and has seen a weekly plunge of approximately 10%. The technical outlook for ADA indicates a bearish intent for the altcoin. Demand and accumulation have significantly decreased on the chart, reflecting a lack of buying interest. The overall market sentiment has remained negative, with Bitcoin also exhibiting volatility. Most other altcoins have followed a similar downward trend. For ADA to initiate a recovery, it would require renewed buying interest in the upcoming trading sessions. Otherwise, there is a possibility that ADA may reach a multi-month low. The recent news of the SEC suing Coinbase and Binance US has had a notable impact on market sentiment, fueling further selling pressure. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breaks Below This Formation: Signals Potential Further Losses The overhead resistance for ADA is crucial, and breaching that level would be necessary for the altcoin to revive its price. The decline in the market capitalization of ADA suggests that sellers are dominating the market currently. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.32. In recent trading sessions, ADA broke below the long-standing support line at $0.33, suggesting a potential continuation of the downtrend. The key overhead resistance at $0.33 becomes important for ADA to regain bullish momentum and surpass $0.38. However, if ADA fails to sustain its current price level, there is a possibility of a further decline below $0.30, potentially revisiting its March low of $0.29. The trading volume for ADA in the last session is already lower, indicating weaker buying strength in the market. Technical Analysis As ADA broke below the crucial $0.33 support line, buyers’ confidence diminished, leading the coin to hover around the oversold zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the half-line and near the 30-mark, indicating nearly oversold conditions. If sellers exert further pressure, ADA may enter the oversold territory. Additionally, ADA is trading below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that sellers are driving the price momentum in the market. In alignment with other bearish indicators, ADA formed sell signals on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a momentum indicator, displayed red histograms that are associated with sell signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Must Uphold This Critical Support Line For Potential 8% Rally This suggests a weakening bullish momentum. The Bollinger Bands, which measure volatility, have diverged significantly. This indicates the potential for price fluctuations and increased volatility in the upcoming trading sessions.

13624065,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537011,1686240337,"Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Herald Higher Volatility, What’s Next For BTC?","The Bitcoin price has shown a strong reaction after the lawsuits filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase, which may have surprised many. Generally, rising prices on negative news are a strong indication that the sell side is losing steam and a bottom is near. In the case of the Bitcoin price, however, there are still some anxieties hovering over the market at the moment that could mean another, possibly final, drop to the downside. For example, it is still not clear whether the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will also take legal action against Binance and what impact this will have on Binance’s international business. Bullish Arguments Are Growing For Bitcoin Nevertheless, the bullish signals are mounting. As Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann write in their latest analysis, Bitcoin’s Bollinger bands pretty much reflect the current state. On the 1-day chart, BTC price remains within the accumulation zone, between the lower band and the 20-day moving average. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Reportedly Trading At a $2k Premium on Binance.US “Which suggests that this is still a good entry point,” the co-founders of the leading on-chain analysis service say. At the same time, with reference to the chart below, the analysts warn that traders should be aware of widening bands that could herald impending higher volatility that could lead to abrupt moves. Looking at Bitcoin’s open interest, Allemann and Happel state that despite the strong reaction to the bad news, there is no clear direction for now: We believe that the price will continue to consolidate alongside open interest until we approach the FOMC and the market begins to position for the expected output. Remarkably, next week’s Fed meeting – on June 13-14 – will be the first in years without a clear consensus on the rate decision. Since the Fed started raising rates, there has been a clear consensus at every meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, futures show a 30% chance that rates will be raised and a 70% chance that they will not. The lack of clarity is also likely to lead to more volatility in the BTC price ahead of the decision. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests Moving Average That Marked All Major Market Bottoms BTC recently retested the 200-week moving average (MA) at $25,306, but supply liquidity was somewhat thin here. In addition, if price goes down again, a retest of the 50-month MA at $25,898 would be very interesting, where liquidity and sentiment seem to be stronger. It is worth noting that BTC has already formed a double bottom at the 50-month MA. A triple bottom would be bullish. On the other hand, a loss of the 200-month MA would open the way to bearadise. In this respect, a few very important days await BTC in the coming week(s). A defense of the aforementioned price levels is of utmost importance. If defended, a journey to bull paradise could be next, but bulls need to turn the tables on the lower time frames.

42393398,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTQe7,1686240042,Ethereum Developers Cement Final Lineup of Changes in ‘Dencun’ Upgrade,"Ethereum developers agreed Thursday on the full scope of the network's upcoming upgrade, called “Dencun.”  The upgrade, also known as a hard fork, expected later this year, includes five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that designed to add more storage for data and reduce fees.  At the heart of this upgrade is EIP-4844, more commonly known as proto-danksharding. This feature will scale the blockchain by making more space for “blobs” of data, which then is expected to decrease gas fees for layer 2 rollups.  The other EIPs that made the cut are:  EIP-1153 - to reduce fees for storing data on-chain, and therefore improve blockspace.  EIP-4788 - to improve designs for bridges and staking pools.  EIP-5656 - to add minor code changes related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  EIP-6780 - to get rid of code that could terminate smart contracts.  “We also will not add anything else to the fork,” said Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, during the All Core Developers Execution Layer 163 call.  There's no exact date for when the hard fork will happen, but it's supposed to go live by the end of 2023.  Dencun includes simultaneous upgrades happening on the two sides of the blockchain. The “Cancun” upgrade will happen on the execution layer, where all protocol rules reside, while the consensus layer, which makes sure that blocks are validated, will go through its own fork known as “Deneb.” The name “Dencun” is a portmanteau of the names of the simultaneous upgrades.  Now that developers have an idea of the full scope of Dencun, more rigorous testing of the upgrade can commence.

Gensler and Binance With Gary Gensler causing panic and mayhem in the crypto markets as he serves Binance and Coinbase with notice to sue them for alleged misdemeanours such as listing securities and failing to register with the SEC, it comes as quite some surprise to learn that he may have offered his services as an advisor to Binance four years earlier. It was reported by CNBC that Gensler had a series of conversations with Binance officials and CEO Changpeng Zhao himself in March of that year. It was alleged by Binance lawyers that Gensler was perfectly happy with discussing the role of an informal advisor for the crypto exchange. Gensler lauds Algorand This was at a time when Gensler was teaching a blockchain course as a professor at MIT. Gensler appeared to be quite unperturbed with the crypto industry back then, and is on record as saying that most cryptocurrencies are not securities and lauded the technology of Algorand and its founder Silvio Micali, calling it “great technology”. Four years later, Gensler, now the chairman of the SEC, includes $ALGO, the native token of Algorand, as one of several “securities” that both Binance and Coinbase list on their exchanges. Given the alleged ties between Gensler, Zhao, and Binance, lawyers acting for Binance say that “they’d asked for his recusal from any actions regarding the company. They say they got no acknowledgement from SEC staff.” A 180 degree change of mind Gensler’s about face on crypto obviously happened once he landed the job as SEC chairman, and it does appear a little odd that he would have such a complete change of mind on the sector. It probably can’t be argued that Gensler was a novice in financial affairs when he was said to be having discussions with Binance. By that time he had spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs as Head of Finance, had served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets for the US Treasury, and had completed a stint as Chairman of the CFTC. When Gensler levied all of the highly public enforcement actions against some of the most compliant companies in the crypto space, such as Kraken, Paxos, and Coinbase, he must have been fully aware of the consequences of such actions for the crypto market and for all the retail investors in these markets. Tasked with bringing crypto down? The actions of the SEC chairman do appear to be designed to cause the maximum turbulence and damage to the crypto industry and must have caused investors to lose some part of their invested funds. Has Gensler been tasked with destroying the crypto industry in the US? Is this the plan of the Biden Administration? With the crypto industry perhaps being seen as a threat to the US banking system, this might well be a plausible assumption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

These tokens’ price fluctuations persist in a negative direction, leaving investors hoping for a potential rebound soon. In contrast, the Uwerx presale generates increasing excitement as it maintains an upward trend. This cryptocurrency project aims to make a remarkable contribution to the freelance economy, attracting bullish sentiment from investors. Here’s what’s happening in these crypto projects recently. ApeCoin (APE) Is Fueling the Next Metaverse Evolution Launched by Yuga Labs in March 2022, ApeCoin (APE) is the backbone for incentivizing and powering activities within the ApeCoin network. Notably, ApeCoin (APE) has emerged as the leading metaverse token in terms of market capitalization. A key milestone for ApeCoin (APE) has been the introduction of staking, enabling users to lock a portion of their ApeCoin (APE) holdings and participate in transaction validation. With its attractive features, ApeCoin (APE) has garnered significant popularity. Users benefit from low transaction fees, ensuring cost-effective transactions. The network also offers instant transaction processing, enhancing the overall user experience. Moreover, ApeCoin (APE) seamlessly integrates with popular gaming platforms, further driving its appeal in the metaverse space. As the metaverse continues to evolve and gain traction, ApeCoin (APE) stands out as a prominent player, fueling the virtual ecosystem and offering a range of benefits to its users. However, ApeCoin (APE) has steadily declined over the last 30 days. As of writing, ApeCoin(APE) is up by 1.5%. However, it is down by 14% in the last 30 days, with its 24-hour trading volume decreasing by 16.86%. MASK Network (MASK): Powering The Revolution of Social Apps MASK Network (MASK) is an encrypted social messaging platform enabling secure crypto transactions and file-sharing. Its native token, $MASK, facilitates crypto transfers, grants access to platform features, and allows participation in community voting. Recently, MASK Network (MASK) has been in the news. MASK Network (MASK) recently revealed its 3rd Web3 Social Grant round, collaborating with Gitcoin and offering a $50k matching pool. They have also sponsored Decentralized Social Afternoons to foster a vibrant community. In addition, MASK Network (MASK) invested in Telegram's TON, aiming to provide innovative solutions to a broad user base. Furthermore, they received 257,540 ARB tokens from Arbitrum, distributing them to incentivize active community members and support the Mask DAO treasury. However, MASK Network’s (MASK) price has recently declined. The token is down by 2% as of writing. Its 24-hour trading volume has also slumped by 14.83%. Uwerx (WERX) Presale Continues to Surge Uwerx, an innovative cryptocurrency platform for freelancers and clients, is gaining traction with its exciting services and 1% flat fee. Having already secured audit approval from SolidProof and InterFi, Uwerx is currently in its stage 5 presale, moving past stage 1 to 4 within a few weeks while selling millions of WERX tokens. As a result of the rapid success of Uwerx's presale, the Uwerx team adjusted its token allocation, with the presale getting a boosted 57% (427.5 million WERX tokens) of the 700 million total token supply. The team has also announced that the stage 5 presale is set to go live soon. Furthermore, the native token, WERX, is currently priced at $0.041, experiencing significant growth from its starting price of $0.005. Industry experts are highly optimistic about the future of the Uwerx token, predicting it to surpass $3 by Q1 2024. However, Uwerx is achieving more success in other areas of the project. Excitingly, the anticipated Alpha Version of the platform has been launched, featuring the landing page and sign-in/sign-up pages. Additional features such as login, user dashboard, job posting, job search, and more will continue to be rolled out weekly/bi-weekly. Transition to the Beta version will follow soon, allowing users to test the new platform. Users can provide valuable feedback by emailing feedback@uwerx.network. Uwerx has also introduced a new feature called the Uwerx Vault, enabling users to stake their tokens for a preferred duration and earn rewards.

42393418,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTS8R,1686237797,ConsenSys Faces Shareholder Vote Over Controversial Transfer of Company Assets,"For the past three years, one of the most important companies in crypto, ConsenSys, has been engaged in a slow and brutal battle whose outcome could determine its very survival. Following a series of Swiss court rulings, ConsenSys today held its first shareholder vote in two years, which may result in the company taking a stomach-churning leap toward the abyss.  At the heart of this years-long conflict are claims that Brooklyn-based ConsenSys, which develops products on Ethereum, executed a series of corporate maneuvers to transfer the company’s core assets – products like Infura, PegaSys, Codefi and MetaMask, as well as a number of foreign subsidiaries – out of the original Swiss incarnation of the company and into a new American company formed in 2020. This resulted in former ConsenSys employees, who had been granted equity as part of their employment agreements, losing much of the value of their shares, those former employees say.  Ashley Rindsberg, a reporter based in London, is the author of ""The Gray Lady Winked,"" an investigation of The New York Times.  These former employees have been engaged in a protracted legal battle with ConsenSys that, according to legal experts contacted by CoinDesk, seems to have tipped in their favor. A spate of recent rulings by courts in Switzerland (where ConsenSys was originally incorporated as an “AG” or limited company) have given the case by the 35 former employees fresh momentum.  “This is not just some ‘prior employee getting fu&^ed over’ kind of thing,” said Gabriel Tumlos, one of the 35 former employees who is part of the legal action. “The thing that keeps me going is that at the core of all this is the blockchain story. If this were a DAO or something on-chain, this kind of shadow accounting, the legal arbitrage that companies always do to people, would not have happened.”  The former employees’ action against ConsenSys has proceeded through a number of court cases, including a request for an independent Swiss audit of the transfer of assets from the original to the new company, and a separate case to force a shareholder vote on the transfer of ConsenSys assets. Swiss courts ruled that both requests should be complied with.  Last November, a Cantonal Court in Zug ruled in favor of the former employees’ request for a shareholder vote on the transfer of assets, known as a Sale and Contribution Agreement, which the company appealed. This May, the company acquiesced to the request by the former employees for a retroactive shareholder vote on the 2020 transfer of assets to the new company. The key resolution is a motion to approve action by the Swiss company against the new American company on the basis that the transfer of assets was illegitimate.  Although the official results of the meeting, which took place today in Zurich, won’t be known until later this week, the outcome is a foregone conclusion: Joe Lubin, the company’s founder and majority shareholder, will vote to reject the proposal that the transfer of assets should be unwound, a move that would effectively liquidate the company. Despite this, the vote will allow the former employees to litigate that decision itself in a new legal proceeding.  But the shareholder vote is not the only case in play. In January, the High Court of Zug ruled in favor of the former employees’ request for an independent Swiss audit, a ruling that does not allow for the possibility of further appeal. With a Swiss auditor investigating, the truth will out – and likely very soon.  Read more: ConsenSys AG Shareholders Readying Legal Action Over Share Valuation  ConsenSys vigorously disputes these claims. “ConsenSys AG (Mesh) is aware of a small group of former employees behind certain legal actions in Switzerland,” it said in an email.  “Mesh refutes the allegations underlying the legal actions as well as those contained in the factually inaccurate press releases that were self-authored by one of the former employees. Mesh looks forward to prevailing on the merits and refuting the allegations in Swiss courts.”  The company’s current troubles began with COVID. In 2019, ConsenSys founder and largest shareholder Joe Lubin went out to raise ConsenSys’ first round of VC funding, targeting $200 million. As part of the effort, Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, delivered a keynote at SXSW, in Austin, where he would declare his mission “to build and fix things essentially on a new trust infrastructure.” But despite that roadshow, COVID jammed a spoke in the company’s fundraising wheel. With crypto plunging into winter, and putting the broader economy in deep freeze, options were quickly leaving the table.  At that time, ConsenSys had a payroll of around 1,300 employees and an attic filled with acquisitions, including an asteroid mining company, a dating app, a music company, an NFT endeavor – and a burn that a company pitch deck projected at $100 million for 2019. The only option left was to take investment from one of the few investors willing and able to put substantial money into the company at that moment. It so happens that company was JP Morgan, hardly a bastion of the decentralization Lubin has long touted.  This, at least, is the more or less official version of events. Lubin, who has a supermajority stake in the company (he can outvote the combined votes of all other shareholders), did what he had to do for the survival of the company. And, indeed, there is little about this version that would inspire a years-long legal battle. But the reality is more complex.  To execute the deal with JP Morgan, ConsenSys crafted a plan called Project NorthStar, designed in concert with the Swiss office of consulting giant PwC. Project NorthStar would call for the creation of a new Delaware C-corp called ConsenSys Software Inc (CSI) and the transfer of all major assets from the original Swiss company, ConsenSys AG (CAG), into the new entity. To determine the share of the new company that the original company would be awarded, ConsenSys had to arrive at a valuation of its core assets, which at the time consisted of Infura, Pegasus, Codefi, a 50% stake in Truffle and MetaMask, along with the company’s subsidiaries in Australia, France, the U.K., Hong Kong, Ireland, and the U.S.  To value the assets, PwC produced what the consulting firm called a “Valuation Report.” The number it arrived at was $46.6 million – total. That sum may sound strangely low, especially considering that these products, identified repeatedly in Swiss court documents as the company’s “crown jewels,” are considered fundamental to the Ethereum ecosystem. But, for the former employees pursuing legal action, this low valuation was key to the design of Project NorthStar.  “What they hired PwC to do was to perform evaluation for a very specific purpose,” said Tumlos, a former CPA specializing in audits, who argued that the kind of evaluation PwC performed is generally used for tax reporting. “The way that we [former shareholders] have understood it is that the goal of any kind of tax evaluation is to minimize your tax liability. That's why you hire the tax specialist.”  As the report made clear, ConsenSys provided all of the data used for the evaluation, and no independent audit or assessment was performed by PwC. As the report states in its “Disclaimer” section: “PwC has not conducted any audit or due diligence. PwC has not independently verified any of the information received from ConsenSys AG or publicly available and has relied on it as being complete and accurate.”  While a Swiss court ruling rejected the former employees’ claim that the PwC report was specifically a tax evaluation, it nevertheless found that the resulting valuation of ConsenSys’ core assets “is not comprehensible.” The High Court for Canton Zug noted that just 14 months after the asset transfer, the new U.S.-based company was valued at $3 billion, 64 times more than the value of the assets PwC had produced. Less than a year after that, in spring 2022, the value of ConsenSys Software Inc. reached $7 billion – 150 times the PwC valuation on the basis of the same core assets.  According to the former employees, ConsenSys refused to provide former employee shareholders with the data or instructions given to PwC to produce the report, leading the court to surmise that “the impression that PwC had been provided with ‘embellished’ data cannot be entirely dismissed…” The High Court for Canton Zug noted that “even the [Swiss] Federal Tax Administration (FTA) could not readily comprehend the appropriateness of the set purchase price of USD 46.4 million on the basis of the PwC valuation report.”  Whatever the valuation should have been for the assets, the question remains whether the deal was appropriate to begin with. With its specifics abstracted, the picture we have is of the CEO and controlling shareholder of a company creating a second company, of which he would similarly be CEO and controlling shareholder, and transferring assets from company A to company B.  “The problem here is there was no shareholder meeting, and there's no clear approval from the shareholders,” said Jiaying Jiang, assistant professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law, where she focuses on blockchain and crypto law. “And there's definitely a conflict of interest when the transaction happened because Lubin was a shareholder and may have been a director of both companies at that time.”  Just 14 months after the asset transfer, the new U.S.-based company was valued at $3 billion, 64 times more  The specifics of the deal complicated matters further. Lubin justified his 52.5% stake in CSI by transferring a $39.1 million loan he’d made to CAG, the first company, as a liability on the books of the newly created U.S. company. This debt transfer would be used to justify the transfer of assets from the original Swiss company in exchange for just 10% of the new company – whose worth consisted solely of the assets transferred.  According to former employees, what ConsenSys calls a “loan” was, in reality, Lubin’s personal investment in the company he’d made over the years. “Lubin considered all of the money that he put into Consensus AG – and this was unbeknownst to anyone actually involved – he was writing everything down as debt,” said Arthur Falls, an early ConsenSys employee and representative of the former employees pursuing legal action against the company.  Swiss law stipulates that if one shareholder loans money to a company, all shareholders must be informed and must be given the opportunity to do the same. According to legal filings by the former employee shareholders, that didn’t happen.  Against this background, the Swiss court found that the motivation for the almost absurdly low valuation is not hard to discern: “The lower the purchase object [the assets] was valued, the higher the value of the assigned loan receivable of nominally USD 39.1 million, which was finally offset, and the higher the personal (direct) participation of Joseph Lubin compared to the participation of [ConsenSys AG] and that of JP Morgan.”  Read more: ConsenSys AG Shareholders File for Independent Audit of MetaMask, Infura Transaction  “The basic problem was that the former employees were not represented in the board of directors of ConsenSys AG,” said Rico Florin, a lawyer at Swiss firm Alpine Capital, which has a crypto practice.  “According to Swiss company law, business decisions are taken by the board of directors (and not by the shareholder meeting). Therefore, the former employees had basically no access to the documents about this major deal. The court came especially to the conclusion that Joseph Lubin was in a conflict of interest in connection with this agreement and that he didn’t take the necessary steps in such a situation as e.g. the valuation by PwC doesn’t meet the requirements of a fairness opinion.”  Lubin did not reply separately to a request for an interview. Consensys AG, now called Mesh, provided a statement responding to allegations made by the former employees.  According to the company, “With regards to the ConsenSys Software Inc. (CSI) transaction, the spin out was conducted properly, with the close involvement of globally renowned law firms and an independent valuation by PwC. Although the business fundamentals and operating environment are entirely different today than at the time of the transaction, which occurred during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the group would like to apply a retrospective valuation with the benefit of hindsight, which is not how valuations work.”  Lubin decided to denominate his loans to the company in ether, another issue for the ex-employees leading the case. This meant that, as ConsenSys employees built out the Ethereum ecosystem, with the eventual effect of driving up the price of ETH, the value of Lubin’s loan increased.  The decision would lead ConsenSys AG to claim in court filings that Lubin had in fact waived loans to the company worth a staggering $330 million, the approximate figure cited in company financial statements seen by CoinDesk as debt issued by ConsenSys.  According to the court filing, the $330 million figure was calculated according to the price of ETH in December 2020, four months after the transfer of assets had been completed. The ETH-denominated loan put the company in a bizarre logical loop in which the more it succeeded, the greater its debt grew – a debt owed to its founder and largest shareholder. To have any hope of repaying the debt, ConsenSys would have to grow faster than the underlying currency its business was built on.  As it happened, JP Morgan would invest no money in ConsenSys (old or new) despite the fraught corporate maneuvering. Its main contribution was the transfer of Quorum, an enterprise targeted version of Ethereum similar to PegaSys, a product ConsenSys had already built. Nevertheless, JP Morgan received 10% of the new company. Lubin would wind up with a 52.5% stake in the new company, in addition to his 70% stake in the original Swiss company. In the subsequent months, ConsenSys Software Inc would raise a total of $715 million from companies including SoftBank, Microsoft, HSBC and UBS and Mastercard, a fact that the former employees also take issue with.  “The most important assets that are at the core of the Ethereum ecosystem have now somehow been sold to the banks,” said Tumlos. “And, look, I'm not like some kind of idealist. Banks have a place in our future. They do a very specific thing that's valuable. But we are still in a fight of how do we rebalance the future of our financial ecosystem for the better of all? And something was done here that goes against the ethos, I think, of what we're fighting for.”  This, too, is disputed by ConsenSys, which points to its longevity and the centrality of its products to the Ethereum ecosystem as evidence of its dedication to crypto ideals.  “Mesh is proud of its history of spinning out projects and its unwavering support and commitment to the broader crypto ecosystem. It is grateful that, despite market downturns and many other challenges, dozens of Mesh projects continue to have stellar success. It will continue on its mission, including defending against such legal actions and public attacks,” the company said in a statement.  Former employees of ConsenSys, some of whom had helped build the company’s core products, in many cases devoting years to the business, would end up with a fraction of the value of their former stake in the company. “I feel that as a shareholder, there has been material harm,” said one early former employee who wishes to remain anonymous. “And, to this date, it hasn't really been acknowledged. Prior to us getting some momentum in Swiss courts, they wouldn't even talk to us.”  With the ruling of subsequent Swiss courts coming down in favor of the former employees, this does not bode well for ConsenSys. And, in light of a striking lack of information surrounding the transfer of assets, nor does the pending Swiss audit.  It might be another instance of painful irony that the propriety of actions concerning one of the most important forces in crypto, a champion of decentralization and trustless protocols, will be adjudicated by the most centralized of all bodies: a government court. But disruptive innovation is rarely clean and pretty.

42393411,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTRYX,1686237583,"When AI and Blockchain Merge, Expect the Mundane at First","Everybody wants to know how blockchain and generative-AI technologies will come together, so allow me to speculate.  From family dinners to weekend afternoons, I’ve spent a lot of time in the last six months playing around with generative-AI tools and thinking about how they will change “everything.” I’m more and more certain that they will have an impact, but it won’t be as enormous or as fast as some might think, particularly in the enterprise.  Let me start with all the reasons why generative AI is going to take a while to really achieve scale in enterprise business processes and have a measurable impact on productivity.. First and foremost, enterprises achieve scale by implementing process controls and then automating systems. From inventory management to hiring, the key to scaling enterprise systems is the ability to move people’s work efforts from individual transactions or activities to management of end-to-end processes.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Take something simple like stocking a grocery store with food. Enterprise systems and retail point-of-sale (POS) systems have been carefully integrated over the years to automatically reorder out-of-stock items and, much more importantly, forecast and plan systematically to avoid ever being out of stock.  Generative-AI systems, by contrast, are not good at rigorously and consistently executing the same task over and over again with high precision. Ask a generative-AI system similar but not identical questions and you may get wildly different answers. This kind of variance breaks business processes built on input consistency.  Generative-AI systems are terrific at coming up with new ideas, and doing so at enormous speed, but business transformation is largely about change management – both people and systems. Enterprise ecosystems tend to transform at about the same rate as the slowest components in the ecosystem, not the fastest ones.  A great example of this comes from the early era of web commerce. It was quickly possible to build web-based store fronts and accept credit-card payments. However, shipping and packaging was built and optimized for a world of pallet-sized deliveries to shops. To the extent that companies even had digital catalogs, they didn’t have pictures of products. No supervisor of a grocery store needs to know what a can of soup looks like. They already know. They’re in the store every day. As a result, e-commerce took off much more slowly than analysts expected, held back not by the web, but by warehouses and logistics systems.  Like e-commerce, generative-AI systems will infiltrate enterprise systems alongside blockchain technology and they will eventually work very well together, but the progress will be driven by careful design and integration, not rapid, wholesale adoption. While consumers are often capable of adopting new technologies broadly in about a decade, it typically takes enterprise about 25 years and we should probably expect the same with generative AI and its integration with blockchain technology.  A look on the bright side  Having gotten the bad news out of the way, let me focus on the areas where we will see the most dramatic impact of how these two technologies will work together. I’ve identified four that might come sooner rather than later.  Software development  Enterprise business processes are run on software, and generative AI systems are exceptionally good at software development. It is one of the few areas where we have strong, documented evidence that generative AI systems significantly improve productivity. Since integrating blockchains into enterprise processes is very much a matter of both process and software integration, the likely impact will be significant and felt soonest.  Analytics  Blockchains do an amazing job of improving data quality. When you think about products, services, and systems that move between enterprises, one of the biggest casualties of inter-company work is data quality. In a world of silos, data is re-entered in each enterprise ecosystem. On a blockchain, tokens and hashes represent assets and data and can maintain their integrity as they move through an ecosystem. With better-quality data, expect generative-AI systems to do even better analysis.  It will also work the other way around: generative-AI systems are terrific at matching and interpreting patterns. They will become foundational to the business of blockchain analytics in a very short order, helping identify trends and classifying individual transactions.  Generative AI-training data  One of the biggest emerging problems for AI systems is how to find trustworthy source data. We’re in the early stages of an exa-flood of AI-generated content. Much of it will be banal, generic and mediocre. How will we know what is an authoritative, expert view on a topic or a machine-generated pattern based on other machine-generated patterns? By verifying authenticity and origin of source data using blockchain hashes.  The ANSA news agency in Italy already notarizes nearly 1 million articles a year using EY’s OpsChain system. This was intended to combat fake news, but in the future, tools like this may be critical for authenticating the sources of AI-training data.  User interfaces  In the same way that generative-AI systems are great at writing code, they are also good at interpreting error messages, problems and suggesting solutions. Blockchain usage is still too complex and conversational interfaces that are able to accept error messages, search for, and format suggestions and work as a “co-pilot” in a process are likely to be enormously helpful to users.  In the early days as new technologies evolve and interact, the results tend to be both boring and predictable, much as I have described above. We saw this with GPS and Web commerce and mobile phones. At first, we had an e-commerce experience that was little more than a paper catalog on a screen. Eventually, we ended up with push-ads coming to us in a ride-sharing vehicle proposing to have food delivered to us at our destination.  And so it will be here, as blockchain and AI start to evolve and converge together. We’re in the boring phase, but just wait until things get weird and wildly unpredictable. Because they will.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/08/when-ai-and-blockchain-merge-expect-the-mundane-at-first,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/026e756f36719a25d6e48b23218fd4099dfa6b15-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If passed, the regulations would clamp down on misleading hype and unrealistic promises, requiring more transparency and balanced information. According to a release by the FCA, the new rules, which will apply to first-time investors in the UK willing to purchase crypto assets, will require companies to introduce a cooling-off period from October 8, 2023. The FCA has also opened consultations regarding the matter until the 10th of August. New Rules For Firms Promoting Crypto Products Or Services Essentially, the FCA wants to treat cryptocurrencies as high-risk investments as part of its post-Brexit financial strategy revealed in February. In 2022 alone, the FCA forced firms to rectify 8,582 misleading promotions. The regulator is concerned that crypto newbies don’t fully understand the risks of these volatile, unregulated assets. With the value of major cryptocurrencies fluctuating wildly, those promoting crypto must also put in place clear risk warnings and ensure adverts are clear, fair, and not misleading. Related Reading: Not Immune To FUD? Binance Sees $1.5 Billion In Outflows In 24 Hours According to the announcement, firms promoting crypto products or services will need to include a clear risk warning such as: ‘Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Take 2 mins to learn more.’ A comprehensive set of guideline consultations will be published, and it will clarify the rules that companies must follow to make sure that advertisements regarding cryptocurrencies are not misleading. In addition, promotions that appear to attract crypto investors, such as ‘refer a friend’ programs, would no longer be allowed.

The company was already expected to report weak second-quarter 2023 trading volumes before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the crypto exchange on Tuesday, the report said.  This weakness may now persist and intensify “due to the overhang that the lawsuit has created,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote. ""The upshot is that we view COIN shares as uninvestable in the near term.""  The bank maintained its hold rating on the stock, and slashed its price target to $39 from $55. Coinbase shares were trading 2.4% higher at $54.47 at time of publication.  “Given the potentially significant impact of the lawsuit’s outcome on Coinbase’s U.S. operations, we would expect some investors to reduce their exposure to its platform,” the note said.  Berenberg says that more uncertainty was created by a task force of 10 U.S. states that alleges the exchange’s staking rewards program violates state securities laws. That only adds to the extent of the negative overhang on the company’s share price, the bank said.  The SEC’s desired remedy would probably require the complete closure of Coinbase’s core business in the U.S., and this will also weigh on the shares, the report added.

42393438,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhXYLx,1686235743,Metaverse and Its Inroad into Financial Markets,"The content of CoinDesk Indices; not affiliated with CoinDesk editorial.  By Reza Akhlaghi, Senior Content Marketing Manager, CoinDesk Indices  Today, the term metaverse has come to represent a range of new technologies that are associated with, but not limited to, the emergence of Web3, blockchain protocols, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, and virtual ownership of assets. The metaverse is one of the defining characteristics of Web3. The latter is the evolution of Web1 (read-only internet) and Web2 (read and write internet) into its current read, write, and own internet that leverages user generated content and blockchain technology.  The metaverse epitomizes new, decentralized, and immersive social settings and experiences that utilize avatars, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. It offers a whole new set of social relationships with hitherto unimaginable opportunities. So, the question many ask is how did the metaverse become part of the digital asset taxonomy and carve itself a place in the financial markets?  Futuristic yet in the present  The metaverse can be broadly defined as a blockchain-fueled, all-encompassing virtual world that offers new human and socio-cultural experiences. The term comes from the 1992 science fiction book “Snow Crash” by Neal Stephenson, who is currently the chairman of Lamina1, a metaverse-focused blockchain. In the book, Stephenson offers characters who immerse themselves in virtual social settings to escape from a dystopian reality. Fast forward three decades, and Stephenson’s fiction has in many ways become fact.  Using real-time interactivity, augmented and virtual reality, as well as tools that represent ownership of virtual assets, the metaverse creates a digital simulation of life as we know it. It is a radical departure from the single-platform business models that store value in their walled gardens to the one in which open platforms allow participants to profit from user-generated value with an economic stake in their online existence.  Centralized vs. decentralized metaverse  The metaverse represents the blend of the physical world and the virtual, with assets owned within a decentralized structure and value distributed among participants through decentralized payment systems, cryptocurrencies and governance tokens. But is every metaverse built on a decentralized structure? The answer is no—not all of them.  A centralized metaverse is one in which the activities of participants, their interactions with others and their ability to engage in business activity are set by the choices made and the rules set by the platform’s owners. The content created by the community of users is the property of the entity that owns the platform. They are not free to own any pieces of the digital world, and their privacy is handled by the platform owners.  In a decentralized metaverse, however, participants or inhabitants are unencumbered by the many restrictions that exist in a centralized metaverse. This includes the creation of immersive experiences, ownership of the content they create and the freedom to conduct business activity in the form and manner of their choosing across dispersed networks. Participants also bear the responsibility to protect their privacy. So, three factors play a dominant role in determining the decentralized nature of a metaverse: distributed networks, permissionless participation and decentralized ownership.  A brief look at metaverse tokenomics  A driving force behind the emergence of the metaverse in the digital asset universe is the use of metaverse crypto tokens for participation in the metaverse economy. The tokens enable users to offer a specific service or benefit from it; they can also contribute to the development of decentralized applications within the metaverse. As with other tokens, metaverse tokens are cryptographically secure and protected and can process transactions almost instantaneously. Both non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens are used for a variety of transactions in the metaverse and run on the Ethereum blockchain, the underlying infrastructure of the metaverse.  ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens  The most widely used tokens in the metaverse are ERC-20 tokens. They are fungible tokens that meet the technical standards for smart contracts as well as the key guidelines for issuing any new token on the Ethereum blockchain network. The tokens that represent the incumbent metaverse ecosystems such as Ape (APE), Sandbox (SAND), Wilder World (WILD), and Decentraland (MANA) are ERC-20 tokens.  ERC-721 tokens, on the other hand, are non-fungible and represent a class of assets as opposed to a particular type of asset (ERC-20). ERC-721 tokens are a standard for NFTs, which ensure an individual’s ownership of an asset with its distinct value and properties, making them non-interchangeable with other tokens. NFTs often represent digital artwork, virtual real estate and goods, or unique in-game items within the metaverse. They make it possible for participants to monetize their digital content, such as music and artwork.  To enable a functional and secure metaverse, the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain needs to improve. Therefore, a growing number of layer 2 scaling solutions are being utilized in the metaverse that can increase the speed and volume of transactions and help reduce gas fees. For example, Hellven, a metaverse social platform, has partnered with Arbitrum to improve throughput and liquidity. Another example involves two heavyweight players in the metaverse and layer 2 solutions, respectively: The Sandbox and Polygon.  Last summer, The Sandbox, which is a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based game software and VC company Anomica Brands, decided to migrate its smart contract to Polygon for higher transaction speeds, reduced gas fees, better user experience and greater scalability. The pace of adoption of layer 2 solutions in the metaverse is expected to continue, making the ecosystem more efficient with greater adoption rates and subsequently larger transaction volumes. This has already captured the attention of established players in traditional finance (TradFi).  Banks have noticed  Once relegated to the world of science fiction and cute-looking avatars, the immersive and virtual world of the metaverse has garnered attention from financial institutions. With a user base and audience that are young, tech-savvy and in the early stages of their financial lives, metaverse offers banks unique opportunities to interact and build relationships with a digitally native and growing consumer base who have long embraced fintech. It is also equally important for the banks to be able to tap into this pool of talent for their future waves of hiring.  Leading institutions in TradFi from different parts of the world have started to build presence in the metaverse. They include such established names as J.P. Morgan Chase, DBS, HSBC and Kookmin. For example, J.P. Morgan set up shop on Decentraland under the brand Onyx by J.P. Morgan, which, according to the company, is “a blockchain-based platform for wholesale payment transactions.” In March last year, HSBC announced the purchase of land on The Sandbox to engage with existing and new clients and offer them novel experiences through emerging platforms.  In Canada, incumbent financial institutions TD and RBC are conducting metaverse pilot programs to understand the technology and stay ahead of the game so that they can offer immersive services to their customers effectively . TD’s program this year ran from January to April, which included pilots in customer experience.  Kookmin and DBS, two banking giants both hailing from Asia, have entered the metaverse and started to offer various services. South Korea’s Kookmin Bank offers its own native metaverse-based financial services as well as one-on-one customer service. It also has plans to expand its services to include employee training and financial education for young consumers. As for DBS, Singapore’s biggest bank, it announced its entry into the metaverse by purchasing a large plot of land on The Sandbox to develop interactive experiences aimed at promoting a more sustainable world.  Inroad into the financial markets  The above dynamics in the banking sector go beyond setting up shops and buying land in the metaverse. The growing market capitalization of metaverse tokens as well as the economic potential of Web3 have led many investors, including professional investors and high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), to seek a better understanding of Web3 technologies and the economic potential they hold. This includes interest in metaverse ETF and metaverse index products. Moreover, this growing interest is manifesting itself in financial and wealth management advisors to educate themselves about a wide range of cryptocurrencies beyond the two incumbent assets: bitcoin and ether.  The impact of the metaverse on the financial services sector is a representation of the next evolutionary stage in banking and capital markets. A driving force behind this evolutionary stage is the big shift to investing in digital assets by millennials, Gen X, and Gen Z clients. Underlying these dynamics, a report by Capgemini entitled “Wealth Management Top Trends 2023” revealed that 70% of HNWIs globally have invested in digital assets, including more than nine out of 10 HNWIs younger than 40 choosing cryptocurrencies as their favored asset class to invest in.  Their high rate of digital literacy and adoption of new technologies have compelled the financial industry to recruit specialized talent who understand next-gen wealth perspectives and their investing attitudes. And to serve the growing shift in investing in digital assets, the market is witnessing the development and launch of firm wide or industry wide digital asset education and curricula for financial advisors and wealth managers.

The company, whose decentralized network forms part of the sharing economy, has been conducting tests in Kenya, Mozambique, and Nigeria ahead of a broader rollout across the African continent. World Mobile Does DeWi For the past few months, World Mobile has been on a mission to convince Africans to trial its cellular data service. Its message is simple: World Mobile can provide data significantly cheaper than incumbent carriers and provide better coverage, particularly in rural areas where residents can struggle to get a signal. World Mobile’s ultimate goal is to create a community-owned wireless network that spans the globe, with users incentivized to provision spare bandwidth. To get its African service up and running, however, the company has utilized TV White Space equipment. This taps into unused spectrum in the TV broadcast band, harnessing it to deliver mobile network services. To further boost bandwidth, World Mobile also utilized Starlink, the satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX. According to World Mobile CEO Micky Watkins, “The successful completion of field tests in Kenya, Mozambique, and Nigeria, mark a significant milestone in World Mobile's mission to connect the unconnected. These tests validate the feasibility and scalability of our DeWi technology, bringing us one step closer to providing affordable and reliable internet access to both rural and underserved areas worldwide.” From Zanzibar to India and Beyond World Mobile has been steadily rolling out its services to select territories with a view to gauging demand and ensuring its network can scale to match demand. Last month, the company launched its commercial service in Zanzibar, having completed successful trials in the East African island cluster that saw 16,000 users sign up. Meanwhile, the company has announced its intention to perform periodic buybacks of its WMT token. The token is used to reward participants in World Mobile’s sharing economy and support adoption of its mobile solutions. Ultimately, World Mobile aims to forge an inclusive mobile ecosystem in which users can earn revenue while retaining a degree of ownership over network infrastructure and data. Within the radical decentralized mobile economy World Mobile is building, individuals and businesses are encouraged to operate nodes on the network. This helps provide greater network coverage while rewarding operators for their efforts. While Africa has formed the focus of World Mobile’s strategy for much of 2023, there are plans to gain a foothold in other key regions including India. Tellingly, the company recently announced the appointment of Manoj Kohli as an advisor. As the former country head of SoftBank India and CEO of Bharti Airtel, Kohli’s telecoms expertise will be pivotal in realizing this goal.

STX’s price moves have left investors wondering if it will soon conquer the $0.7 level, as its seven-day price range is between $0.532995 and $0.669564. Stacks (STX) Bucking Bearish Trends Amid Heightened Regulatory Uncertainty According to CoinGecko data, STX rebounded yesterday from a two-day price decline after the total crypto market cap witnessed a 1.6% increase. The token saw a massive 11% price decline on Tuesday, June 6, before regaining momentum with an 8.9% price increase on June 7. Related Reading: Less Than 100 XRP Needed To Become A Millionaire? New Research Suggests As a DeFi-enabling protocol, Stacks (STX) is among the tokens prospering in the heat of the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. After the US regulator pronounced several digital tokens, including SOL, ADA, BNB, MATIC, and ATOM, as securities, DeFi protocols witnessed increased trading volume. The same goes for STX, and according to CoinMarketCap data, STX saw a 0.65% increase in market cap over the past 24 hours. The crypto market cap turned red after news of the two lawsuits broke out in the crypto ecosystem. Although STX went with the flow, dropping 0.3% and 11% on June 5 and 6, it soon recovered momentum. The token’s timely recovery could be why it retained most of its 7-day and 14-day gains. Data shows that STX’s 14-day price increase is 11.9%, while Bitcoin only recorded a 0.5% increase in the last two weeks. STX Price Outlook Volatility is high across various assets in the crypto market, while sentiment is down as fear and uncertainty grip investors due to heightened enforcement actions. The Fear& Greed Index has been neutral over the past month, but technical analysis suggests a bullish outlook for STX. At press time, STX price has exceeded the 10, 20, and 30-day Exponential and Simple Moving Averages, suggesting a strong buy signal. However, the momentum is a little bearish, as the token has to conquer the 50 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages to break above the $0.7 mark. Related Reading: Polkadot Metrics Surge With Project Launches – Good News For DOT Price? The bull Bear Power is currently neutral at 0.0655. Therefore, the bulls must overpower the bears before the STX price can rally with bullish momentum in the coming days. Also, STX is trading at $0.65, gearing up to touch $0.7. That could be possible if the bulls conquer the bears in the coming days.

On Thursday, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) unveiled stricter marketing rules. The new guidelines, set to come into force on October 8, introduces a “cooling-off” period for crypto buyers and scraps “refer a friend” bonuses. The regulator said in a press release: The new rules mean crypto firms must ensure that people have the appropriate knowledge and experience to invest in crypto. Incentive Bonuses Scrapped The UK’s financial watchdog is taking a closer look at its crypto marketing rules introducing a more comprehensive guideline to protect investors. In a bid to discourage impulsive crypto purchases, the FCA’s new rules require first-time crypto investors to wait out a 24-hour “cooling-off” period after registering trading accounts. Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of the FCA’s Consumers and Competition Division, said: It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Consumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk. The regulator further said that “refer a friend” incentive bonuses for crypto buyers would be done away with. It added institutions promoting crypto assets would have to introduce clear risk warnings and ensure that advertisements are transparent, fair, and not misleading. The agency said crypto firms would have to carry warnings stating, for instance: Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. UK Looks To Regulate Crypto Sector Regulators worldwide are working relentlessly to introduce frameworks to govern the crypto sector to mitigate the risk to investors and economic stability. The European Union (EU) has taken charge in this respect with its landmark Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation. The bill underwent its last vote late in May and is set to take effect in phases in 2024. The UK Treasury Committee recently released a report compelling the government to regulate retail crypto trading not as financial assets but as gambling instruments. The committee argued that fraudsters and money launderers’ potential use of crypto threatens consumers and economic stability. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393446,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhXYlb,1686232800,Providing Regulatory Clarity (Binance and Coinbase Edition),"Well I was going to write about last week’s market structure bill but then the SEC sued Binance and y i k e s. So let’s talk about Binance. And then the SEC sued Coinbase! Double y i k e s. So let’s talk about both of them.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The SEC crusade  The narrative  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed two major lawsuits and an application for a temporary restraining order over two days against Binance and Coinbase, respectively the world’s and the U.S.’s largest crypto exchanges. While the suits share commonalities, there are some pretty major differences as well.  Why it matters  These may well be the cases that define how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the U.S., at least until Congress passes some legislation (if that happens). We’ve seen the complaints; the question is how Coinbase and Binance will defend themselves.  Breaking it down  I’ve already written well over 2,000 words on the various lawsuits, so I’m not going to recap them here. Click the links to read my coverage of the Binance lawsuit and the Coinbase lawsuit.  I’m more interested in the responses from the companies right now. Both Binance and Coinbase have issued a number of statements and had their respective executives weigh in on both TV and Twitter about the allegations.  There are some clear differences so far: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is making the TV and conference circuit, saying Coinbase does not plan to shut down its staking service (which is also facing heat from 10 state regulators) while Binance.US announced Wednesday it would halt trading on over 50 different token pairs, most of which were traded against the tether (USDT) stablecoin. Binance itself has said multiple times that customer funds have never been at risk, and that it disagrees with the SEC’s assessment.  One argument Coinbase has made since receiving its Wells Notice earlier this year is that the fact it’s gone public under the SEC’s auspices.  “The SEC reviewed our business and allowed us to become a public company in 2021,” Armstrong said in a tweet this week.  That’s a misleading claim, said Alexandra Damsker, a one-time SEC attorney who’s now an adviser to INX. A reviewer with the Division of Corporation Finance is not tasked with determining whether something is legal or illegal, she said, though they can alert the Division of Enforcement or another enforcement officer if they find something questionable.  “I can't tell them that what they're doing is illegal, because I don't know,” Damsker said. “And I can't tell them it's not because I don't know. And I can't warn them because I don't know and I can't put a comment on it because comments are public, and that would tell the industry or tell the marketplace that there might be something illegal and that's not something we can do, right? So what do I do? I continued the process.”  The Division of Corporation Finance would just continue its own review, which consists of looking for material misstatements or omissions and ensuring that the SEC’s rules are met, she said.  Armstrong also said Coinbase tried to “come in and register,” as SEC Chair Gary Gensler has often said, but “there is no path” to do so, a complaint echoed this week by Robinhood’s compliance chief Dan Gallagher in front of Congress (and it’s worth noting Robinhood received a subpoena tied to its crypto activities). Both Coinbase and Binance also reiterated their complaints about regulation by enforcement rather than guidance, though, arguably the SEC did provide some notice that it believed some (specific) cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.  To some extent, this comes down to the fundamental question at the heart of this complaint: are cryptocurrencies – at least the ones listed in the Coinbase and Binance complaints – securities? The SEC obviously thinks the answer is yes, and so Coinbase’s efforts to get the agency to say something else may just well be moot.  Binance, for its part, is taking a similarly combative position, arguing in public statements that it had been cooperating with the SEC’s investigation and tried to work toward a “negotiated settlement.”  “While we take the SEC’s allegations seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis. We intend to defend our platform vigorously,” Binance said. “Unfortunately, the SEC’s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission’s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.”  Of course, the Binance and Coinbase cases do share some major differences. While Coinbase is facing a largely vanilla case where the main allegation is “you listed securities and didn’t register as a broker, exchange or clearinghouse,” the Binance case includes a number of allegations that Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao secretly had access to Binance.US’s customer funds and diverted these funds to Zhao’s own entities.  In various tweets, Binance.US has said that the SEC hadn’t previously expressed concern about customer funds and that its attorneys have already spoken with the agency about these issues.  Binance now has a June 12 deadline to respond to the SEC’s motion for a temporary restraining order, with a hearing scheduled for June 13. The company’s defense will (I’m guessing) illustrate some of its broader arguments against the SEC’s overarching complaint.  Stories you may have missed  Binance Lawsuit Could Be ‘Huge Mistake’ or Bring Needed Clarity to U.S. Crypto Industry: CoinDesk’s Helene Braun spoke to a number of crypto industry participants about the suit against Binance.  Binance Hands Rising Star Teng Key Role to Replace CEO Zhao at Largest Crypto Exchange: Shortly before the SEC filed its suit, Ian Allison reported that Binance’s Richard Teng is now well-positioned to become the head of Binance’s global empire should founder and current CEO Changpeng Zhao step down.

Crypto Traders Suffer $320M Losses in Liquidations as SEC Lawsuit Against Binance Spurs Market Plunge: So does this one.  Coinbase Traders Withdraw $600M in a Day Amid SEC Lawsuits: And this one, really.

They alleged that Binance may have made false statements, including whether its U.S. affiliate Binance.US was in fact a separate business as Binance had declared. The news comes just days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, alleging that the platform violated the country's securities rules, mishandled customer funds and misled investors. The Wall Street regulator also accused Binance of taking insufficient steps to prohibit U.S. investors from accessing its unregulated exchange. From 2019 up until 2023, the company shuttled around $70B through accounts at collapsed U.S. lenders Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, according to a filing dated Wednesday, underscoring Binance's U.S. ties even though it doesn't have authority to operate there. “This is a serious matter,” the senators wrote in a Wednesday letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, Bloomberg reported . In March, Warren, Hollen and Roger Marshall (R-KS) called on Binance to disclose its balance sheet and raised doubts over its regulatory compliance, accusing it of repeatedly evaded regulators and hid basic financial information from the public. The SEC isn't the only regulator scrutinizing Binance. Last month, a Canadian securities regulator sent an order to Binance to probe whether it tried to circumvent the country's regulations and compliance controls. And, in March, it got sued by the Commodity and Futures Trade Commission for allegedly breaching certain trading and derivatives rules.

The financial world is struggling to define and understand digital assets, which transfer capital in innovative ways that have not existed before. Working through the issues surrounding cryptocurrencies will take time and patience, but it is necessary to create a system that protects investors and enhances the financial system. The editors of Bloomberg raise the question, ""How Could Coinbase and Binance Ever Be Legal?"" If these editors were to turn to China they would see how the Chinese have reacted to the world of cryptocurrencies. The Chinese have banned cryptocurrencies. The United States does not act that way. The United States' way is much more painful and time-consuming. The latest in the battle to understand what cryptocurrencies are and how they should exist has Gary Gensler and the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that two of the world's largest digital-token trading platforms, Binance and Coinbase are illegal. But, this action only shows what these institutions shouldn't do. We are still on the road to determining what they should do. That will come! It will have to come because digital is the way the world is going. At least that is what I think. See, for example, my recent post "" The Future of Everything in Banking is Digital ."" First of all, we should not be surprised with the current dilemma. This is the way all innovation goes. Innovation is new. Innovation is different. Innovation may be strange. Innovation, ultimately, may not work. Innovation may be used to exploit situations. There just is a lot we don't know about innovation. So, we have to learn, we have to grow in our thinking, and we have be careful not to be taken advantage of. And, that is what we are doing. But, working things out takes time. And, working things out is not inexpensive. And, the more major the innovation is to be in our lives, the more careful we have to be. No one is happy with the time it is taking for the financial world to become ""digital."" But, we need to get it as ""right"" as we can, as early as we can. Some Simple Definitions For starters, we still seem to be stuck right at the start. We have to define things. For example, what is a security? What is a commodity? Don't we know the answers to these questions? Furthermore, what is a loophole? And, there are many more definitions to clarify. But, digital assets are innovative and transfer capital in ways that have not been in existence before. And, as many of their supporters argue, this can be done with the internet or with blockchain, and without oversight. But, as with Binance and Coinbase, as with the closed FTX, the vehicles combine products and services that we have found, through financial history, probably should not be combined to avoid conflicts of interest and should not be combined to meet disclosure requirements and/or other investor protections. Also, without the separation seen in many traditional financial systems and networks, customer funds can be used in ways that are not legal or legitimate. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done before these vehicles can be fully trusted and degenerate the confidence that our current financial system has. The thing is, much is at risk in the short run. Cryptocurrencies may be a very good thing. To find this out, the cryptocurrency world must be tested and tested and modified and modified to find out what works, what protects investors, and what enhances the financial system. This takes time. This requires patience. But, investors must see that working through all the issues as well as possible can only generate a world that is the best one we can create. The Reply Mr. Gensler is speaking out more these days. ""We don't need more digital currencies,"" Mr. Gensler contends . ""We already have digital currency. It's called the US dollar. It's called the euro or it's called the yen, they're all digital right now."" I agree with this, but I also agree that innovation needs to be allowed. We don't know what the future is going to be like and so we need to keep asking questions and trying to create newer and newer answers. In a world like this, however, time and patience are needed. And, the approach Mr. Gensler has taken is not a comfortable world for many of these innovators. Those that criticize him argue that he is regulating the market through enforcement action, rather than by defining long-term rules as policy. But, this is a world heavily reliant upon the ""new"" for its evolution. In such a world, how can you have ""long-term rules"" when there is no such thing at the current time that is ""long-term""? Mr. Gensler and the SEC are ""learning by doing,"" just as all the innovators challenging them are learning by doing. Binance and Coinbase are finding this as a target to challenge. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, argues, therefore, that their only recourse is to go to the courts to challenge Mr. Gensler. And, that is what is happening. But, this, too, will take years. This is a world of radical uncertainty. And, this is the world that investors must deal with. It is a world of complex innovation, a world where all the questions are not known let alone all the answers. Going Forward Cryptocurrencies have been pushed very hard by the libertarian thought makers. The idea was that you could have a currency that needed a minimum (hopefully zero) regulations and very little oversight (hopefully none). This is one of the dynamics of the world of innovation. People innovate and then people continue to innovate and then they innovate even more. How can I make things better? How can I make more money from some product or service? How can I take advantage of others with my innovation? This is the very nature of invention and progress. But, it is also the very nature of ""how can I get around things""? and ""how can I fool you""? Regulation and oversight is necessary. Right now, I am a huge fan of digital currencies, like those of the U.S. dollar, the euro, and so on. The digital world is still going to grow and expand and dominate. I am, and always have been concerned about the ""crypto"" world. The ""crypto"" world is going to have to be regulated and controlled. The unregulated and uncontrolled ""crypto"" world is going to produce ""holes"" in its system that investors will create opportunities for others to take advantage of them. The ""crypto"" world will become less and less interesting as the regulators and legislators get more and more into its models. This is how the world of innovation works. This is how the world of innovation is working. Investors may find very profitable opportunities, but investors may also find the glamor of the ""crypto"" world fading into the background as this space becomes more regulated and revealed.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4610262-making-the-case-for-crypto-or-not?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13621338.jpeg

Adding to this challenging situation is the recent lawsuit filed against crypto exchange giants Coinbase and Binance by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Both Binance and Coinbase were charged by the SEC of being unregistered exchanges that sold unregistered securities, including Binance’s own digital assets, BNB and the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. As a consequence of this disheartening news, Binance’s netflow on the Ethereum blockchain has plummeted to a staggering negative $776.8 million. This event led to the crypto market dropping over 3% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing as significant cryptocurrencies slid, pulling the entire market downwards. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, for its part, continues to languish below the $27k region. Thus, these top five cryptocurrencies are a must-avoid for investors if they want to stay in the green this week. Netflow to Binance over the past 24 hours is $778.6M negative on Ethereum – $871.7M in and $1.65B out Over the past hour, netflow on Ethereum continues to be negative at $35.7M on Ethereum – $14.8M in and $50.5M out Track it here https://t.co/nwTgpXWhZY and filter for “Binance” pic.twitter.com/jnNAN0QKVy — Nansen 🧭 (@nansen_ai) June 6, 2023 Top 5 Losing Cryptos Amid FUD Storm PEPE Once the bringer of significant gains to investors has now succumbed to the bearish forces of the market, according to Coingecko, the token is now down over 13% in the daily timeframe, following the market slippage that started this week. The token’s current trajectory puts it on a path for more FUD for investors. At the moment, PEPE’s price oscillates above the $0.00000101 support range. With the bearish sentiment in the crypto market right now, it will take some time before bulls can knock a zero out of PEPE.

Investors and traders could expect the bears to break through this support level if the bearishness in the market continues. If this happens, a drop to $0.4368 will occur. SUI Even as the news of the network’s partnership with Red Bull Racing hit the market, bears still found a way to crash the party. Recent market data shows that the SUI, the governance token of the network, is down 14% since Wednesday. SUI has a newfound support range at $$0.7533. SUI bulls, however, should not expect much from this support level as it has no strength backing it. At the moment, investors and traders should monitor the market’s movement as the token has a significant correlation with Bitcoin. Bitcoin sliding near the $25K region. BTCUSD Chart: TradingView.com Bearish Atmosphere Pervades CFX Bears brought havoc to CFX, continuing the bearish momentum after Conflux was affected by Multichain’s irregularities. As of writing, the CFX is down over 12% since yesterday, following the general market downturn. At the moment, CFX bulls are trying to settle around the $0.2229 support level. If this support holds, we might be able to see a return towards $0.2354 in the long term. However, investors and traders should still be wary of short to medium term losses on the token. AXS Despite the successful release of Axie Origins on the Apple Store last month, the market downturn and FUD dashed any hope of gains in the short term. Coingecko data reveals that the token is down nearly 12% since Wednesday. After enjoying gains made after the release of Axie Origins, bears are now trying to break through the $6.6 support level. If they are successful, a drop to $5.86 in the near future is possible if the market continues to pull AXS downward. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

One example is a DeFi protocol establishing a non-profit foundation to hold its native tokens, write governance proposals and advise the project – often confusing users and regulators alike.  The term became relevant in April when the community behind the Ethereum layer 2 network Arbitrum accused the Arbitrum Foundation of fudging its very first governance vote with $1 billion worth of ARB tokens on the line. The foundation had already moved the tokens into its coffers, making an upcoming vote to “ratify” the move really just retroactive permission.  The vote was ultimately scrapped, and the foundation vowed to change its ways.

""I would love for us to start talking about the technology more, and real-world use cases,"" said Michelle O'Connor, vice president of brand and global communications at TaxBit, a developer of tax software for crypto owners.  However, the industry struggles to talk about broader benefits in a way that resonates. Part of what keeps crypto out of the mainstream is the bewildering storm of jargon and memes spewing from the industry, the kind of talk that few bother trying to parse.

13620756,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/ankr-launches-enterprise-rpc-on-microsoft-azure-marketplace,1686230100,Ankr Launches Enterprise RPC On Microsoft Azure Marketplace,"San Francisco-based Web3 developer hub Ankr has officially launched Enterprise Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services on Microsoft's Azure Marketplace, following their partnership announcement in February this year. The service is intended to provide Azure's vast customer base with low-latency, globally accessible blockchain connections, aiding them in their Web3 project and application development. Notably, Ankr's AppChains, a solution enabling enterprises to deploy dedicated, customizable blockchains, will also be made available on Azure Marketplace. Initial offerings will include the deployment of Polygon Supernets with a promise of more blockchain ecosystem choices in the near future. ""Through this partnership, we are abstracting away what is often an impediment to testing, deploying, and scaling Web3 projects seamlessly,"" shares Daniel An, Microsoft's Director of Business Development. AppChains have been part of Ankr's product line-up for a year now. These scalable, application-specific blockchains facilitate decentralized app development and project execution for Web3 organizations. Their popularity among traditional enterprises has grown significantly due to their versatile application potential across banking, institutional clients, CBDCs, gaming, and more. By offering AppChains through the Azure Marketplace, enterprises have a vetted and trusted platform to explore and adopt this new technology. Ankr's AppChains aim to overcome significant hurdles faced by enterprises, such as scalability, user experience, and the cost of hiring new Web3 engineering talent. AppChains provide speedy and affordable transactions, seamless user experiences, regulatory compliance, and comprehensive engineering support. These advantages could streamline the transition to Web3 for many firms interested in the digital asset space. Peter Stewart, Head of Infrastructure at Ankr, praised the collaboration with Microsoft and highlighted their anticipation for increased demand following the Azure Marketplace launch. Simultaneously, Kev Silk, Ankr AppChains Lead, underscored Ankr's commitment to facilitating Web3 accessibility for large businesses through this enterprise-grade chain solution. ""With Microsoft's guidance, we will continue to innovate and improve based on user feedback and performance metrics. This partnership has been remarkable, and we are excited for the future of our Enterprise RPC service,"" Stewart shares. Ankr, as an all-in-one Web3 developer hub, offers an extensive toolkit to build Web3 apps and establish high-performance connections to over 30 blockchains. Ankr is an approved infrastructure partner for constructing application-specific blockchains on ecosystems like the BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche. According to data from 2022, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud service provider worldwide, commanding a market share of approximately 20%. Analysts predict that by 2024, global blockchain technology revenues are expected to reach $23.3 billion. Given this context, the Ankr-Microsoft partnership could be a significant step in catering to this emerging demand. The Ankr and Microsoft Azure collaboration represents an important development in the expansion of Web3, emphasizing the increasing importance of reliable infrastructure in fostering its growth. By facilitating the rapid deployment of customized blockchains and providing scalable connections to over 30 blockchain networks, this partnership could catalyze the mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies. Building Web3 infrastructure is akin to creating the foundational pillars of the next-generation internet. It provides the necessary groundwork that enables decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms to run smoothly. This not only enhances performance but also ensures that these platforms can effectively maintain the decentralized ethos at the heart of the Web3 vision. What's Next For Ankr and Microsoft Azure? Microsoft Azure's involvement in this endeavor is notable. As one of the leading cloud service providers, Azure brings extensive expertise in facilitating scalable, reliable, and secure cloud solutions for various applications. Its entry into the Web3 infrastructure space underscores the intersection of traditional tech giants with the burgeoning field of blockchain technology. In terms of broader implications, the Ankr-Microsoft partnership provides an excellent example of how cloud services can fuel the growth of Web3. Cloud computing, with its inherent flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, provides an ideal environment for developing and deploying dApps, smart contracts, and other blockchain-powered applications. In fact, the synergy of cloud computing and blockchain could serve as a catalyst for new business models and applications in the Web3 space. For instance, decentralized data storage and management, enhanced digital identity solutions, and streamlined supply chain systems are among the numerous potential applications of a blockchain-cloud fusion. Microsoft Azure, with its robust cloud infrastructure, has a history of fostering such innovations. The platform's as-a-service offerings – including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) – have already disrupted multiple sectors. By extending these capabilities to Web3 infrastructure development, Azure could unlock new frontiers in the decentralized tech landscape. The integration of Ankr’s Enterprise RPC services and AppChains into Azure Marketplace, therefore, not only marks a significant step in Web3 infrastructure development but also demonstrates the potential of cloud services in accelerating the growth of Web3. As enterprises worldwide increasingly recognize the potential of blockchain technology, collaborations like these are likely to become more prominent, shaping the evolution of the Internet as we know it. Partnerships such as Ankr and Microsoft Azure's represent a critical step in this direction, bringing together the flexibility of cloud services with the transformative potential of blockchain technology.

13620626,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537009,1686229850,Australian Bank Takes Stance Against Payments To Select Crypto Exchanges,"Due to concerns over the risk of scams, Australia’s largest bank, Commonwealth Banks (CBA), has recently announced the temporary delay of certain payments associated with crypto exchanges. This decision arose after the United States Securities Regulator (SEC) sued two major global exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. This comes just a few weeks after another major Australian bank, Westpac, banned customers from transacting with crypto exchange Binance. Commonwealth Bank Combat Scams, Prioritizing Customer Protection On June 8, CBA disclosed its intention to decline or place a 24-hour hold on “certain payments to crypto exchanges.” Nevertheless, the bank has yet to specify which crypto exchanges or payment types would be impacted by these new measures. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Blasts SEC Chair For Anti-Innovation Stance, XRP Bulls Remain Optimistic According to a statement, CBA claimed that the measures they’ve introduced safeguard their clients from scams associated with making payments to crypto exchanges. The bank added that customers sending funds to crypto exchanges to purchase cryptocurrencies will have a monthly limit of AUD 10,000 ($6,650). The general manager of CBA’s fraud management services, James Roberts, said; Consumer interest in cryptocurrencies has been increasing, and unfortunately, scammers globally are capitalizing on this trend and masquerading as legitimate investment opportunities or diverting funds into cryptocurrency exchanges. James further emphasized that the limits on outbound payments to crypto exchanges and the 24-hour holds will help fight the number of scams and money lost by customers. CBA said continual evaluation and monitoring would be conducted to assess the impacts of these scam response measures. This recent security measure marks a significant reversal from its previous plans. Notably, in November 2021, the bank introduced crypto trading services through its CommBank app, holding millions of users. During that period, the bank’s CEO, Matt Comyn, acknowledged the associated risks but emphasized the greater risks of not participating. He stated that “The sector and the technology [isn’t] going away anytime soon.” Uncertain Future for Crypto Exchange Binance Australia Services Following De-banking Amid the ongoing global de-banking of crypto businesses, Binance users in Australia now face limited options for purchasing cryptocurrencies. According to Binance, starting from 5:00 pm local time on June 1, bank transfers for fiat on-ramps and off-ramps have been suspended in Australia, including trading for Australian dollar (AU$) pairs. The recent suspension of deposits and withdrawals is connected to previous events that have affected Binance in Australia. Related Reading: US SEC Sues Binance, Fails To Mention Ripple (XRP) As Security In February, Binance’s local derivatives division informed users that specific positions and accounts would be closed for those who did not meet the criteria to be classified as wholesale investors. According to the law, a wholesale investor has sufficient capital to invest in higher-risk and more speculative assets. This investor category is also called an institutional or accredited investor. To qualify as a wholesale investor in Australia, one must possess net assets of at least $2.5 million or have an annual gross income of at least $250,000. Notably, a report published by Binance in July of 2022 clearly states that the derivatives products are strictly for Australian wholesale clients.

42393436,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhXYGp,1686229759,Banks Have Come to the Metaverse,"It may not be the buzzword it once was among the tech set, but the metaverse has begun to get attention from financial institutions. With a user base and audience that are young, tech-savvy and in the early stages of their financial lives, metaverse applications offer banks unique opportunities to build relationships with a digitally native and growing consumer base that has long embraced fintech. It’s also important for banks to be able to tap into this pool of talent for future hiring.  The metaverse can be broadly defined as a blockchain-fueled, all-encompassing virtual world that offers new human and socio-cultural experiences. It epitomizes decentralized and immersive social experiences that often involve virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), opening up an entirely new set of opportunities for social interaction. No single company or application defines the metaverse, and users can use a single, portable identity among metaverse apps.  Banking on the metaverse  Leading institutions in TradFi from different parts of the world have begun to set up shop in the metaverse. JPMorgan arrived in Decentraland under the brand Onyx, which, according to the company, is “a blockchain-based platform for wholesale payment transactions.” In March last year, HSBC announced the purchase of land on The Sandbox to engage with clients and offer them novel experiences through emerging platforms.  Kookmin and DBS, two banking giants from Asia, have also entered the metaverse and begun offering various services. South Korea’s Kookmin Bank has its own native metaverse-based financial services as well as one-on-one customer service. It also plans to include employee training and financial education for young consumers. As for DBS, Singapore’s biggest bank, it purchased a large plot of land on The Sandbox to develop interactive experiences aimed at promoting a more sustainable world. According to the bank, the partnership is part of efforts to explore the potential of Web3 opportunities and spread awareness on important ESG issues.  In Canada, incumbent financial institutions TD and RBC are conducting metaverse pilot programs to understand the technology and stay ahead of the game to be able to offer immersive services effectively to their customers. TD’s program this year ran from January to April, which included pilots in customer experience.  Preparing advisors for Web3 financial services  The above dynamics in the banking sector go beyond virtual awnings and buying pixelated land.  Banks are taking measures to prepare their financial advisors and wealth managers for Web3-based financial products. This includes metaverse ETF and metaverse index products, fueled by the growing market capitalization of metaverse tokens and a shift to investing in digital assets by millennials, Gen X and Gen Z clients.  Underlying these dynamics, a report by Capgemini entitled “Wealth Management Top Trends 2023” revealed that 70% of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) globally have invested in digital assets, including more than nine out of 10 HNWIs younger than 40 choosing cryptocurrencies as their favored asset class to invest in.  The impact of the metaverse on the financial services sector is a representation of the next evolutionary stage in banking and capital markets. This is manifesting as advisors taking measures to educate themselves about a wide range of cryptocurrencies beyond the two most influential assets: bitcoin and ether. Many advisors feel the need to educate themselves to provide access to this new asset class, and the industry is adapting to serve this need with the development of digital asset education and curricula.  As advisors become more savvy about digital assets, the question isn’t just what’s in your wallet or even your digital wallet — but how much of it is in the metaverse?",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | AR,Reza Akhlaghi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/08/banks-have-come-to-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66c06473d5b350ce47c6640a29f5dbc5ebb88f7b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nostr, created by Fiatjaf and self-proclaimed Bitcoin hobbyist and advocate Ben Arc, has its roots in No Big Deal (NBD), Zebedee’s non-profit arm for advancing open-source Bitcoin development. Fiatjaf and Arc first conceptualized the protocol in 2019 and later advanced its development via NBD.  In 2022, Nostr got the attention of former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who promptly donated 14 bitcoin (about $245,000 at the time) directly to Fiatjaf himself. In May 2023, Dorsey made a heftier $10 million donation to OpenSats, a non-profit organization for free and open-source Bitcoin projects. Half of the donation to OpenSats ($5 million) was specifically earmarked for further Nostr development.

The company's adjusted net asset value has been further impacted by severe dilution since 2022Q4, with shareholders losing a 31% claim on MARA's assets and future earnings. Our model suggests that Bitcoin has to trade above $50,737 to justify MARA's current valuation, but MARA will likely tail Bitcoin's price action rather than fundamentals. MARA can be invested if prospective investors believe Bitcoin will quickly recover above $33,400 (MARA's total mining cost per Bitcoin) to avoid further dilution and Bitcoin sale. Prospective investors should also account for over-centralization risks (regulatory risks) and MARA's SBC policies. Introduction It has been a while since we last visited Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ). In our previous article , we discussed MARA's risk of over-centralization. We showed that 62% of MARA's operations are centralized in Texas alone. The SEC's lawsuit against crypto exchanges such as Binance (BNB-USD) and Coinbase (COIN) puts MARA under massive regulatory risk. For instance, New York recently became the first state to impose a ban (partial) on Bitcoin Mining. Should Texas impose similar policies, MARA will suffer a loss of revenue and incur massive expenses to locate and relocate to new sites with excess energy production. This article aims to examine other aspects of MARA that prospective investors should consider, especially when we've outlined a strategy that could double the return and halve potential losses, outlined here . Expansion Progress Negated With Side Effect Here, we need to give credit where it's due. MARA has guided shareholders 23 EH/s mining capacity by mid-2023 (which is now) since 2021Q4. According to the latest May production update , MARA is now nearing its guided 23 EH/s and has 20.1 EH/s capacity installed as of May 2023. Here is MARA's expansion progress since 2021Q1. Table 1. MARA's Historical Built-up Hash Rate Since 2021Q1 QR Built-up hash rate (Energized) 2023Q2 15.2 EH/s 2023Q1 11.5 EH/s 2022Q4 7.0 EH/s 2022Q3 5.7 EH/s 2022Q2 3.9 EH/s 2022Q1 3.9 EH/s 2021Q4 3.5 EH/s 2021Q3 2.7 EH/s 2021Q2 2.09 EH/s 2021Q1 1.46 EH/s Source: Author However, the side effect of this expansion is the diminishing value of MARA's asset value on paper due to depreciation. Historically, MARA supported expansion efforts by securing large amounts of equipment via large prepayments to vendors. The value of MARA's prepayment peaked at $830mil in 2022Q2 . Then, the value of MARA's prepayment (""Prepaid"") gradually decreases as the prepaid equipment gets delivered. Hence, the value of Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) increases. However, the value of the prepayment is not completely transferrable to PP&E. This is because PP&E is subjected to depreciation (both in reality and on paper) while prepayments are not. As a result, the value of MARA's total assets also decreased. Table 2 illustrates the diminishing Adjusted Net Asset Value for MARA over time, assuming Bitcoin is priced at $27,000. In this computation, we only include primary assets (Cash, Bitcoin reserves, PP&E, and Prepayments to vendors) to be conservative. Table 2.

The total number of outstanding shares increased by 43% (167.26mil/116.8mil, Table 3) in the past 2 quarters (2022Q4 and 2023Q1). This implies that shareholders have lost 31% claim on the MARA's assets and future earnings. Hence, Adj NAV per share has declined more rapidly than Adj NAV. Table 3.

This is because Bitcoin is trading below MARA's total mining cost per Bitcoin. Hence, MARA has to cover expenses through the issuance of new shares or debt in addition to liquidating some or all of the Bitcoins mined. For instance, this year, MARA liquidated 1,500 Bitcoins in January, 650 in February, and 600 in April. As a result, MARA's Bitcoin reserves did not grow as we would like (Table 4). Table 4. MARA's Historical Bitcoin Holdings/Reserves Q Bitcoin Reserve 2023Q2 12,259 ( May) 2023Q1 11,466 2022Q4 12,232 2022Q3 10,670 2022Q2 10,055 2022Q1 9,374 2021Q4 8,133 2021Q3 7,035 2021Q2 5,784 2021Q1 5,324 Source: Author Cost Analysis: Normalizing Costs Sustainable? We computed MARA's total mining cost per Bitcoin to be around $32,000 (=$70.2mil / 2,195 Bitcoin mined). The total mining cost comprises the cost of revenue (depreciation and hosting) ($51.1mil), general administrative expenses ($15.344mil), and interest expenses ($3.76mil). Non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensations and depreciation are also included because these costs still impact the fair value of MARA's shares. $32,000 total mining cost per BTC represents a 28% decline QoQ from $44,000 in 2022Q4 and an acceptable industrial average (e.g., Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), Bitfarms ( BITF )). Moreover, the $32,000 total mining cost per BTC is also considered highly efficient by MARA's historical standard (Table 5). Table 5. MARA's Total Mining Cost Per BTC QR Total Mining Cost per BTC 2023Q1 $32,100 2022Q4 $44,400 2022Q3 $91,200 2022Q2 $81.683 2022Q1 $31,700 2021Q4 $32,240 2021Q3 $95,850 2021Q2 $20,711 Source Author However, we expect the costs to increase. One of the key reasons is stock-based compensation (SBC). According to 2023Q1 reports : The decrease in stock-based compensation is primarily related to generally lower value of the Company's stock. Following this rationale, SBC will likely increase when MARA's stock price recovers, bringing the overall total mining costs up with it. Furthermore, MARA has also increased its headcounts, which will further increase SBC when the stock price recovers. This ... increase in expense was primarily due to the increases associated with the larger scale of the business, including higher cash compensation and benefits costs ... resulting primarily from an increase in headcount from 13 employees in the prior-year period to over 30 employees in 2023... In the past, MARA was already notorious for ""generous"" SBC expenditures. For instance, MARA incurred $97.2mil of SBC expenses in 2021Q3 which represented 90% of the total costs . MARA also incurred $54.4mil in SBC in 2021Q1 when the cost of revenue was only $2.41mil. In 2023Q1, MARA suffered $25mil losses related to some form of stock grants. This event may not be related to SBC, but it seems MARA has troubles with compensations. Profitability and Valuations Since Bitcoin is trading well above its $15,000 (=$ 33.4mil / 2,195 BTC) hosting cost per BTC, it still makes sense to continue mining Bitcoin. That being said, MARA is currently unprofitable as Bitcoin is trading below its $32,000 total mining cost per BTC. Based on MARA's adj NAV, cost analysis, risk of SBC cost increase, and a 5x earnings multiple benchmark (which is derived from the average lifespan of the mining rigs), our valuation model suggests that Bitcoin has to trade at least above $50,737 to justify MARA's current valuation of $1.69bn. At $50,737 per Bitcoin, the adjusted Enterprise Value (EV) of MARA would be $893mil (= $1.69bn Market Cap - [$124mil Cash + 12,259 BTC * $51,000 + $715mil PP&E + $69.5mil Prepaid - $734 Total Liabilities]). On the other hand, MARA's net profit per BTC would be $17,337. Since the drop in the Bitcoin network hash rate during 2021H1, the Bitcoin network has been growing at 93% annually (Figure 1). Hence, the Bitcoin network hash rate is expected to reach 733 EH/s (Figure 2). At 23 EH/s terminal capacity, MARA would account for about 3.1% (=23 EH/s over 733 EH/s) of the total Bitcoin network. Therefore, MARA is expected to produce 10,302 Bitcoin annually until the next Bitcoin halving cycle. This would put MARA's expected annual profit at $178.6mil and valuation at $893mil at 5x earnings multiple. In summary, this implies that MARA is currently overpriced. However, we do not think that MARA's price would decline simply because it is overpriced. Based on past data, MARA is 40% more volatile than Bitcoin (Beta to Bitcoin = 1.40). Hence, MARA's price will likely follow Bitcoin rather than fundamentals. What do all these means? If you believe Bitcoin will recover above $33,400 in the near future and $50,737 in the long term, you could consider MARA investible now. Keep in mind the risk of over-centralization and MARA's SBC policy before investing. Else, you'll likely get severely diluted on top of losses from MARA's share price declines. Figure 1. Data by YCharts Figure 2. Data by YCharts Summary In this article, we discussed MARA's balance sheet is highly susceptible to the depreciation of its PP&E while shareholders risk further dilution if Bitcoin continues to trade below its total mining cost per Bitcoin. Given the additional unsystematic risk of MARA's mining business, we maintain our recommendation to invest directly in Bitcoin.

On Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, alleging the sale of unregistered securities, commingling of customer funds, and that CZ was ""secretly"" controlling Binance.US.  “This is a serious matter,” the lawmakers reportedly wrote in Wednesday's letter.  In March, Warren and Hollen called the exchange a ""hotbed of illegal financial activity,"" in a letter to CZ and Binance.US, requesting information on the entity's financials and anti-money laundering measures.

The token is in a battle between the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) and payment company Ripple. Related Reading: Less Than 100 XRP Needed To Become A Millionaire? New Research Suggests This legal battle began two years ago but has become more relevant than ever as the regulator crackdown on the nascent sector. The event has attracted speculators and traders looking to profit from its outcome. With the SEC filing two new lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase, XRP could benefit from a positive result, and other tokens could record a positive correlation. In other words, if XRP wins in court, other tokens will follow a similar trajectory. As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.52 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. In the previous week, the token recorded a 3% profit as the market collapsed, with Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) experiencing sharp corrections. Trading The SEC War, Why XRP Is Key The SEC’s lawsuits put Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and many more coins under the spotlight. These cryptocurrencies could be deemed securities in the United States, thus rendering most crypto exchanges unable to offer them for a while. Binance.US has begun pausing trading on this and other “crypto asset securities,” as the regulator calls them. As a result, their prices have been suffering and could continue to see downside pressure in the short term. According to pseudonym analyst Daan Crypto, some of the tokens targeted by the SEC could rise again to benefit those traders willing to take the risk. Via Twitter, the analyst wrote: I think there might be some smart people that know whether these coins will come out on top or not and might get some amazing discounts. I’d rather choose the easy route (Left side of the bell curve) and trade other coins for the foreseeable future. The analyst recommended that traders stick to Bitcoin and other “dino coins,” such as Litecoin. These digital assets already have a clearer status than newer cryptocurrencies, as the SEC and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. hinted at BTC being a commodity under their laws. On higher timeframes, when the Ripple versus SEC case is finally settled or decided, XRP and other altcoins are likely to rally: If Ripple wins then expect some massive rallies in basically every alt coin that got named as a security by the SEC. Cheer for $XRP even if you don’t like the project itself. They are fighting everyone’s fight here. The fate of this case could be decided soon, according to top executives within the payment company. In the meantime, traders could see some profits by taking positions on older coins. Related Reading: Polkadot Metrics Surge With Project Launches – Good News For DOT Price?

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Major cryptocurrencies targeted as unregistered securities in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase continued their sharp declines. BNB, the Binance Smart Chain’s native token, dropped 5% in the last 24 hours to a five month low of $252, according to CoinDesk data. Algorand’s ALGO lost 8% over the same period, and Solana’s SOL slid 5.2%. Bitcoin has remained somewhat of a safe haven, but only on a relative basis. The cryptocurrency is down modestly over the past 24 hours, but still remains near a three-month low at $26,400.  Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) will continue operating its crypto staking service despite facing lawsuits from state and federal regulators over the program and several of its other offerings. “We're not going to wind down our staking service,” said CEO Brian Armstrong Wednesday at the Bloomberg Invest Conference. “As these court cases play out, it's really business as usual,” he added. Armstrong noted that the exchange’s staking service accounts for about 3% of Coinbase’s overall net revenue. His comments came after the SEC on Tuesday sued Coinbase for a swath of violations, including allegations the company sold unregistered securities. A ten-state coalition led by the Alabama Securities Commission also took aim at the exchange, slapping Coinbase with allegations that the company’s staking program had violated various state securities laws.  As a private citizen in 2019, current SEC Chair Gary Gensler offered to serve as an advisor to Binance, lawyers for the exchange told SEC officials on June 4, according to a court filing yesterday. With Binance facing a suit from the SEC, the exchange’s attorneys argued that Gensler should recuse himself from the case because of this history. In March 2019, according to the Binance attorneys, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao and Gensler had an in-person lunch meeting in Japan where they discussed the BNB token and Binance opening an exchange in the U.S. Gensler at the time “acknowledged the regulatory uncertainty"" around the then quickly-growing cryptocurrency industry, they said. The two remained in touch after the meeting, and “Zhao understood that the now-Chairman was comfortable serving as an informal advisor,"" something that Gensler himself offered, according to the filing.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price slipped to former resistance-turned-support at $25,300 early this week.  The move could be called a throwback – a counter-trend move that takes prices down to the breakout price.  Prices typically rise after the completion of a throwback, according to technical analysis theory.

A proposal to allow crvUSD minting via stETH was passed by 100% of Curve DAO community members in a vote that ended Thursday morning. Users can put up their stETH holders as collateral, and Curve shall automatically mint crvUSD whose value will be a portion of the value of the stETH.  Users currently have to pay a 6% borrowing rate and will be automatically liquidated, to maintain the intended $1 peg of crvUSD, if the value of the supplied collateral drops.  As of Thursday, there is a maximum limit of $150 million worth of cvrUSD that can be issued using stETH as collateral.  Curve deployed its much-awaited crvUSD stablecoin on the Ethereum mainnet last month after stating its intention to issue a dollar-pegged stablecoin last June. The token is backed by a basket of tokens and controlled via smart contracts – ensuring it is fully backed at all times in a move that hopes to prevent a repeat of TerraUSD disaster.  Some market observers have previously weighed in on the impact of crvUSD in the broader crypto ecosystem once it is issued.  “The crvUSD could be a very interesting development, as we haven’t yet seen a stablecoin that is issued by a major DEX,” (decentralized exchange) Daniel Zlotin, senior DeFi developer at Orbs, said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  “Connecting a stablecoin with a viable [decentralized finance] platform could open up some interesting possibilities in terms of new models (such as using LP tokens as part of the backing system),” Zlotin added, cautioning that there would “definitely be some challenges” in implementing such a concept.

Cuban was highly critical of the lack of support for companies actively looking to comply with securities regulations in the country. Cuban Frustrated With SEC Approach Billionaire Mark Cuban has long advocated for cryptocurrencies and recently expressed his frustration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approach to crypto. Cuban stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission could have adopted a much clearer approach for compliance, and avoided legal disputes altogether. Cuban tweeted, “The SEC could have easily have gone to them and outlined an exact plan to get them to compliance. Then if @coinbase or whoever didn’t comply, they sue over whatever legal disagreements they have. Instead, they do what they told one of my companies to do when we called, read these cases and get a lawyer to figure it out for you.” SEC Only Wants To Litigate Cuban also stated that the SEC is full of lawyers, and all lawyers want to do is litigate. He added that there would be greater compliance if there were more business people within the SEC. “They are full of lawyers. Lawyers want to litigate. If you had business people, more like the SBA, there would be more compliance, fewer lawsuits, and better investor education and protections. But if that happened, 2k SEC lawyers would be out of a job.” The billionaire also suggested that the SEC promotes the cases and wins as metrics instead of keeping track of the number of companies that they help reach compliance. No One Trusts The SEC Cuban further argued that the SEC’s approach was fermenting a climate of fear and mistrust, leading to companies fearing to engage with the regulator because they are afraid of potential legal ramifications. This would make it harder for companies to achieve compliance, going against the SEC’s mandate of protecting investors and maintaining efficient markets. “As it is, no one wants to talk to the SEC because no one trusts them for fear of being in the same situation as Coinbase finds itself. You get what you measure.” Repercussions Of The SEC Crackdown The lawsuit against Coinbase came just after a similar complaint was filed against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The crackdown reflects an increasingly hostile regulatory environment for crypto companies in the United States. It has also led to a number of trading pairs being delisted from Binance.US. The SEC has been going after crypto companies following the collapse of FTX under the pretext of protecting consumers. Coinbase Pushes Back Coinbase has also pushed back against the SEC and has demanded clearer guidance from the chief financial regulator. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, stated that the agency needs to clearly define what constitutes a security, leading to greater uncertainty and potentially hindering innovation in the crypto space. The SEC has stated that everything other than Bitcoin is a security. However, Armstrong has contended that the law says differently and that regulators around the globe are taking a different position than that of the SEC. Armstrong stated in an interview that Coinbase also met with the SEC, “We met with the SEC 30 times in the last year. They never gave us a single piece of feedback about what we could be doing better. We just got silence.” The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has ordered the SEC to respond within a week. The SEC had sued Coinbase for allegedly acting as an unregistered broker, as it goes after some of the biggest names in crypto over alleged violations of US securities laws. “Since at least 2019, Coinbase has made billions of dollars unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities. Coinbase intertwines the traditional services of an exchange, broker, and clearing agency without having registered any of those functions with the Commission as required by law.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393419,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhXXHH,1686222108,"Bitcoin Traders Shrug Off U.S. SEC's Action Against Binance, Coinbase","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s crackdown on heavyweight cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase (COIN) failed to spur signs of disquiet among savvy bitcoin (BTC) traders, options-based implied volatility metrics show. That's a sign the lawsuits were expected and priced in.  ""The biggest takeaway for me is everyone has been looking for a catalyst to shock implied volatility back to life and see some sort of renewed bid for longer-dated options,"" said Christopher Newhouse, an independent crypto derivatives trader. ""But I see little evidence of that, which suggests players in the volatility market might be shrugging this off.""  Regulatory concerns have been prevalent since the beginning of the year, and perhaps the market anticipated and priced in the SEC's actions, he said.  Implied volatility (IV) is based on options data and reflects investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period. It is positively affected by demand for options , which are derivative contracts that offer the purchaser protection against bullish or bearish fluctuations. A call option protects against rallies, while a put option protects against drops.  Rising demand for options and the resulting increase in implied volatility often reflect heightened wariness in the market and the potential for increased price turbulence in either direction. So far, bitcoin implied volatility has seen a muted rise at best.  Bitcoin's seven-day annualized implied volatility rose to 43% from 34% after the SEC news, and has since pulled back to 40%, a meager six-point increase for the week. The 30-day gauge has increased by four points from multimonth lows, while the three and six-month IVs have remained largely unchanged, according to Amberdata.  ""We have seen a short-lived pop in the front-end [short duration] IV. So, there are no real signs of panic,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the SEC's action is more damaging to alternative cryptocurrencies, or coins other than bitcoin.  ""IVs have indeed risen, but the rise is not large, and it is mainly concentrated in the front-end [short duration] options,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.  ""The possible reason is that BTC and ETH have already been certified by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, and their derivatives have been traded on compliant exchanges such as CME for several years, while the SEC's prosecution mainly targets altcoins, and many altcoins identified as securities, the impact on BTC and ETH is relatively limited,"" he said.  The SEC, in its lawsuit against Coinbase, mentioned Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Sandbox (SAND), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Internet Computer (ICP), Voyager Token (VGX), NEAR protocol (NEAR), NEXO, FLOW and DASH, driving their prices lower.  Bitcoin has chalked up 3% to 5% daily price moves since Monday in a narrow range of $25,300 to $27,400, CoinDesk data show. Ether has seen a similar range play between $1,800 and $1,900.

The lawsuit against PoolTogether was filed in 2021 and alleged that the platform operated in a way that allowed users to scam consumers and evade financial regulation. Lawsuit Against PoolTogether Dismissed In the ruling dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Frederic Block stated that the federal court system was not the appropriate platform to air concerns related to PoolTogether and its operations. This means that many watchers who were anticipating how the courts would handle matters related to decentralized finance would likely have to wait longer. The lawsuit, filed in 2021 by software engineer Kent was among the first to turn to the courts to rule on how the law would apply to decentralized finance. The judge stated in the order, “While Kent no doubt has genuine concerns about PoolTogether—including its legality under New York law—a suit in federal court is not an appropriate way to address them.” DeFi protocols and applications are designed to be completely anonymous and are governed by a community of token holders instead of the entity or individual that creates them. In the lawsuit, Kent alleged that PoolTogether violated New York State’s gambling laws and allowed users to evade financial regulations and scam customers. In the complaint against PoolTogether, Kent stated that the platform was essentially a lottery. Judge Refuses To Be Drawn In The judge refused to dive into the legal questions raised by the lawsuit, focusing instead on where it belonged. The judge asked Kent’s lawyer if the case was better suited to a state court rather than a federal one. Furthermore, the judge’s statements during the hearing for arguments over the motion to dismiss the lawsuit suggested he would rule in favor of PoolTogether and its investors. PoolTogether Skeptical About Motives PoolTogether and its founder, Leighton Cusack, disputed the lawsuit and, in a motion filed in 2022, sought to have Kent’s claims dismissed or push him to arbitrate the matter. PoolTogether has also questioned whether Kent could bring in a lawsuit against the company in the first place. The platform and other defendants have also questioned Kent’s motives behind the lawsuit, adding that he was not harmed by putting his digital assets. The Judge seemed to agree with these statements, stating that putting funds into PoolTogether was a matter of choice and that it was done willingly by the petitioner. However, the judge also seemed to acknowledge the validity of the questions raised in the lawsuit, stating, “We’re dealing with the exotic world we live in today.

Digital assets underperformed other risk assets in May as trading volumes slumped to a 2-year low, breadth narrowed, and leverage remained muted. Overall, the Metaverse & NFT market remains highly dynamic, with Blend's success in NFT lending and Binance's entry into the space demonstrating the industry's drive for innovation and accessibility. There have been 16 centralized exchanges that have withdrawn from certain regions, half from the United States. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Digital assets underperformed other risk assets in May as trading volumes slumped to a 2-year low, breadth narrowed, and leverage remained muted. For the month, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell 8%, and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) fell 1.5% vs. the S&P 500 +1% and the Nasdaq + 6%. Bitcoin’s annualized 30-day volatility slipped below 30, a 5-month low, while BTC’s weekly correlation with the Nasdaq Composite fell to 20%, an 18-month low. Small and mid-cap coins continued to underperform, down 12% and 11%, respectively, vs. large-caps, down only 4%. We observe a similar ‘consolidation’ theme in both protocol activity & centralized exchange fundamentals: ETH monthly fees and fee share of all smart contract protocols both hit 12-month highs; meanwhile, Coinbase ( COIN ) & Kraken ( KRAK-USD ) aggregate market share of US centralized exchange trading rose to 83%, a YTD high. We count 16 centralized exchanges closing or exiting certain jurisdictions year-to-date, half of whom are leaving the US. Overall, centralized exchanges’ aggregate market share fell to an all-time low vs. decentralized exchanges, a topic we will discuss further below. We think this reflects an acute lack of traditional financing available to crypto exchanges, reduced counterparty exposure appetite by speculators, tougher compliance standards, and improved functionality in DeFi. Layer 1s The total market cap for Smart Contract Blockchains ((SCB)) fell 4% in May from $346B to $333B. Ethereum (-1.5%) and Tron ( TRON-USD )(+11%) outperformed dramatically. Every other token amongst major SCBs was down between 5-35% for the month. The weakest performers in our coverage zone for the month of March included Optimism ( OP-USD )(-35%) and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD )(-15%). Still, despite the muted performance of SCB tokens, fundamental usership was strong as daily active addresses across all SCBs grew 8% from 4.3M to 4.7M. Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Starknet, who grew by +75% and 160%, respectively, in May, were the largest relative gainers in daily active users. Likewise, value accrual also showed strong gains, with total fees by SCBs growing 41% from $368M to $518M. Average Daily Active Users Source: Token Terminal as of 5/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Ethereum was again a notable outperformer, posting exceptional on-chain usership metrics for the month. Additionally, positive news events materialized that improved the Ethereum supply picture by attracting millions in newly staked ETH. At the same time, Ethereum cemented its status as a usage-driven, deflationary monetary system. On the economic activity side, over $438M in fees were generated on Ethereum in the month of May, and this total represents Ethereum’s highest level of fee generation since May 2022. This fee bonanza drove Ethereum’s market share of smart contract blockchain fees to 80%, which also happens to be the highest fee share of Ethereum since May 2022. While overall crypto price volatility was muted, most of Ethereum’s fee increase resulted from meme coin speculation as Ethereum daily fees surpassed $30M a few days in early May. As a result of the trading melee, the average fee for transactions on Ethereum ballooned from $6.15 in April to $9.79 in May. Smart Contract Platform Fees vs Ethereum Market Share of Fees Source: Token Terminal as of 5/31/2023.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. While Ethereum increased its market share of fees and set a yearly high in monthly fees, its usage feats were accomplished amid the inauspicious backdrop of potentially substantial ETH token unlocks. Because Lido ( LDO-USD ), the leading liquid staking provider on Ethereum, enabled its validators to both exit their ETH staking positions as well as unlock their stacking rewards, there was tremendous FUD about the potential for over half a billion dollars of staked ETH to be withdrawn and sold. There was also concern that Celsius ( CEL-USD ), the troubled crypto lender, would be dumping an additional 428k ETH worth $781M into the public markets. However, while 949k ETH were withdrawn from staking in the month of May, this figure was dwarfed by the 3.7M ETH that was staked during the same time period. The supply picture in May was further improved by a burn of 200.4k ETH which contributed to an overall reduced total supply of ETH by 140k ETH in the month. If May’s pace of ETH burn is maintained, it will result in an annual drop of 1.4% in the total supply of Ethereum. Circulating supply, or ETH, which is not locked in staking contracts like Lido, also decreased in the month of May, moving from 100.64M to 96.85M ETH. At the time of writing, 19.4% of all ETH is locked in staking contracts. ETH Supply Dynamics Source: Dune as of 5/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Ethereum’s month was not without its blemishes as an unusual bug in the consensus software caused network issues causing significant block production lapses, resulting in temporary delays in finality on May 12th. In fact, 47 and 149 blocks were not produced in the two incidents, which caused the validators who would have held those leadership slots to miss out on block rewards. The roots of the problems were traced back to a coding error in one of Ethereum’s three consensus clients. But, because Ethereum has three, the network was able to progress past the incidents without terminal consequences for the network requiring drastic intervention by core developers. These issues and their quick resolution may prove to be strong testaments to Ethereum’s potential as a global financial settlement system. The existence of multiple clients helped Ethereum remain resilient throughout the issues as no funds were lost, and block production quickly resumed without issue. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only blockchains with more than one client to run their networks. In summary, an unforeseen surge in economic activity on Ethereum driven by speculation, coupled with vastly improving tokenomics and removing ETH liquidation FUD, enabled ETH’s price to outperform despite technical issues and other SCBs faltering. For more in-depth research on Ethereum, check out our most recent Ethereum valuation . Market Share of SCB Fees ex Ethereum Source: Artemis.xyz as of 5/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Tron, the only other major SCB whose token was positive for the month of May, continued its trend of market share gains. For May, Tron grabbed 77.2% of the fees ex-ETH, and this dominance was up from 75% for April and 50% in June 2022. For example, Tron’s fees in May were 4.7x those of Tron’s most similar competitor – BNB Chain. Tron appears to have carved out a market niche, particularly in emerging markets, as an inexpensive access point where users can cheaply send and interact with stablecoins like Tether ( USDT-USD ). At the time of writing, Tron held around $45B worth of Tether on its blockchain, which is about $9B more USDT than is secured by Ethereum. As a result of growing adoption, Tron hit an all-time high for monthly daily average transactions at 8.58M, which edged out the second-highest total ever, which was April 2023, with 8.47M transactions per day. This makes Tron the second most active blockchain, in terms of transactions, behind Solana. Though, Tron’s figures can be considered even more impressive because the vast majority of Solana’s transactions are either consensus vote transactions, oracle updates, or arbitrage bot trading orders “quote-stuffing” to capture arbitrage opportunities.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Additionally, Tron is the most used Smart Contract Platform, by daily active users, with an average daily user base of 1.8M unique users for the month of May. This is also the highest it has ever been in Tron’s history, and this number overtakes the previous all-time high set for Tron that was set in the month of April. Additionally, Tron’s daily active user base is more than 4x that of Ethereum and around 40% higher than BNB, its closest competitor. Tron’s usage is most likely driven by funds transfers between users’ wallets rather than a more complex financial activity like swaps, trading, and loans. Tron, for example, averages around 50-60% of its transactions as transfers of stablecoin USDT, while 89.7% of all its on-chain activity are simple wallet transfers. Ethereum, by contrast, averages around 8-15% of its transaction volume in stablecoin transfers, and 30-40% of its transactions are wallet transfers. To further highlight the differentiation of Tron’s product market fit, despite having $45B in stablecoins to BNB’s $5.8B, Tron’s DEX volumes average 1/60 th that of BNB’s in 2023. Optimism showed dramatic under-performance in the month of May as it was the worst-performing token, not only among our set of smart contract blockchains but also among the top 100 tokens by crypto market capitalization. The biggest dark cloud hanging over Optimism was the substantial token unlock of OP tokens that more than doubled the circulating token supply. On May 31, more than 386.5M tokens were unlocked for investors and core contributors, with some of these early investments up 10,000% , including seed round funders Paradigm and IDEO. This unlock brings more than $550M worth of OP tokens to the market that can be sold. Additionally, the underperformance of OP can be attributed to decreased on-chain activity and operating income declines. Despite a slight increase in the market share of DEX volume, absolute DEX volume was down 34% between April and May, and the total transaction count was also down 28% for the month of May. For Ethereum Layer-2s, their net margin before incentives is an important component of their financial picture. While Layer-1 blockchains count transaction fees as a revenue item and security fees, paid to validators, as a cost, Layer-2s have a slightly more complicated setup. Since L2 blockchains do not have validators and consensus mechanisms but instead have sequencers to process and order transactions, they must pay their host Layer-1 security fees to settle transactions. Essentially, they must bundle their transactions into a compressed piece of data and post that as a transaction to Layer-1. This transaction must still compete in the gas auction for blockspace, subjecting it to wildly varying transaction costs. A rough measure of L2 profitability can be termed “Operating Income Before Incentives” (OIBI) as it is derived as the transaction revenue earned by an L2 less the settlement fees paid to the L1 for posting the rollup data. Ethereum L2 OIBI Source: Token Terminal as of 5/31/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. While the fees generated on OP were up in the month of May, the OIBI accruing to Optimism was down 13% month to month. This is because the fees paid to Ethereum spiked as the demand for Ethereum’s blockspace surged. When competition for blockspace is high, the cost of settling transactions increases, and L2 OIBI margins will decrease. As the month of May was one of the great demand for Ethereum blockspace, L2s like Optimism saw OIBI drop significantly. Of course, Optimism was not alone in declining profitability due to Ethereum gas costs; Arbitrum’s ( ARB-USD ) OIBI declined 63%, while Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) saw the same line item decline 33%. Considering the OIBI margin of these L2s, Optimism margins have historically been slightly lower than those of Arbitrum or Polygon. Because Polygon is not a true L2 but rather a side chain, its settlement fee structure from Ethereum is much lower. Polygon, because it has its own validator set, uses a technique called state sync to send a snapshot of Polygon’s blockchain state to Ethereum. On the other hand, Arbitrum has achieved higher margins than Optimism because it uses a better-designed virtual machine to process transactions and a more data-streamlined fraud-proof mechanism. As a result, in its current form, Arbitrum has a slight margin advantage over Optimism. From a cost standpoint, rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum have two costs embedded in their fee structure – the cost to roll up all the transactions and post to Ethereum and the cost to transact on the L2. More detailed, the cost for transactions on Optimism breaks down as such: Optimism Transaction Fee = [ Fee Scalar * L1 Gas Price * (Calldata + Fixed Overhead) ] + [ L2 Gas Price * L2 Gas Used ] Despite the massive token unlocks, the future for Optimism still looks bright to us. With the announcement of the OP Stack, a software development kit to create Layer-2 blockchains, projects such as Coinbase’s Base and Kinto intend to build using Optimism’s technology. While these projects may not directly add value to the OP token, the OP token will act as a governance token of the whole ecosystem, which will govern the progression of the SDK software updates going forward and the process towards a decentralized, shared sequencer. This sequencer set will utilize the tokens for governance and potentially even for staking. Additionally, Optimism is on the cusp of releasing an update called Bedrock which will reduce transaction costs by up to 90% through better data compression to minimize costs. Bedrock also reduces deposit times and enables the separation of the roll-up node and the client to create a modular L2 set-up. L2 Monthly Margin Source: Token Terminal as of 5/31/2023.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Avalanche was the other noteworthy underperformer for the month of May, as declining blockchain fundamentals and a large token unlock dragged down AVAX price by 18%. The fundamentals of Avalanche paint an initially deceptive picture. Though monthly active users posted an all-time high on Avalanche, further inspection of the activity driving that figure suggests that the activity is “astroturfed.” Of 732k monthly unique active users recorded on Avalanche in the month of May, 470k, or 64% of the total, interacted with Stargate. If these Stargate users were removed, the MAU total would be only 302k Avalanche monthly active users, which would be the lowest number for Avalanche since September 2022. Despite being the second highest in the last twelve months at $1.34M, monthly fees on Avalanche were a 34% decline from April’s fee total. Additionally, though Avalanche's fees were relatively high, over 10% of the fees were incurred by Stargate, and another 29% were incurred by wallet transfers of AVAX. These figures corresponding to Stargate and the wallet transfers are notable, given that there is great speculation of a Stargate token airdrop. As a result, these figures, and, as a result, the topically positive figures for Avalanche on-chain activity, should be looked at with suspicion. Likewise, there has been a tremendous decline in DEX activity in May compared to April and a drop in TVL. While TVL dropped 11.36%, DEX volume was down a whopping 46%. Avalanche TVL and DEX volume were the lowest monthly figures on record since the doldrums of July 2021 following the Chinese Bitcoin mining ban. The month-to-month drop in DEX volume for Avalanche was the worst among all tracked smart contract blockchains for the month of May, and the TVL decline was the second largest. Additionally, despite all the bridge activity generated by Stargate, bridged tokens to Avalanche fell $65M from $470M to 405M, losing 13.84% of the bridge’s value. To add salt to the wound of deteriorating fundamentals, on May 29, 9.5M AVAX, around 3% of supply, was unlocked, of which 6.2M went to the Avalanche Team and the Avalanche Foundation. Some encouraging developments for Avalanche in the month included the deployment of a Euro stablecoin called EUROC, the announcement of AvaCloud to enable businesses to build no-code blockchains that launch in minutes, the creation of the GoGoPool, which will reduce the cost of operating a validator node, and the transition of the Avalanche X-Chain to the blockchain data structure to smooth the way to future exchange and asset integrations.

DeFi MarketVectors Defi Leaders Index (MVDFLE) fell 9% in May as investors allocated to larger-cap coins amidst weaker overall price performance. Among constituents, UNI fell 3.5%, AAVE -7%, CRV -8%, MKR -9%, and YFI -19%. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi fell slightly from $48.6B to $47.4B. This decrease can be attributed, in part, to the decline in the price of Ether (ETH), the primary collateral used in many DeFi protocols. As the price of ETH dipped, the overall TVL mirrored the trend. One of the most developments in DeFi during May was the substantial rise in decentralized exchange volume compared to centralized exchanges. According to data from The Block, decentralized exchanges accounted for only 14.1% of crypto volume in April. However, they witnessed a significant surge in May, capturing just under 22% of the total volume. This shift was driven by a decline of approximately 30% in centralized exchange volumes, juxtaposed with a growth of around 10% in decentralized exchange volume. The increase in volume was mainly captured by PancakeSwap, which saw an 87% increase in volume this month. Despite the volume growth, the price of PancakeSwap’s governance token, ( CAKE-USD ), fell 36% in May. DEX % of Crypto Spot Volume Source: The Block as of 6/1/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Lending rates in DeFi remained stagnant throughout the month, with the average stablecoin borrow APR hovering around 3.5%. Despite introducing new decentralized stablecoins, their development has not reached a level catalyzing meaningful increases in leverage across the space. This is primarily because these teams have intentionally limited the size of their initial products as a precautionary measure. For instance, Curve's crvUSD ( CRV-USD ) recorded $8.77 million in open loans at a 4.99% APR on $12.93 million of sfrxETH collateral. Similarly, Maker's ( MKR-USD ) newly released Spark protocol attracted just over $10 million of wstETH collateral and enabled $5.1 million in loans. As these protocols mature, they are expected to raise deposit caps and incorporate additional collateral types, thereby fostering wider adoption. One emerging trend we monitor in the DeFi market is the release of liquid-staked ETH-backed stablecoins. This innovation essentially creates a self-repaying loan for investors, as the staked ETH generates yield above that which the investor is paying for their loan. With the growth of liquidity and increased confidence in the peg-resilience of liquid-staked ETH tokens, we think this trend may gain further adoption. We see Yearn ( YFI-USD ) as one of the best protocols for building interest-bearing collateral due to its unique design. The project’s forthcoming yETH vault could capture a significant share of the liquid-staked ETH lending market. A forthcoming blog post will explain this thesis more fully. Metaverse & NFTs Metaverse tokens lagged severely in May, with the MarketVectors media & entertainment leaders index down 17% and little user traction in most of the projects we track. Leading metaverse tokens experienced notable percent changes in May as APE ( APE-USD ) declined by nearly 20%, MANA ( MANA-USD ) dropped by 13.2%, and SAND ( SAND-USD ) witnessed a decrease of 5.4%. Usership of the top metaverse platforms remained relatively stagnant throughout the month, indicating the need for further catalysts to drive growth and engagement. On the other hand, Apple's ( AAPL ) entry into the metaverse space with its upcoming headset has the potential to be a significant catalyst. As the release of Apple's headset draws near, interest in augmented reality ((AR)) and virtual reality ((VR)) has re-emerged, and this anticipation could reignite investors' desire to gain exposure to metaverse tokens once again. Apple's recent announcement, encouraging creators to prepare for building new worlds, has reinvigorated metaverse enthusiasts online and, if their product lives up to the rumors, could revive the “going to work in the metaverse” dream. Among gaming projects, Illuvium ( ILV-USD ) released its highly anticipated private beta 2, introducing a range of new features that sparked some renewed investor interest. ILV rallied off its mid-month low but still ended the month -3% with no significant increase in NFT trading volumes. We have been monitoring the development of this project for over a year now. While determining its viability is hard to make pre-release, the progress and thoughtfulness that we have seen from the team so far are impressive. Overall, NFT sales volume rose 4% in May to $730M from $700M in April. Ethereum maintained its lead with $395 million, Bitcoin followed closely with $192 million, while Solana enabled $44 million in NFT sales volume. These figures highlight the continued dominance of Ethereum in the NFT market and signify the increasing interest and adoption of other blockchain platforms, specifically Bitcoin. May NFT Sales by Blockchain Source: VanEck, Cryptoslam! as of 6/1/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. However, the real standout was the booming NFT lending scene, with Blur’s Blend leading the way. Blend recorded over $335M in borrow volume and $130M in loan repayment volume. Blend's borrows accounted for about 80% of the ETH borrowed on NFT collateral in May. This surge in NFT lending showcases the increasing demand for leveraging NFT assets to unlock liquidity and create new financialization opportunities. In a move to compete with the existing NFT lending platforms, especially Blend, Binance ( BNB-USD ) announced the development of its own NFT lending marketplace. The platform, launched at the end of May, provides users with an alternative option for utilizing NFT collateral. Binance's entry into the market adds an exciting layer of centralized competition and is expected to bring further innovation and accessibility to the NFT lending space. Specifically, the cost and success of Binance’s user incentivization should provide interesting data compared to Blur’s airdropped rewards method. Blend: First Month Results Source: Dune: @ahkek, VanEck as of 5/29/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The conclusion of the month brought news of Kellogg 's ( K ) potential expansion efforts into the metaverse, as the renowned American cereal giant filed a dozen trademarks for its portfolio of brands. Documents revealed that Kellogg's has strategic plans to utilize its intellectual property by creating branded NFTs. This move signifies Kellogg's recognition of the growing significance of the metaverse and its intention to leverage its brand assets within this emerging digital landscape. Overall, the Metaverse & NFT market remains highly dynamic, with Blend's success in NFT lending and Binance's entry into the space demonstrating the industry's drive for innovation and accessibility. And while Ethereum continues to lead in sales volume, other platforms like Bitcoin are carving their own paths in the NFT landscape. We are hopeful that Fortune 500 companies like Kellogg and Apple will eventually catalyze mass adoption of NFTs as a direct-to-consumer loyalty protocol or B2B as a ticket to unlock subscriptions and other services. Ethereum upgrades, such as account abstraction, should help unlock this utility. On the other hand, most gaming & metaverse tokens are plagued by lackluster user traction and still-inflated valuations. We are on the lookout for users before deploying more aggressively into this space.

Brooks had resigned as the CEO of Binance.US in August 2021, just months after taking the position. Shadow CEO Court documents cited Brooks in a transcript linked to documents regarding the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s case against Binance, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Bam Trading, and Bam Management. In the interview transcript with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Brooks was asked about his role as the head of Binance.US; Brooks stated, “I did not work for Binance.com, that nobody at Binance.com was my boss, and that my role was to complete and highlight the corporate separateness. So when I talked to CZ, I considered myself to be talking to him in his role as board chair of BAM Trading. What became clear to me at a certain point was [that] CZ was the CEO of BAM Trading, not me…That wasn’t because Binance.com somehow controlled us, but again, he owns the vast majority of Binance.com, so I put that aside.” At the time of resigning, Brooks stated that he was leaving his position as the CEO of Binance.US because of differences over strategic direction. Brooks held his position at the American arm of Binance for only three months. The SEC’s Case Against Binance The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on Monday. The lawsuit contained 13 charges, including allegations of fraud and co-mingling of customer assets. The action came after months of threats, warnings, and discussions, with the exchange and Zhao accused of operating a “web of deception.” The filing against Binance also includes quotes from multiple unnamed Binance executives, which it stated were acknowledging that they were running Binance.com as an unregistered securities exchange in the US. It also quoted Zhao as seeking ways to keep its VIP customers. According to the lawsuit, Zhao, in a weekly meeting with senior company officials, stated, “We don’t want to lose all the VIPs, which actually contribute to quite a large number of volume. So ideally, we would help them facilitate registering companies or moving the trading volume offshore in some way—in a way that we can accept without them being labeled completely US to us.” Binance Reacts Binance handles billions worth of investments for small and established investors and also sponsors Italian Serie A team Lazio and the Argentina National team. The action on the exchange is part of a wider crackdown on crypto initiated by the SEC, which began after the collapse of FTX. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been charged with several offenses, including securities fraud and money laundering. Reacting to the SEC lawsuit, Binance stated that it was “disheartened and disappointed” with the SEC lawsuit. It added that it had extensively discussed with the regulator to reach a negotiated settlement. “Most recently, we have engaged in extensive good-faith discussions to reach a negotiated settlement to resolve their investigations. But despite our efforts, with its complaint…the SEC abandoned that process and instead chose to act unilaterally and litigate.” The SEC also added that it had filed a temporary restraining order against BAM Trading, BAM Management, which oversees Binance.US operations, and against Binance. If the order is granted, it would look to freeze the assets of BAM Trading and BAM Management. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

13616445,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536976,1686217521,Less Than 100 XRP Needed To Become A Millionaire? New Research Suggests,"Valhil Capital has published a new research paper assessing the fair value of XRP, and the results are astronomical. The private equity firm explains in the research paper, using six pricing models, that the fair value is somewhere between $3,500 and $21,900 per token. So, as one community member pointed out, it would only take 77.9 XRP to become a millionaire at the median price of $12,822. Even at the most conservative projection of $3,500, 285.8 XRP would be enough to become a dollar millionaire. XRP Price To The Moon? Molly Elmore, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at Valhil Capital, shared the whitepaper titled “A Comprehensive Approach To Determine The Fair Market Value Of XRP” via Twitter. According to her, the document is the result of an extensive two-year research conducted by a “larger group of individuals,” the “confidential committee.” The origin of the effort was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, which raised the question: if the SEC’s lawsuit harmed retail investors, how could financial damages be calculated? To do this, Valhil Capital argues that it is necessary to examine the extent to which the lawsuit prevented the adoption of the XRP Ledger from realizing its intended use case. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Blasts SEC Chair For Anti-Innovation Stance, XRP Bulls Remain Optimistic Because of this, the concept of fair market value came into discussion, and how it differs from market value. To assess the fair value, the Confidential Committee formed a smaller Valuation Committee in the fall of 2022, composed of individuals who had experience with quantitative and financial valuations. As a result, the Committee establishes six pricing models: Pipeline Flow Model, Athey and Mitchnick Model, 99-Year Golden Eagle Model, Discounted Cash Flow Model, Collateral Model, and a Quantum Liquidity Model. All models relate to various factors, including market conditions, supply and demand, and other relevant considerations. However, the most important driver of the asset price, according to the analysis, is the extent to which the world decides to use XRP to store wealth. According to the white paper, this will happen after people see a modest increase in price from using the asset. For example, the pipeline flow model looks at transaction volume, store of value, supply and demand interaction factors, and the interaction dynamics of competition. It assumes that there will be a “big bang” event triggered by the FX trading volume on the XRPL suddenly exploding. The Theses And Projections Are Controversial It should be noted that the thesis of Valhil Capital should be taken with a grain of salt. Even in the XRP community, founder Jimmy Vallee and his buyback theory are more than controversial. Related Reading: US SEC Sues Binance, Fails To Mention Ripple (XRP) As Security Various well-known members of the community, such as attorney John E. Deaton and CryptoEri have distanced themselves from the buyback theory. Deaton made it clear in February of this year that he will not accept any money from Vallee for his efforts in the Ripple and LBRY cases. The XRP buyback theory dates back to 2021. According to Vallee, XRP will become the world’s reserve currency when government debt reaches unsustainable levels. He posits that this is only possible if governments buy large amounts of XRP, at a much higher price than currently. At press time, the XRP price stood at $0.5209.

42393440,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhXYbL,1686214729,Social Media Targeted in EU Consumer Group Complaint About Crypto Ads,"BEUC, an umbrella group of European consumer organizations, filed a complaint with European Union consumer protection bodies calling for Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter to toughen their crypto advertising rules.  National regulators should require social media networks to tighten their policies and ban influencers from promoting crypto, the complaint said.  “Consumers are increasingly being promised ‘get rich quick’ investments by ads and influencers on social media,” Director General Monique Goyens said in a statement. “Unfortunately, in most cases, these claims are too good to be true and consumers are at a high risk of losing a lot of money without recourse to justice.""  Under the EU’s forthcoming Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, crypto providers will need a license to advertise across the bloc, and the parallel Digital Services Act imposes extra constraints on large online platforms.  BEUC said extra measures are nevertheless needed under existing consumer laws that prohibit unfair commercial practices because crypto scams could expose people to heavy financial losses.  “Crypto promotion is all over the place, you see it on primetime TV,” Goyens told reporters. She added she was “not a fan any more of Matt Damon” and was “boycotting” soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, stars of recent promotions linked to crypto.com and Binance.  “Online platforms have a duty and an obligation of professional diligence” under EU rules to counter unfair commerce, Goyens added, saying that some networks are breaching their own ad policies.  In theory, national consumer authorities can levy fines on transgressors of consumer law, though Goyens said she wanted sanctions to be tougher. In a case last year, TikTok promised to comply with EU strictures after BEUC complained of hidden marketing and aggressive ads targeting children.  BEUC staffer Agustín Reyna told reporters that social media networks took different approaches to moderating content, but he expected that if they could not stop interactions with misleading material that they should ban all crypto promotions outright.  France recently passed landmark legislation to regulate influencers – social media users who use their clout to promote goods and services. Under the law, crypto promotions will be allowed only for crypto firms that are registered with regulators.  CoinDesk has reached out to Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube for comment.

The SEC’s Crypto Witch Hunt This week, the SEC launched an attack on crypto by suing Coinbase and rival exchange Binance.

The SEC’s declaration of some tokens as securities has caused doubt in the industry.

The layer one blockchain can now authentically be labeled as the public chain of choice, with the most daily active users, the most daily transactions, and the largest circulation of the stablecoin USDT. Impressing the industry with one achievement after another, it has grown into the global leader among all public chains. As the number of comparable chains and competitive options has exponentially increased, TRON continues to stand out with its second-to-none performance, scalability, and security, attracting masses of developers and users worldwide. Following TRON's anniversary, on June 1, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) began accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses. As a top-tier public chain, TRON has promised full support for Hong Kong's Web3 ambitions to become a crypto hub of the world. TRON was founded by H.E. Justin Sun in 2017, and its MainNet went live on May 31, 2018. Five years into the launch of its MainNet, TRON now has over 165M users worldwide and has processed more than 5.7B transactions. According to DeFiLlama, it also outshines the pack with a TVL (Total Value Locked) second only to Ethereum. TRON has established a robust commerce infrastructure via partnerships across the industry. It has become the global stablecoin highway for USDT, USDC, TUSD, USDJ, and USDD. According to the data on Tether's website, the supply of TRC20-USDT has exceeded 46.1B, now 10B more than the Ethereum-native ERC20-USDT, accounting for 60% of USDT's total supply. Powered by a secure, cost-effective, and efficient underlying blockchain, the TRC-20 protocol launched by TRON has become the go-to choice among on-chain users. In addition, TRON has developed a well-rounded ecosystem covering the hotly contested fields in the sector, including DeFi, NFT, GameFi, stablecoins, the metaverse, cross-chain solutions, and DIDs, with the commitment of a group of active developers. TRON aims to elevate its on-chain stablecoin market cap to $100B in 2023 and strives to become the preferred choice for stablecoin users around the world. In October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, and seven TRON-based utility tokens were granted statutory status as authorized digital currencies for use in everyday commerce there. This collaboration blazed a trail for blockchain projects to explore technology application and development with sovereign nations. The next five years look to be as exciting as the previous five. The TRON DAO team is confident they work hard to delve deeper into blockchain tech development by welcoming more and more projects and protocols into the ecosystem to #BUIDLtheFUTURE on TRON. An essential player in propelling the global digital economy forward, TRON strives to empower decentralized commerce and community for every person on the planet. About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of June 2023, it has over 165.1 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 5.79 billion total transactions, and over $12.0 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.

The firm's U.S. arm filed for bankruptcy on May 8 after regulators accused it of operating an unlawful securities exchange and after it reached a settlement worth around $30 million with the Treasury for allowing business from customers in Iran, Cuba and Crimea.  Four days later, the company sought court permission to let customers withdraw their holdings without the expense and delay of litigation. The U.S. government, whose Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is owed $5 million, says it’s not right to play favorites.  “Siloing creditors into subordinated classes outside of the confirmation hearing is improper,” the government’s filing said. The Bittrex companies “have not demonstrated why the issues of ownership of cryptocurrency assets needs to be determined prior to the confirmation of the [bankruptcy] plan.”  Bittrex’s U.S. arm holds $50 million in customer cash and $250 million in customer crypto. The Maltese operating company, which also filed for bankruptcy, has $120 million in customer cash and crypto, and both have enough assets to honor withdrawals, lawyers representing the company have previously told the Delaware court.  Previous interventions by the government have proved decisive in scuppering crypto bankruptcy plans. An offer from Binance to buy the assets of defunct crypto lender Voyager was abandoned after delays caused by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which argued the fine print would have absolved those involved from breaches of tax or securities law. The SEC has since sued Binance.

The lack of sudden capital flight suggests positive sentiment among global market participants, despite falling prices. BNB coin (BNB) fell to six-month lows on Wednesday, while prices of Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA, Polygon's MATIC, and other tokens also tumbled.  In separate filings on Monday and Tuesday, the SEC charged Binance and Coinbase (COIN) with selling unlicensed securities in the country.  The charges came despite a lack of regulatory clarity from the regulator on whether crypto tokens can be considered securities. The SEC has not given any official legal definitions to token issuers and is yet to respond to a petition from Coinbase seeking clear rulemaking definitions.  Read more: One-Two Punch Finally Registers SEC View on Binance, Coinbase, Rest of Crypto  DeFi avenues remain unfazed, at least as of Thursday. Data shows value locked on Cardano, Solana and BNB Chain networks fell just over 5% in the past week – in line with a broader market decline. These declines hovered at just over 1% on a monthly basis, the data show.  DeFi continues to be resilient  Some market observers opined that the lack of capital from DeFi applications was suggestive of the type of market participant that dominates the current climate.  “It’s been a long crypto winter and the majority of 'tourists' have already left the space,” shared Kyle Doane, trader at crypto investment firm Arca, in an email to CoinDesk. “The remaining participants are most likely more dedicated believers and thus less affected by the latest actions from the SEC.”  ""The tokens themselves being deemed securities have nothing to do with the viability of the underlying tech of DeFi and does not make the tokens/dApps any more or less valuable. These forces will likely only drive more financial activity to DeFi,” Doane added.  Martin Lee, an analyst at crypto analytics firm Nansen, shared the sentiment. “We’re not seeing any massive changes in number of users or transactions on Polygon, Solana and BNB Chain and they’ve largely remained within similar levels as they’ve been in the past month,” Lee said.  “Personal view is that until regulation is enforced and these tokens are officially classified as securities, it’s unlikely that we see a significant impact on the ecosystems,” he added.  As such, while the Polygon network saw sudden withdrawals following the alleged classification of MATIC tokens as security in the U.S., the volumes remain muted based on a long-term analysis, shared Julio Moreno, head of research at analytics firm CryptoQuant.  “From the perspective of people withdrawing from Polygon network to Ethereum network there has been a spike after the SEC mentioned MATIC as a security, as the chart shows,” Moreno said, pointing to the $2.5 million in withdrawals on Tuesday.  “However, from a historical perspective, these withdrawal volumes remain low,” he added.

Bitcoin has sold off, but the chart still looks very bullish to me. If we are beginning another leg up in Bitcoin, I expect altcoins will outperform. Thesis Summary Following a 100% price increase, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has sold off 20% since reaching local highs back in April. And yet, sentiment right now would suggest that we are getting ready to make new lows. A lot of this negativity can also be attributed to the recent actions of the SEC against major exchanges. And yet, the technical picture remains bullish, and what we have now is a good opportunity to buy BTC at support. This could break, and lower lows would follow, but the Risk/reward is good here for a long trade. If BTC holds and a rally ensues, I expect altcoins to begin to outperform. Are you positioned for this? Fear Is In The Air Crypto is under attack, again, as I recently wrote about in this piece . The SEC has issued lawsuits against Binance ( BNB-USD ) and Coinbase ( COIN ); Binance and its CEO Zhao have been accused of running a “ web of deception” , while Coinbase is under investigation for listing 13 crypto assets that should have been registered. The reality of the matter is that the SEC has been very unclear on its crypto regulations, and at the very least Coinbase, has done everything in its power to comply with regulations. The company’s CEO well summarized this on Twitter: 1. The SEC reviewed our business and allowed us to become a public company in 2021. 2. There is no path to ""come in and register"" - we tried, repeatedly - so we don't list securities. We reject the vast majority of assets we review. 3. The SEC and CFTC have made conflicting statements, and don't even agree on what is a security and what is a commodity…. Source: Brian Armstrong In any case, the effects of this debacle have been felt across the crypto industry, with cryptocurrencies selling off across the board. With that said, looking at the larger picture, BTC has only given up a small part of its 2023 gains, and from a technical perspective, this sell-off was expected, and we are still well on track to continue an upward trend. Technical Outlook Still Bullish Let’s begin by zooming into the 4h chart. BTC 4h chart (TradingView) From an EWT perspective, we topped in March in a wave 1, inside a larger (3) not visible here. We have since formed a corrective structure that now looks like it could be complete. We have a completed ABC and we can even clearly see the five waves inside of C. For the moment, we have rebounded just above $25,300, which is just above the 50% retracement of the wave 1. It is also exactly above the lower channel trendline and exactly at the top of an inverse head and shoulders neckline. This is more clear if we zoom out to the daily chart. BTC 1D chart (TradingView) We can make an argument that we have formed an inverse head and shoulders shown by the black curves. The black line is the neckline, and this is exactly where we have reversed. Holding above this keeps the momentum up. From a charting perspective, we can also appreciate a cup and handle, which would also suggest a breakout to the upside. And finally, it’s worth mentioning that we are still within the large channel we have formed since the bottom. To sum up, why are you bearish here? The structure is still very much bullish. We are testing support, something that happens even in bull markets. This is a good opportunity to accumulate or enter a trade with a tight stop. Having said that, if we do brake support then the 61.8% retracement at $23,300 is the next key support. Arguably, this would get the RSI on the daily chart back to the oversold levels that, in recent sell-offs, have led to strong reversals. If we break below support and quickly bounce back into the channel, then we could still count this as a fake-out. Of course, if we were to stay beneath $25,000 for an extended period of time, I would have to reconsider this more immediate bullish outlook. It Won’t Just Be Bitcoin Just on a side note, there’s also a lot of reasons fundamentally to be bullish on Bitcoin, but I have covered these extensively already. In short, I expect global liquidity will begin to increase soon. To wrap up this article, I did want to alert you that I expect the next crypto bull run to be led by the altcoins. Bitcoin has outperformed so far this year, and I think a rotation into altcoins is beginning. It is a consensus idea that altcoin usually begins with outperformance in Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the largest altcoin there is. And what do we see in the ETHBTC chart? ETHBTC (TradingView) After forming a large wedge over the last few months, we have finally got a breakout in the ETHBTC chart. In other words, ETH is beginning to outperform, and the smaller cryptocurrencies will be next. The right altcoins could provide investors with very high returns, and I cover these extensively for my subscribers. Takeaway In conclusion, now is the time to take a risk as Bitcoin hovers above support. If we break below, we might have to reassess, but this is not my primary expectation. The next step for Bitcoin is the $44,000 area, which is the 1.618 ext of the large wave 1, visible in the daily chart. However, I suggest you pay close attention to the alts. These are riskier but also offer a much higher reward.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4610216-bitcoin-fear-is-in-the-air?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13614355.jpeg

42393441,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhXYWD,1686211743,UK Lawmakers Clash Over Government Plans to Regulate Crypto as Financial Services,"U.K. lawmakers appear to be divided on how crypto should be treated by the country's regulators. While some are suggesting crypto is akin to gambling, others support the government’s efforts to bring digital assets into the scope of existing financial services regulation.  Last month, the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee – made up of 11 members of Parliament – recommended that crypto should be treated like gambling “because it has no intrinsic value and huge price volatility.” The suggestion was met with instant industry backlash, and more recently opposed by other lawmakers.  An All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for crypto assets, made up of 15 members of Parliament and Lords (from the upper chamber), released its own report on Monday, which backed the government’s proposal to treat crypto as regulated financial services.  “The APPG supports the position of HM Treasury that cryptocurrency and digital assets are best regulated, in so far as is possible and appropriate, within existing and new financial services regulations, which has a track record in mitigating risks to consumers and investors,” the report said.  Read more: UK Lawmakers Call for a Dedicated Government Role to Oversee Crypto Regulation  At an event marking the publication of the APPG crypto report on Monday, Chair Lisa Cameron listed some reasons why it supports the government's position to treat crypto as financial services – chief among them being tax collection.  “I like people to pay tax when they make gains in the U.K. and it's very important that that's harnessed and that can only be achieved under the financial services regulation rather than gambling,” Cameron said.  Winnings from gambling are not taxed, whereas gains on investments usually are, Diego Ballon Ossio, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance’s London practice told CoinDesk in a statement.  The other reason crypto should be treated like a financial service is so that the U.K. has commonalities with other jurisdictions when it comes to their financial services regulations, Cameron said.  Although global standard-setters are working on norms for crypto, individual jurisdictions have largely differed on their approach to regulating the sector. The U.K.’s immediate neighbor, the European Union, recently sealed the text on a bespoke regime for crypto asset regulation, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a series of enforcement actions arguing a range of crypto assets qualify as securities.  Cameron said the U.K.’s financial services regulations offer the best and most robust protections possible for local consumers.  “Risks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it’s financial services regulation – rather than gambling regulation – that has the track record in mitigating them,“ a spokesperson for the finance ministry said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  The U.K. government has said it wants to bring forward specific crypto regulations in phases. The first step includes passing the new Financial Services and Markets Bill that is set to give multiple regulators more powers to supervise crypto.  After the bill passes, the detailed laws that bring crypto into the regulatory fold would need to be agreed on by both houses of Parliament, Ballon Ossio told CoinDesk last month.

42397004,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAZMoi0,1686211200,Stablecoin Regulation Is a Sticking Point Between the G7 and G20,"Global leaders are setting up universal rules and standards for the crypto sector after its headline-making implosion last year. While they appear to have reached a consensus on most things, advanced and emerging economies seem to be diverging on the treatment of stablecoins, CoinDesk has learned from two senior officials involved in key discussions.  Advanced economies that make up the Group of Seven (G7) appear more open to allowing and regulating stablecoins, which are tied to the value of other assets such as fiat currencies. But emerging economies represented in the wider grouping G20 are calling for tougher restrictions, or even prohibitions, over concerns that widespread stablecoin use could present a relatively greater threat to monetary policy in these jurisdictions.  Disagreements between the two bodies could potentially stall the acceptance of global norms for stablecoins, or at least threaten to fragment the unified oversight envisioned by financial regulators around the world, the officials said. However, as the FSB also points out, its standards allow countries some flexibility in implementing the rules according to their varying needs, the officials added.  “I don’t personally think the introduction of crypto assets or stablecoins could seriously or adversely affect the macro economy or impact monetary policy of the U.S., Euro area or Japan. But macro-financial implications are much more significant in emerging markets,” said Toshiyuki Miyoshi, deputy director-general of the Supervision Bureau at Japan’s Financial Services Agency, which is also part of the nation’s G7 presidential efforts in shaping global crypto rules.  With regards to stablecoins, advanced economies “don’t have any worries,” but “emerging economies have major concerns,” said a senior official of the G20 not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. “Stablecoin regulation is a point of difference.”  Global regulators sprung into action after the collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin in May 2022 caused nearly $60 billion to evaporate from markets, even though some regulators have said such implosions in crypto have had no direct impact on broader financial stability.  Global Norms  The two groupings of nations have committed to taking the lead on framing globally coordinated norms for crypto. Japan and India currently hold presidencies of the G7 and the G20 respectively. The G20 is made up of the G7 jurisdictions, along with 13 others, including 10 emerging economies.  Together, the two bodies, to varying degrees, are relying on global standard-setters such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to make relevant recommendations and rules for the sector.  While both groupings have vowed to implement FATF’s anti-money laundering rules for crypto, recent statements made by the forums have indicated differences in how they view the treatment of stablecoins.  The G7, for instance, has said its nations will align with the FSB’s recommendations for stablecoins, which are focused on the impact of stablecoin use on wider financial stability. Meanwhile, the G20 is looking to align with a more nuanced synthesis paper jointly produced by the IMF and the FSB expected between September and October.  Two approaches  The G7 and the G20 have indicated different degrees of commitment towards framing global crypto policy.  The G7 has pushed for tighter norms and signaled its commitment to implementing the FSB’s norms for regulating crypto assets and the IMF’s recommendations on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The FSB’s individual recommendations for regulating crypto and stablecoins are expected in July 2023.  “We, the G7, strongly support the finalization of the FSBs two sets of high level recommendations, one on crypto asset activities and markets, and the other on stablecoin arrangements,” Miyoshi said.  India, meanwhile, used its agenda-setting power as G20 president to bring in the IMF to lead consultations as the FSB, the de facto leader of framing global crypto rules, was seen to align more with the U.S. India’s actions may reflect a desire to not alienate its old ally Russia following the invasion of Ukraine by allowing the FSB to shape critical financial policy, CoinDesk reported earlier, citing a policy consultant to India’s finance ministry.  Miyoshi said the FSB's recommendations, which focus more on financial stability and regulatory issues will “surely be finalized,” in July. The IMF, meanwhile, is trying to “see the crypto asset phenomena from the perspective of macro-financial implications and not just financial stability,” he said, adding there may be “some time for further discussion on the macro-financial part,” that the IMF and FSB are jointly looking at.  The IMF-FSB synthesis paper is “also focused on crypto’s implications for monetary policy, capital flows, international monetary system, or tax revenues,” Miyoshi added.  Concerns of emerging economies  Emerging economies are concerned about stablecoins because of their potential impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy if widely used, according to Miyoshi. Monetary policies are measures set by a country’s central bank to control the supply of money in the economy and achieve growth.  “If, for example, USD-denominated stablecoins were introduced and began circulating in very small emerging markets, that could hurt the effectiveness of their monetary policy or make capital flows in those nations more volatile,” Miyoshi said. He added that it’s “hard to imagine” that the dollar or euro “could be replaced by a stablecoin if it circulated” in G7 jurisdictions, which include the U.S., U.K., Canada and Japan.  “But in developing economies where monetary policy or foreign exchange regimes are not robust, the risk of currency substitution exists,” Miyoshi said. If stablecoins become widespread in emerging economies, it could also impact the effectiveness of their tax collection and revenue, Miyoshi and the G20 official said.  The “international community will make the best efforts to agree on this,” Miyoshi said, indicating the G7 might agree to a compromise. “The concern of G20 economies around stablecoins may be allayed by the FSB recommending comprehensive stablecoin regulations.”  It’s not clear whether that will be enough for certain emerging economies that may want to simply disallow any stablecoins.  The FSB and the IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The popular meme coin, known for its adorable dog-themed branding, has struggled to reverse its declining price trajectory in recent months. Despite the initial hype and enthusiasm surrounding SHIB, the coin has faced an uphill battle in the volatile market of digital currencies. As the price continued to backpedal, the community of SHIB holders and supporters looked to the long-awaited support level as a potential turning point for the beleaguered cryptocurrency. However, the road to recovery remains uncertain, with SHIB struggling to regain its former glory. Related Reading: Now That Optimism ‘Bedrock’ Hard Fork Is Done, What Can We Expect? Shiba Inu: ‘Final Destination’ Support Is Reached Shiba Inu has finally reached what market observers have dubbed its “Final Destination” support level, a significant price point of $0.000008 that has long been regarded as a crucial roadblock for a potential trend reversal. Source: TradingView A lot of people were anticipating a big spike in the price of SHIB, seeing it as a turning point for the token. They were expecting a spike that would mark a turning point and take SHIB to greater heights. But despite periodic outbursts of excitement and temporary rallies that fueled optimism, the token has struggled to make any real headway. SHIB holders are at a crossroads, uncertain about the future direction of the cryptocurrency, due to the absence of persistent upward momentum. The meme coin is under more scrutiny than ever before, and investors are being prompted to rethink their approaches in light of this crucial juncture. SHIB market cap drops below the $5 billion handle. Chart: TradingView.com The $0.000008 level holds particular significance as it is considered a robust support level that has historically acted as a springboard for price recoveries. The failure of SHIB to gain momentum and break out significantly from this crucial support level has left investors and analysts uncertain about the token’s future trajectory.

These lawsuits sent shockwaves throughout the crypto industry, leaving investors and traders on edge.

The funds were sent to firms controlled by Zhao via an intermediary holding company known as Key Vision Development Limited, the SEC said.  The evidence for these allegations comes via testimony delivered by Sachin Verma, an accountant employed by the SEC, which will be used as part of the regulator's arguments to request the court to sign a temporary restraining order to freeze assets on Binance.US.  “The SEC has been unable to determine why a Zhao-controlled entity that was purportedly trading on the Binance.US Platform using Zhao’s personal funds would have acted as a 'pass through' account for billions of dollars of Binance Platforms customers’ funds,” the court filing reads.  The SEC alleges, via Verma’s forensic analysis of the bank statements of Binance and Zhao’s web of companies, that $12 billion was sent to Zhao and $162 million to a Guangying Chen-controlled company in Singapore.  Chen and Zhao controlled a number of companies with no obvious connection to Binance in their name, the documents show. The SEC says that the majority of the funds sent to Zhao and Chen are now in accounts “offshore.”  Chen is Binance’s back office and financial manager. A recent report said that she controlled accounts belonging to Binance.US, a contradiction of the unit’s supposed independence.  Binance has publicly denied mixing customer deposits and company funds, and has said that Merit Peak is a vehicle for CZ to trade his “self-made wealth.”  The SEC has been investigating Binance.US since at least 2020 and alleges that Binance held custody of its U.S. affiliate’s assets until December 2022, despite assuring regulators and the public they were separate entities.  Binance and the SEC have a court date set for June 13 regarding the restraining order.  Zhao said on Twitter that the allegation was ""simply false.""  In a statement, a Binance spokesperson said the referenced funds were ""strictly corporate funds and not user assets.""  ""Binance’s top priority is protecting user assets, which are held 1:1. These accounts represent revenue received by the business for products provided and/or services rendered,"" the spokesperson said. ""Like every other company across the globe, our revenue is used to cover the operational costs of running our global business.

13606751,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536951,1686193226,Bitcoin Is Reportedly Trading At a $2k Premium on Binance.US,"According to sources on June 6, Bitcoin is trading at a $2,000 premium on Binance US, an exchange the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims is controlled by Changpeng Zhao and Binance Global. According to screenshots widely circulated on Twitter, BTC, at one point, was reportedly trading at $28,505, a price level that was roughly $2,000 higher than the global BTC average of around $26,500 at the time. Bitcoin Trading At A $2,000 Premium on Binance US From price charts, Bitcoin remains volatile even at spot rates. Less than 24 hours after slumping to as low as $25,900 on June 5, the coin reversed losses on June 6. Yesterday, the price of BTC surged, reaching levels as high as $27,000. This upward movement contradicted the bearish forecasts that analysts had previously made for June 5. Additionally, this positive price movement helped alleviate concerns that the SEC lawsuit against Binance would hurt the value of BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin 24-Hour Volatility Soars, Why Bulls Could Win Fight In Short-Term Tumbling Bitcoin and crypto prices on June 5 coincided with accusations from the US regulator. The SEC listed 13 charges against Binance, including that together with the Binance US, the exchange allegedly enabled US citizens to illegally trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the SEC pressed that Binance and Binance US were unregistered trading platforms that continue to offer “multiple unregistered offers and investment schemes” aimed at “defrauding equity, retail, and institutional investors about purported surveillance and controls over manipulative trading.” In response to the SEC’s lawsuit, on-chain data from Nansen shows that investors have continued to pull billions worth of crypto assets from Binance Global and Binance US. The analytics platform observes that over $3 billion of assets from multiple chains have been withdrawn from Binance. Out of this, over $1.3 billion was from Ethereum. Intervention Fueling Bitcoin’s Demand Meanwhile, Binance.US has suspended its over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform and reduced the number of supported trading pairs. The announcement of Binance US’ changes affects roughly 90 pairs of the USDT, BTC, and BUSD pairs. It is also unclear when Binance US will resume its OTC trading services. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Soar To Major Highs Soon, Here’s Why Furthermore, Binance US has reduced the trade and convert options to USDC, USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some of the top crypto assets, including Cardano’s ADA. However, while there is a limitation on which assets existing clients can convert to, Binance US has placed caps on the maximum buy, sell, and convert options to USD at $10,000. The suspension of the Binance US OTC platform and caps on USD conversion and assets could explain why Bitcoin is a highly sought asset and trading at a $2k premium in the United States for clients who used Binance US. SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have previously stated that Bitcoin is a commodity.

As Binance faces a suit from the SEC, these lawyers say the history between Gensler and Binance means that Gensler should recuse himself from the case.  In March 2019, Binance’s counsel wrote, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao and Gensler had an in-person lunch meeting in Japan where they discussed the BNB token and Binance opening an exchange in the U.S.  The two remained in touch after the meeting, and “Zhao understood that the now-Chairman was comfortable serving as an informal advisor,"" something that Gensler himself offered, said the letter, which was shared by the SEC in a court filing.  “Mr. Gensler should have been recused from any consideration in this matter based on this history and the prospect that Mr. Gensler may be a material fact witness,” Binance’s counsel wrote. “To date, the Staff has never confirmed whether Mr. Gensler has recused himself, and if he has not, the Commission’s explanation for why not.”  The letter indicated that Gensler was scheduled to provide testimony before the House Financial Services Committee in 2019, and prior to this hearing, he forwarded a copy of his planned statement to Zhao for advice.  In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that “Gensler was approached by multiple private firms including Binance to be an adviser” but this new letter makes it appear that Gensler himself pitched Binance on the idea.  Binance lawyers said the SEC has not confirmed if Gensler will be recused from the case.  Shortly after the SEC launched its suit against Binance, it filed for a temporary restraining order to freeze all assets on Binance.US. The two are due back in court on June 13 with regards to the order.

However, the coin has experienced a sharp decline in value following the recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint against Binance.US and increased regulatory oversight by the US watchdog. Currently, BNB is trading at $260, down by over 7% and 14% in 24 hours and the last seven days, respectively. This drop has been attributed to the recent regulatory scrutiny, as well as broader market trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin 24-Hour Volatility Soars, Why Bulls Could Win Fight In Short-Term BNB Price Drop Spells Trouble The BNB bridge suffered an exploit that has put Binance Coin in a precarious position, with a potential liquidation of $200 million on Venus Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) looming if the price drops by 14% to $220. Venus DAO is a community-driven organization that governs the Venus Protocol, which is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform built on the Binance Smart Chain. The Venus Protocol allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, and earn interest on their holdings. According to the researcher DeFi Ignas, the exploit occurred on October 7th, 2022, when an attacker minted 2 million BNB ($593 million)) and deposited 900,000 BNB as collateral to Venus. They then borrowed other assets on Venus to launder as much money as possible. This is the single largest potential liquidation in all of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and cannot be closed. Following the exploit, BNB Chain was halted to upgrade the network, and the Binance Bridge hack now ranks as the third-largest overall hack. All three of the top hacks have been cross-chain bridge exploits, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the DeFi ecosystem. According to Ignas, to prevent any cascading liquidations, the BNB Chain will liquidate the position itself. However, the good news is that Venus DAO has voted to whitelist BNB Chain as the sole liquidator of the BNB exploiter address. This move should help to prevent any further market disruptions and provide some stability to the market. Binance.US Netflow Plummets Blockchain and data research firm Nansen has reported that the net outflows from major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase have decreased in the 24 hours following the news of the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase.

In the past 24 hours, the meme-coin has seen a decline of nearly 4% on its chart. Looking at the weekly chart, SHIB has depreciated by 6%. The technical analysis of SHIB reflects a prevailing bearish sentiment, with a decrease in demand and accumulation observed on the chart. As Bitcoin has demonstrated high volatility, SHIB has struggled to surpass its immediate resistance level. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Must Uphold This Critical Support Line For Potential 8% Rally However, if Bitcoin manages to maintain its recovery following a significant price plunge, there is a possibility of SHIB making a price comeback. This would require a decline in selling pressure over the subsequent trading sessions. To further confirm the negative price action, SHIB has broken below a formation that indicates bearish strength in the market. The market capitalization of SHIB has declined, indicating low buying strength on the one-day chart. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.0000080. However, the bulls encountered resistance at $0.0000083, leading to a continuation of the coin’s downtrend. The immediate overhead resistance for SHIB is located at $0.0000083, followed by another resistance level at $0.0000087. If the price manages to surpass the $0.0000087 mark, it could potentially approach the $0.0000090 resistance level. Conversely, if the price falls from its current level, it may drop below $0.0000079, and a further decline could bring SHIB to $0.0000074. Notably, SHIB had formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, and the recent price movement saw it breaking below the triangle, indicating a continuation of the bearish sentiment on the chart. Additionally, the trading volume of SHIB in the last session was low, suggesting a lack of buying strength in the market. Technical Analysis Throughout the month of May and the beginning of June, SHIB faced a decline in buyers’ confidence, resulting in a decrease in demand for the altcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained below the half-line, indicating that sellers held the upper hand in the market. Furthermore, SHIB moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average, which confirmed the downward price action and suggested that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. In line with the technical indicators, SHIB displayed sell signals on the chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates price momentum and shifts, formed red histograms associated with the sell signal for the coin. This suggested a bearish outlook for SHIB. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which indicate price volatility and the likelihood of price fluctuations, had previously narrowed down.

""While Kent no doubt has genuine concerns about PoolTogether—including its legality under New York law—a suit in federal court is not an appropriate way to address them,"" Judge Frederic Block said in the order.  The lawsuit, filed by former congressional staffer Joe Kent in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in October 2021, alleged the DeFi platform violated New York state’s gambling laws by “allowing people to evade financial regulations and scam consumers,” according to the original complaint. Kent, who previously worked for crypto skeptic Sen Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), filed the suit as an apparent test case as legislators explored avenues to pursue legal actions against DeFi actors.  In response to the lawsuit, PoolTogether released an NFT collection called “Pooly,” to raise funds to fight the case. The platform raised roughly $135,000 worth of cryptocurrencies within just two hours of the collection’s drop.  While the case was dismissed, that doesn’t mean the DeFi space is immune to litigation. Last month, investors sued DeFi protocol Bancor for allegedly deceiving investors about its impermanent loss protection mechanism (ILP) and operating as an unregistered security. The DeFi space also faces increasing scrutiny from regulators amid U.S. regulators’ broader crackdown on the crypto industry. In March, the SEC subpoenaed DeFi protocol SushiSwap and its “Head Chef” Jared Grey.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/08/us-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-defi-startup-pooltogether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d9881fb8ab15e061e69ed048748dd5716d63945-2282x1428.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $26,364, off 3.2% over the past 24 hours. BTC had soared above $27,200 on Tuesday as investors seemed to already price in the latest regulatory body blows against an industry already reeling from assorted debacles. Bitcoin and ether, along with Tether’s USDT stablecoin, traded at large premiums on Binance.US, a sign that investors were exiting the platform.  In an email to CoinDesk, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at Web3 crypto and fiat service provider YouHodler, wrote that the firm was expecting continued higher volatility for ""days or even weeks"" as a result of the SEC suits.  But he added: that ""in general, the market seems in better shape and better prepared for possible outcomes. Undoubtedly, crypto market participants are doing a better job at managing risks than they did two to three years ago.""  ETH fared somewhat better than BTC to recently trade at $1,834, off 2.7% from Tuesday same time. CoinDesk Indices‘ Ether Trend Indicator (ETI) moved into “significant uptrend"" territory, an improvement over its reading a day prior. The ETI, which gauges price momentum, suggested that ""recent bullish price action is outpacing previous price moves,"" CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote in a column.  Still, SEC fallout was fierce on Wednesday. BNB, the Binance Smart Chain’s native token, recently dropped 7.6% from Tuesday, same time, and at one point earlier in the day sank to about $252, its lowest price since early January, according to CoinDesk data. Cardano’s ADA, Polygon’s MATIC and Solana’s SOL, all top 10 tokens by market capitalization that were noted in the SEC filing, recently took a dive between 6% and 9%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently down 3.1%.  Equity indexes closed mixed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ticking up a few notches but the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 falling 1.3% and 0.4%, respectively, just a day after reaching 2023 highs as investors fretted about the Bank of Canada's unexpected interest rate hike. The decision offered the latest evidence that central banks remain anxious about inflation and that the monetary hawkishness that has hamstrung asset markets over the past year may continue.

""They were the first to raise rates in 2022 and then put them on hold earlier this year,"" Moya wrote. ""The BOC is signaling that more rate hikes could come and that has everyone rethinking that the Fed will be done after the July hike.""  -JR  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

While the financial community eyes jobs data, inflation figures and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) impacts, one straightforward factor my give more insight into where the price of bitcoin is headed next.  As a primary vehicle for buying crypto assets, the amount of stablecoins on exchanges can serve as a precursor to buying demand.  While some notable exchanges offer a “fiat onramp,” meaning the exchange of U.S. dollars directly for crypto, some investors acquire crypto assets via the exchange of stablecoins like USDC and USDT for crypto.  Per on-chain data firm Glassnode, the amount of stablecoins held on exchange addresses has declined from 32 billion to 19 billion between January 2022 and June 2023. The price for both BTC and ETH are down 45% and 50% respectively over that time frame.  Increases in the stablecoin exchange balance during the remainder of 2023 will be a likely indication that buying demand is increasing.  -GW  This article was written and edited by CoinDesk journalists with the sole purpose of informing the reader with accurate information.

13602385,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536914,1686182587,Bitcoin Retests Moving Average That Marked All Major Market Bottoms,"Bitcoin price is falling, crypto is crumbling, and the United States SEC appears to be out for blood. But before a bloodbath occurs across the digital asset market, the top cryptocurrency by market cap is making a stand at a key level. In fact, BTCUSD is retesting an important moving average that in the past marked ever single major bear market bottom. Take a look below. Bitcoin retests the 200-week moving average | BTCUSD on TradingView.com SEC Onslaught Brings Bitcoin Down Against The 200-Week Moving Average The cryptocurrency market is on the ropes, quite literally. On weekly timeframes, BTCUSD has touched back down on the 200-week moving average. The pullback comes in the wake of a string of SEC-made charges against top crypto exchanges this week. Both Binance and Coinbase have been caught in the crosshairs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Momentum Crosses Bearish For First Time In 2023 Although the onslaught mostly focused on altcoins which are now deemed securities, the sell pressure has been able to cut Bitcoin down a few notches. But it is holding on for dear life. The 200-week moving average makes for an ideal location for a bounce, as this is where Bitcoin has put in a bear market bottom in the past. The line must hold for Bitcoin bulls | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why It’s Critical For BTCUSD To Hold For Renewed Confidence In Crypto Upon zooming out, we can see that a major bottom was put in when BTCUSD touched the line several times in 2015. It served as the bottom bounce yet again in 2018, and one more time in 2020 after the COVID crash. Considering its track record of success, it was especially shocking to see the moving average lost in 2022 following the LUNA collapse. Bitcoin then spent a cumulative 36 weeks below the long-term span. When the US banking sector began to fall apart in March 2022, BTCUSD rocketed above the line for the first time since losing it.

Support is holding at the moment and the weekly is currently forming a hammer – a potential bullish reversal candlestick pattern. It is far too early to tell, however, considering there are still several days left before the weekly candle closes. If Bitcoin can hold above the 200-week moving average, it could tell the market that the bottom is in and finally lead to some renewed confidence in the crypto market. Losing the line again would be unprecedented, but then again, few thought it would be lost in 2022. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.
