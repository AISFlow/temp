42377916,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCYz,1419792015,Could Cryptocurrency Improve P2P File Sharing?,"The Pirate Bay may never make it to its teenage years. The popular file sharing site, launched in 2003, was recently taken offline following a raid by Swedish police.  It’s a sad event for a site that is supposed to be all about unassailable file sharing and, although resurrected versions of The Pirate Bay may already be back up online, the latest interruption to its service raises a number of questions.  What does this raid mean for decentralised P2P filesharing? And can the same technologies that underpin cryptocurrencies help sustain or even enhance decentralised P2P filesharing networks like The Pirate Bay?  A way around ISPs  P2P filesharing networks work by enabling lots of computers on the Internet to share files with each other. Most of the P2P networks today use the BitTorrent protocol.  BitTorrent has some superficial similarities to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin: namely, it is a protocol offering decentralised communications among autonomous nodes in a network.  There are several potential problems for people wanting to use BitTorrent networks. The first is that visitors to sites like The Pirate Bay may be blocked by their own ISPs, possibly at the behest of governments or industry lobby groups.  “I don’t think a decentralised service offers a way around ISPs,” said Nick Lambert, COO at MaidSafe, which focuses on distributed secure file storage. “When the SAFE Network launches – which is the most decentralised service I have heard of, as it doesn’t have a blockchain – it is still not immune from ISPs.”  Theoretically, users could do away with ISPs altogether with a decentralised mesh network using bitcoin as an incentive to participate. Lambert points to Libernet, a bitcoin-funded mesh networking concept, as a way to dodge ISPs altogether. This is more of a theoretical solution than a practical one at present, though.  “The quest to find a replacement for ISPs is something that many people would like to see, but unfortunately I think a really viable solution is a wee bit off,” he concluded.  The other potential problem for filesharing users is that even if their ISPs let them visit sites like The Pirate Bay, local law enforcement may take those sites down at the source, as happened with The Pirate Bay.  However, this may be less of an issue than expected, because The Pirate Bay wasn’t actually sharing the files itself. Instead, it was simply an index, maintaining a database of those files.  “Despite the warning message, most of these users will still download their file successfully, since BitTorrent trackers have already been made mostly redundant by a global P2P network, which can be referred to as ‘the BitTorrent DHT’,” said Andrew Miller, a computer science PhD student at the University of Maryland.  Miller is a key contributor to permacoin, a project designed to use blockchain technology to archive data across thousands of computers.  How BitTorrent file sharing works  To understand this concept, we must delve into how BitTorrent works.  In a BitTorrent network, files are made available for others to download in a process called 'seeding'. Files are seeded by computers called 'peers', and anyone’s computer can be made into a peer simply by downloading an appropriate software client and connecting it to the Internet.  Computers on the network that download files from seeders are called 'leeches', and it’s common for a peer to be both a seeder and a leech at the same time.  Seeded files are carved up into many individually downloadable segments. This has three advantages:  First, if one peer containing a file becomes unavailable during a download, other seeders will still be available to deliver the segments that a leech is missing. Second, multiple segments can be downloaded from different seeders at once, making it easier to retrieve files quickly. Finally, leeches can quickly become seeders themselves, by seeding the files that they have already downloaded. This contributes to the overall health of the network and the availability of files.  In the early days of BitTorrent, peers on the network found each other using tracker files, which contained a constantly-updated list of which peers held which file segments.  The Pirate Bay used to be a centralised tracker service for BitTorrent files. For each downloadable file, it would host a downloadable tracker file with a .torrent extension.  Trackerless torrents  In 2009, The Pirate Bay switched off its centralised tracking service. Instead, it switched to trackerless torrents. These use a variety of mechanisms to enable people to find their files. The most common is the distributed hash table (DHT) technology that Miller describes. It enables peers in the network to hold partial lists of other peers that are hosting particular file segments. Another mechanism, Peer Exchange, enables BitTorrent clients to ask other peers in the network directly which peers they are connected to.  Consequently, The Pirate Bay moved from being a source of downloadable trackers, to a directory of magnet links. Unlike trackers, magnet links didn’t tell a peer where to find a file. Instead, it contained cryptographically hashed information about the content of a particular downloadable file, effectively telling a client what to look for. A BitTorrent client referencing a magnet link connects to its peers using distributed hash tables and asks them who is seeding that file.  When sites like The Pirate Bay stopped sharing files, they stopped being necessary for the continued operation of the file sharing network. Instead, the real heavy lifting has long since moved to the client, and the distributed hash tables. Nevertheless, those sites did provide a useful way to easily find shared files online.  One way to sustain that ease of use, rather than relying on people manually sharing links, may be to decentralise the publishing of file information itself. This is something that distributed hash tables are useful for. OpenBazaar, which is a decentralised marketplace allowing people to list their own goods and services, uses DHTs to get that information out. Projects like OpenBazaar suggest that it’s possible for autonomous nodes in a global network to publish information of their own for everything from trading to P2P lending.  Other projects, like Triblr, have already implemented distributing searching for file sharing.  Using cryptocurrency to improve performance  So, cryptocurrency’s underlying technologies may not be needed to save file sharing, or the indexing of information about currently-available files. Nevertheless, there may be room for cryptocurrency to improve the performance of these filesharing networks.  “One of the innovative things in bitcoin is its use of built-in virtual currency for incentives in its network,” said Miller.  BitTorrent also has a built-in incentive mechanism, Miller points out. Those peers that seed files are rewarded with faster downloads, while peers that seed fewer or no files will find that the frequency of file segments they can download from another peer are artificially limited, or ‘choked off’.  This incentive mechanism leaves new peers with a problem: they have nothing to seed, so their downloads may be slower. The BitTorrent protocol uses ‘optimistic unchoking’, in which a random peer is selected for unthrottled downloads, on the assumption that it may pay off.  “Overall, the BitTorrent network consists of volunteers. Perhaps BitTorrent would work even better if you could offer to pay your peers for their service,” said Miller. In such a scheme, a leeching peer without file segments to trade could potentially pay a seeding peer to unchoke it, increasing its download performance, and using the blockchain to track it all.  A fluffier long tail  There’s a nuance here. Popular files such as the latest viral video or Hollywood blockbuster would probably do quite well without a paid quality of service download, as there would be enough seeders to satisfy even a new leecher.  “I think this approach would have the most potential for the ‘long tail’ of files such as personal backups (that only concern one person) or niche files (which, currently, are less likely to have active seeders),” Miller said.  The long tail is a distribution in which a small number of items outrank the rest in popularity (the long tail would be the yellow part in the diagram below).  A term highlighted by Wired editor Chris Anderson’s popular book of the same name, it applies to content in the Internet age. A small number of popular mainstream items will be downloaded the most, while other, more obscure content will be viewed by far fewer people. However, there are far more of these less popular items, creating the ‘long tail’.  BitTorrent networks have their own version of the long tail, giving rise to something known as the seeder promotion problem. Seeders often discontinue their file seeding after they have downloaded their own content. While there will always be enough seeders for a popular file, there may be only one or two seeds for that obscure public domain Norwegian documentary on the cultural history of lutefisk that you’ve been dying to watch. If you start leeching from the handful of seeders for that item and they become unavailable, you’ll be stuck without the full file download.  Using a cryptocurrency as an incentive could be a way to ‘fluff out’ the long tail, by encouraging more people to share less popular items. It could reward peers with a form of stored value. They could use in the future to purchase their own priority download status for segments of a different file, or, if the cryptocurrency was traded on exchanges, they could cash out.  Tackling fraudulent peer attacks  There’s another potential use for cryptocurrency technologies in file sharing networks, Miller said: as a form of protection from attack.  Media companies have hired firms to disrupt filesharing networks using a variety of methods, including using fake seeders. These seeders may transmit incomplete blocks, or upload poor-quality or broken files.  “The rating system used by Pirate Bay and other sites is important for combatting this, but it's potentially fragile,” Miller said. “It's possible that if such attacks become much more advanced in the future, then blockchain technology may lead to more robust defenses.”  The blockchain might become a way to store downloads and information about the quality of particular files or peers, for example. An internal cryptocurrency could even be used as a form of reputation system to reward genuine sharers and punish fraudulent ones.  For now, such ideas remain theoretical, and BitTorrent continues along its current successful path without any of these blockchain enhancements. But technology disrupts wherever it can. If the need arises, the technology is certainly there.

42377915,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCWT,1419782054,How 'Bitbanks' Could Solve Bitcoin's Volatility Problem,"Cameron Harwick is a PhD student in economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. He conducts research into monetary theory and institutions.  In this article, Harwick examines bitcoins issue with volatility and how bitcoin banks could offer a solution.  Everywhere in the modern world, money is plagued with political problems. Bitcoin’s success, with no help – and, indeed, much opposition – from political authorities around the world, shows just how valuable it is to avoid these problems.  Nevertheless, as important an innovation as cryptocurrency is, it comes with its own unique problems. Bitcoin in particular has been notoriously unstable in value, making its success all the more remarkable. Since its inception, its exchange rate against the US dollar has frequently jumped or crashed over 20%, and sometimes nearly as much as 50%, in the course of a single day (see the chart below).  By contrast, the US dollar/euro exchange rate has never changed more than 2.5% in one day over the same period. As successful as bitcoin has become, imagine how much more successful it could be with a more stable value.  A crash course in monetarism  To diagnose what's behind bitcoin’s stability problem, we’ll use the most important equation in monetary economics, the equation of exchange: MV=PQ.  This means the quantity of money (M) times the rate at which it’s spent (V for velocity) equals the price of everything bought (P) times the amount of it bought (Q for quantity).  This simple equation is true by definition of any monetary system at all times, so it’s a good tool to figure out what happens when one of these variables changes.  In bitcoin, M is on a predetermined path, converging to 21m bitcoins. So in terms of the other variables, it’s basically fixed. That leaves V, P, and Q to fluctuate.  In modern economies, prices take a long time to adjust to systematic pressure, ie: inflation or deflation. So if V or M suddenly drop, the equation tells us that Q has to drop until P catches up. Unemployment and recession is the result.  Fortunately, people still tend to think in terms of dollars rather than bitcoins as a unit of account, even when transacting in bitcoins.  Because the value fluctuates so much, the easiest thing for a seller to do is to price a good in dollars, and figure out at the point of sale how many bitcoins it’s worth. You see the same thing in countries with hyperinflation. During Argentina’s crises, for example, you could pay in pesos, but prices were all in dollars.  What this means is that bitcoin’s P is very flexible compared to the dollar’s. Q doesn’t take the hit, so you don’t get recessions and unemployment in the bitcoin economy. But since this flexibility depends on the dollar as its relatively stable unit of account, we’ll have to figure out how to smooth out bitcoin’s value if we want it to be a self-sustaining currency.  Unstable demand  If bitcoin’s M is basically fixed, its P bounces around and its Q is relatively stable, the equation of exchange tells us V must be bouncing around too. In other words, the demand for bitcoins is highly unstable.  This is no surprise: when people don’t expect your currency to be stable, it’s profitable to speculate against it, which makes it even less stable. For this reason, we can’t expect stability to level out as demand grows.  On the other hand, when you can credibly commit to a stable value, speculation actually reinforces that stability. Great Britain enjoyed this sort of speculation during most of its time on the gold standard. Bitcoin’s problem is not only that its price is unstable, but that there’s no way to convince people that it will be stable.  The usual advice is to make sure that M moves in the opposite direction of V. If the left side of the equation (MV) doesn’t move too much, there’s not too much pressure on prices, and we don’t have to suffer a drop in Q.  This is why central banks try to expand the money supply during recessions, and to contract it during booms. And with a credibly stable P, speculation reinforces that stability.  There are, in fact, two possibilities open to cryptocurrencies to stabilize MV: the traditional way, through a banking system, or by automatic adjustment of the money supply.  Starting with the first:  Bitcoin and banking  Bitcoin is actually very similar to another successful currency whose supply was basically fixed in the short run: gold. So the logical question is, why wasn’t gold as volatile as bitcoin is now?  During the feudal era, money wasn’t that important. V was low and stable, so the rigid supply of gold and silver wasn’t too problematic. Once the Industrial Revolution came around and economic growth started exploding, though, we might have expected violent monetary paroxysms like we see in bitcoin, except on a Europe-wide scale.  As it turns out, the transition was pretty smooth, at least with regard to money. Fortunately – and perhaps necessarily – the industrial revolution was contemporaneous with a banking revolution.  Once people started using banknotes and checks instead of gold coins, this gave banks the ability to expand M beyond the relatively fixed supply of gold. And where these banks were least hobbled by regulation (for example, in Scotland), making loans on a fractional-reserve basis actually tended to keep MV fairly stablehttp://www.freebanking.org/2013/06/19/free-banking-and-ngdp-targeting/.  Similarly, we might expect to see banks arise on the bitcoin platform, issuing banknotes ('bitnotes'?) and making loans, and ultimately stabilizing the value. Unfortunately, banking with bitcoin faces a few hurdles that banking with gold didn’t.  Technical and regulatory hurdles  First of all, there’s a technical hurdle. If we want the money supply to be flexible, a bitnote can’t be a bitcoin, even if they exchange one for one. And since it takes more effort to implement a new payment system than to just accept (physical) notes instead of coins, 'bitbanks' will face an uphill battle getting people to accept and transact in their currencies.  Since this is a technical problem, we can expect smart people to overcome it. More difficult is the legal hurdle. Banks are centralized, so by using bitnotes, you lose a lot of the benefits that made cryptocurrency attractive in the first place.  It also gives hostile governments a bigger target. It’s too costly for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prosecute each user of bitcoin, but it’s easy enough to shut down organizations as they get too large.  So, in the current legal climate, where governments are more than willing to take such actions to protect their own currency monopolies, banking is probably a dead-end path to stability for bitcoin.  Internal stabilization  What if, then, we could play to the strengths of cryptocurrency and have M adjust automatically to compensate for changes in V? This is actually a strong possibility. Remember that V is the rate at which a unit of currency is spent. Since all transactions happen on the blockchain, the protocol knows V.  If the reward to mining were to vary in order to compensate changes in V, rather than targeting a fixed supply path, it could stabilize MV more precisely than any central bank in history.  Quite a few proposals have circulated based on this idea. Unfortunately, the quantity problem isn’t the only one to be solved. Most importantly, when you adjust the money supply, it matters who gets the new money.  Ordinarily, these changes enter through the banking sector, where they’re distributed to those who value them most via loans. If this doesn’t happen – say, if the increase is distributed to miners instead – the currency isn’t actually any more stable.  Cryptocurrency is, in fact, the first currency with a supply that can be adjusted without a banking sector. This fact presents us with an unfortunate paradox: the macroeconomic benefits of a banking sector (stable MV) only matter in conjunction with the microeconomic function of banks (distribution of liquidity by making loans).  Loanmaking is not something that can be automated by a computer. As the recent financial crisis demonstrates, bad things happen when you don’t (or can’t) check to make sure the borrower is in a good position to repay the loan and this is something that requires irreducible human judgment.  Economist Ricardo Cavalcanti put the problem starklyhttps://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2010/q1/pdf/cavalcanti.pdf:  “Although anonymity preserves money, it rules out all forms of credit.”  If there’s really no way around the need for a banking sector in the bitcoin economy, the most important future hurdle for cryptocurrencies will be the political fight.  On the one hand, a cryptocurrency banking system governed by the SECwould hardly be an improvement over the current banking system. On the other hand, without a banking system at all, bitcoin remains vulnerable to destabilizing speculation, and can’t expect to gain a foothold as an independent unit-of-account currency.  Without these institutions, cryptocurrencies will no doubt continue to innovate on a technical level, but will not be able to supplant today’s legally privileged currencies.
