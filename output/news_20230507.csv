Contrary to general expectations, this recent improvement hasn’t translated into the price of the Terra Luna Classic token (LUNC). Since the start of February, the price of Terra Luna Classic has been on a downward trend. And it can be said that the project’s recent growth hasn’t done much to halt this decline. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential LUNC Price Falls By 15% In Single Week Over the past seven days, the Terra Luna Classic market has experienced a drastic price decline, losing more than 15% of its value. This bearish period was preceded by a week in which the price of LUNC was relatively stable, moving in a horizontal direction. However, a broader look at the market shows that Terra Luna Classic has been on a downward trend in the past few months. Since the beginning of February, the token has recorded a price fall of nearly 53%. According to data from CoinGecko, LUNC is currently valued at $0.00009549. In the past 24 hours, the value of this cryptocurrency has dropped by about 5%, falling beneath the crucial $0.0001 level in that time. LUNCUSD on a downward trend | Source: LUNCUSD chart on TradingView The last time Terra Luna Classic made it below this price point can be traced back to August 2022 – the aftermath of the Terra ecosystem collapse. With the $0.0001 level failing to hold, the token would hope to find rest at its next support level of $0.00009275, even though the current sentiment is strongly bearish. L1JTF Proposes Mainnet Upgrade To V2.0.0 In other news, the L1 Joint Task Force team just completed the upgrade of the rebel-2 testnet to v2.0.0, integrating various new features for better functionality and security. Notably, this serves as a preliminary step towards the Terra Classic mainnet upgrade. The testnet was upgraded to v.2.0.0 with Cosmos SDK v0.45 and will provide a secure and controlled environment for the L1 team to test upgrades on the mainnet. The testnet upgrade, completed on the 4th of May, was announced on Twitter by Till, a part-time developer for the L1 team. Following the successful testnet upgrade, the L1 team’s project manager submitted a proposal aimed at upgrading the Terra Classic mainnet to v2.0.0. According to the proposal document, the mainnet upgrade implementation is slated for May 17. This enhancement will implement a transition to Cosmos SDK v0.45.13 and Tendermint v34.24. It is important to mention that these upgrades are in accordance with Terra Classic’s revitalization plan. Having recorded considerable success in Q1 2023, the development team looks set to reach more milestones in Q2 2023.

Additionally, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 47.26% to a value of $31.95 million. However, this current bearish form does not taint what has been a remarkable year for the Lido protocol. LDO trading at $1.863 | Source: LDOUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles To Break $30,000 Resistance Level: Here’s Why Lido’s Impressive Year So Far Following the Merge of the Ethereum network last year, liquid staking protocols such as Lido became a focal point of investors’ interest. Moreover, this traction was further fueled by the anticipation of the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, which just occurred last month. Riding on the massive hype surrounding its network, Lido DAO recorded staggering gains in its Total Value Locked(TVL), displacing the MakerDAO – creator of the DAI stablecoin and first-ever successful DeFi project – as the biggest DeFi protocol in the crypto space. Data from Defillama shows that the amount of staked ETH on Lido rose from 4.84 million ETH on January 2 2022, to its current figure of 6.33 million ETH, representing a total value of $12.15 billion. In fact, total investment in Lido from all of its five supported blockchains has grown by over 108% since the beginning of the year, allowing the liquid-staking platform to gain a 28% market dominance in the DeFi space. That said, considering the latest partnership moves by its developer team, Lido could be set for more gains in the future. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Accumulating – Why Is ADA Bearish? OKX Wallet Integrates With Lido Earlier today, OKX announced the integration of Lido with its OKX wallet web extension allowing users to directly assess Lido’s staking service by visiting the platform’s official website via the “Discover” module on the wallet. This integration represents good news for Lido DAO with the prospect of many new users as OKX ranks as the second biggest crypto exchange with over 50 million customers worldwide. In addition to Lido, the OKX wallet offers access to 100+ DeFi protocols, including Aave, Curve, Sushiswap etc. That said, similar integrations with established centralized exchanges in the future could well result in Lido increasing its dominance in the DeFi space. -Featured Image: The Market Periodical, chart from Tradingview",NEUTRAL,ADA | ETH | LDO,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | LDO,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/all/lido-dao-records-biggest-network-transaction-in-2-years-santiment/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

For instance, a recent development that sparked an outcry was the proposal to impose a 30% excise tax on crypto-mining facilities. US President Joe Biden’s budget proposal presented a phased-in tax on the electricity used by crypto mining firms. This tax and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement actions may push many top crypto firms and startups to consider offshore operations. As such, Tim Draper foresees a massive departure from the US that might crash its economy. US Unclear Regulatory Environment Is Leading To Massive Crypto Exodus In a Twitter post, the founder of DFJvc, Draper mentioned that Silicon Valley startups are relocating operations to Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low He further stated that Gemini and Coinbase are moving out of the US due to the regulatory pressure on their operations. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong hinted at the same outcome in an April conference organized by the Innovative Finance industry body. While speaking, Armstrong stated that the Bahamas-based FTX exchange that crashed in 2022 shows the need for clear crypto regulations. As such, the industry needs clear regulations in the US and UK, or more firms will establish operations in “offshore havens.” New York Is Losing Blockchain Development Leadership Draper also pointed out that countries like Singapore, Dubai, and London gradually overtake New York in blockchain development. A report by Global Media Insight on March 29, 2023, pitched the UAE as the most digital-friendly country in the world. The report revealed that Dubai has many policies that support blockchain technology. As such, it is emerging as one of the best crypto trading markets worldwide. In April, Binance also shared many reasons Dubai is crypto-friendly, mentioning tax-free zone, government support, high-tech infrastructure, etc. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread Apart from the UAE, London, and Singapore also has a more crypto-friendly environment than the US.

Despite numerous attempts in April, Bitcoin has struggled to break the $31,000 mark. The price is blocked by its daily Kijun at around $29,100 and by its psychological resistance at $30,000. A correction to around $25,000 could be preferred to prepare for an extended bull run as long as this zone blocks prices. This would correspond to a retest of the same resistance level at the beginning of the year and can be confirmed as the support level. In the event of a break through the $31,000 mark, then Bitcoin could continue to climb towards $33,500. This would provide the next resistance level ahead of a potential ascent to $40,000. However, if the bears persist below $25.000, Bitcoin risks breaking the price spread, which could cause the price to fall below the $18,000 mark. Related reading: Polygon Bears Gain Ground As MATIC Continues To Retreat Bullish Sentiment Based On External Factors Bitcoin is in good stead and could make a major bull run due to the following factors. First, the banking crisis is plaguing the United States and other parts of the world. Secondly, there is the decoupling between BTC and traditional markets. Finally, we can mention the brake on interest rates the US Federal Reserve promised. The Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy in early March is still wreaking havoc on the industry, with many Americans scared of placing their money in the Bank. Bitcoin’s recent price surge has coincided with this, showing its flexibility as digital gold. Related reading: UMA Token Surges By 28% Despite General Bearish Trend There has been a surge among investors to diversify their assets into Bitcoin for good reasons. Bitcoin does not need intermediaries; anyone can store BTC in their wallets without trusting a centralized institution. Bitcoin is a unique asset due to its volatility. At times it shows a high correlation with stock indices. While sometimes, it diverges and forms its own course. The following graph shows the comparison with respect to gold, the S&P500, and the NASDAQ. Pearson’s correlation shows how close BTC’s behavior is to that of certain traditional assets. If the shares of banking and fintech companies continue to fall, there’s likely to be a huge inflow of volume into the Bitcoin network leading to a price surge. Finally, the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% annually. This is the maximum level since 1997. But the increase came with an extra announcement: no new increases (or reductions) are foreseen for the remainder of 2023. Generally, a stalemate or reduction of interest rates is a catalyst for the increase in the price of risky assets, such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down 2% in the past 24 hours and trading for $28,826. -Featured image iStock, charts from Tradingview",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-struggles-to-break-30000-resistance-level-heres-why/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12415764.jpeg

As such, a Ripple board member and an angel investor at PartyDAO, Asheesh Birla, predict it might offer crypto-enabled banking services. Coinbase Is Transitioning From Crypto Exchange In a Twitter thread, Birla recounted Coinbase’s mission, vision, and value proposition in the crypto industry, concluding that it might offer banking-like services backed by crypto. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread According to the angel investor, the second largest exchange aims at building the crypto economy. This financial system will be accessible, efficient, transparent, powered by crypto, and fair to all users. Birla further revealed that Coinbase’s 2023 quarter-one report showed that more of the exchange’s revenues came from deposits through interest income, custodial fees, and blockchain rewards. These revenue streams were classified under subscription and services. Based on the quarterly report, Birla pointed out USDC deposits interest at $199 million, representing 18% of all Coinbase revenue. Also, the exchange’s revenue gradually moves from consumer transactions to institutional consumers with high margins. Institutional trading revenue spiked by 67% from its 2022 Q4 amount. The Ripple board member also noted that Coinbase now benefits from banking-like revenues not entirely dependent on the crypto market. Banking Crisis Might Push Alternative Services While concluding his post, Birla wondered if the time has come for consumers and institutions to turn to alternative services. Notably, the recent banking crisis that led to the crash of Silvergate, Silicon Valley, and Signature Bank has reduced people’s trust in the traditional financial system. Birla cited a recent Bloomberg Opinion piece by Matt Levine titled; “Nobody Trusts Banks Now,” asking if the timing is right for everyone to move on to alternatives. In the piece, Levine described banking operations strategies in two ways. First, banks borrow short to lend long. Secondly, they borrow long to lend long. In the first strategy, banks use customers’ deposits subject to fast withdrawals to buy bonds and fund loans. In the second strategy, banks use customers’ deposits which could also be withdrawn in the short-term, although not always to buy bonds and fund loans. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low Considering these strategies purely dependent on customers’ deposits, Levine concluded that the banking business is inherently risky. The reason is that if all depositors wake up to withdraw their money simultaneously, the banks will crash. Also, the banks are in trouble if the interest on customers’ deposits spikes. That’s why research by Amit Seru disclosed that 200 more banks in the US face the same risks that crashed Silicon Valley Bank. As it stands now, only the future will tell if Birla’s musings will play out. -Featured image from Pexels and chart from Tradingview",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/coinbase-might-soon-offer-banking-like-services-claims-ripple-board-member/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

ADA’s volatility has been dropping in recent weeks despite a slew of positive developments, mainly from on-chain data. Related Reading: Cardano TVL Climbs By 10% In A Day – Is ADA Set To Soar Once Again? As an illustration, the coin is down roughly 20% from April peaks and retesting a local support zone of around $0.38. Whales Doubling Down, Activity Rising In Cardano Still, even in these market conditions, there are signs that ADA whales are accumulating in the ecosystem. Although the reason for the swarm is unclear, according to IntoTheBlock, large transactions worth over $100,000 have been made over the past 24 hours, worth around $10 billion. The bulk sale of this size stands at $20 billion in the past week. Moreover, data also shows that “large holders” control 35% of ADA’s total supply. These entities act as a proxy to institutional players’ and whale activities, showing how they may be investing and positioning. While it is unclear what knowledge the Cardano whales have, their activities suggest that they are buying the dip. This is considering that ADA is still down around 87% from 2021 peaks. Besides whales buying in bulk, Cardano’s ecosystem is showing promising signs, with the blockchain remaining one of the most highly developed and used. According to Santiment, 2.15 billion transactions were processed on Cardano. Typically, active networks, in both development and use, point to quality and confidence. The more there are projects and addresses, the higher the odds of the platform’s coin finding support. The spike in activity over the past few months, even with the general market lull, could be due to various non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects launching. Djed, an algorithmic stablecoin, is already live on the mainnet. DeFi and NFT projects look to take advantage of Cardano’s EUTXO model. This system mirrors how Bitcoin functions but adds a layer of smart contracting, just like Ethereum. However, one of the main developments of Cardano in recent days is the release of the first Hydra Head on the mainnet. This layer-2 scaling solution uses state channels that extend the concept of payment channels. This technology can drive growth, possibly supporting ADA prices in the long haul. Related Reading: Cardano Launches First Hydra Head For L2 Scaling, But Why Is ADA Dropping? ADA Remains Bullish Even with the recent contraction, Cardano’s long-term prospects look good.

It’s worth noting that ETH is currently down 13% from its April highs, and sliding. Coin holders, including those of ETH, typically send tokens from time to time. Even so, any transfer to a centralized exchange is interpreted as bearish. Vitalik Buterin might need funds to cover operating costs or even invest in projects.

A record amount of ETH was burned at the end of this week, thanks to the meme coin craze, and specifically, PEPE. The majority of meme coins run on Ethereum and are being actively moved with higher gas fees, providing a great opportunity to burn ETH and decrease the circulating supply. 31.7K $ETH has been burned in the past seven days. To put that in perspective, since the merge (231 days ago), 152K ETH total has been burned. That’s ~21% of the total burn in ~3% of the total days. This is the power of meme coins. pic.twitter.com/iFsZaDH5LU — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) May 5, 2023 In addition, Ethereum is seeing increased adoption from major companies and institutions, which is driving up demand for the cryptocurrency. Last week, the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced that it had issued its first-ever digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency. The increased adoption and burning of ETH due to the meme coin mania could sustain prices above key support levels in the days ahead.

12412728,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530303,1683433257,Upcoming Ethereum Upgrade To Reduce Fees – Details,"The second largest crypto blockchain Ethereum is preparing for a new upgrade that will reduce transaction fees on the network. The upgrade tagged “Dencun” will also introduce more use cases for Ethereum. Notably, Ethereum Foundation made the announcement of Dencun upgrade just three weeks after the Shapella upgrade. With the upcoming Dencun upgrade, Ethereum network users can now transact with lower fees. Introducing Dencun Upgrade – What You Need To Know The upcoming Dencun upgrade will feature Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). These are proposals that aim to bring changes to the network. The Ethereum community usually reviews the proposals to accept or reject them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low If the community accepts the EIPs, they become a part of the Ethereum network codes. The Dencun upgrades have four proposals, including EIP-1153, EIP-6475, EIP-4844, and EIP-6748. The first proposal is EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding or The Surge. The Surge aims to bring in “data blobs” for Layer 2 solutions to post transaction and proof data instead of CALLDATA. The blobs offer lower gas costs since they’re never stored on the blockchain permanently. The blob aims to lower the transaction fee on Ethereum. Other Dencun Proposals Bring Diverse Changes The second important proposal for review is the EIP-6780. This proposal is to deactivate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode but still preserve its functionality. EIP-6780 proposal will allow the creation and erasure of contracts in a single transaction but not delete the contract code or storage. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread The third proposal is EIP-1153 which will bring two new opcodes, TSTORE and TLOAD, to the network. The developers aim to provide transient storage that will be cleared once a transaction ends. This will add more use cases, from re-entry locks to single-transaction ERC20 approvals. The fourth proposal is EIP-6475: SSZ Optionals. This change supports EIP-4844 since it defines one of its SSZ elements in the transaction format. The aim is to facilitate forward compatibility with SSZ objects that will be introduced to the network. While the four proposals above remain the major ones, the development team has others that might be considered too. One of the probable ones is EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations. -Featured image from Pexels and chart from Tradingview",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/upcoming-ethereum-upgrade-to-reduce-fees-details/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12412728.jpeg

Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread Based on its market cap of $11.02 billion, Dogecoin is presently ranked No. #8 among all cryptocurrencies with a price of $0.07. Bulls Trying To Ease Market Pressure Dogecoin market sentiment seems bearish as today’s Fear & Greed Index is 27 (Fear). This indicates a relatively low investor sentiment towards DOGE and suggests that the market may be experiencing fear or uncertainty. Notably, DOGE is experiencing high volatility, fluctuating rapidly over short periods. Despite the downtrend, the Dogecoin bulls are trying to ease market pressure by continuing to buy the asset and pushing its price up. Dogecoin trades below the 50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). These levels indicate that DOGE is in a downtrend or bearish movement due to high selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows 45.24, which suggests that the asset’s momentum is relatively neutral. An RSI reading of 45.24 is closer to the oversold region than the overbought territory, which may indicate that the asset is slightly undervalued or oversold. The MACD trades below the signal line, indicating that the sellers control the market. The MACD histogram also confirms the bearish sentiment as the histogram is below the zero line.

Some Factors Affecting Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Below are some key factors affecting Dogecoin: Endorsement From Celebrity: The involvement of celebrities, news coverage, and engagement from the community have contributed significantly to the growth of Dogecoin. This cryptocurrency has become an important financial instrument, often included in institutional investment portfolios and widely accepted by exchanges. Notably, famous figures such as rapper Snoop Dogg, rock band KISS leader Gene Simmons, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been vocal about their support for Dogecoin, with Musk tweeting about the cryptocurrency since 2019 and each tweet causing a surge in its price. Market Sentiment: Like any other asset, the price of Dogecoin is influenced by market sentiment. If investors are optimistic about the future of Dogecoin, they may buy more, driving up the price. Conversely, if investors are bearish about the cryptocurrency, they may sell their holdings, causing the price to decline. -Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-stuck-in-bearish-trend-when-will-it-get-out/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12412076.jpeg

12411150,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=530265,1683428349,Polygon Bears Gain Ground As MATIC Continues To Retreat,"Polygon (MATIC) is slightly shedding its gains today as the bears aim to seize control of its price. Despite the price fluctuations, its trading volume is up by 16%, indicating growing interest from traders. Polygon has dropped below the $1 mark since April 23. However, it trades within the $0.9 and $1 price range. What’s Next For MATIC? MATIC is in a sideways trend today, forming a red candle on the price chart. The recent price volatility might reflect the activities in the general crypto market, where the top coins are slightly gaining. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread MATIC has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with bearish sentiment in the short and long term. Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 40.24 in the neutral zone. However, the indicator is moving downwards and might descend into the oversold region of 30 if the bears prevail. MATIC’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above the signal line and shows convergence. Also, it has a negative value, a bearish signal for the asset. The technical indicators suggest that MATIC might experience further price decline before the bulls rally again. MATIC is trading close to the $0.9451 support level, and the bears at the $1.0064 resistant level have kept its price down. If the current market conditions persist, a descent to the next support level of $0.9231 is possible. However, MATIC is currently in a sideways trend reflecting traders’ hesitation in the market. It will likely fall to the $0.9451 resistance before the bulls rally again. Securitize Launches On Polygon Despite Price Drop A trading firm, Securitize, launched a feeder fund on the Polygon blockchain. Investors can use these funds to collect secure loans and access liquidity on the platform. Also, this funding is in collaboration with Hamilton Lane (Nasdaq: HLNE) which is exclusive to the polygon blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low Hamilton Lane launched the Senior Credit Opportunities Fund (SCOPE) in October 2022. A portion of the SCOPE funds is now available through Securitize. This new investment feature reduces the minimum investment threshold for investors from $2 million to $10,000. The SCOPE initiative targets investment in privately held market-leading information technology and business services assets. The CEO of Securitize Inc., Carlos Domingo, stated that smart contracts built on blockchain networks could improve manual processes such as share redemptions that take weeks to seconds. Also, he believes it eliminates the need for intermediaries and unnecessary fees, thus eliminating the barrier of entry for some investors. Such developments are highly beneficial to Polygon’s network and might improve its price eventually. -Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview",NEGATIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-matic-bears-gain-ground/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
