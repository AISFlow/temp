42380188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN1P,1514498447,"Bitcoin Among Year's Top Searches, Google Data Says","Are people searching more for news about bitcoin or North Korea?  According to recently released data from Google, bitcoin may be on top. As detailed in the search giant's ""Year in Search 2017,"" an overview of what was trending in 2017, bitcoin ranked second under the ""Global News"" category, a distinction that indicates search volume was higher for the technology than even some of the year's more talked-about news events including the Les Vegas shooting and this year's Solar Eclipse.  Similarly, ""How to buy bitcoin"" also took the third spot under the list's ""How to..."" search category.  In this way, the news perhaps provides context by putting an estimate on just how strong the attention on bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been in 2017 during what was a historic run-up in market prices.  As charted by the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the price of bitcoin grew by 20x over the course of 2017, rising from roughly $900 in January to an all-time-high at $19,783 in December. The cryptocurrency market capitalization also topped over $650 billion, up from $17 billion since early January, data from CoinMarketCap shows.  Yet what's also interesting is that users from outside the U.S. seem to be boosting bitcoin's overall ranking. In a U.S. country breakdown, for instance, Google's data indicates that bitcoin-related terms ranked lower than they did on the global breakdown.  Indeed, searching ""bitcoin"" in Google Trends reveals the countries most contributing to current volume include South Africa, Slovenia, Netherlands, Nigeria and Austria, while the U.S. ranks 16th on the list.

42380179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MMq5,1514491221,Singapore Court Dismisses Summary Judgment for $43 Million Bitcoin Dispute,"The Singapore International Commercial Court ruled today to dismiss an application of summary judgment for a lawsuit where the plaintiff attempted to reclaim 3,092 bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange, document shows.  First filed in April this year by the U.K.-based market maker B2C2, against the Singapore cryptocurrency exchange Quoine, the case has become notable due to the large amount of bitcoin involved. The 3,092 bitcoin at stake worth $3.7 million at the time but spiked to $43 million currently, data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index shows.  As reported before by CoinDesk, in April B2C2 managed to capture what Quoine called ""a technical glitch"" and sold 309 ether for 3,092 bitcoin, creating a profit of $3.7 million. Yet, bitcoin, priced at $1,226 at the time, was worth around 25 times more than the ether token, according to CoinDesk's BPI.  Quoine soon reversed the trade without informing B2C2, citing that the market maker's conduct violated the fairness of the market, which subsequently led to B2C2's lawsuit in trying to reclaim the 3,092 bitcoin.  According to the court document, the plaintiff filed an application for a summary judgment, a procedure that aims to reach a court decision based on existing facts without a trial.  Yet, the International Judge Simon Thorley noted that more thorough investigations of facts are needed and thus did not grant a summary judgment application.  One reason, among other reasons cited by the judge, was that the law is not well developed for circumstances where the error is made by computers. As such, the judge concluded that:  “In the present case, I do not consider that the Plaintiff’s responses to the Defendant’s arguments are sufficient to deny it the right to a trial.”  Both B2C2 and Quoine are yet to offer comments on the case.  Correction Note: The article has been updated to reflect that it was the application for a summary judge that was dismissed by the court.

42380192,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN3v,1514484925,2018 and Beyond: Tokens Are Slowly Eating the Firm,"Tekin Salimi is the project manager at Polychain Capital, where he works closely with portfolio projects to add value across multiple verticals.    The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      One of the most fascinating outcomes of the 2017 gold rush into open-source protocol development is the growth of ""community management"" – a business function that combines elements of marketing, business development, investor relations and human resources.  Community managers are being hired en masse. Their job is to oversee all matters relating to a blockchain project's community of supporters. This includes interacting with core developers, contributors, investors and even end users. The role of the community manager is vital to the success of a protocol; so vital that a ‘cottage industry’ has propped up overnight to offer community management as a service.  Pay anywhere from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars and a contractor will manage your project's Slack and Telegram channels, Reddit posts and marketing strategies (which may include, for example, ""air dropping"" free tokens to potential contributors).  Even more interestingly, community management is somewhat disrupting traditional notions of how business organizations should operate.  Due largely to the proliferation of freely tradable cryptocurrencies and the use of new incentive games such as developer bounties, there is a growing adoption of, what could be described as, the ""communal business model.""  What is the communal business model?  One distinct characteristic of this model is blurring the line between formal employment and informal contribution.  Through the use of bounties and payment via inflationary funding, anyone around the world may contribute labor to a blockchain project and be rewarded through a dilutive issuance in that project’s native currency. Rewards are most commonly offered for tasks such as coding, logo design, website design, white paper translation and more.  In theory, so long as the value realized in a token's market price by virtue of the work exceeds the value diminished through dilution, any labor sourced and compensated through this model is a net benefit to all token holders.  The use of bounties also bootstraps the development process by mobilizing and incentivizing a much broader group of participants. From management's perspective, bounties enable the company to meaningfully vet prospective hires through a ""trial run"" before committing to the offer of full employment.  Unsurprisingly, blockchain projects using these mechanisms today often consist of distributed teams of contributors from around the world, and – anecdotally – have low attrition rates.  Another characteristic of this model is that transparency often trumps confidentiality.  Try spending time in a project’s Slack channel and you may be surprised by the amount of seemingly proprietary information a core team will share. This is uniquely enabled for blockchain development projects due to the open-source nature of the code base in development.  Often, a protocol’s adoption relies more on network effects (i.e. strong community backing) than it does on proprietary information or functionality, so there is an inherent incentive to reduce the information asymmetry between a project’s core team and its support community.    Case Study: Interactive Coin Offerings      The interactive coin offering protocol co-authored by Jason Teutsch (Truebit) and Vitalik Buterin (ethereum) is a great case study of the communal model in practice.    Through a publicized announcement of the white paper, 73 developers joined Truebit's Slack channel including representation from the Ethereum Foundation, Zeppelin, ConsenSys, Modular, Shapeshift, five acclaimed developers from the USCC coding challenge, and many more.    The group quickly self-organized to build the first implementation of the smart contracts with various parties contributing to the protocol, code, testing, security audits and UI/UX design.    The implementation can be found in Truebit’s Github repository.    DAOs as communal businesses  It is possible that open source development is merely the first use case of a communal business model.  In coming years, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) might utilize the transparency and censorship resistance properties of blockchain technology to pursue their business objectives in new ways. This would blend the traditional roles of managers, employees, shareholders, creditors and customers.  The use of on-chain voting could enable DAOs to implement a liquid democracy model to decentralize managerial decision-making. And similar to the case of protocol development, mechanisms like bounties, inflationary funding and tokenized/automated dividends can be used to incentivize and reward a DAO's workers.  The notion of a DAO that is operated and governed entirely on-chain is the epitome of the communal business model. As entities of this nature gain adoption, the labour force of the future may look less like a ""9-to-5 job economy"" and more like a ""gig economy"" on steroids.  Opening the closed firm model?  Community management is sparking a paradigm shift. One that may, in time, influence even the most ""closed"" industries to re-evaluate their approaches.  I focus on the example of law firms, as it is the case I am most familiar with. Law firms are business entities that, historically, have had little to no economic incentive to coordinate or cooperate with one another. In fact the opposite is true. Law firms are motivated to safeguard and silo intellectual resources, as very minute and nuanced information is often what differentiates the value proposition of one firm from another.  Nevertheless, we live in a world in which most forms of intellectual labor (including legal work) are being increasingly commoditized.  So, it seems plausible that new ""open"" approaches may demonstrate the economic benefits to collaboration in certain contexts (such as a nascent regulatory industry like blockchain). The SAFT Project is a great example of a co-ordinated approach in such a context.  To be clear, I don’t expect the firm model to go away overnight – or likely ever. But blockchain technology presents an important opportunity to experiment with open models in traditionally closed arenas.

As part of what appears to be a series of updates designed to improve oversight of industry practices, the government will also seek to bar banks from issuing new virtual accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges.  According to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, the announcements were made by Hong Nam-ki, the minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, after discussion with vice ministers from other governmental bodies regarding the recent rise in cryptocurrency interest and ownership domestically.  Hong’s announcement came just after an hour since the head of South Korea’s financial regulator warned against the bitcoin bubble during a meeting with the press.  ""I bet the bubble in bitcoin will burst later,"" said Choe Heung-sik, the governor of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).  Hong told the news source that only accounts with real and matching identity can be allowed for deposit and withdrawals.  The government's ban on using anonymous accounts, effectively a mandate that exchange providers perform know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence, is seen as the latest move to curb the trading activity around cryptocurrencies in the country.  It can also be seen as the result of recent events in which government bodies were reportedly considering measures to halt what they called an ""overheating of virtual currency speculation.""

42380194,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN5B,1514471705,"ICOs: The Beauty, the Beast and JFK","Christine Duhaime is a financial crime attorney and the founder of the Digital Finance Institute, where she advises digital currency companies, and the co-founder of Chatbo, an AML chatbot solution for screening and onboarding.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      All technological advances have a good and a bad side.  Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are no different except that unlike other new technologies, their good and the bads side exist in extremes without any middle ground or balance.  The beauty  Let's talk about the good, or the beauty, of ICOs first.  The beauty of ICOs is that they have reinvigorated the American dream of having the opportunity to launch a company, work hard and strike gold. Only this dream is real and better because it is egalitarian – an entrepreneur can be rich or poor, a banker or a farmer, a man or a woman, and with nothing more than a computer, a good business idea and funds from an ICO, that entrepreneur has an opportunity to secure investment.  There are no financial, capital raising or gender-based barriers to entry such as exist for startups raising capital in the traditional way. ICOs open the door to everyone to raise money, and in 2017, they raised over $2.3 billion.  There are other important benefits of ICOs to the economy – they allow startups to receive investments in digital currencies from other countries or from across one country instantaneously so that the ICO team can start developing technology immediately.  It means that innovation can move forward much quicker. ICOs also play an important role in helping to mitigate the growing problem of wealth disparity, distributing wealth into the hands of more, rather than fewer, people.  The beast  But there is a beast lurking in the ICO space, and that beast is an utter and complete disregard for the rule of law that has plagued the funding model in 2017.  Most ICOs violate so many laws, it's hard to track them in the so-called white papers issued by teams. Among the most egregious are violations of constitutional law that purport to strip investors of the right to sue in the event of a dispute and violations of international treaties and human rights conventions that likewise exist to guarantee access to justice over business, investor, commercial and property disputes.  Most ICOs have next to no compliance with consumer protection laws either. Investors are rarely informed of the risks of an ICO, the risks of the technology, the risks of the complete reliance on a digital currency exchange, the risks of hacking and theft, the risks of inexperienced team members starting a startup or the risks of regulation or changes of government policies.  Consumer protection violations trigger anti-trust concerns of deceptive advertising, another area where some ICOs fail to comport with the law.  Most ICOs are incorrectly launched as foundations but solicit investments as for-profit businesses. In law, they can't be both a foundation and a for-profit business. Many ICOs, despite what they are cleverly termed in white papers, are the issuance of securities and are launched in violation of securities law.  Finally, next to no attention is paid by ICOs to anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and sanctions law when they accept investments or contributions, putting the international financial system at risk. ICO teams sometimes undertake attempts at financial crime compliance but only after funds have been accepted which is too late.  ICOs are invested in by the transfer of digital currencies from one wallet to another from anywhere in the world and such investments can be entirely anonymous such that a terrorist organization could fund an ICO without anyone being the wiser.  If that happens, despite all the benefits of ICOs, governments will severely restrict entry to the space and the party will be over.  New laws with new technology  In fairness to ICOs, though, the problem is not simply one of non-compliance with laws – there is the added problem of outmoded laws that haven't kept pace with technology.  Although bitcoin and digital currency transactions have been around since 2009, not one government in the world has taken a leadership role in investing in learning the technology and working with the private sector to draft laws to support responsible innovation that includes consumer protection, international trade, securities, corporate, online dispute resolution and financial crime law.  Several countries have recently begun marketing themselves aggressively as ICO-friendly, but they tend to be jurisdictions known as tax havens or havens for online gambling companies that fled from the US, and their ICO-friendliness does not translate into the adoption of responsible innovation to address financial crime concerns.  ICOs need a competent legal framework and until governments allocate resources to modernize outmoded laws, ICO teams will follow the path of least resistance and raise funds in the most friction-free manner possible.  But you know what? We've been here before.  Decades ago, President John F. Kennedy addressed the issue of what he called the ""march of technology"" confronting ""outmoded laws."" In a speech to Congress in 1962, he called upon the government to take action to meet its responsibility to consumers when there are technological advances by ensuring consumers could exercise their rights.  He could have been talking about ICOs because those rights, he said, include the right to be informed and protected against fraudulent, deceitful or grossly misleading information and to be given the facts to make an informed choice, and the right to be heard by being assured that government policy will include consumer interests and importantly, the right to be fairly and expeditiously treated in the court system in the event of disputes and to seek remedies.  It is necessary, he concluded, to strengthen government programs, improve government organizations and pass new laws to protect consumers when there is new technology.  While President Kennedy legislated for responsible innovation to protect consumers, his vision hasn't been continued in the ICO space.  ICOs will be scrutinized  In 2018, the ICO ecosystem will face significant upheaval and more scrutiny.  We will see the SEC be more aggressive against ICOs that issue illegal securities or that solicit funds from U.S. persons. We will likely also see movement criminally against ICO teams or exchanges that list them, for anti-money laundering, sanctions and counter-terrorist financing failures.  We will also see many more civil actions against ICO teams for technology or investments that never materialize.  Under pressure from the U.S., tax and other safe haven countries that solicit ICO businesses will likely be forced to take a responsible approach to innovation to protect the financial system.  Believe it or not, 2018 will nonetheless be a good year for ICOs.  The regulatory action coming down the pipe will force improvements upon the players and the process, helping to ensure that the ecosystem that remains is better and balanced.

42380189,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MMyt,1514467846,El-Erian Predicts Bitcoin Crash if Savvier Investors Sit Out Correction,"While bitcoin's price has recovered and held almost half of what it lost last Friday, one commentator believes the bitcoin market has reached a crucial juncture.  After the markets saw an epic drop of 45 percent in bitcoin's price on Dec 22 — down to $10,800, taking nearly every other cryptocurrency down with it, the price has since rebounded somewhat. Meanwhile, the chief economic advisor of Allianz SE and former CEO of Pimco Mohamed El-Erian has asked whether or not this could be a make or break moment for the bitcoin market.  In his column on the Bloomberg View published on Dec. 26, El-Erian wrote:  ""Either this sharp price correction will act as a catalyst for expanding what, until now, has been quite limited institutional involvement in this market — or it will become a stage in the deflation of a remarkable and historic asset bubble.""  Previously, El-Erian has called bitcoin more of a commodity than a currency because its price has remained too unstable for people to use it as a medium of exchange. Without walking that back, he acknowledged major milestones for the bitcoin market this year: its dramatic price increase, the opening of futures markets and very limited government intervention (besides China's).  Nevertheless, he argues that bitcoin has an underlying weakness: in his words, those taking a long position are less sophisticated retail investors while those taking short positions are all the more experienced ones. Meanwhile, institutional investors have overwhelmingly sat out the market.  That said, some of that could change following a price drop, which can be a sign that unattractive irrational exuberance may be leaking out of a market. He writes:  ""After bitcoin experienced one of the biggest roller-coaster weeks in its young history, the most important question facing it is whether the recent price correction will prove to be what market participants refer to as 'healthy.'""  To prove itself, bitcoin investors will need to become more diverse, with experienced investors joining the retail investors in long positions and institutional investors joining the market at all. The correction will also need to yield what El-Erian refers to as ""market-deepening products,"" without further elaborating.  If it fails to grow in these ways, he writes that retail investors will face ""a price appreciation and collapse that would rival even the biggest investment bubbles in history.""

42380193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MN6R,1514434220,No One Should Control the Blockchain Supply Chain,"Samantha Radocchia, Ryan Orr and Maksym Petkus lead development and strategy at Chronicled, a San Francisco startup that leverages blockchain and IoT technologies to deliver smart supply chain solutions.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      2017 was a foundational year for blockchain.  We saw the emergence of new networks, platforms, strategies and fundraising vehicles, and we saw the prices of major cryptocurrencies skyrocket. We saw ICOs. We saw blockchain enter the common vernacular.  But the most exciting of all of these advancements in 2017, we believe, was blockchain’s ability to bring together disparate ecosystems – often competitors – onto a common back-end platform.  One of the use cases where it can be beneficial to support trusted execution of business logic at an industry scale is in the supply chain. A number of companies for the past few years been working on blockchain-enabled supply chain projects including Chronicled, IBM, Provenance, SAP, Skuchain and VeChain.  But at Chronicled we have a different perspective than the others, and we thought it was a good opportunity to share 2017 progress and our vision for 2018 and beyond.  Privacy matters  One misconception in the industry in 2017 was that permissioned blockchain infrastructure would solve the problem of data privacy. This is not the case.  Any data stored on a full node – even on a permissioned blockchain node – is accessible to all of the other node operators in the network. In a supply chain context, where competitors are using a single blockchain, sensitive details around trading partners, shipping patterns and volumes can become available to competitors through their participation in the network.  This poses a serious challenge.  At Chronicled, we discussed this topic with a wide sample of executives in the pharmaceutical and precious metals industries, and recognized early on that this data privacy issue would make or break the evolution of supply chain use cases. We formed an internal company viewpoint that if we could not succeed with implementing a privacy solution, then blockchain systems would continue to be viewed as ""toy systems"" unlikely to gain industry-wide enterprise adoption for supply chain use cases.  Through the first half of 2017, we focused our team's technical fire-power in applied cryptography on resolving this data privacy problem. We investigated more than a dozen candidate solutions in our blockchain lab in San Francisco and built many technical pilots to explore various methods of achieving data privacy.  By mid 2017, after exploring the breadth of the technical solution space, we had identified a robust method that builds on zk-snark technology. This was a solution with the power to meet all industry requirements and serve as a backbone for an open supply chain network with full data privacy built on a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.  As a next step, we spent the period of August through October with three expert applied cryptographers conducting a clean room review of the working implementation of the method.  This included documenting the method with formal mathematical notation, as well as performing detailed calculations to determine the computational capacity and disk space that would be needed to apply the method at industry scale. The solution was optimized to support peak shipping loads and regulatory requirements for archival record-keeping in major industries.  Today, as we head into 2018, we are feeling confident about the solution and we are excited for what the future holds.  The secret ingredient  Zero-knowledge succinct arguments have been studied by cryptographers in various forms for 25 years. However, modern constructions of zk-snarks have only arisen in the past five years or so.  In a paper in 2012, Alessandro Chiesa and his co-authors coined the terms ""snark"" and ""zk-snark,” demonstrating various alternatives to classical constructions. Since then, research on snarks has boomed, with each year seeing new approaches and techniques that improve our theoretical and practical understanding of them.  The technology enables two parties to validate or prove to another party that a given statement, event, or bit of logic is in fact true, without conveying any information apart from the binary proof that the statement is true or false.  In the context of supply chain, zk-snarks enable the confirmation of each transaction of physical goods in the chain of custody, so that a connected record of provenance can be maintained, without any of the players upstream or downstream of the transaction having access to information extraneous to their specific transaction.  The statement from Zaki Manian in the clean room review document published by Chronicled earlier this month provides a summary of benefits of the solution:  ""During my years at SkuChain, I was involved in many supply chain use cases for blockchain and constantly bumped up against the requirement of privacy, which has not been adequately solved to date on any multi-company supply chain platform, blockchain or otherwise. It is clear that privacy is a key component for many supply chain problems and the lack of a solution has been holding back all of the industries. Chronicled’s implementation of zk-snarks technology solves this privacy problem, and when utilized to track prescription medicines, this method holds potential to save many human lives.""  This is unique because it is the first useful demonstration of a zk-snarks protocol that solves a completely different business problem than private value transfer pioneered in the zerocash protocol.  Looking ahead to 2018  As we head into 2018, buyers of blockchain services should be wary of vendors who are entering the market late and have not had time to fully think through all of the trade-offs related to network topology, decentralization, performance, resiliency, openness and data privacy.  We recently observed an attempt by one vendor to control ownership and access to underlying blockchain infrastructure. This feels eerily reminiscent of the days when AOL had aspirations to ""own the internet,"" a strategy that flies in the face of the spirit and benefit of blockchain.  We believe that in 2018 the industry will move towards solutions that embrace both decentralization and data privacy, and we are excited that progress in 2017 can now make this possible.
