42401738,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Gcu,1533246317,UBS: Bitcoin Is Too 'Unstable and Limited' to Function as Money,"Investment bank UBS thinks bitcoin is neither money nor a viable asset class - not yet at least.  The Switzerland-based company's assessment was featured in a research report on the world's largest crypto by market capitalization, which was circulated to clients and released on Thursday.  Published by UBS strategists, the report concludes that bitcoin ""falls short of criteria that need to be satisfied to be considered money."" It explains,  ""Fixed supply and unusual demand dynamics make the system susceptible to high price volatility, in turn making it difficult for bitcoin to step into the role of money or to be a viable new asset class.""  However, the authors don't rule out the possibility that bitcoin could one day become these things.  They argue that if bitcoin can achieve scalability and regulatory support, it could one day become ""a viable payment mechanism and/or a legitimate asset class in which even the most conservative and traditional investors can participate.""  Likewise, they note their plans to ""keep on top of these developments,"" as ""many"" see promise in cryptocurrency's underlying blockchain technology.  According to the report, the research was the banking giant's answer to its investors, who are becoming increasingly interested in the cryptocurrency space.  ""We have received many questions on the subject, which we hope to address in this educational piece,"" the authors wrote in the publication.  The authors' findings were based on comparisons of bitcoin with ""macro variables and its performance against various asset classes."" They frequently draw parallels between bitcoin and online payments provider PayPal, and conclude that bitcoin ""diffusion"" could follow trends in online payments.  This is not the first time UBS has expressed a cautious view on cryptocurrency. In 2017, it declared cryptocurrencies a ""speculative bubble"" in a report due to sharp rises in price at the time. Nonetheless, the bank has consistently been bullish on blockchain, and advised investors in the same report that ""blockchain is likely to have a significant impact"" on a variety of industries.

42401727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2GT4,1533239159,Sony Patent Filings Hint at Work on Crypto Mining Hardware,"Japanese technology giant Sony wants to patent two hardware approaches for hosting and maintaining blockchains, newly published documents show.  Sony's two filings are entitled ""Electronic Node and Method for Maintaining a Distributed Ledger"" and ""Device and System,"" revealing for the first time that the company is working on blockchain-related hardware concepts. They also set the stage for the company to potentially include these devices in a future product.  In the past, as previously reported by CoinDesk, the tech company has filed patent applications centered largely around the technology's use cases, including education data management and security.  The first application includes two elements: a hardware node and a method for maintaining the blockchain, which it repeatedly describes as a ""mining process."" Indeed, in one incarnation of the proposed invention, the nodes would operate a network that's akin to bitcoin's, which is an open-access network with a token.  As the application explains:  ""The distributed ledger may be a blockchain, which may be based, for example, on the principles used for the bitcoin blockchain or the like. The distributed ledger uses mining and proof-of-work mechanisms and it may use some kind of reward (currency), such as bitcoin as currency and/or as reward for performing mining. Moreover, the distributed ledger may use consensus mechanisms for ensuring that all electronic nodes have consensus about the distributed ledger.""  This isn't to say that Sony is launching its own cryptocurrency. But here, it seems that Sony is leaving the door open to the possibility by establishing the claim that its proposed invention could serve that purpose.  In the second application, ""Device and System,"" Sony hones in on the security risks in a network that only has a small number of nodes.  Because ""the number of devices accessing and contributing to the distributed ledger may be small, such that security issues occur,"" Sony proposes essentially boosting that number through the use of virtual nodes. The device proposed in that filing would ""[host] a plurality, e.g. 10, 100 or even thousands of virtual nodes, such that the number of virtual nodes may be much higher, e.g. ten times larger, than the [total] number of devices.""  Ultimately, the submissions appear less focused on the type of distributed ledger and more on the hardware and operational methods themselves. Sony indicates that the networks could be public or private, and could rely on either Sony's own software or ""distributed database technologies like Hadoop,"" as one of the filings states.

As detailed in theSouth China Morning Post on Thursday, Canaan has launched the AvalonMiner Inside, a TV set which according to the publication can process 2.8 trillion hashes per second.  Canaan is not the first company to experiment with hybrid mining and consumer products. Bitcoin startup 21 Inc and Chinese electrical appliances manufacturer Midea Group have also previously explored the idea. Midea, for example, envisioned implanting chips in appliances like air conditioners and dehumidifiers in a 2017 patent application.  Canaan has also debuted the Avalon Miner A9, which provides a hash rate of up to 30 TH/s, with a power consumption of 1,720 watts per unit, according to Canaan's website. The price of the new miner has not yet been disclosed on the website.  The Avalon Miner 9 represents the latest effort to move 7nm ASICs to the market. Back in May, Japanese IT giant GMO Internet revealed its new B2 miner would also sport 7nm chips.  The arrival of a 7nm chip is notable since it offers the ability to generate more hashing power while, at the same time, theoretically reducing power consumption – an important factor for miners that are seeking a return on their investment.  The current market leader Antminer S9 manufactured by mining hardware giant Bitmain offers 14TH/s at a power consumption of around 1,300W.  According to SCMP, Canaan sold almost 300,000 mining hardware units over the course of 2017, taking in about $205 million in revenue during that period.

42401739,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Gfr,1533230457,"Zedd, 3LAU and Big Sean: Tickets On Sale for First Blockchain Music Festival","Tickets for the first music festival set to be powered by blockchain technology are now on sale. Scheduled for this fall, the Our Music Festival is launching the OMF token at the University of California, Berkeley's William Randolph Hearst Greek Theater. The inaugural event hopes to appeal to the San Francisco Bay Area's technology crowd and will be the first musical entertainment experience to process booking fees on a live blockchain application — in this case, the ethereum network, an alternative version of the bitcoin blockchain.  Pre-sale tickets start at $25 and can be purchased as standard digital passes directly from crypto.ourmusicfestival.com and ourmusicfestival.com using U.S. dollars and the cryptocurrencies bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin. General tickets are being released tomorrow for $29 and will also give access to the one-day line-up. Electronic dance musicians Zedd, 3LAU and Matt + Kim, hip-hop icon Big Sean and pop singer Charlotte Lawrence are due to perform on-stage from 5 P.M. to 11 P.M. on October 20.  One of the headlining artists, 3LAU, whose real name is Justin Blau, also happens to be spearheading the event. The project has been a year in the making and represents a collective effort to fix the music industry with like-minded professional veterans who have worked at some of Hollywood and the Internet's biggest talent agencies and music groups — Creative Artists Agency, Paradigm Talent Agency, Spotify, Billboard, Prime Social Group, CID Entertainment and SINGULAR DTV, to name a few.  Our Music Festival, home to a decentralized, end-to-end, direct-to-consumer music ticketing pipeline, plans to stop ticketing vendors from scamming innocent buyers, artificially driving up prices, and squeezing profits thin for musicians and agents — problems commonly seen with Craigslist merchants and street scalpers that have long troubled the team behind the event. By making supply-and-demand economics fully transparent and ticket buyer identities digitally verifiable with blockchain technology, Our Music Festival can skip over the middlemen and streamline the music market for good, Blau told CoinDesk in an interview.  Even with ticket sellers that calculate pricing analytics — think StubHub and TicketMaster — many ticketing options offered through them are manipulated or fraudulent anyway, obfuscating the actual mathematics. Blau explained that without these bottlenecks avoidable only in a blockchain system, Our Music Festival fans can freely curate events and purchase tickets that are less expensive than standard fare price tags, which typically reach hundred dollar markups and do not allow for customization options.  Event attendees can also be encouraged to stay loyal to the music-going experience. Blau added that the tokenized ecosystem plans to let customers instantly exchange upgrades, merchandise, concessions and rewards via an all-in-one community portal that will be integrated into the booking platform with a recurring incentive structure, which he says enforces a sense of social belonging.  No crypto novice  The 27-year-old American music producer shot to fame in the early and mid-2010s for collaborating with EDM notables Dash Berlin, Alesso, Afrojack, R3hab and The Chainsmokers, and for remixing hit songs from pop sensations Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Adele, Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. As a Washington University of St. Louis finance student, Blau gave up a career on Wall Street to create dance music around the same time the Winklevoss twins introduced him to bitcoin.  Since then, in between gigs touring the Electric Daisy and Electric Zoo carnivals and debuting at the Hakkasan, Rehab and Drai's nightclubs on the popular music festival and Las Vegas residency circuits, Blau has frequently posted about cryptocurrencies on social media.

The Financial Supervisory Service's (FSS) appeal was part of a new study published by the agency on Thursday, which was first reported on by Korea JoongAng Daily. The study reportedly encourages South Korean regulatory agencies and companies to collaborate on the development of the proposed system, and also examines the use of the blockchain by stock operators around the globe.  The usage of blockchain in stock trading is already well established, with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) first trialing distributed ledger tech for its settlement and clearing system, called CHESS, in 2016. ASX said in April that it expects to roll out the new system in 2020.  Likewise, U.S. stock market Nasdaq unveiled a blockchain-based private securities platform in 2017, and the London Stock Exchange experimented with using the blockchain to replace paper trading certificates later that year. The Japan Exchange Group (JPX) also founded a consortium to explore blockchain applications to capital markets infrastructure in 2017.  The study reportedly noted that the exploration of blockchain use cases in Korea has only recently started, and that cooperation between private and public companies would be integral to the success of any future system.  ""There should be no barrier between public institutions and private companies in developing a blockchain system,"" the FSS was quoted as saying.

An 8-K form submitted by Long Blockchain to the SEC on July 26 and revealed on Wednesday shows that the firm received the subpoena on July 10, with the SEC ""seeking the production of certain documents."" Long Blockchain said it is ""fully cooperating with the SEC's investigation.""  The firm did not disclosed details of the documents being sought by the regulator.  The subpoena comes four months after Long Blockchain was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange after losing an appeal over the decision and a resultant drop in the value of its stock.  In February, Long Blockchain (which was called Long Island Iced Tea before the pivot) warned that it was facing the risk of being delisted since the SEC believed the firm ""made a series of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology.""  This is not the first time the SEC has probed into firms that saw soaring stock prices following claims of blockchain interest.  As previously reported by CoinDesk in April, the SEC also subpoenaed Riot Blockchain after it drew public attention in a similar fashion late last year.

The investigations are part of the U.S. regulator's wider effort to scrutinize public companies over whether their business claims are genuine or intended to capitalize on hype around tech like blockchain.

42401745,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Gkm,1533222033,Handshake Revealed: VCs Back Plan to Give Away $100 Million in Crypto,"A long-secret cryptocurrency project whose investor deck once touted Burning Man as central to its anti-capitalist ethos has finally arrived.  Released Thursday, Handshake, backed by top venture capitalists and some of the most well-known blockchain developers, has raised $10.2 million for an attempt to replace the digital entities that today authenticate web payments, in the process rewarding those who built the essential infrastructure for the internet itself.  Spearheaded by co-creator of bitcoin's lightning network, Joseph Poon, Purse CEO Andrew Lee, Private Internet Access founder Andrew Lee and CTO Christopher ""J.J."" Jeffrey, the effort is now backed by 67 individuals and funds including A16z Crypto, Founders Fund, Polychain Capital and Draper Associates.  The investors combined to purchase 7.5 percent of the protocol at a $136 million valuation.  The key difference here, however, is that this figure isn't a valuation for a company, it's a valuation for a protocol and its tokens – in the case of Handshake, there won't be any entity to support (or value) beyond the protocol.  So while a remaining 7.5 percent of tokens will be set aside for the project's ""principles"" (those involved eschew the term ""founder""), more notable is what's being done to quickly dismantle the entity that's bootstrapping the project and distribute the remaining 85 percent of tokens, worth a combined $115 million, at launch.  In interview, Poon touted the new cryptocurrency as an experiment that's heralding two leaps forward – an improvement on the existing CA system and domain registrars and also the initial coin offering (ICO) model itself, which that has found untested projects raising millions.  As such, Poon framed Handshake as a project intent on raising as little as possible, so that the largest amount could be given away to open-source developers.  Poon told CoinDesk:  ""There's this notion that crypto tokens when they go live, it's similar to late-stage venture financing, and this gives an alternate model for that. Essentially we give tokens as a gift, we're giving the coins as a gift to the community.""  All told, Handshake aims to give $250 worth of its tokens to *each* user of the websites the company has partnerships with – GitHub, the P2P Foundation and Freenode, a chat channel for peer-to-peer projects. As such, developers who have existing accounts on each could receive up to $750 worth of Handshake tokens.  Additional token distributions are set to go directly to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Tor Foundation and other like non-profits, while domains controlled by the protocol will go to those who can cryptographically prove they own one of the top 80,000 websites.  The goal, project leaders say, is ensuring what they framed as a recreation of the web, but without a shake-up in its stakeholders.In this way, Poon described Handshake as a donation, one that he hopes will set the tone for a new wave of more philanthropic blockchains.  ""One of the goals is to kill the ICO ecosystem and narrative,"" he said.  Old ideas, new twist  But if the idea already sounds too complex, Poon sought to stress the innovation with Handshake lies in the distribution, not the code itself.  A fork of a bitcoin software developed by Purse, Handshake offers ""no fancy contracts,"" just a simple digital, minable ledger to record engagements between users. Poon even went so far as to state plainly his belief the idea been done before, naming blockchain-based domain systems such as namecoin (one of the industry's earliest projects) specifically.  However, he framed the effort as one that sought to answer the question of why the project failed, given that he believes the idea and technical team were strong.  ""If you're apple, why would you use namecoin? It has amazing developers and tech, but there's always been a problem,"" he said. ""The way we attempt to resolve it is Handshake allows anyone to publish proof to the blockchain itself and then they get the domain name.""  Essentially, this would keep the decentralized equivalent of the Apple.com domain open to the company itself, rather than squatters and early adopters, who, hoping to score money on the flip, merely want to sell back these rights to those entities.  ""What can you do with the tokens, you can move the tokens around. You can use it to register for names,"" Poon continued.  As for the distribution, Poon, Lee and Lee sought to position the model not as an airdrop, in which funds are cryptographically distributed to those who are already users of a blockchain, but a return to the ""faucet model"" by which early adopters gave away thousands of bitcoin in order to get the word out about the project.  So far, investors seem keen on the idea, as the returns should the protocol become widely adopted (and accrue value) are still the same, even without the investment in an entity.  ""We support experimentation and see this as an interesting social experiment with an interesting distribution method,"" Ryan Zurrer, principal at Polychain Capital, said.  No foundation  But if rethinking the ICO and CA systems wasn't enough, Poon sought to brand the project in even larger terms, emphasizing how Handshake is properly expressive of what he sees as the key innovation behind cryptocurrencies – the ability to give value, not just create it.  Still, that's not to say getting the project off the ground didn't require time, legal work and the other trappings that have come to be associated with the ICO model.  In the case of Handshake, the project has been close to launch for at least three months, though Poon, Lee and Lee said it has been held up by questions of how to best position the wording around the project, as well as to finalize technical details.  The most notable change is that the project will no longer create a Handshake Foundation, a non-profit whose sole responsibility is to distribute the tokens and manage funds allocated to project contributors, instead automating the whole process to the extent possible.  ""The idea originally was that the foundation would manually verify ownership of each of these names and do all these things. But, we found a way to automate that on the blockchain,"" Lee, of Private Internet Access, said.  To best capture the ""spirit of open-source,"" those involved say that one day, there might not even be much evidence of a centralized start to the project at all. ""We're even thinking about turning off the website,"" Poon said.  However, that's not to say that he doesn't have every aspiration that the model and ideas will be lasting.  ""There's a lot of pieces to this, there's a notion of the nature of gift economies, perhaps there's this emergent game where it's in one's own self-interest to ensure that the overwhelming majority of tokens are properly distributed to humanity,"" he said, concluding:  ""I think there could be interesting developments about this, and it could be one of the key features of what the blockchain can provide.""

42401748,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Gll,1533218409,A New Bitcoin Mining Calculator Aims to Tell 'Truth' on Profitability,"""We joke about it being bitcoin's 'unprofitability' calculator.""  That's how CEO of RandomCrypto, Josh Metnick, described his newly released tool that calculates the profitability of bitcoin mining – the process of solving puzzles to earn bitcoin, usually only possible with expensive processors called ASICs.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Metnick hopes the new calculator will improve on other tools out there, which he thinks don't depict the full truth on whether mining equipment is worth buying and using. For example, using its new measurements at today's prices, RandomCrypto's calculator shows that all of the most popular mining hardware is unprofitable.  That includes Bitmain's flagship S9 and GMO's new 7nm B2, he claims.  ""Our goal is not to show mining as profitable or unprofitable – our goal is to bring more truth, accuracy and transparency to [proof-of-work] mining. Sometimes mining are profitable, and sometimes it isn't. The bigger picture is to create tools and reporting systems to keep the hardware manufacturers honest,"" Metnick told CoinDesk.  Metnick's quick to point out previous mining scams in the industry as examples of where the industry leaves transparency and honesty to be desired.  ""I spent a good portion of my life – years, really, many years – trying to chase down Butterfly Labs, Advanced Miner, and KnCMiner for the millions of dollars I sent them before they absconded with my life savings,"" he said.  Because Metnick himself has been actively mining since 2013, it's a project that's dear to his heart.  Metnick told CoinDesk:  ""This calculator is born of many years of getting screwed in numerous ways by mining companies.""  A different calculator  Online calculators let you input a bunch of variables like electricity cost, hardware cost and so forth, then output how much revenue these variables should lead to, based on the value of bitcoin at the time.  The ingredient RandomCrypto's calculator adds is pretty simple, but it was never deployed in existing models, Metnick said.  ""What we have found, over several years now of observations, is that all of the major bitcoin mining calculators out there show bitcoin mining output as 'profit,' instead of what it really is: output,"" Metnick said.  One key thing these calculators don't include is bitcoin's programmed-in ""difficulty"" rating – the higher the difficulty, the more power it takes to solve the puzzle required to mine bitcoin. So far, difficulty has grown exponentially with time.  Sites like CryptoCompare and CoinWarz show difficulty as a static variable, based on what it's measured at on any specific day.  Metnick argues that because the rapid growth in difficulty isn't factored into such calculators, it makes mining machines look more lucrative than they really are. The RandomCrypto team further argues that if difficulty has grown exponentially so far, this trend is bound to continue as it has for the past nearly 10 years, and calculators need to incorporate this fact.  ""Mining difficulty has been growing exponentially since the advent of bitcoin. To deny this, or not incorporate this fact, this reality, into a mining calculator, should be illegal,"" Metnick argued.  CoinWarz declined to comment to CoinDesk's inquiries, while CryptoCompare did not respond before press time.  Impossible to predict?  Metnick went on to say that, based on bitcoin's price at the time, smaller scale mining is not profitable currently.  ""As of the writing of this email, and price of bitcoin, there is not a single manufacturer selling an ROI [return on investment] positive machine at the retail level. Take a moment to pause on that,"" he argued.  At least, according to his new calculator, that is.  But, is this really possible to predict?  Although bitcoin's difficulty has grown rapidly the last 10 years, there's no way to know for sure that this trend will continue.  ""It's not as predictable as the sun, moon and the stars. But it is predictable within a tight range of specificity,"" Metnick said.  Using historical data they pulled together an algorithm that's been quite accurate so far, he continued, adding:  ""The models we coded on May 8 have not changed, and we have been within 1 percent accuracy.""

The sentencing was announced by the Department of Justice on Wednesday, after a federal jury convicted Thomas Mario Costanzo on five charges of money laundering on March 28. The sentence will credit time already served since his arrest in April 2017.  As previously reported, federal agents raided the man's home last year based on suspicion of unlawful possession of ammunition, as well as money laundering through a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange he operated.  Evidence presented to the court later showed that Costanzo had laundered $164,700 over two years through bitcoin transactions – money he took from an undercover federal agent, who told him the funds were from heroin and cocaine traffickers.  The release states:  ""When undercover federal agents approached Costanzo and told him that they were drug dealers, Costanzo provided them with bitcoin and told them it was a great way to limit their exposure to law enforcement.""  Costanzo was also found guilty of purchasing drugs with bitcoin and using the online bitcoin exchange to help others buy drugs without enforcing know-your-customer authentication procedures.  At the time of his conviction, the DoJ said each of the five money-laundering charges have a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  As part of the decision on Wednesday, the court also ruled that 80 bitcoins seized from Costanzo, provided by him to the undercover agents, will be forfeited.  Early this month, a former bitcoin trader and exchange operator from Los Angeles known as the ""Bitcoin Maven"" was also sentenced to one year in federal prison after she admitted to operating an unlawful money transmission business.

42401735,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Gbv,1533211246,Philippines' Proposed ICO Rules Presume All Tokens Are Securities,"The Philippines is close to introducing new regulations governing how companies can legally raise funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs).  To that end, the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published draft rules governing ICOs on Thursday, and is now seeking public feedback before they can go into effect.  The regulations notably assume that tokens issued in all ICOs are securities by default unless the issuers can prove otherwise.  The financial watchdog commented in a press release that most ICOs conducted in the Philippines have argued that their tokens were not securities and should not be governed by the SEC.  However, the regulator said it would be ""dangerous"" to let investors make judgments over the matter since they don't have sufficient resources to identify which ICOs might be scams, continuing:  ""Therefore, the SEC will put the burden of proving that the tokens issued through an ICO in the hands of the proponents by presuming that the tokens are securities unless proven otherwise.""  Under the proposed rules, companies registered in the Philippines and wishing to conduct a token sale would have to submit an initial assessment application to the SEC at least 90 days ahead of the issuance.  Apart from details of the project team – including names, ages and resumes – the application will also need to contain a review of the ICO proposal and its credibility, as well as a legal opinion from an independent third party to justify why the token is not a security.  After that, the SEC will issue a written report stating its decision on whether the proposed ICO is effectively a securities issuance or not.  The draft further states that ICO issuers can continue with their project even if their tokens are deemed by the SEC as securities, as long as they complete a registration process and obtain approval from the regulator before a token sale can commence.  If an ICO is only to be issued to a maximum of 20 people, or will be limited to institutional investors such as banks, insurance and investment firms, it could be exempted from the registration requirement.  The regulatory move comes as various countries worldwide are either developing legal frameworks to govern ICOs or are issuing guidelines on how to avoid falling foul of securities rules.  Most recently, a financial watchdog in Thailand moved to launch a legal registration process to allow ICO projects to fundraise in a compliant manner.

42401744,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Gjn,1533207606,"Bitcoin Bulls Defend $7,450 But Need Progress Soon","Having defended the key support of $7,455, the bitcoin bulls now need a quick move higher in order to neutralize the threat of a short-term bearish reversal.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,560 on Bitfinex – down 11 percent from the recent high of $8,507. However, that still marks a gain of more than 30 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755.  So, it is safe to say the bullish trend is still intact. Further, BTC's solid defense of $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the June low) seen in the last 28 hours has raised the prospect of a minor corrective rally.  However, the bulls have little margin for error and the upside needs to gather traction soon as the short-duration technical studies have already adopted a bearish bias, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart        The bearish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicates a short-term bearish setup. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has breached the key ascending trendline in favor of the bears.  Hourly chart  The 50-hour, 100-hour, and 200-hour MAs are trending south and are located one below the other, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. Meanwhile, the RSI has dropped below 50.00 (in bearish territory).  Clearly, the short-term charts are aligned in favor of the bears. So, there is a real risk of BTC falling below the crucial support of $7,455 in the next 24 hours.  Moreover, acceptance below that level would only bolster the already bearish setup discussed above and would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  View  BTC's solid defense of $7,455 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) is encouraging, but a positive follow-through needs to happen soon to invalidate the short-term bearish technical studies.  A lack of positive follow-through in the next few hours will likely yield a drop below $7,455.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $7,455 would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and would open the doors to $7,000 (psychological support).  On the higher side, a close (as per UTC) above $8,000 would put the bulls back into the driver's seat.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Participants in the round included ZhenFund, Digital Currency Group, INBlockchain, Blockwater Capital, Global Blockchain Innovative Capital, AlphaBlock Capital and AlphaCoin Fund, according to a press release.  Logos is working to build a payments network inspired by the bitcoin blockchain, with a focus on a scalable, rapid network that still maintains high levels of security.  The firm's CEO, Michael Zochowski, said the platform's advantage comes from its ""novel architecture,"" adding:  ""We're similar to bitcoin [but] a little bit more robust, cheaper and massively more scalable. We're very much focused on our core payments functionality rather than a general purpose network.""  As such, the company is developing a blockchain that combines aspects of various other existing protocols, including delegated proof-of-stake and sharding, to build a network capable of ""hundreds of thousands of transactions per second on the first layer,"" he said.  Currently, the project has an internal test network, or testnet, running with the core consensus and architecture implemented, and plans to roll out a public testnet later in stages this autumn.  ""We'll start engaging the community at that point. In terms of the mainnet, that'll be early 2019,"" said Zochowski.  The seed funding will go towards not only helping develop the network, but also to grow an ecosystem for the platform, he continued. This includes creating blockchain explorers and peer-to-peer transaction apps.  ""We're really going to build out the user experience, and also build out the business side of things,"" Zochowski said, though the immediate focus will be building and testing the network.  Zochowski compared the process he hoped Logos would undergo to NASA, noting that the space agency undergoes a strict development process when building any project.  ""We're really trying to adopt that development process,"" he said, concluding:  ""It's one thing to have a white paper and it's quite another thing to prove that everything works. Right now what we're trying to achieve is some rigorous benchmarking and then taking a step back and making sure that what we bring to market is truly high integrity code that people can build upon.""

Investors Protest a Proposal to Make Crypto Coins Divisible,"Tokens on the blockchain protocol neo may be indivisible – but it's becoming apparent that its community is not.  Perhaps ironically, it's the very notion of indivisibility that has proved contentious to the coin's investors and users in recent weeks. More specifically, a Github proposal to change the structure of the NEO token – one of two tokens native to the network (GAS is the second) – has the project's token holders up in arms.  Authored by neo co-founder Erik Zhang, the post ideates a new economic model for the upcoming version (3.0) of the neo software, one the developer team hopes will better incentivize active participation in the network, but that will also see the NEO token become divisible.  It's the latter change that has many network stakeholders in a frenzy.  One Discord user described the idea of making NEO divisible as ""just plain dumb,"" while others worried about its potential impact on NEO and GAS prices, saying:  ""Divisible NEO is big BS, I would never vote for that. Price will go to trash if they do that.""  But Da Hongfei, another co-founder of neo, said the proposal illustrates a system that can overcome the ""technical constraints"" of the blockchain, like slow transaction speeds, while setting the stage for loftier goals, like the decentralization of the network's governance process.  Previously called Antshares, neo was founded in 2014 with the goal of creating an enterprise-grade blockchain designed for digital assets, identity and smart contracts. After raising more than $3.7 million during an initial coin offering (ICO) and launching its live blockchain, or mainnet, in 2016, the project has scored significant interest, even being referred to as ""China's ethereum"" at points.  As of today, however, it's established a name for itself, and its tokens are valued at over $2 billion. Nonetheless, the co-founders believe the architecture of the network needs to be reworked.  According to Hongfei, the NEO token is currently indivisible for technical reasons that relate to its twin token model.  ""NEO is kind of like the stake of the network; GAS is designed as a utility,"" he told CoinDesk.  In practice, this means token holders use NEO to do things like voting for the network nodes that produce blocks and validate transactions as part of the project's delegated byzantine fault tolerant (dBFT) consensus mechanism. GAS, on the other hand, is used to pay for the execution of services on the platform, such as smart contracts.  Every time GAS is consumed on the platform, it is redistributed to all token holders. Because GAS is currently redistributed to all token holders proportionally to their NEO holding ratio, Hongfei says NEO cannot be divisible.  But this mass redistribution scheme is one thing the team behind the project would like to adjust when it next upgrades the protocol.  While reconfiguring the platform's economic model could be overlooked as mere technical minutia, it has become a flashpoint for other issues within the neo ecosystem – namely the platform's ongoing challenge with maintaining investor trust and its founders' promise to relinquish at least some of its power to token holders.  Empty polls and blackholes  According to Hongfei, restructuring neo's incentives system would tackle two hazards posed by the existing model.  For one, the current scheme does not incentivize inactive participants on the network (namely, those that do not vote in node elections) to become active. These users receive valuable GAS regardless of whether they vote or not.  And that could throw a wrench in the project's plan to ""decentralize,"" which is dependent on users partaking in governance, Hongfei said.  ""We need incentives for NEO token holders to vote for neo consensus nodes,"" he said.  The second hazard is more theoretical and involves what neo calls ""blackhole addresses,"" or wallets to which owners have lost their private keys.  Hongfei explained that it is possible that ""GAS will gradually be redistributed to those blackhole addresses and theoretically if the time is infinite, it is possible that all gas or almost all gas will go to that address.""  In the model proposed for neo 3.0, GAS would be sent to a pool instead of being immediately redistributed to all token holders. Once in the pool, GAS would be distributed over time exclusively to token holders that partake in voting for consensus nodes.  The new distribution method would also remove the technical barrier that requires NEO to be indivisible, Hongfei continued.  Unhappy investors  One possible outcome of making the token divisible is that it could become more accessible to investors in the event of a price increase.  However, the prospect of such a significant change to the project's economic model has left the neo community disgruntled. And even Hongfei isn't convinced that changing NEO's design is a good idea.  ""My personal opinion is [for NEO] to remain indivisible,"" he said. ""The price of one NEO token is about $30, that's not really a lot of money. I don't think people really need to vote like a fraction of $30.""  Despite the impact the proposal could have on investors' token holdings, their capacity to influence the design of neo 3.0 is limited. While Hongfei said that plans to alter the platform are still ""under discussion, nothing is all set,"" neo does not intend to allow token holders to vote on the proposed changes.  ""Currently the official channel is to discuss it on Github and many developers [and] users are posting their opinions of 3.0 and everyone is listening to that,"" he told CoinDesk.  But in the end, only five core developers (one of which is Erik Zhang) will decide what neo 3.0 looks like.  And according to Hongfei, that's because it's the developers who understand all the technical nuances of the blockchain.  ""Voting is a quite tricky system. If you ask people to vote on things they don't understand, the result won't be good,"" Hongfei told CoinDesk. ""Blockchain is a system that involves a lot of value; we don't want to make it too complicated. Complicated software will usually have complicated security issues.""  But the community seems to disagree, as one Discord user wrote:  ""If there is to be voting in neo, wouldn't voting on something as substantial as making NEO divisible make sense? Why don't they create a voting contract to allow people to vote on it? Otherwise, it's just a totalitarian decision anyway, and anything that follows is suspect.""  Waiting on decentralization  The revelation that neo will exclude token holders from this process is likely to raise eyebrows, particularly because the platform recently came under fire for another decision executed with limited community input.  The team claimed it had ""elected"" the first privately-held consensus node to the network several weeks ago. But in practice this meant that the Neo Foundation, which is comprised of Hongfei and Zhang, voted for one candidate – neo-funded developer collective City of Zion (CoZ).  Nonetheless, the foundation claimed that the event was a step toward gradually handing over power to token holders, and continues to maintain that the process was an election. And that's because, Hongfei claims, token holders could have voted in the election, theoretically.  ""Currently in neo's client or node software people can vote as they wish. But there are really very few people that know how to do it,"" he said, adding: ""We didn't advertise it.""  He also argued that token holders could have campaigned to be consensus nodes, or at least, ""it's almost possible now.""  But according to Hongfei, the current consolidation of power within the platform is all part of the plan.  ""We don't think we can be decentralized at this early stage,"" he said.  The development of neo 3.0 is expected to take at least a year. In the meantime, neo is expected to elect other privately operated consensus nodes, with Dutch telecommunications company KPN projected to be the next candidate.  Speaking to the network's planned decentralization, Hongfei said that it will come ""after a few years when the protocol is more stable.""  However, what that means is anyone's guess, as Hongfei continued:  ""We don't have like a technical definition of stable, but what we are sure of is currently it's not.""

The company released an unaudited quarterly financial report on Wednesday, which indicated it made an overall net revenue of $814 million, 6 percent of which came from the cryptocurrency buying service added to its Cash App late last year.  However, with the cost of facilitating bitcoin purchases mounting to over $36.5 million in the same period, Square again chalked up a small margin of $420,000.  That said, the firm's bitcoin sales profits nearly doubled compared to the first quarter's figure of around $223,000, as previously reported by CoinDesk. Meanwhile, Square disclosed that the carrying value of bitcoin held by itself was $0.4 million as of June 30.  During a conference call on Wednesday, Square's chief financial officer Sarah Friar said the goal of the bitcoin buying service on the Cash App is not ""trying to push on the monetization of bitcoin today.""  Square added the crypto service in November for a testing phase and then opened it up to consumers in January, allowing users in almost all U.S. states to buy and send bitcoins.  In June, Square received a so-called BitLicense from regulators in the state of New York, inching a step closer to offering the service to all states in the country.

42401743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Gio,1533181826,Before the 'Bomb' Hits: Why the Race Is on to Alter Ethereum's Economics,"The proposals just keep piling in.  At press time, a total of six ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) have emerged, each hoping to alter the project's code ahead of an upcoming software update (scheduled for October).  Driving the debate is ethereum's so-called ""difficulty bomb,"" a piece of code locked into the $45 billion platform that makes it so a steadily increasing amount of computing power is needed to mine its blocks and unlock its rewards. As designed, the code would eventually push the blockchain into an ""ice age,"" where no further blocks can be formed – that is, if left untouched.  Originally added to ease a transition in which ethereum would change how participants on its blockchain come to agreement – migrating from bitcoin's pioneering proof-of-work algorithm to an alternative called proof-of-stake – the difficulty bomb is set to reactivate in early 2019.  With no proof-of-stake migration in sight, steps must now be taken to delay the bomb — as well as reconfigure how ether rewards are released so as to ensure incentives are aligned to properly secure the blockchain.  But delaying the bomb brings its own problems.  For one, it will make blocks easier for miners to find, meaning ether rewards (currently at 3 ETH) must be decreased along with the delay to ensure that the cryptocurrency is produced at the same rate.  However, because ethereum lacks a formal agreement on its rewards model — unlike bitcoin, whose code caps its creation at 21 million units — there are differing perspectives on how much supply should be reduced, with many calling for a further reduction (and some for an increase) of the quantity of ether that is distributed to miners.  Further, having such a debate in a decentralized network brings added obstacles.  Users, for example, could vote according to how many coins they own — a popular signaling method, but one that has been criticized as too informal a metric. But miners (the individuals dedicating computing power to the software) aren't guaranteed to support a vote.  It's worth noting that debates concerning ethereum's undefined issuance model, as well as the difficulty bomb, have emerged several times throughout ethereum's three-year history.  As detailed by CoinDesk, it's a difficult topic because when it comes to monetary policy, miners and investors are pitted against each other, each calling for the opposite outcome in many cases.  As Lane Rettig, an ethereum developer, told CoinDesk:  ""The postponement of the bomb isn't particularly controversial, but the issuance is controversial. But for that reason the whole thing is controversial, you can't have one without the other.""  Together or separate?  Speaking in a core developer meeting Friday, the communication officer for ethereum, Hudson Jameson suggested a solution could come from separating the two mechanisms.  In a sense, he wants to settle each debate in isolation, tackling one problem before the other.  ""I think decoupling them would help us create priorities, where we have one thing which is an economic and technical change and the other which is a pure technical change that isn't as controversial a thing,"" Jameson said.  Several developers pushed back against this, though, stating that the two issues are intrinsically bound together and necessitate a combined solution.  Still, several EIPs target the question separately — impacting either the bomb or the reward schedule – while others bind them together.  Currently set to activate in 2019, two proposals seek to remove the difficulty bomb completely: EIP 1240, which simply removes the bomb, and EIP 1276, which seeks to remove bomb and alter ethereum's reward structure, lowering the current issuance of 3 ETH per block to 2 ETH.  Two proposals want to delay the bomb: EIP 1234 and EIP 1227, though each takes a different approach to raising and lowering the issuance total.  A further two proposals simply target the issuance rate: EIP 858 does not impact the difficulty bomb but reduces the reward to 1 ETH, and EIP 1276 wants to change the reward to 2 ETH.  Paying for security  Complicating the discussion is the differing views on how much ethereum users should pay for security (in effect that's how developers see blockchain rewards to begin with).  That's because, while the inflation rate of ether ensures its resistance against attacks — preventing the ability of malicious hash power to overwhelm the network — it's essentially a tax that comes from ETH holders directly, as inflation slowly decreases the value of their ETH over time.  Plans to limit the overall issuance with the upcoming consensus switch to proof-of-stake, an upgrade called Casper, have been under discussion for several years, however, that plan is now in question given the consensus switch is still several years away.  ""If you rewind way back two or three years ago when this difficulty bomb was first installed, the plan was we will be on Casper by now, by 2018. If that had happened then the bomb would never have been an issue,"" Rettig told CoinDesk.  Similarly, the supply schedule has yet to be formalized.  Retting said: ""Even with Casper, the issuance schedule, the rewards, the inflation, all that has never been worked out. It has never been finalized, this is called the parameterization of Casper and it's still very much a work in progress.""  Concerns from everywhere  To complicate matters further, there are developers on complete opposite sides of the difficulty bomb debate.  For instance, several developers argue that the difficulty bomb should remain permanently – even though it was only originally planned to last until Casper took effect.  ""It lessens the default effect of inaction being the most attractive option,"" ethereum core developer Nick Johnson said in the meeting.  Yet, Augur developer Mical Zoltu's proposal (EIP 1240) suggests the complete opposite – the removal of the difficulty bomb altogether. Discussing the proposal on a related forum, Zoltu argued that developers should fight against so-called ""planned obsolescence"" – or when software is programmed to become obsolete after a certain time – of the ethereum chain.  ""As a consumer, I have been bitten many times by planned obsolescence and now it is a business strategy that I actively try to avoid,"" Zoltu wrote.  The contention surrounding the difficulty bomb and ETH issuance has also led a group of miners to also speak up about their concerns.  Miners using GPUs, a class of mining hardware that risks being made obsolete due to the emergence of ASICs, are calling for developers to use this opportunity to change ethereum's underlying mining algorithm. According to GPU miners, in the absence of Casper, such a change would restore the blockchain to a more decentralized state.  As Casper developer Danny Ryan said in the developer meeting Friday:  ""They need to be talked about at the same time. A lot of people in the community want them to be talked about at the same time.""
