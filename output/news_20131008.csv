42376595,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bOtH,1381249226,"Four ""significant users"" of Silk Road arrested in UK","Four men in the UK have been arrested over their alleged roles in the online marketplace Silk Road.  One of the suspects is in his 50s and from Devon while the others are in their early 20s and are from Manchester. They were detained by officers of the new National Crime Agency (NCA) shortly after the FBI arrested Ross Ulbricht - the suspected creator of Silk Road.  The NCA has warned that other people in the UK suspected of being ""significant users"" of Silk Road will be arrested over the coming weeks.  Keith Bristow, director general at the NCA, said: ""These arrests send a clear message to criminals; the hidden Internet isn't hidden and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you.""  He went on to say criminals can't completely erase their digital footprints, no matter how technology-savvy they are.  ""They will always make mistakes and this brings law enforcement closer to them. These latest arrests are just the start; there are many more to come,"" Bristow added.  Andy Archibald, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said the NCA is committed to tackling the 'dark' or 'deep' web and those who exploit it. He added:    ""These criminal areas of the Internet aren't just selling drugs; it's where fraud takes place, where the trafficking of people and goods is discussed, where child abuse images are exchanged and firearms are traded.      Stopping this element of serious and organised crime will go a long way to protecting the public.""    It is not clear how much data the NCA possesses – for example whether it can see exactly which products each of the suspects purchased from the site.  While illegal drugs are reported to have made up 70% of the items sold on Silk Road, some other seemingly innocent items have also been up for sale on the site, including digital goods, jewellery and home and garden supplies. However, it seems unlikely the NCA will accept any claims from the suspects that their frequent visits to the site were merely to buy these innocuous goods.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/08/four-significant-users-of-silk-road-arrested-in-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/732552030988d881e8522e387b47bec1a634e19e-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376593,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bOs1,1381240813,Ripple Labs now taking cash payments following deal with ZipZap and SnapSwap,"Payment system and virtual currency Ripple is now taking payments in physical cash, thanks to a deal with ZipZap, and SnapSwap.  ZipZap  , a service that allows people to complete online transactions by paying in cash at selected locations, has partnered with SnapSwap, which is a gateway onto the Ripple network.  SnapSwap already enables people to make payments from their US bank accounts into Ripple, and to draw it out again using Dwolla.  Ripple has 12 gateways for its network, which allow funds to enter and exit the system from the world of fiat currency.  There was also a Bitcoin Bridge, announced in July, which enables anyone using the Ripple system to exchange money with merchants accepting bitcoin, via a Ripple wallet.  Users of this Bridge can make a payment to a bitcoin merchant using any currency, including fiat, and the merchant will receive the payment in bitcoins.  However, this now enables people to put money onto Ripple's payment system with nothing other than cash - and accounts with SnapSwap and ZipZap.  “It's great for people without a bank account,” said Patrick Griffin, executive vice president of business development for Ripple Labs, a for-profit enterprise which recently open sourced its software and renamed itself from OpenCoin. “Because it's not a gateway, ZipZap deposits the money into a Ripple wallet through SnapSwap so a user must have accounts with both.”  Representatives from Ripple Labs were unable to tell CoinDesk today how many units of ripples (the organization's virtual currency) have thus far been given away.  Under plans originally announced by the firm, 20% of the 100 billion ripples pre-mined were retained by the founders, while the remainder were to be given to the community in stages to encourage Ripple's growth.  The partnership announcement coincided with Ripple Labs’ first developer conference, which takes place at the Money2020 conference this week.

42376596,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bOvn,1381235051,BitPay offers new pricing plans for bitcoin payment processing,"Bitcoin payment processor BitPay has announced three new pricing plans ranging from $30 per month to £3,000 per month.  All of the plans come with 0% transaction fees and will be available from November, with the cheapest - the Professional plan – costing $30 per month. This can be used on one domain and offers ""easy"" eCommerce tools, retail POS tools, 20 shopping cart plugins, daily bank deposits to 30 countries and email support.  The Business plan costs $300 per month and can be used on three domains. It comes with all the features of the Professional package, plus it enables users to import sales data into QuickBooks, offers unlimited daily processing and also features phone support.  At $3,000 per month, the Enterprise package comes with all the features of the Business package, plus users will have a dedicated account manager, VPN access for fastest performance, priority phone and email support and it can be used on an unlimited number of domains.  Tony Gallippi, CEO at BitPay, explained why the company decided to introduce the new pricing options: ""BitPay is going after the SaaS (software as a service) model that is popular in other industries today and bringing this model to the payment processing space.""  He went on to say the new pricing plans mean merchants are only charged for the features they need and don't get stung with transaction fees.  The company still offers a Starter package, which has no monthly cost, but comes with a 1% transaction fee.  Gallippi said BitPay and other companies within the bitcoin space are moving on from last week's Silk Road scandal and suggested the closure of the black market website could be positive for digital currency.  ""The bitcoin industry has been making positive contributions for years, but these have been overshadowed by Silk Road. Now, there's room for other vendors to get their positive news out,"" he explained.

42376594,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bOuX,1381230803,MiiCard aims to cut the time it takes to buy bitcoins,"Bittylicious  and btcQuick have signed up with identity proofing and verification service miiCard to cut the time it takes people to buy bitcoins.  MiiCard, which stands for My Internet Identity Card, removes the need for in-person photo ID checks and allows people to register and buy bitcoins in under 15 minutes.  Currently, it typically takes a couple of days to register and become verified on a site that sells bitcoins. Users have to scan in an item of photo ID, plus a bill displaying their current address. This puts a lot of people off getting involved in the digital currency, as they simply can't be bothered to go through the motions. In fact, miiCard claims up to 70% of potential customers ""drop out"" or lose interest when they realise offline identity proofing is required.  Those who create an account with miiCard have to enter their name, email address and date of birth, then they are asked to state which bank they are with and enter their online banking details.  This is the bit a lot of people will have an issue with, but miiCard CEO James Varga assures it is safe to do and that the information given is protected by ""the most stringent and up to date security and privacy methods used by the world’s leading banks"".  Once the user's account is integrated, they are ready to go and can use their miiCard account to quickly verify their identity on a number of sites – now including btcQuick and Bittylicious.  The beginnings  Varga used to work for Money Dashboard – an online personal finance management solution similar to Mint.com – and became familiar with the difficulties people face when trying to sign up for financial products.  ""If you're being told to invest in something or consolidate your debts with a particular loan, what you really want is to be able to get on and do that straight away, but you can't because there's a lack of online identity verification,"" he explained.  MiiCard was created to address this problem, to ""tick that box to confirm you are who you say you are"".  Varga said that, over the past six months, miiCard has been approached by a few bitcoin companies that want to make it quicker and easier for people to buy and sell bitcoins.  ""We're seeing a lot of interest from the bitcoin space as people can see that the trust of identity that exists within the traditional financial services environment can be applied to the virtual currency market.""  He believes that miiCard will help to increase the number of people who invest in bitcoin, but conceded that it's not for everybody.  ""There will always be people who won't like the idea of it – just like there are people who don’t like online banking. It's designed to rule out inconvenience, though, so I know it will appeal to a lot of people.""  Buying bitcoins  Marc Warne, founder of UK-based Bittylicious, said he is constantly looking for ways to make it easier for his customers to buy bitcoins.  ""We are passionate about getting new users to join the bitcoin world with no issues, and this means that we even allow users that haven't registered an email address to get started. Of course, we only sell tiny amounts of bitcoins to unknown and unverified users, but we hope it's enough to start the bitcoin addiction!"" he added.  In order to sell large amounts of bitcoins to users, the company needs to know more about them, and this is where miiCard comes in. Warne explained:  ""We had some fantastic communication straight away with developers on the miiCard side to see where both our businesses could work together. It was clear that we were dealing with a brilliant team there so we were sold from the get go. After looking deeper into how easy it would be to integrate, it seemed like a no brainer.""  Jerrod Bunce, CEO of Colorado-based btcQuick, was equally impressed with miiCard's offering.  ""MiiCard allows us to verify an individual and also offer them our highest membership level – the highest level that can be reached via verification methods. Typically with miiCard, a user can register, link their miiCard account, and be able to buy bitcoins in less than 15 minutes,"" he explained.  MiiCard is currently valid in 10 countries: Australia, Canada, France, India, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Spain, the UK and the US, but the company is looking to expand its reach soon.

42376599,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bP0p,1381224618,Silk Road alternatives emerge as public hammers FBI bitcoin wallet,"The bitcoin community has been having some fun with the FBI, after it discovered the bitcoin address that the agency has been using to transfer Silk Road bitcoins to its own wallet. Pranksters have been sending tiny transactions to the address, giving them a chance to attach personal messages to the feds.  The FBI had already seized 26,000 bitcoins that had been held in escrow for Silk Road customers. It registered a bitcoin address using blockchain.info, which has a feature enabling people to attach notes if they send bitcoins using its wallet.  Among advertisements for bitcoin exchanges, pleas for charity, and sideways references to the X-Files, was one wag who seemed intent on Rickrolling the FBI. Repeatedly.  Others were more serious. “What we’re doing isn’t about scoring drugs or ‘sticking it to the man.’ It’s about standing up for our rights as human beings and refusing to submit when we’ve done no wrong,” said one commenter.  Others are already looking ahead, beyond Silk Road.    “They took down the site via conventional detective methods, but in the end, it doesn't really matter,” said Roger Ver, bitcoin advocate and founder of Memory Dealers, in an email to CoinDesk. “Here is an example of why.” He then posted a picture of the Black Market Reloaded site, which is a replacement for Silk Road.    Black Market was one of the sites listed in a note sent with a bitcoin transaction to the FBI’s blockchain.info address. That sender also posted the Tor link to another, called Sheep Marketplace.  Others are proposing alternatives that move entirely outside the Silk Road system, in which a central arbiter held bitcoins in escrow, releasing them when both parties to a transaction were satisfied.  Instead, Github user goshakkkhttps://github.com/goshakkk used the open-source software development site to propose a system called Silk Road 2.0 in which no money passed through a black-market site, and in which no central server or small group of servers hosted the site.  Instead, the proposal suggested using bitcoin transaction scripts to find an ad hoc third-party who would mediate a transaction. Their vote would be needed to finalize a transaction and release coins from a buyer to a seller on the network.  “Everyone can be an arbitrator and they get chosen based on their reputation,” (s)he said, proposing a system like Namecoin to maintain identities and reputation information. That system could also use a community-run, decentralized social network such as Diaspora, in which multiple users could host their own nodes, all operating an instance of a black market marketplace.  Presumably, this would have to run over anonymous browsing networks such as Tor to avoid people running the networks being picked up by the authorities – although we're not entirely sure what such people would be charged with, if they were not handling funds.  But such a site would be a future problem for the Agency, which has bigger issues on its hands right how, as it tries to access a further 600,000 bitcoins. The 26,000 coins it already accessed were held by Silk Road, but the other funds were held separately by Ulbricht, and are worth around $80m at today’s prices. An FBI representative told Forbes that the private keys to these wallets are encrypted.
