43297,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=235615,1652484615,The Forgotten Bitcoin Wallets – How They Could Affect the Economy,"According to the blockchain monitor &apos;Whale Alert,&apos; there was a reactivation of an old wallet containing 50 Bitcoins for the first time in 13 years and 6 months. The mining of the block was on November 22, 2009, just a few months after the first Bitcoin transaction in January 2009. Because there were no exchanges at the time, Bitcoin was effectively worthless. As a result, the first users of Bitcoin did so as a hobby and did not expect to become wealthy. The creation of the wallet was before the famous programmer Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas in May 2010. On February 8, 2011, Bitcoin and the US dollar were finally equal in value. The original owner of these coins has turned them into a $2,100,000 fortune. Even though the address was already existing while Bitcoin&apos;s creator Satoshi Nakamoto was still active in the community, he is unlikely to be behind the transfer. The most likely explanation is that someone found the private keys to millions of dollars in Bitcoin. Some believe that the address owner turned to the wallet after jail release. In recent months, there have been several cases of Bitcoin wallet reactivation for the first time in years. In May 2020, the price of Bitcoin fell after &apos;Whale Alert&apos; learned that coins from a wallet that is believed to be Satoshi&apos;s were reactivated. Later, they found that the transfer had nothing to do with the person who created Bitcoin.

These stablecoins which are pegged to the U.S. dollar have been the obvious winners from the recent crash but it seems that investors are taking it one step further this time around.

They were all stablecoins, and although some of them had lost their peg, the majority had been able to retain and provide some much-needed cover for investors.

42374737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2EpP,1652481134,Do Kwon: ‘I Am Heartbroken’ Over Pain Caused by UST Collapse,"Terra creator Do Kwon said in a tweet thread he was “heartbroken” about his creations losing functionally all of their value this week.  Kwon, who founded Terraform Labs – creator of the luna (LUNA) governance token, terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and various other cryptocurrencies – said he spent the last several days calling various community members about the tokens’ losing all of their value. Luna, which was worth nearly $120 at the start of April, collapsed in dramatic fashion this week and traded around at less than 1 cent as of press time.  “I still believe that decentralized economies deserve decentralized money – but it is clear that $UST in its current form will not be that money,” he tweeted.  UST, a stablecoin whose value was supposed to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar, lost that peg earlier this week and never recovered.  Kwon pointed to his “revival” plan on Terra’s Agora governance forum for next steps. Posted earlier Friday, the plan envisions distributing ownership in the network across UST and LUNA holders; it acknowledges Terra’s stablecoin as it stands is irrecoverable.  Read more: Do Kwon’s Proposed Terra ‘Revival’ Puts UST, LUNA Holders in Charge  “While a decentralized economy does need decentralized money, UST has lost too much trust with its users to play the role,” Kwon said there. The blockchain underpinning LUNA and UST was shut down twice by validators over the past day.  Kwon said that he did not sell any of his LUNA or UST during the “incident.”  The situation was exacerbated earlier this week when Terraform Labs and the Luna Foundation Guard, an entity tasked with maintaining the value of UST, appear to have hyperinflated LUNA by printing several billion tokens and dramatically increasing the number of tokens in circulation, further speeding LUNA’s price collapse in a bid to save UST.

42393816,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbHP,1652478304,Argentina Was at the Cusp of a Crypto Boom. The Central Bank Had Other Plans,"Argentina is enjoying a true crypto boom. Millions of users entered the market and the stablecoin segment grew sixfold in 2021. The country is tenth in the crypto adoption index published by Chainalysis. Local conditions are ripe for adoption: 58% inflation, devaluation of the national currency and lack of access to U.S. dollars. For many Argentines, crypto is the best way to safeguard their savings.  Banks were also getting into the action. On Monday last week, Banco Galicia (GGAL), the largest Argentine private bank by market value, added the option to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on its platform. The bank added a feature in its app’s investment section for users to acquire bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), USDC and XRP. That same day, the domestic digital bank Brubank began offering similar services. Both appeared to be a major step toward crypto’s mainstream adoption in Argentina.  Then, Argentina’s Central Bank (BCRA) tried to slam the brakes.  On May 7, only days after the banks’ announcements, the BCRA barred banks from offering services for any digital assets not regulated by the central bank. In other words, the banks themselves can no longer directly facilitate the buying or selling of crypto. Banco Galicia had to suspend its brand-new service.  It wasn’t a total crackdown, however: When Argentines trade on local cryptocurrency exchanges, they can still use their bank accounts to send and receive pesos.  The prohibition came as a shock to the banks involved in crypto. Banco Galicia had the BCRA's verbal approval to launch its new feature, sources close to the matter told CoinDesk, explaining that a Nasdaq-listed bank would not get into crypto without a real endorsement from the local regulator. Moreover, up to that point, there was no clear regulation preventing financial institutions from operating in the crypto sector.  But now there is.  According to Lirium, a Liechtenstein-based crypto company that was going to operate the feature offered by Banco Galicia, there were four other Argentinian financial institutions planning to launch a crypto trading service after Banco Galicia.  Speculation about the reasons for the BCRA's decision is varied. One of the strongest suspicions is the BCRA's need to please the International Monetary Fund (IMF), after a $45 billion debt deal that the country signed in March with the organization, which includes a provision discouraging the use of cryptocurrencies.  However, after an information request made by the local Nongovernmental organization Bitcoin Argentina weeks ago, the BCRA said that “crypto assets are not explicitly a target or benchmark of the program.”  Sources close to the matter not authorized to speak publicly told CoinDesk that the BCRA's ban simply reflects a lack of knowledge of the crypto world, and its fear that banks will ask for U.S. dollars to buy and sell crypto.  Currently, the main concern of the monetary authority is the scarce amount of U.S. dollar reserves, especially the liquid reserves, estimated by consulting firms to be negative. Due to that lack, for example, Argentines are prevented from acquiring more than $200 per month through banks and companies of different industries face production struggles due to import restrictions.  However, Banco Galicia was not going to get its crypto with dollars from the BCRA’s reserves, but through a liquidity circuit provided by OSL, a Hong Kong-based digital-asset trading platform that began operating in Latin America last October.  Exchanges are wary  The BCRA’s decision hasn’t directly affected Argentine crypto exchanges. But they are nervously watching for signals.  According to sources, the BCRA's decision generated bewilderment among the numerous exchanges operating in Argentina, which have recorded high growth rates in the last three years, largely because Argentines are not prevented from acquiring dollar-pegged stablecoins on their platforms. Consequently, in 2021, for example, the use of stablecoins increased sixfold, with DAI leading the way.  In Argentina alone, crypto exchange Lemon already surpassed 1 million users weeks ago, the company said. Belo, an exchange that began operating in September 2021, has already surpassed 170,000 users and, at a 100% monthly growth rate, plans to surpass a million users before the end of the year.  But despite the high growth rates, the exchanges are still nervous about the regulatory scenario. They all operate without a financial institution license, such as those held by Banco Galicia and Brubank, and most of them interact with the Argentine market — taking and returning Argentine pesos — as payment service providers, an activity regulated by the BCRA, since there is no special identity for exchanges in the country.  The BCRA, for now, has no measures planned against exchanges, sources at the monetary authority told CoinDesk. It's understandable: Exchanges are helping address Argentines' desperation to get rid of their pesos amid a foreign exchange restriction that prevents locals from acquiring dollars through banks. And all the companies provide their services without using BCRA’s reserves.  In any case, exchanges are wary, as it becomes increasingly clear that the current administration is not crypto-friendly. This isn’t the first time the BCRA stepped in. In June, it began an investigation of nine fintech companies for allegedly offering unauthorized financial intermediation through crypto assets. There were no further updates on that inquiry.  But at least for now, the monetary authority has not yet impeded these financial institutions from transacting with exchanges. That, directly, would be a shot to the heart of the Argentine crypto ecosystem.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/13/argentina-was-at-the-cusp-of-a-crypto-boom-the-central-bank-had-other-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4c7ce3c2a4a2dbfd4b694af6bba47bb85e5d2fa-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

GMT may rally to reclaim $4 if $1 remains as the primary support in the medium term. Past Performance of STEPN The GMT token is one of the top performers as per the arrangement in the daily chart. Rising a massive 61 percent against the USDT in the past 24 hours, STEPN is also outperforming ETH and BTC in the same period. The GMT crypto appears to be bottoming up after dumping 80 percent from May 2022 peaks. STEPN Technical Analysis GMT crypto prices are reversing from the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the March to April 2022 trade range. Overall, bears are in control. However, the wide-ranging bullish engulfing bar of May 13 may set the trend, triggering a leg up. As it is, aggressive STEPN bulls may load the dips above $1, targeting $2.7 in the immediate term. Further gains may see GMT reverse losses and reclaim $4 or April 2022 highs. On the reverse side, losses below $1 and May 12 may force GMT back to all-time lows of $0.02. What to Expect from GMT?

42374753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2F1z,1652474064,Market Wrap: Cryptos Are Higher After a Volatile Week,"Most cryptocurrencies traded higher on Friday as bearish sentiment waned. It appears that short-term buyers have returned from the sidelines, although technical indicators show limited upside from here.  Bitcoin (BTC) returned toward the $30,000 price level and was up by as much as 5% over the past 24 hours. Still, momentum signals remain negative on the charts after BTC's 17% dip over the past week.  For now, cryptos and stocks are experiencing a relief bounce, which could last for a few more days. Alternative cryptos (altcoins) outperformed on Friday, which reflects a greater appetite for risk among traders. For example, ICP, MANA and DOGE rallied by more than 20% over the past 24 hours.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Meanwhile, the Terra blockchain resumed activity on Friday following a nine-hour halt. The LUNA token continued to trade below 1 cent at the time the network was halted.  Also, on Friday, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) discount widened to an all-time low of 30.79%. The recent crypto sell-off also may have contributed to a wider GBTC discount. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $29,980, +5.17%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,057, +6.60%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,024, +2.39%    ●Gold: $1,808 per troy ounce, −0.88%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.94%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Crypto outflows  Fewer crypto traders sought refuge in stablecoins during the recent market sell-off. That suggests investors are starting to exit crypto markets.  The chart below, provided by Glassnode, shows the 30-day change in aggregate stablecoin supply (blue) alongside the contribution by stablecoin USDC (red). Since last May, USDC has been a significant contributor to total stablecoin supply growth. Recently, however, USDC has been the primary stablecoin asset experiencing redemption.  Stablecoin supply contraction signals a degree of net capital outflow from the cryptocurrency industry at large, according to Glassnode. ""Overall, there are a number of signals of net weakness in the space, many of which indicate that risk-off sentiment remains the core market position at this time,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  Interestingly, Tether's USDT has seen its supply continue to expand over the same period of USDC outflows. But since the start of April the aggregate stablecoin supply has plateaued.  It remains to be seen if trust in stablecoins will return following Terra's faulty experiment using algorithms. Some stablecoin issuers have assured market participants that not all stablecoins are the same (some are backed by cash-like instruments, while others try to maintain their value based on an algorithm that balances the stablecoin with a partner token). But recent episodes have exposed instability in the so-called stable corner of the crypto universe.  Limited upside ahead  For now, cryptos could face additional volatility ahead, which could keep some buyers on the sidelines (in stablecoins or cash).  Despite the recent price bounce, bitcoin's forward returns following a peak-to-trough decline of 55% or more tend to be flat or negative over the following six months, according to Delphi Digital.  Altcoin roundup  LUNA exchange-traded product issuances halted: VanEck, Valour and 21Shares, all of which offer LUNA-related exchanged-traded products (ETP) in Europe, suspended issuing shares, citing the network’s recent issues, which include two complete shutdowns of the purportedly decentralized network. All three products lost close to 100% this week. Read more here.  Do Kwon’s Terra revival plan: A “Revival Plan” was submitted Friday by the Terraform Labs CEO.

The cryptocurrency is still down by 82% from its all-time high of $3.10, achieved in September of last year. Some analysts have attributed recent gains to a short-squeeze rally, which occurs when a large number of short sellers exit their positions.

There is an estimation that the use of electric vehicles worldwide prevents the release of about 50 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. This is less than half of what Bitcoin produces each year. There has been an increase in Bitcoin&apos;s carbon footprint by a factor of five in just two years.

Out of this amount, $240 million liquidations have belonged to short traders. Crypto Shorts Observe $240 Million In Liquidations Over Last 24 Hours In case anyone isn&apos;t aware of what &apos;liquidations&apos; are, it&apos;s best to first take a brief look at the workings of margin trading in the crypto futures market. When an investor opens a, say, Bitcoin long or short contract at a derivatives exchange, they first have to put forth some collateral called the &apos;margin.&apos; This margin can be in BTC, any other coin, or even fiat. Against this margin, the investor may choose to take on &apos;leverage,&apos; a loaned amount often many times the initial position. The advantage of leverage is that if the price moves in the direction the contract bet on, the profits earned are then many times more now.

When such losses eat up a specific portion of the margin, the exchange forcefully closes off the Bitcoin position. This is what a liquidation is.

42393828,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbmB,1652468418,‘Stable in Name Only’: Stablecoin Issuers Speak Out as UST Craters,"As the cryptocurrency industry takes stock of the dramatic unraveling of the UST project, those that build and maintain stablecoins are at pains to point out that these instruments aren't created equal.  That message needs repeating, says Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, creator of the USDC stablecoin, because it’s not obvious to people outside of crypto and that may include regulators and politicians whose attention will now be focused on the industry.  “I do think there’s a conversation around disassociation; that the term of art ‘stablecoin’ has probably run its course,” Disparte said in an interview.  “It does warrant a discussion around, do algorithmic stablecoins even belong in the class of instruments that are subject to existing regulations? Do they belong inside the perimeter that touches real consumers and real payments?"" he added.  Circle’s USDC, which counts BNY Mellon as a custodian and which recently received investment from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has a circulation of $49 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Tether, the largest asset-backed stablecoin with a $79.3 billion market cap at the time of this writing, generally held its peg over the course of this week, confirming on Thursday that it was continuing to honor redemptions.  Speaking about the Terra debacle during a Twitter Spaces discussion, Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino echoed Disparte’s call for clearer classification of stablecoins.  “We would like to see a categorization of stablecoins, where there are of course the centralized stablecoins, and Tether is the biggest one, and there are algorithmic stablecoins,” Ardoino said. “I believe that it is really important for customer protection to have some sort of guidelines.”  Disparte said that while regulators have so far placed a lot of attention on asset-backed stablecoins such as USDC, algorithmic stablecoins have so far been a bureaucratic “blind spot.”  “Those are the ones that are blowing up, and so I think it’s an association problem,” Disparte said. “It’s a ‘stable-in-name-only’ problem. But the risk that has manifested itself is exactly why the policy conversation about these types of issues matters.”  To be clear, there are generally thought to be three varieties of stablecoin: fiat collateralized (USDT, USDC), crypto collateralized (DAI, sUSD) and algorithmic (UST, IRON).  Despite a blurring of classifications, some lawmakers are making distinctions, as Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania did earlier this week as UST catapulted its way into congressional testimony.  Spectrum of stability  As for algorithmic stablecoins, there’s a spectrum within that category, said Fernando Martinelli, CEO at Balancer Labs, an automated market maker in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.  “There has always been a question mark within that third category of algorithmic stablecoins,” Martinelli said. “You can’t tell if an algorithmic stablecoin has no substance or is not well designed. There are some that are algorithmic that are collateralized to a high degree, but not over-collateralized.”  Since Terra began blowing up, DAI, a five-year-old overcollateralized stablecoin overseen by the MakerDAO community, has held its peg and carried out liquidations of collateral in an orderly fashion, which has been “a great test of the system,” said Luca Prosperi, a leader on lending oversight at MakerDAO.  MakerDAO’s DAI is stable because it’s conservative and is overcollateralized, Prosperi said. The current collateral ratio is 175.59%, meaning each DAI is backed by $1.7558 worth of collateral; notably, the USDC stablecoin currently accounts for 41% of collateral used to mint DAI, according to on-chain data compiled by Dai Stats.  Maker’s automated liquidation mechanism starts liquidating collateral to protect itself and has shrunk accordingly, down to a $6.4 billion market cap.  “Maker did exactly what it was supposed to do,” Prosperi said in an interview.  “It shrank because the economy is shrinking and the currency base is shrinking,"" he added.  ""The system has been stable because it’s been built in a very conservative way, and that took a lot of effort from core team members because this community is very impatient. So when Terra was growing, a lot of people were accusing us of being too conservative. But we’re running a currency.”  Concerning Circle’s point about terminology and how this will play in the eyes of regulators, Prosperi said calling something a “stablecoin” is a great marketing tool. But he cautioned against a straightforward recategorization since there is a “continuum.”  At one end of the spectrum is USDC, “a plain vanilla coin that is very safe, is not very innovative but is a great bridge,” Prosperi said. The other extreme is UST, and DAI is somewhere in the middle, he said.  “I think we will see more and more and more diversification of this term into sub-terms that reflect much better what are the single-use cases for each of these projects, and I guess that some of the best projects will work together,” Prosperi said. “I think USDC can be a great collateral for Maker that can create an overlay of leverage that is conservative through DAI.”  On the subject of regulatory scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins after UST’s demise, Prosperi said MakerDAO is a “weird animal” in that it’s a decentralized community rather than a legal entity and a permissionless protocol that can’t be switched off.  “I think there will be some pressure from the regulators, for sure. But I think Maker is probably not in the frontline,” he said. “I think USDT, USDC, these ramps are the frontline, and other services that allow liquidity to come on-chain will be scrutinized.”",NEUTRAL,USDT | DAI | USDC,LUNA | MKR | USDT | DAI | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/13/stable-in-name-only-stablecoin-issuers-speak-out-as-ust-craters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ea0f7ce297e1802b1202926d2e41f007f6d860d-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411795,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5cb,1652467958,Crypto Savings Accounts: What You Need to Know,"By default, blockchain protocols don’t pay interest to those holding their native currencies – unlike interest paid by a conventional savings account or a dividend paid out to shareholders. But there are plenty of companies that will pay you interest on your cryptocurrencies if you park your holdings with them.  Some companies in this category stake your crypto to enhance the security of a blockchain, others add liquidity to vast pools of crypto that power decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, some may lend your crypto to others and finally, companies may invest your crypto. But they all have one thing in common: They use the money they earn from these activities to pay you regular interest on your holdings.  Read More: What is Staking?  How crypto savings accounts work  Crypto savings accounts were created because interacting with unfamiliar protocols by yourself can be confusing and complicated. For people who just want to earn some interest on their crypto and not let it just sit there, the crypto savings account may be an elegant solution. Just like a savings account with a conventional bank, the company behind a crypto savings account will lend, invest or stake your crypto on your behalf, then pay you a cut of the proceeds as regular interest payments.  Many exchanges (like Coinbase or Binance) offer crypto savings accounts, as do crypto companies like BlockFi, Celsius and Nexo. These companies differ vastly in the interest rates they provide for their users, and in the terms under which interest will be paid out, such as the annual returns, lock-up periods and the regularity of interest payments.  For example, take BlockFi, a lending company that has attracted more than $10 billion in assets from over a million clients. It offers variable rates of up to 11% annual percentage yield (APY). Popular coins like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have comparatively low interest rates of up to 3%. Stablecoins like Gemini’s GUSD carry interest rates of 11%, and alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, cardano (ADA), solana (SOL) and avalanche (AVAX) come with interest rates of 10%.  Crypto savings accounts may offer you more favorable rates if you agree to lock up your crypto for a while, or if you hold a platform-specific token. Nexo, for instance, increases interest rates by up to 4% for holders of the platform’s governance token, NEXO. Binance and Crypto.com are among companies that offer greater interest rates to holders who lock their tokens away for months at a time; keep in mind this kind of deposit means you can’t sell that crypto in the event of a sudden downturn.  Some crypto savings accounts, like those offered by BlockFi and Celsius, have drawn scrutiny from regulators. In February 2022, BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million in fines to U.S. regulators for its crypto lending product, the BlockFi Interest Account, following charges that the account constituted an unregistered securities offering. Now, BlockFi no longer offers these accounts to U.S. citizens.  Why consider crypto savings accounts?  Of course, the main advantage of decentralized finance (DeFi) is that it allows anyone to access services that in traditional finance would only be available to institutional investors.  Many DeFi protocols offer greater returns than savings accounts run by large corporations; they can produce yields as high as 20%, but many aren’t beginner-friendly. Some services, like Argent Wallet or Zapper, let you interface with DeFi protocols through an app that is just as easy to use as a crypto savings account.  So why would you opt for a crypto savings account over a DeFi protocol, if the money ends up in the place, anyway? Why not just cut out the middleman?  For some, the answer may be that as well as convenience, these companies handle some of the risk. Even though BlockFi, for instance, could go bust if it lends your money to dodgy borrowers, it has agreed to pay out depositors first in the event of an insolvency. Some companies, like Nexo, are backed by insurers and work with established custodians, such as BitGo.  As investors have seen in May 2022, a protocol like Anchor, which provides yield based on UST deposits, can struggle when the token melts down. As of writing, Anchor has proposed cutting yield from an average of 19.5% to 4%, which is a major slash in rates. Ultimately, Anchor isn’t regulated and doesn’t guarantee rates or deposits.

42411801,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5t8,1652466757,What Is a Node?,"In computer science, the term ""node"" simply means a device that plays a part in a larger network.  In the context of crypto and blockchain, a node is one of the computers that run the blockchain’s software to validate and store the complete history of transactions on the network.  How nodes work?  Blockchains are distributed ledgers that store the complete history of transactions on a certain network. It is a sequence (chain) of sets (blocks) of transactions that everyone in the network agreed to be legitimate.  If you wondered where the blockchain is – it is in the nodes. Each node holds an identical version of the transactions.  When there’s a new group of transactions (a block) on the blockchain, it gets broadcast from node to node so that every one of them can update its own database in the same way.  You may have heard that a blockchain network is ""distributed"" and ""peer-to-peer."" This is because nodes are responsible for maintaining the correct database of past transactions in a distributed way, validating each other’s dealings on the network.  Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work  Who can run a node?  In traditional finance, payment networks such as Visa or Paypal are held by a central administration.  In the case of most cryptocurrencies, the nodes of a blockchain do not rely on any validation from the top of the system because they check and verify each other by a consensus mechanism.  Thus, anyone can set up a node by downloading the blockchain’s software onto their personal computer anywhere in the world.

It currently stands in the 14th position in the CoinMarketCap ranking of cryptocurrencies in their market capitalization. It is trading at $0.6605 at the time of writing. However, it experienced a market implosion. TerraUSD saw its price gain a 24 hours minimum and maximum price of $0.2998 and $0.9206, respectively. It ought to have equivalent value to the United States Dollar, but this implosion is its worst performance since its launch. It attained its maximum price of $1.05 on January 30th, 2021.

42411464,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO53Q,1652466480,The Human Cost of Lunatic Hubris,"As the collapse of the Terra ecosystem enters its final, definitive stages, signs of the real-world wreckage caused by the flawed virtual project are impossible to miss. On social media and message boards, former LUNA backers are reporting huge losses, despair and hopelessness. Secondhand reports suggest a rash of suicides and attempts.  It's a sobering moment for those of us in the crypto-watching business. I’ve spent a great deal of time over the last two years trying to highlight absurdities in the bubbly crypto market (including predicting luna’s failure), but I still find myself somewhat shocked by just how exposed civilians became to one of the most experimental projects in the industry. And to be explicit, the crypto industry is still best thought of as entirely experimental.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The scale of the loss is, in one sense, easy to understand: It is total.  The Terra ecosystem has entered a hyperinflationary “death spiral.” This fallout was baked into the network’s supposedly stabilizing algorithm, and LUNA will continue to asymptotically approach zero. The UST algorithmic stablecoin price, currently at 18 cents instead of a dollar, will crumble towards zero as well. A ""recovery plan"" posted by Do Kwon this morning is an insulting joke. That wipes out roughly $68 billion, the combined paper value of LUNA and UST at the end of last week. Exchanges continue to facilitate trading in the tokens, a decision with murky ethical implications.  The scale and severity of individual losses is harder to grasp. As a thought experiment, cut LUNA/UST’s total supply cap in half to account for the internal holdings of ecosystem projects and assume outside investors held an average of $20,000 in UST or LUNA before the crash. Dividing $34 billion by $20,00 implies 1.7 million holders lost what 99.9% of the humans on Earth would consider a life-changing amount of money.  Those weren’t all real dollars because many bought LUNA below the May 12 price peak. But paper losses can still be devastating, and many folks did lose real money, particularly those who bought supposedly “stable” UST to farm the 20% yield on the system’s heavily subsidized Anchor lending protocol.  The signs of deep and widespread distress have been mounting all week. Matthew Graham, a crypto VC noted for his accessibility online, reports getting a wave of despairing messages from those caught in the broken system’s catastrophic unwinding. Police have reportedly been called to protect Terra founder Do Kwon’s home in South Korea, where angry investors have reportedly been threatening his safety.  See also: Do Kwon's Proposed Terra 'Revival'  The darkest reports are of people contemplating or following through on self-harm. In a tweet that is no longer public, one former LUNA partisan going by @terranaut3 claimed to know of at least eight people who have taken their own lives in the days since the unwind. The Terra subreddit is full of reports of suicides and attempts, links to mental health hotlines and dire reports of financial immolation. Most of that was posted before the forum was locked two days ago, when LUNA was still trading at hundreds of times its current price. CoinDesk hasn’t confirmed these stories, but they seem all too plausible.  Here to help  I am not a counselor, but for anyone in this position there is one key practicality: Declaring bankruptcy is a far better option than harming yourself. That’s particularly true in the U.S., where bankruptcy laws in some states could protect you from seizure of your home or automobile.  Crypto washouts aren’t new, but these reports of despairing LUNA holders are novel in one way: a huge number of “normies” appear to have been suckered into buying UST and LUNA. For most of the time that I’ve spent in crypto, the bulk of the money in the system came from people who were actively engaged with crypto ideals or technology, or from investors and traders with big risk appetites.  The 2020-2021 crypto craze was much bigger and had much wider retail reach, so its fallout will be fundamentally different from the deflation of the 2018 crypto bubble. We can certainly expect to see a rush of regulatory scrutiny in response, but crypto insiders should also take time to reflect on whether their behavior has put retail speculators at unnecessary risk.  See also: Is Bitcoin a Risk-On or a Risk-Off Asset? Maybe It's Neither | Opinion  High on the list of examples here is crypto fund manager Mike Novogratz, who famously displayed a huge LUNA tattoo in January and declared himself “officially a Lunatic.” Reports have since surfaced that Novo’s fund actually exited LUNA by March, but if he ever disclosed that walkback it didn’t get remotely the traction of his bullish flag-waving. From the outside, that looks an awful lot like pump-and-dump behavior, in spirit if not substance.  The other shift I hope to see out of this mess is a lot more humility, critical thinking and serious openness to contrary opinions. Before the death spiral began at the start of the week, about 17,000 CoinDesk visitors read my April 22 piece outlining the scenario for LUNA’s failure that ultimately played out. If just a few dozen of those readers took steps to protect themselves before that failure actually happened – heck, if even one reader did – that’s what I’m here for.

It is a way for people to send money quickly and efficiently to one another without using banks or intermediaries. From its humble beginnings to witnessing various value spikes and crashes to getting adopted as a legal tender in sovereign nations, Bitcoin stands as the most popular and the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. A prominent part of Bitcoin&apos;s decentralized network is its nodes. Nodes are responsible for a very significant role within the network. These nodes make sure the network functions properly. They are essentially computers that run the Bitcoin network. A diverse, distinct set of nodes run the network. These nodes are responsible for the network&apos;s proper operation and maintenance of its integrity. It&apos;s worth noting that Bitcoin nodes are not the same as the consensus mechanism. The nodes check to determine genuine transactions before the consensus mechanism kicks in. Types of nodes There are four different classifications of nodes on the Bitcoin blockchain: full nodes, supernodes, light nodes, and mining nodes. Full nodes store copies of the blockchain ledger. They make the network decentralized and serve as a reference point for verifying the blockchain&apos;s history.

42374735,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2EkN,1652462044,LUNA Exchange-Traded Product Issuances Halted After Price Shellacking,"Three different exchange-traded product (ETP) issuers announced they will suspend trading and issuing shares in LUNA-related investment vehicles after the cryptocurrency lost almost all of its value over the course of a week.  VanEck, Valour and 21Shares, all of which offer luna ETPs in Europe, suspended issuing shares, citing the network’s recent issues, which include two complete shutdowns of the purportedly decentralized network. All three products lost close to 100% this week.  VanEck alerted investors Friday that it will be temporarily suspending creations and redemptions of shares in its VanEck Terra ETN (exchange-traded-note), which trades in several European nations. The firm pointed to the “loss of most of its value and the halt of the Terra network.”  VanEck added that it is “unable to conduct transactions in Luna through the Terra network. Therefore, it is technically not possible to accept creations and redemption for VanEck Terra ETN.”  Likewise, Valour said it is halting trading of its Valour Terra (LUNA) SEK product, which trades on the Nordic Growth Market in Scandinavia. The firm cited “high volatility and the prevailing uncertainty around the Terra ecosystem.”  Valour also said that it seeks to “provide a market, through the market maker, as soon as it is possible and allowed.” Valour is a unit of Canadian-listed DeFi Technologies.  Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Swiss-based 21Shares told CoinDesk that given the LUNA network “operating intermittently and inconsistently, 21Shares is unable to provide creation and redemption operations and is suspending the quotation of the Terra ETP. We will continue to closely monitor this fast evolving situation on the underlying.”  21Shared warned investors on Thursday that “if the price of LUNA drops to zero, that will be reflected in the indexed products and the value of the tracker fund will also fall to zero. As LUNA experiences low prices and high volatility, it is likely that exchange spreads will continue to widen, which may ultimately lead to delisting on the part of the exchanges.”  Read more: LUNA, UST Still Available on FTX and Other Exchanges Despite Terra Blockchain Halt",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/13/luna-exchange-traded-product-issuances-halted-after-price-shellacking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89057cbb45397da781b232ae21a9d8a6693c942d-6048x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since the real hurdle to expanding a market is turning curious people into investors in order to raise the market cap of NFTs, it&apos;s the new investors that need to be supported. The problem is that the current poor user experiences in the NFT space are pushing away new investors and lowering the market cap. Research shows that the barriers to NFT adoption are reliability, education and necessity. These barriers have severely limited the adoption of NFTs. One columnist for The Daily Eastern News claims that NFTs are &apos;really confusing&apos;, while other writers criticize NFT marketplaces for being too technical, confusing and fragmented across Web 3.0. Among the different marketplaces, many have attempted to remove barriers to entry for new NFT investors. One such example is Opensea which added MoonPay as an option to purchase cryptocurrencies. By using MoonPay, an investor can directly add funds and purchase NFTs through their app. However, MoonPay is banned in numerous countries and states.

The plan comes as Terra’s terraUSD (UST) stablecoin, which is supposed to be pegged to the price of $1, “death spiraled” below 15 cents this week – wiping out over $30 billion in value. UST’s sister token, LUNA, which propped up the stablecoin’s value, has fallen to below a penny (LUNA was worth above $80 just a week ago).  In Friday’s proposal, Kwon, who created the Terra blockchain with his Terraform Labs team, concedes that the Terra ecosystem has experienced total collapse.  “Even if the [UST] peg were to eventually restore after the last marginal buyers and sellers have capitulated, the holders of Luna have so severely been liquidated and diluted that we will lack the ecosystem to build back up from the ashes,” Kwon wrote.  He continued, “UST holders need to own a large share of the network, as the network’s debt holders they deserve to be compensated for the tokens they have been holding to the end.”  This is a developing story.

Coinbase Global (COIN) jumped almost 18%, MicroStrategy (MSTR) gained over 21% and Toronto-listed Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY) rose about 14%. Additional gainers included crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital (SI), up 23%, and crypto broker Voyager Digital (VYGVF), up 24%.  Bitcoin mining stocks were also up significantly on Friday, led by CleanSpark (CLSK) and Hut 8 (HUT).  Gains in bitcoin (BTC), which was up 4% over the last 24 hours, and ether (ETH), up 5%, along with a broader tech stock rally were helping the cause as investors have recently fled high-growth tech stocks and riskier crypto assets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was rising over 3% Friday.  Coinbase got a much-needed boost after posting weaker-than-expected earnings on Tuesday that caused its stock to fall as much as 34% this week. Oppenheimer defended the company’s 10-Q risk disclosure that led to investor concerns in a note on Thursday, saying the filing and tweet from CEO Brian Armstrong are “grossly misunderstood and being taken out of context.” Analyst Owen Lau maintained an outperform rating and price target of $197.  Shares of MicroStrategy, which holds billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet, were down as much as 45% at one point this week. Despite bitcoin’s latest declines, CEO Michael Saylor tweeted on Tuesday that the company’s bitcoin-backed loans were not a cause for concern.  The collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) along with the LUNA ecosystem also sent broader crypto prices lower this week.  “The extent of the damage caused from the depegging of recent stablecoins, and collapse of LUNA is unknown and will likely continue to play out in the weeks to come, but we expect that recent events in the crypto market to be catalysts for regulation, particularly around stablecoins, which we think would be welcomed by investors,” Chris Allen, an equity research analyst at Compass Point, told clients in a note Friday.  Elsewhere, Robinhood (HOOD), which has a significant crypto trading business, rose over 26% on Friday after it was learned that FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had taken a 7.6% stake in the online brokerage.

42411457,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4ja,1652455914,Why the Fed Will Go Back to Easy Money,"If you’re invested in crypto, it’s hard not to think about the red ink in your wallet right now as concerns over the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have walloped token prices.  But if you want to think about the long-term outlook, it’s better not to look at your “DeFi” holdings but at your “TradFi” portfolio of stocks and bonds. While the losses haven’t been as brutal there as in crypto, those markets are also tanking, and to such an extent that it will eventually prompt a policy response, one that will impact crypto.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The Fed is currently in a hawkish mode as it is dead set on choking off inflation. But it’s easy to imagine that once Wall Street’s pain feeds into the mainstream economy – which it most certainly will – and when that starts to fuel political easing – which it most certainly will – the central bank will turn dovish again. After that, economic circumstances in the post-coronavirus pandemic world could quickly become so dire that, in the absence of other options for addressing them, the Fed and other central banks will return to the same policy framework of the past decade and a half, with interests near zero and quantitative easing (QE) the norm. And that will be the foundation of a crypto rebound.  The complicating factor here is what this might mean for the Fed’s reputation. If it returns so quickly to a policy solution that has created wild distortions and contributed to the inflation woes of the past year, might that show that our entire monetary system is broken? Might that finally be the moment in which people recognize that we need a new model?  After so many false starts, I’m reluctant to declare that the next cycle is the one in which crypto and Web 3 technologies and ideas rise above the fad-like way in which mainstream investors and businesses otherwise tend to engage with them and instead become more integrated into the global economy. But I do think a dynamic in which central banks feel compelled to deliver “helicopter money” could have an “Emperor’s New Clothes” effect where people question the dominant financial paradigm and look to alternatives.  Broken government = broken money  Before we view what lies ahead of us, let's turn the clock back 14 years to address the root problem.  In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, it became clear in the U.S. that a failure of federal governmental action left monetary policy as the only lever for boosting economic growth. That dependency is now, arguably, even more entrenched.  It wasn’t always the case. In the 1930s, the solution to the Depression lay in the rollout of massive government-funded public works projects and the creation of a welfare backstop for those out of work. This eventually drove economic recovery and created an infrastructure base upon which the U.S. economy’s great 20th-century expansion was built.  But in 2009 and beyond, the Obama Administration was thrust into battle with a Republican-controlled Congress. The two sides searched, against all odds, for a bipartisan agreement to back fiscal spending projects, but other than the controversial trillion-dollar bailout programs that kept Wall Street from imploding, nothing substantial to address mainstream America’s needs was ever passed. Stimulus initiatives became piecemeal and politicized and were ultimately insufficient to give the U.S. economy what it needed to grow.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Will Rising Interest Rates Sink the Crypto Ecosystem?  This was a deeper problem than most people recognized. It directly challenged confidence in the democratic process, which is supposed to be the mechanism by which public resources are distributed in service of a common national interest.  Libertarians, of which the crypto community claims many, might argue that the best thing the government could do was to get out the way. But their idealism tends to ignore the preexisting market distortions created by Wall Street’s politically privileged place in the economy, a privilege that was most clearly manifest during the housing bubble that preceded the crisis. As such, “getting out the way” was in itself a biased action. U.S. banks got their bailouts, but everyone else got crumbs.  The upshot of our politicians abdicating their responsibility in this regard is that the burden for stimulating a moribund economy fell to the Fed, which was forced to cut interest rates so aggressively that it quickly hit the so-called zero bound. With no room left to go lower beyond zero percent, quantitative easing became the solution. Buying bonds and, later, other financial instruments, was a way to keep market borrowing rates low for companies that use the capital markets to raise funds.  The trillions in monetary expansion kept things afloat but also proved to be a brutally blunt instrument. Savers were harmed, borrowers were helped. Hedge funds and other institutional owners of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments made out like bandits while tens of millions struggled to keep their head above water.  Regardless, QE became the default option whenever times got even slightly tough, which is what we saw during the pandemic. The Fed instituted what became known as “Infinity QE,” an unlimited commitment to keep buying assets to keep rates low. Combined with the distortions in demand and supply brought on by the pandemic’s economic disruptions, it was a recipe for the runaway inflation that eventually arose.  So, what now?  Fast forward to 2022. Political divisions are arguably even worse than they were in the Obama era. And confidence in the government to resolve our economic challenges is at all-time lows.  So, what happens when this year’s financial meltdown leads to the inevitable pullback in financing for everything from startup ventures to homes? Growth will dramatically stall and jobs will be lost. And while that slowdown in demand should help to stall inflation, there’s a legitimate fear that COVID-led supply chain problems will mean that shortages and price appreciation continue.  It’s hard to believe Congress will agree to aggressive stimulus to solve this. So, as the midterm elections approach and the problem becomes politicized, the pressure will grow on the Fed to act.  But what then? The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on confidence in the overarching system –- that people trust that the Fed will protect the value of the dollar even as it boosts money supply. It’s not clear that that confidence will last in response to such an about-face.  In other words, the failure of the overarching system, writ large, will become apparent. And that’s where Bitcoin and blockchain solutions pose the alternative.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Michael J.

CleanSpark (CLSK) and Hut 8 (HUT) are among the larger movers, with each gaining nearly 20%. Shares of miner BitNile (NILE), Marathon Digital (MARA), Bitfarms (BITF) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) were all up by more than 10% on Friday.  Friday’s rally, however, appears to be little more than a blip on longer-term charts, with most of the mining sector down 50% or more this year, and lower by even greater percentages since the price of bitcoin peaked in Q4 of 2021.  “With the plummeting bitcoin price, the profitability of these companies will continue to be under pressure,” said Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Arcane Research. However, he added, the larger miners – with lower operating costs than the industry average – should be able to see themselves through the valley of this bear market.  Mellerud further noted that the larger players might take advantage of cheap prices to go on an acquisition hunt of struggling peers.  In fact, Core Scientific’s (CORZ) CEO Mike Levitt this week said his company is already getting calls from other mining outfits potentially interested in selling due to their lack of access to capital markets.  Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi, meanwhile, put out a bullish note on Hut 8 on Thursday. He noted its relatively long track record (operating since 2018), and $185 million of bitcoin on its balance sheet as bullish factors going forward.

For years, the GBTC fund traded at a premium to the underlying bitcoin price, but it flipped negative in early 2021 due to several factors, including the launch of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) in Canada, which provided an alternative to those looking to invest in bitcoin through a stock market vehicle.  The discount could be taken as a bearish indicator because it might mean a waning interest in bitcoin among traders. But it also is seen by some opportunistic traders as a way of scooping up bitcoin on the cheap.  GBTC discount  Unlike for exchange-traded funds, the trust has no built-in market mechanism to keep the GBTC share price trading close to the underlying value of the bitcoin.  Last year Grayscale applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert GBTC into a spot exchange-traded fund. Many analysts are skeptical the SEC will approve the conversion anytime soon, though some traders have bought GBTC as a way of betting on the prospect of the SEC's nod; in that sense, a wider discount signals dimming optimism for such an approval.  In the meantime, investors are getting charged fees.  The recent crypto sell-off also may have contributed to a wider GBTC discount. Bitcoin fell as low as $24,000 on Thursday, before recovering to over $30,000 early Friday. The asset has lost 23% of its value in the past month amid inflation concerns and weak sentiment in broader equity markets.

Even after the crash, investors are pinning their hopes onto Bitcoin. Bitcoin started it all and will always be the one to set expectations for the rest to follow. Hence the curiosity leads some of them to buy Bitcoin on an exchange, while others pursue a dynamic path and look into Bitcoin mining. With Bitcoin mining, computing power is focused on solving intricate math problems to validate transactions and adding them to the blockchain ledger. Miners receive rewards for solving these puzzles. Many are drawn to Bitcoin mining by the allure of potentially hefty payouts. Miners currently collect 6.25 Bitcoin for each successfully validated block. Eng Taing, who runs 261 personal Bitcoin mining machines, noted in April 2022 on how he&apos;s collecting $111,000 per month from his &apos;side hustle&apos; mining setup as he runs his private equity firm. However, physical mining setups can quickly become expensive. As Bitcoin becomes more complex to mine, more advanced (and often costlier) equipment is needed to ensure sufficient computing power. Electricity prices are also a common challenge for prospective miners. In August 2021, the Digiconomist&apos;s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index found it would take about 53 days&apos; worth of power for an average American household to mine one Bitcoin.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Market Moves: BTC and altcoins trade in the green over the last 24 hours. ADA, SOL and AVAX make 15%+ gains.  Feature: Continuing with the Terra saga, we take a look at the latest exchanges to delist Terra's LUNA and UST.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) is up 8% over the last 24 hours, climbing back above the $30,000 mark after dropping to lows of $25,000 on Thursday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has still lost over 50% of its value from its all-time high reached in November 2021 around $69,000.  After one of the most turbulent weeks in history for the market, the total crypto market cap has decreased over $300 billion over the past seven days. Multiple assets crashed over 30% during the week, but have started to regain ground early Friday.  And that doesn't even begin to touch the disaster that was Terra's LUNA as the UST stablecoin lost its $1 peg. LUNA tumbled 100% on the week.  Solana's SOL token, which took a steep hit on Thursday as the wider market fell, trading as low as $35, is now up 15% on the day and trading at around $51. Cardano's ADA is trading up 20% on the day, and Avalanche’s AVAX is up 24%.  In traditional markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a sixth straight day, and the S&P 500 took a 19.4% hit from its high of 4,800 in January. The S&P 500 is now at 3,868, and according to a popular rule of thumb used by investors, a dip of 20% or more signals the start of a bear market.  Robinhood (HOOD) shares soared after a new filing revealed that Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, took a 7.6% stake in the company.  Market Moves  According to Florian Giovannacci, head of trading at Covario AG, the crypto market rebound over the last 24 hours for BTC and altcoins is “more a technical bounce following over the top bearishness/capitulation and leveraged short positioning being liquidated (especially for alts).”  He said that today’s increase in price for crypto assets will “definitely help sentiment but there’s no news out there to really mark a definitive change of mood.”  Looking forward, despite trading in the green for a number of assets on the day, Giovannacci said correlation to U.S. equity is a key factor for BTC’s price.  “Until we see CPI data improving, bears will be in the driving seat.”  Latest Headlines  Terra Blockchain Resumes Following 9-Hour Halt The Terra blockchain has resumed activity following a halt of around nine hours while validators plotted a route out of its ongoing crisis.

Yellen Call for 'Responsible' Crypto Innovation Is Right Janet Yellen, recently speaking at American University, made erudite, sensible remarks about the right approach to regulate digital currencies and assets, innovation and the policies surrounding them.  Binance, OKX Delist Terra's LUNA and UST Citing User Protection  By Shaurya Malwa and Jamie Crawley  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, suspended spot trading for LUNA and UST against its own stablecoin BUSD on Friday after rival OKX said it planned to end spot listings of UST and delisted margin and borrowing services for Terra ecosystem tokens such as LUNA, anchor (ANC) and mirror (MIR).  ""An exponential amount of new LUNA were minted due to flaws in the design of the Terra protocol,"" Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said in an explanatory tweet. ""Some of our users, unaware of the large amounts of newly minted LUNA outside the exchange, started to buy LUNA again, without understanding that as soon as deposits are allowed, the price will likely crash further. Due to these significant risks, we suspended trading.""  OKX planned to terminate exchange-traded UST trading for bitcoin (BTC), avalanche (AVAX), solana (SOL) and ether (ETH) as of 10:00 UTC, adding to earlier cancellations of the margin trading and borrowing function for LUNA, ANC and MIR. Perpetual swaps were suspended at 8:00 UTC.  “Seismic crypto market movements like we’ve seen this week tend to deliver some pretty brutal lessons,” explained Lennix Lai, an OKX director, in an email. “We’re seeing a flight away from direct investment in DeFi protocols in the wake of UST breakdown.”  “The reality is that centralized exchanges are set up to provide much greater levels of protection for users whatever the markets are doing,” Lai said.  UST slumped to as low as 22 cents earlier this week amid a run on the currency. The prices of its related LUNA token dropped 99.7% to pennies on Thursday from levels above $60 earlier this week.

However, the positive mood of the cryptocurrency market allowed us to see only the probability of a false break of $2.54 and a return of the price within the consolidation limits. https://www.tradingview.com/x/6gFWt74e/ The BTC price fall below local lows in June 2021 played an important role in SAND pricing. However, the main question is if there is a great prospect of SANDUSDT price fall without local corrections. The main range from which you can try to buy SAND is $0.8.

The coin has support at May 11 lows, with bulls optimistic about a recovery. Past Performance The tide seems to be changing for the coin after a calamitous first half of the week. APE is up 39 percent versus the USDT and printing a green candlestick when writing. Notably, it is soaking selling pressure of the past 24 hours, unwinding losses of May 11. APE Technical Analysis The rejection of lower lows at spot rates is at the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the March 17 bull bar. While it may be too early to call bottoms, the reaction at the Fibonacci level could provide a hint that bears might be slowing down after the decimation of early this week. In the medium term, how APE prices react at $5.2 and $9.2-marking May 11 high and low could shape price action. For now, sellers may unload the pullbacks within the conspicuous bear bar of May 11, targeting $3—or lower in the short term. However, if buyers build on recent gains to close above $9.2, APE may bounce to $25 in the medium term. What to Expect? Sellers are still in a commanding position at spot rates despite APE coin gains. Losses below $5.2 could spell more dumps for the APE token. On the flipside, a recent recovery could be a reliever for stretched bulls.The post ApeCoin (APE) adds 39%, Are Sellers Slowing Down? appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,USDT | APE,ICO | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | APE,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/apecoin-ape-adds-39-are-sellers-slowing-down/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=apecoin-ape-adds-39-are-sellers-slowing-down,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Past Performance of DREP DREP prices experience a surcharge in the underlying bullishness near the $0.30 mark after the breakout of the $0.50 mark.

According to Terra Analytics, the supply of Luna was only around 340,000 for the last two weeks - up until just three days ago. That was until Monday, when TerraUSD (UST) lost its dollar peg, sending Luna, a linked token supposed to prop up UST&apos;s value, into a downward spiral. Luna sales were expected to help UST maintain parity with the US dollar, according to the algorithmic stablecoin&apos;s design. The mechanism put a lot of downward pressure on Luna once UST lost its peg and investors rushed to cash out en masse. Worse, the more Luna&apos;s price dropped the more downward pressure. This set off a vicious cycle in which Luna&apos;s price plummeted, and supply grew exponentially. The network issued 40 million Luna tokens on Tuesday. Luna&apos;s circulation supply rose on Wednesday, reaching 1.5 billion tokens. Despite the chain being paused for a short time on Thursday, this achieved 176 billion tokens. It has now reached 6.5 trillion and is still increasing if the chain has not been terminated for the second time. Developers working on Terra eventually called it a day.

42374742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2Eqf,1652437900,Elon Musk Says He's Committed to Twitter Deal After Putting It on Hold,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said he is committed to his $42 billion takeover of social media giant Twitter (TWTR) after putting it on hold earlier on Friday. Musk said in an earlier tweet that he is putting the deal on hold till he can verify that spam or fake accounts represent fewer than 5% of the total users on Twitter.  Twitter estimates that fewer than 5% of the accounts on the site are spam or fake, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Musk claimed in April that he wanted to authenticate every Twitter user.  Twitter's share price was down over 17% at $37.2 in premarket trading, while Tesla shares were up over 5% at $769.27 in premarket trading.  The merger agreement, on page 30 of the filing, states that Musk will have to pay $1 billion in the form of a termination fee if the takeover falls through.  On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Musk is seeking new funding for the Twitter takeover, as he looks to scrap previous plans to take a margin loan against Tesla stock.  The Tesla CEO started his takeover campaign of the social media site last month by buying a prominent stake in Twitter and then offered to buy the firm for $54.2 per share, which would value the company at around $41.4 billion.  The offer was initially reportedly rebuffed by Twitter's board but was later accepted. Musk said he wants Twitter to be a platform dedicated to free speech.  Musk is also a prominent supporter of cryptocurrencies over the past few years, often discussing popular memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) and bitcoin (BTC) on social media.  Dogecoin slumped by more than 7% following Musk's statement on the Twitter deal. It has since recovered back to $0.0904 after trading at a low of $0.0869.  Tesla converted $1.5 billion of its balance sheet into bitcoin in February 2021.

The industry has been racing to reinstall traditional financial services in the decentralised world throughout the last year, dramatically boosting the DeFi business. However, the unbridled expansion of DeFi came at a cost — $2.3 billion, to be exact. That was the total amount of cryptocurrency taken in DeFi breaches and robberies last year, an increase of 1,330 per cent from 2020. According to most recent data analysis, this pattern has intensified in 2022 and may suffer much more as the year passes. The report discovered $1.26 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen through DeFi protocols in the first quarter of 2022, according to a report published. For the full year of 2021, this represents 55% of all DeFi thefts. Ronin Network Attack The Ronin Network attack took half of this sum, which saw roughly $615 million worth of ETH and USDC syphoned from the bridge between the Ronin Chain and the Ethereum mainnet. This pattern has continued throughout the second quarter of the year. On April 17th, the DeFi platform Beanstalk Farms suffered a $180 million loss due to a vulnerability that allowed a hacker to pass a governance proposal that syphoned all of the protocol&apos;s cash into the hacker&apos;s wallet.

Nomura launched over-the-counter cryptocurrency derivatives with bitcoin (BTC) non-deliverable forwards and non-deliverable options for clients in Asia out of Singapore, according to an emailed statement from the bank.  “We also have the capability to offer bitcoin futures and options trading, with such trades executed this week on the CME with Cumberland DRW, marking the first digital asset trades for Nomura,” Rig Karkhanis, the bank’s head of global markets for Asia ex-Japan, said in the statement.  The introduction coincides with a highly volatile period in the crypto market, set off by the dramatic collapse of Terra’s LUNA stablecoin and decentralized finance platform. The total crypto market cap has dropped about 30% this week.  “Options enable investors to trade volatility directly and protect against downside risks,” Karkhanis said.  The last year has seen banks kowtow to client demand and start to trade crypto, albeit at arms length without touching spot markets. Goldman, the first Wall Street bank to begin trading crypto futures, has also announced using bitcoin as collateral for dollar loans.  “Digital assets have grown from a niche industry into a $1.5 trillion asset class, but many investors still don't have an avenue to get exposure to the space,” Paul Kremsky, the head of relationship management at Cumberland DRW, said in an email.  Nomura was one of the first banks to explore custody of crypto assets, joining the Komainu custody joint venture alongside fund manager CoinShares and custody specialist Ledger, in June 2020.

Cardano’s ADA jumped as much as 40%, leading gains among the biggest cryptocurrencies. BNB Chain’s BNB spiked 30%, Solana’s SOL added 25%, and XRP added 22% during the morning in Asia. The recovery came as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptos, added over 12% each. Most of the largest cryptocurrencies rose at least 25%, with the likes of ApeCoin (APE) climbing as much as 57%.  Traders may have deemed cryptocurrencies as oversold and purchased assets after a dramatic sell-off. For the week, total market cap is down about 30%, CoinGecko data shows.  “After serious oversold previous days, altcoins rose at a double-digit pace in the last 24 hours,” FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in an email. “This could be both the start of an extended buying wave and a trap for the bulls.  “The cryptocurrency fear and greed index was down 2 points to 10 by Friday and remains in 'extreme fear,' but it largely ignores the optimism of recent hours. Thus, the indicator’s current low levels might also attract 'buy when you are scared' buyers,” Kuptsikevich said.  Cryptocurrencies dropped steeply this week amid systemic risks from both within the market and outside. Concern about high inflation in the U.S. hit bitcoin prices, while terraUSD (UST) – a stablecoin designed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar – dropped to a low of 22 cents. Investors took risk off the table, causing bitcoin to briefly fall to almost $24,000 on Thursday.  Part of the recovery in the past 24 hours could have arisen from what's known as a short squeeze. That occurs when traders who had bet on prices falling have to buy assets to cover their pessimistic positions, known as shorts. In a short, traders borrow an asset to sell in the hope they will be able to buy it back at a lower price and profit on the difference when they return it to the lender. If prices rise, they stand to lose money, and buying to limit their losses adds to bullish momentum.  Futures data shows 64% of traders were short in the past 24 hours and took on $266 million in liquidations, which may have contributed to a price rise amid a possible short squeeze.",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | BNB,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/13/cardanos-ada-jumps-40-to-lead-recovery-in-major-cryptos-sentiment-remains-in-extreme-fear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9f8fd6f83d37f35f6cfd872f00166c28bc9f805-2373x1263.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin fell to as low as $24,000 on Thursday morning before a slight recovery overnight.  This risk-off reaction caused stocks of crypto-related companies to tank.

Hong Kong-listed BC Technology Group (0863) was down 15% on Friday morning.  BC Technology Group, which runs several businesses, is the parent of crypto brokerage and lending company OSL. Monex owns crypto exchange Coincheck and trading platform TradeStation, among other businesses.  Monex and OKG saw some nominal recovery later on during the trading session, rising over 1% as bitcoin added 13.5% to regain the $30,000 price level.

Elon Musk still believes #Dogecoin has potential as a currency I agree! pic.twitter.com/CMNHWsp065 — Doge Whisperer 🐕 (@TDogewhisperer) May 12, 2022 Dogecoin is a viable currency because of its inflationary process, which pushes individuals to spend more. Because the meme coin isn&apos;t a store of value, people are unlikely to hoard it. According to Musk, Bitcoin, on the other hand, is deflationary money, making it &apos;not a good substitute&apos; for transactional currency. However, Musk has already expressed scepticism about Dogecoin&apos;s ability to supplant conventional currency. According to Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Dogecoin is a considerably cheaper alternative to established card networks. The meme coin&apos;s block time must be decreased to ten seconds for this to happen. In the meantime, Dogecoin has dropped more than 91% from its all-time high, which was reached a year ago. Following Twitter&apos;s agreement with Musk, the meme cryptocurrency enjoyed a temporary price increase. However, along with the rest of the market, the meme cryptocurrency plummeted.

The Binance team claims that the update will not affect Spot trading and other core functions. Binance to Upgrade Tick Sizes Binance would be changing the tick size (the smallest modification in the individual rate) of some spot trading pairs on 12th May at 12:40 UTC to ensure users have the ideal experience possible when prices are very volatile. The word &apos;tick size&apos; refers to the minimal quantity that can be quoted and traded on a cryptocurrency exchange. Coin tick sizes made sense when BTC just had some dollars&apos; worth of value. Penny ticks were acceptable when BTC&apos;s value was $100. The problem is that it costs more than $1K. The crypto world rewards volatility and disincentivizes standing orders. NYSE&apos;s definition of &apos;tick size&apos; indicates the availability of a minimum range between price movements of $.01 that cannot get displayed for a typical trader. For example, if you were to look at the price of a stock on a chart, the stock value would fall by $.01. A rise in a stock value does not mean that you will pay $.01 more than the previous price. It just refers to the tick size. You determine price and value fluctuations by combining tick size with other metrics such as lot size. The changes made on the tick sizes would have no impact on spot trading or other essent...",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/binance-to-upgrade-tick-sizes-for-some-trading-pairs/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=binance-to-upgrade-tick-sizes-for-some-trading-pairs,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Chances of a price reversal cannot be ruled out yet because the altcoin has broken below its descending trendline. Often after a sharp fall, prices make a turn around. In case of a price revival, Aave could target $111. Another fall from its present price level would make the altcoin trade near the $61 support line and then hover around the range of $50. As mentioned above, the trading volume rose and was seen in red signifying bearishness in the market.

42411462,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO507,1652406082,Yellen Call for 'Responsible' Crypto Innovation Is Right,"Janet Yellen, recently speaking at American University, made erudite, sensible remarks about the right approach to regulate digital currencies and assets, innovation and the policies surrounding them.  The U.S. Treasury Secretary noted the sector's explosive growth from $14 billion to $3 trillion in just five years and its origins, even touching on the original Bitcoin white paper’s solution for preventing the same digital assets being spent twice, a key criticism of systems preceding Bitcoin.  Yellen said that “the government's role should be to ensure responsible innovation – innovation that works for all Americans, protects our national security interests and our planet, and contributes to our economic competitiveness and growth. Such responsible innovation should reflect thoughtful public-private dialogue and take account of the many lessons we've learned throughout our financial history. This sort of pragmatism has served us well in the past and I believe it is the right approach today.""  Adelle Nazarian is the CEO of the American Blockchain PAC, which protects innovation in blockchain and digital assets in the U.S. and opposes legislation that limits the growth of crypto assets.  In a recent interview with the Huffington Post about crypto legislation, I observed that we needed new rules, language and a more elastic framework for initial coin offerings (ICO) consistent with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rulemaking that would ensure innovation could continue to flourish.  The American Blockchain PAC that I lead as CEO welcomed Secretary Yellen's sound guidelines for a process of developing a legal and regulatory structure to protect the public while creating a climate that fosters innovation. As it happens, Rep. Glen ""GT"" Thompson (R-Pa.) has significantly advanced this process by proposing a thoughtful, well-formulated ""crypto regulatory blueprint.""  The ""Thompson principles"" offer a framework for digital commodities exchanges, voluntary registration and qualified digital commodity custodians. They also offer an improved process to create digital commodities; to provide a full accounting of stablecoin assets and liabilities; to protect customers using stablecoins and register asset-backed digital commodity users. They would comply with and apply to pre-sold digital commodities.  Read More: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Calls Crypto 'Transformative' in Wide-Ranging Speech  These proposals honor Secretary Yellen's prescribed process. Let's sample the proposed voluntary registration:  ""Trading venues would opt into the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] Digital Commodity Exchange regime or remain regulated under individual state money transmitter licenses. Trading venues will be incentivized to choose CFTC regulation to reduce their regulatory burdens by facing only one regulator, be eligible to offer leveraged trading, and be the point of entry for new digital commodities to the retail public.""  According to the Congressional Research Service, 49 states require registration as money transmitters. It costs millions of dollars and years of working through the bureaucratic labyrinths followed by continuing onerous compliance requirements to make this a reality. This process is prohibitive for most startups, reducing innovation without providing meaningful added public protection. Allowing enterprises to choose ""one-stop shopping"" honors Secretary Yellen's counsel of pragmatism.  Congress and the financial services industry finally grasp that cryptocurrency is not just another extraordinary, popular delusion or the result of the madness of crowds. The blockchain (from which cryptocurrencies are fashioned) is fundamental to many important emerging technologies like non-fungible tokens, Web 3, and the metaverse.  And President Joe Biden's Executive Order on ""Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets"" calls for the mitigation of risks while recognizing that ""the United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system. …""  The White House, the Secretary of the Treasury and members of Congress, including Rep. Thompson and the chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus – Reps. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) and Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) – are representatives of the burgeoning distributed ledger sector, as is the American Blockchain PAC.  The principals of the public-private dialogue commended by Secretary Yellen have already been assembled. It is time for all these parties to convene in the Secretary's Conference Room.  Such a conversation would foster President Biden's and Secretary Yellen's regard for public safety, keep America at the forefront of responsible development and shape the future of digital assets and technology.

Prices of other altcoins followed suit as Bitcoin hangs below the $30,000 price mark. Ethereum&apos;s current price has hit a new low in 2022. The altcoin had tried to pull off a brief recovery a week back but the broader market weakness finally crept in and caused it to dip further. At the time of writing, ETH is seen below its major support line of $2500. Selling pressure had accelerated as the increased fear index drove investors out of the market. From the technical outlook, Ethereum is set to dip further and then could stage a recovery above $2500.

Key points are as follows: Merchants can communicate with customers in a two-way manner. The feature helps merchants to provide customized transaction links to users.
