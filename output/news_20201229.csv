42385442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1zs7,1609286223,"Coinbase Underpaid Women, Black Employees, NY Times Reports","An analysis of internal pay data shows leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase underpaid its female and Black workers at a much greater rate than exists in the technology industry, the New York Times reported.    The report comes on the heels of another New York Times report in November that painted a picture of a company that “has long struggled with its management of Black employees.”  While Coinbase executives said at the time those complaints were limited to a few employees, the company's compensation data cited in the most recent report suggests that inequitable treatment of both female and Black workers was more widespread than acknowledged.  The timing of the back-to-back reports could hardly be worse for Coinbase, which earlier this month filed preliminary documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, undoubtedly seeking to capitalize on the record surge in the price of bitcoin and the white-hot IPO market.  Even before the first New York Times story was published in November, Coinbase saw at least 5% of its staff depart in the wake of being asked to choose between accepting CEO Brian Armstrong's recently announced ""apolitical"" policy and leaving the firm. This latest story shows that the exchange's workforce problems aren't going away.  According to the data presented in the Times report, women at Coinbase were paid an average of $13,000, or 8%, less than men at a comparable jobs and ranks.  Meanwhile, Black employees were paid $11,500, or 7%, less than all other workers in similar jobs, the Times said.  The Times' data included pay details for most of Coinbase’s roughly 830 employees at the end of 2018.  In a letter to Coinbase employees regarding the most recent New York Times article, L.J. Brock, chief people officer, said Coinbase has been working to ensure equal pay for equal work as part of a broad review of the company's pay practices that began in 2018.  Brock said the company has been working over the past two years ""to ensure our compensation framework is transparent"" and ""fair to all employees."" He also said the company will ""examine our pay through the lens of ethnicity/race, in addition to gender.""

42385453,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB207D,1609280107,New Research Sheds Light on the Front-Running Bots in Ethereum’s Dark Forest,"New research from the cryptocurrency wallet ZenGo has shed additional light on front-running attacks happening on the Ethereum blockchain.      First outlined in “Ethereum Is a Dark Forest,” DeFi investors Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos called attention to a variety of attacks by bots that were roving the Ethereum blockchain in search of prey.      The new report from ZenGo outlines how the researchers identified and isolated generalized front-running bots while evaluating their efficiency and how likely a transaction is to get hunted down, while also testing how to evade them.    See also: Ethereum, Dark Forests and the Limits of Transparency    “Front-running in general is not something new on Ethereum,” said Alex Manuskin, a blockchain researcher at ZenGo, who conducted the research. “The novelty here is that we looked at bots that seek any profit, even in contracts they have never seen before, and even if these contracts are quite complex and perform several internal calls to other contracts.”    Front-running    The ZenGo report described front-running as the “act of getting a transaction first in line in the execution queue, right before a known future transaction occurs.”      An exchange bid is an example of front-running. If someone is about to buy a large amount of ETH on Uniswap, to such an extent that it would drive the price higher, one way to cash in would be to buy ETH right before the large purchase goes through then sell immediately after.    See also: DeFi Has a Front-Running Problem. Sparkpool’s Potential Fix Is Launching This Month    Ethereum front-running happens because bots are able to bid “a slightly higher gas price on a transaction, incentivizing miners to place earlier in the order when constructing the block. The higher-paying transactions are executed first. Thus, if two transactions making a profit from the same contract call are placed in the same block, only the first takes the profit,” the researchers wrote.      “Under the surface of every transaction that finds its way to the blockchain, there are fierce wars over every bit of profit,” said Manuskin. “If you happened to come across an arbitrage opportunity, or even notice an error in some contract, it is very likely that it will be hard to extract this value without either operating a bot yourself to fend off the front-runners, connecting to and paying a miner to conceal your golden goose transaction, or making the transaction complex enough for the front-runners to not notice.”    Luring a bot    The researchers set out to attract a generalized front-running bot. In order to achieve this, they had to put enough funds into their honeypot transaction to make it attractive to such a bot.      “This time, we had a hit,” the researchers wrote. “The transaction was pending for ~3 minutes before it was mined, without getting value from the honeypot contract. Looking at the contract’s internal transaction, we could see the funds went to someone else.      The front-runner’s transaction had used slightly more gwei, the smallest unit of ether, (0.000001111 gwei more, to be precise) and was mined in the same block as their attempted abstraction.    Crypto markets are lit markets, by definition. So predators can see the prey coming. The prey can see them, too – but the prey cannot escape. When you submit an Ethereum transaction, it must wait in that mempool until a miner picks it up. It has nowhere else to go. So it is, to coin a phrase, a “sitting duck.” Every predator in the pool can see it. It inevitably gets replicated, front-run or otherwise stolen. The wonder is that any legitimate transactions ever get verified at all.Frances Coppola    Once they’d identified the bot, they were able to track how much it had pulled in since the start of its operations. Using Dune Analytics, they estimated the bot started operating in May of 2018, and surmised it had raked in about $10,000 in ETH in total. While that may not seem initially like a high amount, remember, one individual can create any number of bots to act on their behalf.      Another bot, which the researchers attracted with a slightly larger honeypot transaction, was more sophisticated. When the researchers tried to extract the funds from their bait transaction, they obscured their call by means of a proxy contract. This type of contract function involves a totally separate contract and does not publish to the public blockchain      They “deployed the ProxyTaker contract and called the appropriate function in an attempt to extract our funds.”      The transaction was quickly front-run by another bot.      “This time it was far more impressive,” they wrote. “Not only was the bot able to detect our extraction transaction, but it identified it from within an internal call, from a completely different contract! Accomplishing this in a record-breaking time. Our extraction transaction was mined in a few seconds (and so was the bot’s).”      This bot was much more sophisticated and focused not just on ETH transactions; rather, it performed a variety of arbitrage transactions involving multiple currencies.      Viewing the account collecting the funds, the researchers found it was much more successful than the previous bot and was holding 300 ETH, or $180,000 at the time of publication.    Results from tracking the bot    The research shed light on the methods of some fairly sophisticated bots combing the blockchain for profitable transactions, though other bots may have varying behavior parameters.      “Factors such as potential upside, communication patterns, and minimum complexity (e.g., gas limit), among others, likely impact the way they operate,” they wrote.      Manuskin said that there is still a lot of research that needed to be done, but he did have some high-level takeaways.      “Generalized front-runners are more prominent than one might think,” he said. “Any contract call that can bring profit to anyone who calls it is very likely to be front-run by these generalized front-runners.”      Additionally, he found that avoiding detection by the front-runners is possible, but is not easy.      “Each operates differently and might be triggered by different factors of the transaction,” he said. “The bots themselves are in competition with each other over who gets the reward. This is only the tip of the iceberg in the full picture of the bots out there, which makes it even more interesting.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/29/new-research-sheds-light-on-the-front-running-bots-in-ethereums-dark-forest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeac3cdb9cca42ce02ec04ef8433d93244beca49-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB20CF,1609277202,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Down to $26K but Traders Remain Bullish,"Few seem to be bothered by bitcoin’s volatility on Tuesday, as the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization declined to the $26,000 level after its first-ever trades above $28,000 on Sunday. Many market participants are convinced retail and institutional investors will push bitcoin’s price higher after the holiday lull.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $26,937.67 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.37% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $25,875.05-$27,117.95 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    With limited institutional trading activity during the final days of 2020, traders and analysts told CoinDesk the recent price movement has been largely driven by retail investors.      “It's quite unusual for the past whole week being like this, given it's a holiday season. Usually during the holiday season there's a liquidity crunch,” Mable Jiang, principal at crypto hedge fund Multicoin Capital, told CoinDesk. “The heat was partially driven by the recent run-up of bitcoin, and the resurfacing retail interest in the market, at least in China.”      Jiang noticed a few patterns in recent trading activity among retail investors. Some are rolling alt-coins into bitcoin and ether. Others are looking for coins that may potentially outperform bitcoin on returns in the coming months.      In TradeBlock’s weekly market commentary on Dec. 28, the cryptocurrency analysis firm wrote that recent highs for bitcoin and ether were driven by outflows from XRP.      “The only two digital currencies the [Securities and Exchange Commission] has definitely stated are not securities are bitcoin"" and ether, TradeBlock said. “As regulatory uncertainty increased in the alt-coin market after the SEC’s action [against Ripple Labs, claiming it was trading an illegal security, XRP], traders took the opportunity to pile into more regulatory-certain assets, bitcoin and ether, while maintaining exposure to crypto amidst its one of the strongest bull runs on record.”      Read More: Coinbase to Suspend XRP Trading Following SEC Suit Against Ripple      Yet, even though bitcoin’s price fell below $26,000 in the past 24 hours many market participants appear to be optimistic about the coming weeks and months, especially after investment activity returns after the holidays.      “Should the expected wave of retail flows materialize, I would expect to see bitcoin charge past $30,000 as we enter the new year,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime Brokerage Bequant.      Read More: CME Tops in Bitcoin Futures Rankings Amid Rapidly Growing Institutional Interest      Last month’s price move towards the previous $20,000 resistance level makes a convincing case to support such optimism, according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. While small sell-offs occurred three times during that rally (on Nov. 25, Dec. 1 and Dec. 5), prices quickly recovered as a strong demand for bitcoin outweighed the amount of bitcoin sold.

Jan. 4 onwards we should see institutional positions coming back into the market.”      Read More: Grayscale Has $19B in Crypto Assets Under Management, Up From $16.4B Last Week    Ether lower on active retail trading activities    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was down Tuesday, trading around $728.59 and down 0.47% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Similar to bitcoin, market sentiment for ether’s performance has also remained positive despite the price volatility.      Read More: Ether Trades Above $700 for the First Time Since 2018      “Currently, [ether’s] trading volume is more than 15% higher than average, further proof that ether is on the rise,” Guy Hirsch, eToro's U.S. managing director, said. “We expect the second-biggest crypto asset to continue rallying into the new year, and possibly surpassing $800 sometime during the first half of the year.”      If they aren’t doing so already, institutional players could also soon start looking into ether, particularly after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) said it will launch a futures contract on ether in February 2021. That could bode well for ether’s performance relative to bitcoin, according to some analysts.      Read More: Institutions Will Start Buying Ether in 2021, Messari Analyst Says      “The imminent introduction of ETH futures from the CME Group should spur additional adoption, especially among financial institutions looking to diversify digital asset holdings with another regulated product they are comfortable with,” Vinokourov said. “This, combined with [decentralized finance’s] continued surge, should help ETH to outperform BTC for the foreseeable future.”      Retail traders also appear more interested in ether, as the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, as provided by analytics website DeFi Pulse, reached to $14.47 billion, as of Tuesday.      “From the market-making side [on DeFi], we see flows pretty evenly, with slightly more [stablecoins] to ether than the opposite, which I believe indicates that there are still plenty of retail investors trying to jump on the wagon,” said Peter Chan, a trader for Hong Kong-based crypto firm OneBit Quant who is focusing on DeFi trading.

Effective Jan. 19, 2021, at 10 a.m. UTC, XRP will be delisted and trading suspended from the Crypto.com App in the U.S.  Crypto.com's move came the same day two other crypto exchanges, Coinbase and OKCoin, also announced suspensions of the XRP token.  On Tuesday, crypto payments firm Wirex and bitcoin app Ziglu took similar actions, according to The Block. Wirex won't include XRP in a U.S. version of its app while Ziglu will suspend trading in XRP as of Jan. 12, 2021.  Meanwhile, also Tuesday, the Bittrex Exchange said it will remove XRP markets on Jan. 15, 2021, while Swipe Wallet said it will be delisting XRP for U.S. customers on Jan. 5, 2021.  The SEC claimed last week that XRP is a security, and that Ripple has been selling it without registering or seeking an exemption for seven years, raising $1.3 billion in the process. The legal battle is just beginning, and litigation might take years to resolve. Ripple has said it would fight the lawsuit.  In a general statement released Tuesday, Ripple said that with the ""uncertainty"" introduced into the market as a result of the SEC's legal action, it’s ""no surprise that some market participants are reacting conservatively as a result.""  Given that exchanges that handle the trading of securities must fill out a lot more paperwork than those that don't, it's little wonder crypto exchanges and market makers are backing away from XRP.  Like Coinbase, Cypto.com said it will continue to support the Spark (FLR) Token Distribution to XRP holders, which is currently set for the first half of 2021.

42385450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB203R,1609268453,Opyn Upgrade Aims to Add Capital Efficiency and Liquidity to DeFi Options Market,"Opyn, a marketplace for decentralized finance (DeFi) options, has rolled out new features in its updated protocol that aim to make the crypto options markets more efficient and liquid.      While Opyn entered DeFi with an insurance-like product for governance tokens such as Compound's COMP, its focus has since pivoted to the options market in the digital asset space. According to Zubin Koticha, co-founder of Opyn, the pivot is driven both by user interest and by the sort of hurdles DeFi currently faces.      “The biggest issue with DeFi is that[in]traditional finance, you don't need super over-collateralization,” said Koticha. Differing capital requirements also eat into DeFi’s competitiveness with traditional finance, he added.      Put simply, options are financial contracts that give users the right to buy or sell an underlying instrument at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Depending on what they make of market trends, options allow traders to bet on the future bullish or bearish nature of the market.    See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained    While options have long existed in traditional finance they are relatively new to the crypto space and hence come with their own hurdles.      Koticha pointed out that under Opyn’s earlier version users needed to put up 100% of the strike price, the agreed-upon price for the option, as collateral in order to mint and sell one. This differs from traditional options markets where the requirements can be significantly lower.    New features for options marketplace    According to Opyn, the update will add a host of new features to its options marketplace, including cash settlement for options without the need to exchange underlying assets, the ability for yield-earning assets to be used as collateral for options, and margin improvements for options.      “We changed our system from physical settlement to cash settlement,” said Koticha. Noting that while traditional markets also cater to needs to settle options in physical commodities like grain, he said there is no such physical delivery need in the crypto space and hence little need to actually exchange the asset. Instead, only the difference in price needs to be delivered.    See also: DeFi Platform Opyn Launches Put Options on Compound Token    Although the overall thrust of changes at Opyn are geared toward added efficiencies in how DeFi handles capital, the changes are only part of the upgrades in the pipeline. Koticha said Opyn is also plotting a protocol upgrade that will add the functionality to net short and long options together, thereby freeing up more capital.    Past vulnerability    Earlier in August, Opyn discovered a vulnerability on its platform when attackers were able to exploit a bug and walk away with $370,000. According to report by Cointelegraph, the bug allowed attackers to double-spend Opyn’s oToken and thereby steal the collateral put up by users.      In response, Opyn laid out in a blog post a set of measures it would adopt to prevent another such exploit and also compensated users affected by it. According to Koticha, the platform has continued to build on its security by performing additional audits and adding a functionality to pause the system.      While a central kill-switch seems counterintuitive to the ever-bustling crypto markets, Koticha said that with plans to launch a governance token in the future Opyn wants to transfer the kill-switch controls to decentralized governance for the long run.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/29/opyn-upgrade-aims-to-add-capital-efficiency-and-liquidity-to-defi-options-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eb012d85138c9e33f1d7d8954b53b7e6c3eb9c9-2560x1534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385452,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB205x,1609257653,16 Ethereum Predictions From a Crypto Oracle,"Every year since 2016, I’ve made predictions about what the next year will bring for the industry. If you pay attention to the incremental change that occurs year after year, you realize everything is connected and you can foresee some exciting outcomes. 2021 will undoubtedly be a year for blockchain and crypto to take center stage economically, politically and socially. Here’s what I see coming.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Andrew Keys is Managing Partner at Digital Asset Risk Management Advisors and the co-founder of LiquidStake, a solution to the liquidity problem of Ethereum 2.0. Formerly, Keys was the head of Global Business Development at ConsenSys.    1. In 2020, the world started to understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin as “digital gold.” In 2021, we will witness the same understanding of Ethereum as “digital oil.”      In the next year, Ethereum will solidify its place as the future substrate of the global digital economy by underwriting the world’s contracts.      Contracts are the connective tissue of the world – sales contracts, college acceptances, employment offers, insurance policies, medical prescriptions, NDAs, ISDA agreements, etc. Yes, Earth runs on contracts (not on Dunkin’). Ethereum allows contracts to go truly digital. The digitization of the contract is the digitization of the global economy, which has been valued at an estimated $270 trillion (compared to the $18 trillion market cap of gold that bitcoin stands to capture). Ethereum has the opportunity to upgrade entire economies, not just one asset class.      2. Ethereum 2.0 phase 1 will successfully occur.      On Dec. 1, the Ethereum community successfully launched phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0. The network upgrade from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake will make Ethereum scale and run faster with less computing power. In 2021, we will see phase 1 of Ethereum 2.0 go live, drastically improving scalability.      3. Bitcoin will reach $50K.      Bitcoin has a singular use case with a limited supply. As more institutional investors continue to buy bitcoin, the price will surge to $50,000.      4. Ether will reach $2K.      The Eth 2.0 upgrade will catapult the network’s capability and garner even more attention from enterprises and institutional investors, driving the price of the ether currency to new heights.      5. Total DeFi locked will exceed $150 billion and 2021 will be the year of DeFi cross-chain bridges.      It is undeniable that Ethereum is home to the majority of decentralized finance activity. But other networks will enter the space in a more material way, putting other native tokens to work in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. With the various tokenized bitcoin options (tBTC, ren, wBTC) growing in popularity, we will see bitcoin’s $430 billion market cap collateralized in DeFi. This will grow the TVL in DeFi exponentially.      See also: Why DeFi Pulse’s Key Metric Is So Simple It’s Confusing      6. As Web 3.0 gains traction, the value will accrue in the protocol layers, rather than the application layers.      In Web 2.0, the majority of the value lies in the application layer of the stack. The largest internet company on the planet is not the company that maintains the HTTP protocol, it’s the company that provides the most valued and entrenched experience to the end user. In Web 3.0, the scope of the application layer will shrink and we will witness protocol infrastructure provide the most value.      7. Layer 2 will explode.      In 2021, Ethereum will continue to cement its position as the leading layer 1 blockchain. As with any technology stack, there are many layers that make up an application. With Ethereum as the base layer, we will see an explosion of layer 2 solutions that will augment the Ethereum mainnet with unique features: scalability, privacy, interoperability and more.      DeFi has grown on Ethereum at an exponential rate, causing gas fees to skyrocket and transactions to slow. Advancements in layer 2 technologies will provide a scaling solution for all of the microtransactions that do not need to happen on mainnet. So 2021 will be a breakthrough year for projects like ZK-Rollups and Optimism (shout-out to Jinglan Wang) as more dapps turn to layer 2 solutions like state channels to increase transaction throughput up to 100 to 2,000 transactions-per-second (TPS).      8. IPFS and Filecoin will step into the global spotlight.      In 2016, IBM said that 90% of the world’s data was created in the prior two years alone. That was four years ago, when the world generated 2.5 quintillion bytesof data. Every internet connected device on Earth –smartphones, smart TV’s, computers, cars – is generating data. As the amount of data generated grows exponentially year after year, so will the need for storage that is cheap, accessible and permissionless. The options we have for data storage today stand in stark contrast to the needs of tomorrow, and enterprises and consumers alike will begin to understand the limitations of existing solutions.      Enter IPFS and Filecoin. IPFS and Filecoin are complementary layer 1 protocols that work in tandem to provide decentralized storage. Since its mainnet launch in October, Filecoin storage has surpassed 1 exbibyte of capacity (that’s a colossal amount). Bridges between Ethereum, IFPS and Filecoin are already underway and in 2021 we will see entire workflows – from agreements and transactions to data storage and sharing – executed using decentralized protocols.      9. 'Ethereum killers' will need to find a niche or will be slaughtered.      For years, various layer 1 blockchains have marketed themselves as “Ethereum killers.” Many have promised a faster and more sophisticated smart contract platform with little to show for it. In 2021, those that have raised millions on the promise of capturing Ethereum’s market share will need to carve out a niche use case for their platforms or risk becoming irrelevant before any code has been shipped. Ethereum’s dominance is comparable to Google’s share of search, and other protocols are contributing to this hegemonic position by building cross-chain bridges as one of their first integrations. These layer 1s will likely gain momentum for specific use cases or technological preferences, such as NEAR with gaming, or Dfinity with its use of WebAssembly instead of Solidity.      Ethereum might lose a small percentage of projects, but even as new open source ecosystems emerge around these other protocols all roads will lead back to Ethereum as the base settlement layer.      10. We will see the beginning of crypto IPO mania.      BlockFi, Celsius and Coinbase (it’s already happening!) will file for an initial public offering. Within a year, the valuation of Coinbase will rise upwards of $40 billion. These companies should tokenize an aspect of the IPO and launch a digital security, as many of them built their success on the promise of usurping the very systems they will now join.      11. China will go live with its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP).      Tens of thousands of people have already tried the new digital currency and the rollout will continue leading up to the 2022 Olympics. An international financial hub like Singapore, Switzerland or Hong Kong will be the second country to issue a CBDC.      12. The U.S. will continue to delay its work on a CBDC as a dozen other countries are steadfast in their pursuit of a digital currency.      The U.S. has been paralyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic and a tumultuous presidential election cycle and will spend much of 2021 dealing with the economic repercussions of the pandemic. Stimulus will continue to be distributed in slow, analog fashion, even as the use case for a government-issued digital currency becomes increasingly evident.      13. We will witness the first areas of significant enterprise adoption on public blockchains.      Led by industry pioneers like Yorke Rhodes of Microsoft, Paul Brody of EY and John Wolpert of ConsenSys, the open-source Baseline protocol employing public Ethereum mainnet to connect enterprise blockchains to Ethereum’s public network using peer-to-peer messaging and zero-knowledge cryptography.      14. NFTs will emerge as the leading consumer use case for Ethereum.      In November, the record for highest value nonfungible token (NFT) was set at approximately $141,536.20 for a medieval interpretation of Vitalik Buterin. That record was shattered just days after. NFTs have long been touted as a promising solution to counterfeit goods. In 2021, we will see the popularization of NFTs as digital representations of unique goods, from art to music to collectibles. Innovators like SuperRare and Sorare will be the market leaders in their respective industries. Kids will trade NFTs of European Football League stars in the same way kids used to trade baseball cards.      15. Crypto VC will explode.      Venture capital investment in Web 3.0 and crypto companies has steadily increased in the last five years, but 2021 will be a breakout year, catalyzed by the next generation of crypto VCs. Consider the 100-person Silicon Valley VC that has a few people specializing in blockchain technology. These individuals will depart their big firms and raise their own $50 million funds and firmly establish the next generation of crypto VCs.      16. The largest derivatives exchange in the world.      In February 2021, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest derivatives exchange in the world, will launch Ethereum futures, making Ethereum the second Commodity Futures Trading Commission-registered crypto commodity. This will clear the path towards an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (though it's been a slog for bitcoin thus far).

42385459,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB20Az,1609254059,The Fight for Consumer Adoption Is Just Beginning,"For the past three years, crypto developers have been fighting a shared enemy, a three-headed beast known as the blockchain trilemma. For every gain made on one front – security or decentralization – territory was ceded on another, such as scalability.      Eventually we learned what in hindsight should have been obvious: No single network can defeat the trilemma. But when their forces combine and each network plays to its strengths, the common foe can be vanquished. From sidechains to sharding, we have implemented solutions to deliver crypto technology that can operate at scale, toppling the trilemma and marking an end to the layer 1 battle.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Justin Sun is the founder of TRON and the CEO of BitTorrent.    The campaign, which has taken the better part of three years, has concluded with allied forces claiming their share of the spoils.      On the adoption and utility front, Ethereum has gained ground, thanks to its strong network effects and burgeoning DeFi primitives. TRON, meanwhile, has supported fast and low-cost transactions for settling billions of dollars in stablecoins, supporting thousands of dApps, and extending the reach of the world’s largest file-sharing network. And then there’s Tezos, which is still breathing at least.      Ethereum and TRON dominate most blockchain benchmarks, leaving the other smart contract networks to play catch up.      For TRON, 2020 has been a prolific year that saw over 100,000 daily active users and $6.4 billion of USDT issued on the network plus the introduction of WBTC. More importantly, TRON brought decentralization one step closer to the masses this year, establishing a brand new DeFi ecosystem, expanding the functions of BitTorrent’s decentralized storage, and forging cross-industry partnerships.      Ethereum doesn’t need me to cheerlead on its behalf, it’s had a prolific year too. Rather than dwelling on layer 1 achievements and milestones, though, I’m more interested in what comes next: the quest to win over hearts and minds beyond the crypto-sphere.      It’s time to focus on a far greater challenge, with a greater prize at stake: onboarding the next 100 million crypto users.    The battle so far    In the early stages of any skirmish there are key battles over turf, infrastructure and supply routes. Over the last three years we’ve seen this play out with layer 1 smart contract chains, which have competed for infrastructure, liquidity, partnership, developer community and war chest.    Infrastructure: The technical foundation must be secure, scalable and affordable to support development further up the stack.  Liquidity: The blockchain’s native asset needs to be listed on major crypto exchanges and maintain a healthy transaction volume.  Partnership: Strategic partners should be onboarded that can actually help the ecosystem thrive and extend its user base.  Developer Community: A diverse and growing number of third-party projects should be developing on the blockchain.  War Chest: There should be enough funding to keep the ecosystem running for years to come.    Here’s how the leading layer 1s shape up when measured using these benchmarks:      Ethereum is the obvious front runner, with TRON chasing closely, while Polkadot and Tezos are playing catchup. Although the race is far from over, when the competition among blockchains began in 2017 the barrier to entry was much lower. It has taken established protocols such as Ethereum and TRON over three years, immense capital, development and revolutionary partnerships to capture the hearts and minds of the industry. It is not only going to be difficult but also extremely expensive for newer layer 1 protocols to cross the moat that has been built by these industry giants.      See also: Noelle Acheson – Justin Sun’s Crypto Lunch with Warren Buffett Is Genius Marketing at Work      For TRON, 2020 has been a prolific year that saw over $6.4 billion of USDT issued on the network, which accounts for about 30% of Tether's total market cap. More importantly, we established a brand-new DeFi ecosystem that already has over 120 million total value locked.    Winning the next wave    The campaign to onboard the next wave of users must be framed in language they understand, with a value proposition that resonates. People shouldn’t use an app because it’s decentralized – they should do so despite it. Just as the average web user knows and cares nothing about TCP/IP, blockchain and its arcane terminology must be abstracted, while the onboarding process to the cryptoconomy needs to be streamlined. We’re talking gasless wallets, better user experience and fiat integration so that interacting with crypto apps is seamless and intuitive.      See also: Alexander S. Blum – In Defense of Justin Sun      We also need more compelling use cases for participating, over and above censorship resistance and permissionless access. Gaming, trading and DeFi have formed the foundations of layer 1s. What comes next? Whether it’s digital collectibles, celebrity stock markets, citizen journalism or encrypted messaging, we’re still waiting for crypto’s first killer dapp.      I’m confident we’ll find answers to many of these questions in 2021 as layer 1s up their game and turn their focus to solving real-world problems and attracting real world users. Regardless of which blockchain accrues the most transactions, dapps, and volume, the layer 1 battle is over but the fight to secure mainstream adoption is just getting started.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Justin Sun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/29/the-fight-for-consumer-adoption-is-just-beginning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dfc0124db3fd0679bc02a7b9320d6a8ce4e9722-1191x822.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385444,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1zud,1609250450,Panthers’ Russell Okung Becomes First NFL Player to Be Paid in Bitcoin,"“Pay me in bitcoin” has come true for National Football League player Russell Okung. Some 20 months and a 273% price increase after he first tweeted that demand in May 2019, Okung will be the first player from any major U.S. sports league to be paid in bitcoin.      The arrangement comes by way of Zap, the bitcoin startup founded by Jack Mallers. Zap’s Strike product enables traditional paychecks to be converted into BTC.      Okung’s just happens to be quite large. His $13 million yearly salary is being split 50-50 between bitcoin and fiat, Mallers said Monday in a phone interview with CoinDesk.      Mallers said other pro athletes, including unnamed members of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team and baseball's New York Yankees, have also begun onboarding to the program. Mallers said the NFL and NFL Players Association had to be involved to get approval. It is unclear if such approvals are also required for the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball.    How Strike works    Technically speaking, Okung is still being paid in fiat. Behind the scenes, however, is Lightning Network magic: Strike receives a direct deposit from his team, the Carolina Panthers, and then swaps dollars for bitcoin. That bitcoin is then sent to a cold storage wallet held by Okung, Mallers said. (To recap, Lightning is a secondary system for sending bitcoin in a cheaper and quicker fashion compared to using the Bitcoin network itself.)    See also: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?    Strike, which launched in private beta about a year ago, can connect to any bank account via a routing number, according to Mallers. Square’s Cash App worked in a similar manner by partnering with Lincoln Savings Bank and Sutton Bank before Square received a banking license in March.      The Okung announcement also serves to tease another bit of news from Zap. Strike can now be used as a checking account through partnerships with two yet-to-be-named banks, according to Mallers.      Mallers said Strike is now processing into the “seven figures” of monthly volume and expects that number to grow as more big names join Strike’s newest payment method. Strike does not currently receive any cut for processing payments, Mallers said, but it might as the product gains adoption.      “It’s a big, big deal that we found a way to allow any individual to receive a [percentage] of their labor in bitcoin,” Mallers said.

There were signs of a new, shared realization as non-believers began to quip, ""If we can just print money, I shouldn't have to pay taxes"" and, ""This is unsustainable. We're screwing ourselves."" There were also signs they began to see how much absurdity dominates our lives. Discrimination didn't end in 1863 or in 1964 or in 2019. We have never had “the lowest Fatality (Mortality) Rate in the World.” The stock market is not the economy. Their truth is not true.      Moreso, the truth seemed to be whatever those in power wanted it to be. Or rather, the truth is whatever we, those not in power, believe it to be. So long as enough people believe it to be true, it is true.      Our new reality manifested in everything from increased anxiety and depression as the world remained in a state of locked-down uncertainty, to debates about masks and potential COVID-19 treatments, to the Black Lives Matter movement coming back with a vengeance.      One of the least-complex manifestations of the power of shared belief was the curious case of Hertz's stock price pumping 900% in the weeks following its bankruptcy filing. It left otherwise rational, mature, market-minded adults (and Hertz itself) bewildered. As far as anyone has been able to sort out, after a lifetime of believing The Adults knew what they were doing The Kids realized the truth and took action on the not-so-secret secret that you don’t win the market by betting on the future – you win when you bet on what other people think will happen in the future. The Kids also happen to know, more than any other generation, that technology is the key to changing what other people think.    The Hertz moment    I actually completely missed the Hertz situation when it first made headlines. I’m sure I saw the articles as I doomscrolled through another day of lockdown. But, as the story is so familiar, I didn’t even bother registering it to my memory. Crypto has been pumping and dumping and re-pumping and re-dumping empty shells of coins for years.      Hertz was especially uninteresting as it followed the classic pump-and-dump scheme, like what might be found on bitcointalk.org in 2013. Today’s decentralized finance (DeFi) token schemes are wrapped up in automated market makers, interoperability and yields, often making it hard to discern whether the shared delusions of the players are giving the tokens value, or if the perceived value of the tokens are creating the shared delusion. To complicate things, there is a third, meta layer: The players are aware they are playing a game and can predict the cycle of their shared delusion. The whole thing is a grotesque ouroboros – all simultaneously feeding itself, and feeding off itself, and birthing itself in some eternal, cyclical, scammy mindf**k.      See also: Taylor Monahan - As We Hunger for Viability, Let’s Stay True to Our Values      Well, maybe not “eternal.” The folks who “aped into” the DeFi things this summer had such a finite view, usually minutes or hours rather than months or years. It’s hard to grok how any DeFi thing could survive once the heavily subsidized reward period wore off. Especially if two or three or 10 freshly subsidized DeFi things had launched since. Yet they somehow did ... sorta.      It’s even harder to understand how this became a dominating force of 2020 considering the intense individualism and selfishness that it both fuel, and is fueled by. We've managed to build thousands of ""every man for himself"" sub-networks on a sprawling, decentralized, cooperative, consensus network. Luckily, or perhaps unluckily if we value our humanity, decentralized consensus networks don't care about the morality of the things running on it.      And, as much as they continue to fight me on it, I remain convinced that these half-baked farming games are unsustainable in the same way initial coin offerings (ICOs) are unsustainable, in the same way hacked smart contracts are catastrophic, in the same way the money printer cannot go BRRRRRR forever and in the same way the serpent cannot devour itself in perpetuity.    Better system?    Bitcoin has seemingly solidified its place as an alternative, though still slightly experimental, store of value. I would talk more on this but literally everyone is talking about it and I have nothing original to add. I will admit I was wrong in 2015 and 2016 and 2017 when I said the digital gold narrative will never be more valuable than the digital cash one. Any narrative that becomes truth is more valuable than the narrative that fades from memory.      I do wonder what will ultimately become of our historically most persistent narrative, that we are creating a better world. Have we made real progress on banking the unbanked, unbanking the banked, breaking down borders and removing power from repressive regimes and corrupt cabals?      For me, crypto is a worthwhile endeavor because it can provide a viable alternative to the existing systems. Crypto can give people the gift of choice. And with that choice we can opt into the systems that benefit us and opt out of the ones that oppress us.    I wonder if this system will ever be a ‘better system’ or just ‘a system that better serves me?’    This is valuable as we all strive to be, well, valuable. We want to be worth something and, as social creatures, to know that we are worth something. We want our existence to matter. How this manifests varies greatly across time and place. How you measure your value determines how you pursue value; both are shaped by the culture of the society in which we exist.      Today, in the West, we often measure ourselves by our salary: This person has deemed my worth to society to be this many dollars, therefore I am. We carry this in us and it muddles everything up and causes us to see worthless, expensive things as more valuable than worthwhile things. In other places or times, you may measure your worth by the animals you hunt or your ability to bear children, or your ability to be born into one life and level up into an entirely better life.      When we have no choice or control over our own worth, we have no motivation to attempt to increase our worth. We are oppressed. Choice in itself does not satisfy our desires, though. It simply gives us the autonomy, and therefore the motivation, to pursue what we desire.      See also: CoinDesk's Year in Review 2020      Between the diminishing returns on truth, the ever-increasing individualism, and our submissiveness to life’s cycles, I wonder if this system will ever be a “better system” or just “a system that better serves me?”      This is important. In one, we aim to remove the system's very ability to have a 1%. We attempt to break the cycle of oppression. We create systems to humanize any and all participants and prevent ourselves, the early adopters, the influencers and the Believers, from gaining power on the backs of others.      In the other, we simply shift the power from the oppressors of today to the oppressors of tomorrow. The oppressed devour the oppressors. The oppressors are reborn as the oppressed. The cycle continues. And then, one day, some kids show up and it is the Crypto Believers who this time must shout, “Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Taylor Monahan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/29/the-year-the-narrative-became-the-truth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20c4d6b78690f872783d4f956cc4d178a189f944-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
