This whale bought over $405 million worth of ETH since March 31 and is suspected to be Tron founder Justin Sun. Sun is also linked to another address that made massive ETH moves this year. Related Reading: 3 Major Metrics To Watch Out For That Can Impact Ethereum Prices A New Whale On The Horizon, Is It Justin Sun? The blockchain research platform Lookonchain revealed that a whale has gone on an Ethereum buying frenzy over the past few weeks. The newly created account started buying ETH from crypto exchanges on March 31. According to the post, the mysterious wallet first withdrew $96.8 million stablecoins from the crypto exchange Binance. Then, the whale started buying Ethereum from Binance and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). Did #JustinSun buy 127,388 $ETH($405.19M) since Apr 8?

Also on Mar 31, a mysterious wallet was created on #Ethereum and withdrew $96.8M stablecoins from #Binance.Is this a… pic.twitter.com/OcEovodUrc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 22, 2024 From April 8 to April 20, the address bought 127,388 ETH, worth around $405.19 million, at an average price of $3,172 per token. According to the research platform, the activity from this new address is similar to that of the alleged Justin Sun address. Although the possibility of a coincidence is not ruled out, the activity between the two addressed seems to suggest otherwise. On March 31, the address Sun was suspected of owning made a significant deposit of 787 million USDT to Binance on Tron, which coincided with the withdrawal made by the mysterious new address. As reported by NewsBTC, Justin Sun’s alleged wallet also went on a similar buying spree from February 12 to February 24. At the time, the address acquired 168,396 ETH, worth around $580.5 million, for an average price of $2,894. Lookonchain considers that the similarities hint that these addresses are likely owned by Sun. If so, Justin Sun has bought 295,757 ETH, worth $891 million, in the past two months. Ethereum Price Recovers Amid Whale Accumulation X users expressed concern over Sun’s alleged movements. At the time of the first report, some considered the transaction suspicious. One user affirmed that Sun would be “the reason of the next market crash.” Others believe it was time to question whether Sun would dump his ETH bag. However, the possibility of him accumulating for the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) was brought up. The latest news of Sun’s alleged buying spree received a more positive response. A user considered it a bullish signal for the second-largest cryptocurrency, as the token could benefit from whale accumulation. On Friday, Ether’s price dipped to $2,865, a level not seen since late February. Over the weekend, however, ETH began to recover from its recent fall as the whale buying spree occurred. Since then, the “king of altcoins” regained the $3,100 support level, currently trading at $3,192. The recovery represents a 2% increase from its price 24 hours ago and a 1.5% surge in the weekly timeframe. Moreover, ETH’s daily trading activity has increased by 8.7%, with a daily trading volume of $11.42 billion. Similarly, the second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a 1.78% rise in market capitalization during the last day. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Hints At Potential Fresh Rally, Buy The Dip?

However, with the market recovery, the ADA price has begun to see some positive headwinds. Analysts expect this recovery to continue, with one crypto analyst in particular, who goes by CobraVanguard, expecting a bullish continuation toward $1. Cardano Completes The ABC Wave The crypto market crash, led by Bitcoin, saw the prices of Cardano and other altcoins plunge into a dreaded ABC wave. This wave is notorious for causing massive dips to the tune of 50%, leaving investors in losses in its wake. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Accumulation Phase As $500 Million ETH Leave Exchanges The crypto analyst revealed that Wave A had taken place when Cardano had fallen from $0.8 to $0.57, and then Wave B saw the recovery from $0.57 to $0.68. The third and final wave, Wave C, saw the price crash from $0.77 to $0.4 before bouncing upward once again, signaling the completion of the ABC wave. As with all other crashes, there comes a time when the ABC wave is over, and the price of an altcoin can recover, and it seems Cardano has entered this range. The price of the altcoin has since recovered above $0.5, with the bulls now taking control. From here, the analyst expects the recovery to continue and rally with a new wave. “After the fifth bullish wave, Cardano has completed his corrective waves (ABC) and now he has reached the end of the wedge, now it is time to start the five bullish waves,” CobraVanguard said. Source: Tradingview.com ADA Price Targets CobraVanguard outlines a number of reasons why they believe that the Cardano price is going to be bullish. Firstly, they outline an ascending structure of the chart, which suggests a bullish continuation. Next is the bullish wedge that is forming in the chart. Also, high-potential areas are becoming clearer in the chart, as the analyst outlined. Related Reading: Battle For The Halving Block: Bitcoin Users Spend Record $2.4 Million On Block 840,000 In the first wave, the analyst outlines a possible jump to $0.77. From here, they expect that the price will retrace a bit to $0.64 before resuming the uptrend. However, the analyst takes a more conservative stance compared to other analysts about the top, putting it somewhere around $1.09. The analyst further pointed out that in a situation where the wedge were to break down, it could invalidate this, and possibility lead to a decline in price. “Note that if the WEDGE is broken down with the power of descending candles, our analysis will fail,” CobraVanguard concluded.

Funding rates for some altcoins and memecoins turned deeply negative, potentially leading to a swift move higher in a short squeeze, QCP Capital noted.  Crypto markets climbed higher Monday with bitcoin {{BTC}} nearing $67,000 as fears about a deeper correction allayed.  Bitcoin, which underwent its quadrennial halving event during the weekend cutting the issuance of new supply in half, advanced over 3% over the past 24 hours, recently changing hands at $66,500. Ether {{ETH}} held steady near $3,200, but lagging with its 1.5% increase during the same period.  Crypto's strong showing was broad-based, with 163 out of 173 cryptos in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) posting positive daily returns. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 Index (CDI) gained over 3% during the day, led by layer-1 blockchain Near Protocol's native token {{NEAR}} up 15%.  The bounce extended to digital asset-focused stocks, with shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and MicroStrategy (MSTR) rallying 7% and 12%.  Publicly listed miners Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Hut 8 (HUT) surged 15%-20%, while Marathon Digital (MARA) advanced 6% during the day, after transaction frenzy caused a spike in fees – an increasingly important revenue source for miners – gave hopes for better bottom lines for the companies.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Poised to Unleash Darwinism on Miners  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said Thursday in an interview with CoinDesk TV that bitcoin's halving ""is not a bullish event"" and warned of market weakness for the next few months, with potentially a deeper correction in the cards. The key reason would be miners offloading their BTC inventory worth $5 billion to keep their operations steady after having their revenue cut, he explained.  On the longer outlook, though, the past three halvings were followed by an exponential move higher for bitcoin's price about 50-100 days after the event, crypto hedge fund QCP Capital pointed out in a Monday market update. ""If this pattern is repeated this time, BTC bulls still have a few weeks to build a larger long position,"" the report said.  The fund also noted that funding rates – the cost leveraged derivatives traders need to pay for keeping their positions open – cooled off from very hot levels, and even turned into deep negative territory for some smaller cryptocurrencies, making them ripe for a swift move higher if risk-appetite returns.  ""What we could see in the short-term is a short-squeeze led by altcoins and memecoins which have seen persistent negative funding, with some as deep as -100% [annualized],"" QCP Capital said.

The rollout of the popular Bitcoin scaling layer’s largest upgrade to date began at Bitcoin block height 840,360 (around 14:30 UTC), beginning a two-step process that will end sometime in late May.  Called Nakamoto, honoring Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, the upgrade will decouple the Stacks block production schedule from Bitcoin's. Although the layer-2 network has a higher transaction throughput than Bitcoin (which processes about 7 transactions per second), as initially designed, Stacks produced blocks at the same rate as Bitcoin, leading to congestion issues, network creator Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk.  Nakamoto will introduce a new way of producing Stacks blocks, updating its bespoke proof-of-transfer consensus algorithm. Starting today, new block “signers” will start coming online to validate “tenures” of transactions. At first, until the upgrade is fully activated in May, this will all be for “'practice,” Stacks developers said on X. (If you want to learn more about what’s changing on a technical level, read here.)  For casual users of Stacks, the developers recommend checking you’re using an updated wallet, which in many cases should happen automatically. For those who stake their STX tokens, the instantiation on Monday automatically unlocked those tokens, which can then be restaked when Nakamoto-compliant pools come online, likely sometime next week.  There is currently about $1.3 billion worth of STX staked on-chain, representing about one-third of the total $4.2 billion circulating supply, making it one the largest interest-earning pools of capital related to bitcoin. The token has rallied more than 16% to about $2.90 over the past 24 hours, pushing it for the first time into the top 25 tokens by market capitalization.

Michael Welsh, a former lead attorney on the Debt Box case, and Joseph Watkins, an investigative attorney whose declaration served as the foundation for the SEC’s case against Debt Box, were reportedly forced to step down or else be terminated, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the situation.  A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment, but an April 15 court filing declared that Welsh “is no longer employed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.” Watkins’ LinkedIn page says he is still employed by the agency.  Last December, U.S. Chief District Judge in the District of Utah Robert Shelby, wrote that he was “concerned the Commission made materially false and misleading representations” in their pursuit of the restraining order that “undermined the integrity of the proceedings.”  Following Shelby’s order, the SEC filed a response with the court admitting that its team “fell short” of standards but called sanctions “unwarranted.” In addition to apologies from Welsh and Watkins, the SEC’s Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal personally apologized for his agency’s “shortfall” in the case in a Dec. 21, 2023 court filing.  The agency also moved to dismiss the case without prejudice – meaning they would retain the ability to refile the case against Debt Box – but Shelby denied the motion, arguing that his court had “not yet had occasion to evaluate the underlying merits of [the] action.”  Apologies were not enough to get the SEC out of hot water – in February, five Senate Republicans sent SEC Chairman Gary Gensler a letter blasting the agency for conducting itself in “an unethical and unprofessional manner” and suggesting that “other enforcement cases brought by the Commission may be deserving of scrutiny.”  In March, Shelby ruled that the SEC had committed a “gross abuse of power” and ordered it to pay legal costs for Debt Box.

42408415,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIkXu,1713813317,How the Bitcoin Halving Will Drive Action to Layer 2s,"Welcome to “Epoch V” of Bitcoin. On April 20 Bitcoin underwent its fourth successful halving, the programmed slashing of the amount of new bitcoin {{BTC}} that enters into circulation via mining. While the event itself is a bit of a barnburner — a moment for people around the world to celebrate virtually and in person — many eyes are on what is to come.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The launch of Runes, a new protocol that enables the creation of meme coins on Bitcoin, coincided with the halving. Already hundreds of tokens have launched, contributing over $80 million in fees to bitcoin miners. This increased trading activity has also driven up the costs associated with sending a transaction on Bitcoin, with the current average price over $70, an increase of 1,395.8% over the trailing 30 day average, according to TokenTerminal.  While it’s hard to say whether this activity will level out, there are some who think “Epoch V,” or the period of time leading up to the next halving in 2028, will be when Bitcoin layer 2s like the Lightning Network will finally catch on. On April 20, bitcoin fees hit an all-time high of $128.  “Anything that causes fee rates to spike will probably drive people to seek out other solutions,” Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Lightning is one option. Also there are side chains like Fedimint, Ark and a bunch of layer 2s. High fee environments will prompt people to look into them.”  See also: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Come Crashing Down Post Halving  It’s a point echoed by a recent Messari report, which argued that with the rising level of on-chain activity, “layer-2 solutions for Bitcoin are not just a luxury but a necessity,” analyst Nikhil Chaturvedi wrote. Bitcoin is no longer just “digital gold,” but a platform on which to build.  This shifting mindset was stirred by the launch of the Ordinals protocol last year, which enabled new ways of storing data on the smallest units of BTC, called satoshis. There have already been over $3 billion in NFT-like Ordinal “inscription” sales, and trading activity is trending up with the average number of transactions approaching 2 million.  But Ordinals is hardly alone in driving up Bitcoin fees. BitVM, a way to move computation off-chain, enables people to build Ethereum-like smart contracts on Bitcoin. Babylon is building a way to stake and earn yield on BTC holdings. And layer 2s like Stacks and Merlin are becoming home to a number of decentralized apps and meme coins.  Interestly, in the days since the halving, tokens associated with Bitcoin L2s have outperformed BTC. For instance, Elastos’ ELA token has risen 11%, and SatoshiVM’s SAVM climbed 5%. Stack’s STX token has gained nearly 20% to $2.87 — though that may also have been driven by the network’s anticipated Nakamoto upgrade, which began rolling out today.  While market forces will likely drive action to Bitcoin’s secondary layers, that may not always be a good thing. For one thing, those with low bitcoin balances may be priced out from using platforms like Lightning, if they want to use it non-custodially and set up their own channels, Chow suggested.  “The problem is, all of these layer 2s require an on-chain transaction,” Chow said, referring to something like the “inbound capacity” needed to fund a Lightning account. Lightning users also have to pay for an on-chain closing transaction. “In a high fee environment that means it's going to be a little bit hard to actually start using those things.”  See also: OG Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major Overhaul  Of course, there are workarounds to this: custodial Lightning companies that subsidize these surprisingly expensive transactions.  “I am concerned higher BTC fees will drive users to custodial Lightning services … giving BTC users no sovereignty or anonymity over their BTC holdings,” pseudonymous bitcoiner and Lightning critic Sovereign Matt told CoinDesk. “Custodial Lightning services will become the new banks/middlemen that people will have to trust with their life savings as it will be too expensive to self-custody and transact using mainchain bitcoin.”  To some extent, all of this is downstream of the so-called Blocksize Wars over how to scale Bitcoin years ago, where it was decided that instead of ramping up the size of Bitcoin blocks to scale the chain through layer 2s. That set Bitcoin down the path it’s currently on.  “There's basically two schools of thought on increasing the number of transactions per block. You can make blocks bigger, or you can make transactions smaller,” Chow said, adding that expanding the block size is like “brute forcing” a solution.  There are ways of making bitcoin transactions smaller, and more compact, but until that happens, it’s like layer 2s will grow.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/22/how-the-bitcoin-halving-will-drive-action-to-layer-2s,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9b4f8339e0e120d8314a346a72d2882d23dc0be-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On-chain data has indicated some serious whale movements during this period, with trillions of SHIB shuffled in and out of exchanges. The price of SHIB went through a decline earlier in the week from an extended selloff in the previous week. As the week progressed, things started to change into bullish action during the weekend up until a resistance just below $0.000028. Interestingly, on-chain transaction data from whales shows the major holders moved trillions of SHIB over the weekend, with 3.19 trillion SHIB movement in the past 24 hours. Recent on-Chain Data Shows Large SHIB Whale Activity According to IntoTheBlock’s large transaction volume data, the number of Shiba Inu transactions over $100,000 went through a major uptick last week, with the value of transactions greater than $100,000 reaching $661.5 million. On April 19th alone, SHIB transactions in this cohort reached 6.36 trillion SHIB worth $144.76 million. Large transactions in the last 24 hours particularly reached 3.19 trillion SHIB worth $82.49 million. Related Reading: Were Bitcoin Miners Behind The BTC Price Crash Below $60,000? With so much SHIB on the move, the big question is where are these whales sending their tokens. Interestingly, on-chain data showed large transactions consisting of a to and fro movement into and outside exchanges, indicating mixed feelings from large holders. A notable transaction involved the movement of 100 billion SHIB tokens into a crypto exchange on Sunday. Speculations from investors are that this could be a potential selloff from the whale, suggesting that there is a possibility of a price decline in the short term. What Does This Mean For Shiba Inu Holders? For average SHIB investors, whale activity can be both promising and worrying. While more large holders and transactions may indicate growing mainstream interest and adoption of the token, their moves can also significantly impact price. A positive price movement is enjoyed by Shiba Inu when whales are accumulating from exchanges. However, movement into exchanges suggests a selloff, as in the case of the 100 billion SHIB transaction on Sunday. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Accumulation Phase As $500 Million ETH Leave Exchanges At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002726, a 6.65% increase from 0.00002556 in the past 12 hours.

26219152,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604510,1713808801,"Market Expert Predicts New Paradigm For Bitcoin: ‘Days Under $100,000 Numbered’","As the Bitcoin (BTC) Halving event concluded for the fourth time, the cryptocurrency market witnessed notable changes in key metrics. These developments have led Charles Edwards, a market expert and founder of Capriole Invest, to issue bold predictions that hint at a paradigm shift in the BTC market. Bitcoin Trading At ‘Deep Discount’ One of the key metrics highlighted by Edwards is the staggering electrical cost associated with mining a single Bitcoin. Edwards reveals that this cost has now reached an astonishing $77,4000. This figure represents the raw electricity expenses required to power the Bitcoin network for every newly mined BTC. Another significant metric that Edwards draws attention to is the Bitcoin Miner Price, which soared to $244,000 on Saturday. This metric encompasses the block reward and fees miners receive for every Bitcoin they successfully mine. Notably, this surge in miner price coincided with transaction fees skyrocketing to $230, marking a four-fold increase compared to the previous all-time high of $68 set in 2021. Related Reading: Brazil Wants BTC: 7,400 Bitcoin Futures Contracts Created On First Day Of Trading Considering the metrics above, Edwards suggests that BTC currently trades at a “deep discount.” This is because BTC’s price is lower than the electrical costs of mining it. Typically, this situation only lasts for a few days every four years, suggesting that the price will only take a short time to catch up and surpass this price level, which is slightly below BTC’s all-time high (ATH) of $73,7000, reached on March 14th. Edwards outlines three possible outcomes in the wake of these developments. First, he anticipates a scenario in which the price of Bitcoin experiences a significant surge. Secondly, there is a likelihood that approximately 15% of miners may be forced to shut down due to unfavorable economics. Finally, Edwards suggests that average transaction fees are expected to remain substantially higher. Based on the analysis of these metrics and the potential scenarios, Edwards boldly predicts that Bitcoin’s days under the $100,000 mark are “numbered.” While it remains to be seen which of the three outcomes will prevail, Edwards expects a combination of all three factors to contribute to Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Optimal Buying Opportunity? Bitcoin has demonstrated significant price consolidation above the $60,000 mark since Friday, following temporary drops below this threshold amid mounting anticipation for the Halving event. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently analyzed Bitcoin’s current price state, suggesting that a potential bottom may have formed above these levels, increasing the likelihood of surpassing upper resistance levels shortly. According to Ali Martinez’s analysis, Bitcoin strives to establish the $66,000 price level as a crucial support zone. Data reveals that approximately 1.54 million addresses collectively purchased 747,000 BTC at this level. If Bitcoin successfully secures this support, it may pave the way for further upward movement. Martinez identifies Bitcoin’s next critical resistance levels, between $69,900 and $71,200. These levels represent significant price barriers for BTC bulls, and Bitcoin may encounter selling pressure at these levels. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bloodbath Over? Analysts Say $60,000 Is The Cycle’s Bottom In addition, the analyst points out that the Bitcoin MVRV ratio, a metric that compares the market value of Bitcoin to its realized value, has shown a promising pattern, as seen in the chart below. Martinez highlights that whenever the MVRV ratio falls below its 90-day average since November 2022, it historically indicates an optimal buying opportunity for Bitcoin. Interestingly, such buying opportunities have resulted in average gains of approximately 67%. According to Martinez, based on current market conditions and an analysis of the MVRV ratio, now may be an opportune time to consider buying Bitcoin. The historical data and the potential for significant price appreciation support this view. BTC is trading at $66,100, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin 1-Week Price Appears To Be Forming A Classic Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed how DOGE seems to have been showing a classic pattern in its weekly price once again. This trend involves a technical analysis (TA) pattern called the “Descending Triangle,” which, as its name suggests, is shaped like a triangle. The pattern involves two trendlines between which the price of the asset consolidates; one of these is a line slopped downwards while the other is parallel to the time-axis. This property of the price converging downwards as it goes through the pattern is why it has descending in its name. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales Are Buying, Time For Rally To Return? Like other TA consolidation patterns, the upper line of the Descending Triangle also provides resistance to the commodity, making tops more probable to form at it. Similarly, the lower line acts as a point of support and can help the price reverse back upwards. A break out of either of these lines may result in a continuation of the trend in that direction. This means that a break above the triangle can be a bullish signal, while one below could suggest the dominance of bearish momentum. Similar to the Descending Triangle, there is also an Ascending Triangle in TA, which works much like it, except for the fact that the parallel axis makes the upper line, connecting together tops, while the lower line ascends up as it joins higher lows. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that highlights a pattern that DOGE’s 7-day price has been forming recently: The classic pattern that DOGE seems to have formed before in its history | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that the Dogecoin 1-week price had been trading inside a long Descending Triangle between 2021 and this year, but the meme coin found a break earlier and has since registered some notable uplift. Recently, though, the cryptocurrency has reached a stage of sideways movement. This, however, may not entirely be a bad thing, as DOGE has also seen a similar trend of a Descending Triangle break followed by consolidation in the past as well. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trader Selling Pressure Declining, CryptoQuant Head Explains Why As is visible in the chart, the previous two such formations led to Dogecoin witnessing some very significant growth. As such, the latest one may also prove to be bullish, if this historical pattern continues to hold. “Based on past trends, we might just see DOGE rocket towards $1 in the coming weeks!” explains Ali. From the current spot price, such a potential rally would mean a growth of a whopping 525% for the coin. DOGE Price Dogecoin’s price action has been quite stale since the price plunge earlier in the month, as the asset’s price is still trading around $0.16.

The agreement, filed in a Miami court on Friday, has not yet been approved by a judge. If approved, the settlement would release Bankman-Fried from both current and future civil liability tied to the collapse of FTX.  Bankman-Fried's end of the bargain will see him providing the plaintiffs’ attorneys with information – including both testimony and documents in his possession – to “aid in victim recovery” and assist their litigation efforts against a host of celebrity promoters and venture capital firms who endorsed FTX. He has also agreed to provide the attorneys with financial information and documents, including a total of his remaining personal assets and his firm’s 2021 investment in AI startup Anthropic.  The pending settlement agreement comes shortly after Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in FTX’s implosion. Bankman-Fried has appealed his sentence and conviction.  Bankman-Fried’s one-time friends, colleagues and co-defendants Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, as well as FTX lawyer Dan Friedberg, have made similar settlement agreements with the plaintiffs’ attorneys.  Several of the smaller celebrity promoters – including finance Youtubers Andrei Jikh, Graham Stephan, Jaspreet Singh, Tom Nash, Brian Jung and Jeremy Lefebvre – have also settled, contributing to a common fund of $1.4 million to fund the lawsuit, according to court documents.  Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who was paid $500,000 in 2022 to endorse FTX subsidiary Blockfolio, also settled with the plaintiffs last year.

26214739,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604450,1713801635,3 Major Metrics To Watch Out For That Can Impact Ethereum Prices,"The crypto market has been plagued with increased volatility lately, with the second largest crypto token by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), not exempt. This has made it harder to determine Ethereum’s future trajectory. However, certain metrics indicate what direction ETH’s price could head in when this volatility subsides. Ethereum Investors Are Bullish Data from Coinglass shows that most Ethereum investors and traders are still bullish on the crypto token despite recent fluctuating prices. Specifically, most of these traders have continued to open long positions on Ethereum, meaning they are betting on it experiencing significant moves to the upside in the long run. Related Reading: Battle For The Halving Block: Bitcoin Users Spend Record $2.4 Million On Block 840,000 The bullish sentiment towards Ethereum is highlighted by a trader who, having lost $4.5 million while longing ETH, still opened another long position on the second-largest crypto token. This crypto whale went as far as borrowing 17.3 million USDT from Compound just to increase their position on Ethereum. These investors’ bullishness on Ethereum is even more commendable, considering that the bulls have suffered the most from ETH’s high volatility. Data from Coinglass shows that over $16 million in long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, compared to the $10 million short positions that have liquidated during this period. Meanwhile, data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has dropped, indicating that many Ethereum holders are not yet in profit. This could be bullish for ETH’s price as these holders will likely hold in anticipation of further upward price action, thereby providing support against any potential price declines. Making A Case For The Bears While the activity in the derivates market and Ethereum’s MVRV ratio paint a bullish outlook for the crypto token, Ethereum’s network growth suggests that ETH could still experience further price declines. Data from Santiment shows that the rate at which new users enter the Ethereum ecosystem has slowed recently. Related Reading: Were Bitcoin Miners Behind The BTC Price Crash Below $60,000? This declining network growth is also evident in a recent Bitcoinist report, which noted that Ethereum fees have dropped to their lowest since January. Ethereum fees are known to skyrocket when there is increased activity on the network. Therefore, low fees mean fewer new users are currently transacting on the network or even holding the ETH token at all. However, the silver lining is that data from Santiment also shows an increase in velocity, which suggests that existing users on the network are actively trading and injecting more liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem. This factor could also contribute to potential price surges for the ETH token. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,200, which is up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42408429,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIlBa,1713800896,NYSE Asks Market Participants About 24/7 Trading for Stocks,"The New York Stock Exchange is seeking opinions from market participants about shifting the U.S. stock market to a 24/7 operating schedule.  Round-the-clock trading became popular during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the trading of cryptocurrencies picked up and retail investor interest blew up.  A Steve Cohen-backed trading platform, 24 Exchange, is currently awaiting a decision from the SEC on whether it can launch the first 24/7 exchange.  The New York Stock Exchange has asked market participants about how they'd feel if the market operated 24 hours a day, the same schedule that cryptocurrencies use, the Financial Times reported.  NYSE, whose roots stretch back to the 18th century, famously signals the start and end of daily trading with bell-ringing ceremonies in the morning and afternoon – though, because of electronic trading, buying and selling has for decades actually taken place before the first bell at 9:30 a.m. and after the second one at 4 p.m. New York time.  But a startup, 24 Exchange, which is backed by billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, wants to take that a step further as the first stock exchange to allow 24/7 trading. Several retail brokers like Robinhood already let clients trade day and night.  And cryptocurrencies never stop trading. “Anyone who wants to trade crypto 24/7 would also like to trade Apple or Microsoft 24/7,” 24 Exchange’s founder and CEO, Dmitri Galin, told Bloomberg in 2023.  Round-the-clock trading became a popular idea after interest in crypto blew up and retail trading grew tremendously during the Covid-19 pandemic. Increased investor interest from Asia and Europe in U.S. financial assets has also picked up in recent years.  “The world changed with the pandemic and with crypto trading 24/7. Everybody has the infrastructure and the support to handle trading overnight now,” Brian Hyndman, chief executive of Blue Ocean, an overnight-trading provider, told the Financial Times in December.  Questions in NYSE’s survey included whether participants would prefer overnight trading to take place seven days a week, how investors should be protected from price fluctuations as well as opinions on the staffing of overnight sessions, according to the FT.  The SEC has several months to make a decision on 24 Exchange’s application.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/22/nyse-asks-market-participants-about-247-trading-for-stocks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ea1f2e52254e4c537299b337fe4b83314f0400b-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26212579,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604460,1713798007,"Ethereum Spot ETFs Approval Skepticism Persists, As ETH Recovers","Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approval odds continue to witness notable pessimism as the cryptocurrency space awaits the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on the products scheduled for May. The expectation surrounding the SEC’s decision highlights how important ETF approval is in terms of giving conventional investors more convenient access to Ethereum’s spot market. Presently, data from Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market, shows that ETH ETF approval odds have fallen to a mere 11%. Pessimism Deepens As Ethereum ETFs Remain Uncertain As the May deadline draws near, doubt and skepticism loom large on the horizon, casting a dark shadow for the products. One of the most recent figures to voice doubts about the SEC’s willingness to approve the exchange-traded products this May is Nate Geraci, the president of ETF Store. Related Reading: Cloudy Future For Ethereum ETFs – What’s Casting Doubt On Their Fate? According to Geraci, the regulatory watchdog is eerily silent on Ethereum spot ETFs. He further suggested that the products might not be approved due to the SEC’s significantly lower level of engagement with ETF issuers than in previous interactions. “Logic says that is correct, but also wonder if SEC learned a lesson from clown show with spot Bitcoin ETFs,” he added. Thus, he has pointed out two possible options for the products, which are either an approval or lawsuit from the Commission. Commenting on the president’s insights, a pseudonymous X user questioned if there is a possibility that activities are taking place behind closed doors in order to avoid disrupting the pre-launch market. Geraci responded, saying he believes that could be possible, drawing attention to Van Eck CEO Jan Van Eck’s review, which might prove otherwise. It is worth noting that Van Eck is one of the earliest firms to submit its application for an Ethereum exchange product. Even though the company was the first to file for an application, Jan Van Eck is pessimistic about the approval of the ETPs, saying they will probably be rejected in May. He stated: The way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs. And right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned. In light of this, investors prepare for an unpredictable result while managing market swings and modifying their investment plans in the face of changing regulations. ETH Price Sees Positive Movement While Ethereum ETFs might be experiencing negative sentiment, ETH, on the other hand, has witnessed a positive uptick lately. ETH has revisited the $3,000 level again after falling as low as $2,888 during the weekend. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Hints At Potential Fresh Rally, Buy The Dip? Today, ETH price rose by over 4%, reaching around $3,234, indicating potential for further price recovery. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,215, demonstrating an increase of 1.40% in the past day. Also, the asset’s market cap and trading volume are up by 1.40% and 5.96% in the last 24 hours. Given the anticipated impact of the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving on cryptocurrencies, ETH could be poised for noteworthy moves in the coming months.

42408433,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIlOo,1713795819,Polymarket Odds Say Columbia University President Will Keep Job,"Columbia University president's job is probably safe, Polymarket traders signal.  Taylor Swift's new album is unlikely to break her record, Kalshi odds say.  Traders are betting on a DeFi controversy.  The president of Columbia University is facing a growing backlash regarding pro-Palestinian protestors who continue to occupy the campus, which coincides with her scheduled Capitol Hill testimony on antisemitism on college campuses.  But the Polymarket hive mind doesn't think she'll be another Claudine Gay – who resigned from her role as Harvard president after a double-whammy of plagiarism accusations and institutional criticism to the university's response to protests targeting Jewish students after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.  Right now, ""yes"" shares for the crypto-based betting platform's ""Minouche Shafik out as Columbia President in April?"" contract are trading at 7 cents, signaling a 7% chance of her ouster in that timeframe. Each contract pays out $1 if the prediction turns out to be true, and zero if it's false.  Keep in mind there's not a lot of liquidity in the contract, and while the protests have recently been in the press because of their newfound intensity, they aren't occupying the same place in the national psyche as the ousting of Harvard's Gay.  But also keep in mind that there was a fair degree of volatility in the contract predicting Gay's exit. The ""yes"" side began at 26 cents – or 26% odds of her leaving – then pushed up to the mid-50s, before dropping to the low-40s, then rallying up to 100%.  It was so volatile that one of the journalists who broke the story of Gay's plagiarism lost money betting on her ouster.  Read more: He Exposed Harvard President's Plagiarism, Then Lost Money Betting on the Story  Chart-Topping Taylor?  Taylor Swift's Era's tour broke records as the world's highest-grossing concert tour, so, naturally, expectations are sky-high about her latest album, ""The Tortured Poets Department."" Launched on Friday, the album has already broken records by becoming Spotify's most-streamed album in a single day with 300 million streams in a 24-hour period.  Considering all of this, one would expect that the album would sail through prior records set by the Swift Empire and dominate the Billboard 200 charts for months.  But bettors on Kalshi, the regulated U.S. prediction market platform, aren't so sure.  Right now, the market sees the album owning the charts for two to three weeks, with an edge chance of it going four to five weeks and a wall of unlikeliness hitting at the six-week mark.  If the album does not break the six-week mark, it won't be a record-setter for Swift. Currently, Folklore holds the record for the longest Swift album to hold the top spot. It was released during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic; the isolation effect of quarantine may have fueled its popularity, some critics argue.  Coming in at the three-to-four-week mark at the top of the charts would make this a fairly average album for Swift, and one has to wonder if the market is underpricing the impact a global multi-billion-dollar sell-out tour has on sales.  Just asking?  Sometimes a question is an accusation.  Consider a Polymarket contract concerning the decentralized finance, or DeFi, gambling project ZKasino which raised $26 million from some well-known investors, including the MEXC exchange, at a valuation of $350 million.  Its launch party was scheduled for Token2049 this month in Dubai, but was canceled because of historic floods. When it came time to launch the actual project, there were outages and bugs.  Now, it turns out that $33 million in Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} that users deposited at the virtual gambling house, to earn its native token, ended up being directed to Lido, the staking protocol, rather than returned to them as ZKasino originally said would happen.  Read more: ZKasino Users Plead for Refunds as $33M of Bridged Ether Sent to Lido  Users are furious, and many are not giving the project the benefit of the doubt. Hence the Polymarket contract asking: Will the two founders, known by their handles Derivatives_Ape and XBT_Prometheus, be arrested this year?  But it's premature to draw conclusions about whether this was a costly blunder or a rug pull, which is probably why Polymarket bettors give only a 27% chance of it happening, with only two users holding tokens on the ""yes"" side.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/22/polymarket-odds-say-columbia-university-president-will-keep-job,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7eca8b01806a87971ebd3ba7af434d7d2752d75-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Benchmark initiated coverage of the bitcoin mining stock with a buy rating and a $12 price target.  Its bitcoin stash of 9,102 coins provides it with a sizable liquidity cushion, the report said.  The new Hut 8 (HUT), resulting from the merger with US Bitcoin Corporation (USBTC) that closed last November, features a diversified business model with multiple revenue streams, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Monday.  Benchmark initiated coverage of the bitcoin {{BTC}} miner with a buy rating and a $12 price target. Hut 8 was trading 5.2% higher at $8.47 at publication time.  These revenue streams include self-mining, managed services, hosting, and high-performance (HPC) computing and artificial intelligence (AI).  “Hut trades at a discount to its bitcoin mining peers that we expect to shrink as the company executes on its self-mining expansion plans,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote.  As of March 31, Hut 8 ranked second among listed miners in terms of bitcoin holdings with 9,102 held in reserve, the report said.  This bitcoin horde provides the company with a “sizable liquidity cushion as well the ability to capture upside during bitcoin price rallies,” the report added. Its crypto holdings are valued at around $592 million, which is equal to about 82% of its market capitalization.  Since the merger closed, “management has focused on actions aimed at reducing the company’s cost of mining bitcoin and its realized cost of energy and increasing its cash flow,” Palmer wrote.

Despite initially saying that the bridged ether would be returned, ZKasino said it had converted the ether for ZKAS.  Blockchain data shows that the ether has been deposited to Lido.  Cryptocurrency casino ZKasino went live over the weekend, but the launch was met with dismay from investors, who are calling foul on the company for sending $33 million worth of user deposits to staking platform Lido.  ZKasino is an on-chain gambling platform that uses zkSync and EigenDA as well as Chainlink and Randomizer’s Verifiable Random Functions to ensure fairness. In March, it raised $26.2 million at a $350 million valuation.  In the lead-up to going live, ZKasino opened up a token bridge that allowed investors to deposit ether {{ETH}} to earn ZKAS, the platform’s native token. Originally, the website said that bridged ether would be “returned” once the bridging period was over, that wording has since been removed.  In a blog post on April 20, ZKasino wrote that “all bridged ethereum has been converted to our native gas token, ZKAS, at a discounted rate of $0.055.”  “This conversion was done as a favor to our users who have bridged to participate in the ecosystem,” it added.  The $33 million worth of ether that was deposited by more than 10,000 users was subsequently sent by ZKasino to staking platform Lido, blockchain data shows.  ZKasino is yet to respond to a wave of criticism from depositors, who are vocally requesting a refund on social media platform X.

Analysts Say $60,000 Is The Cycle’s Bottom","Bitcoin enthusiasts around the globe can now breathe a collective sigh of relief as the world’s premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, rebounds from a recent downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Strike Gold: $107 Million Profit From Runes-Fueled Minting Spree Last week witnessed Bitcoin, akin to the broader market, sliding below the $60,000 mark, primarily due to risk aversion, the US tax season, and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. However, in a surprising turn of events, Bitcoin has not only recovered but has surged past the $66,000 mark, reigniting optimism and sparking discussions about its future trajectory. This recent resurgence in Bitcoin’s price comes on the heels of a significant price correction that coincided with April’s highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event. The halving event, a recurring phenomenon in Bitcoin’s protocol, entails a reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoins are mined, effectively halving the supply. 20% drawdown would fit the current bull’s pattern: pic.twitter.com/usNxQz1t92 — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) April 18, 2024 Historically, this event has been associated with heightened market volatility, as some analysts feared that the supply shock could trigger a prolonged sell-off. Nevertheless, prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space, such as Tuur Demeester, offer a more sanguine perspective. Demeester suggests that the recent dip to $60,000 might signal the floor of the correction, aligning with historical patterns observed during bull markets. According to Demeester, a 20% drawdown from highs is considered a typical correction for Bitcoin, and thus, there is a strong possibility that $60,000 could serve as a support level moving forward. BTCUSD trading at $65,883 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com While Demeester advocates for stability in Bitcoin’s price, anoother analyst, McKenna, foresee a period of sideways movement. McKenna agrees with Demeester regarding the $60,000 floor but predicts that Bitcoin may enter a re-accumulation phase, characterized by prolonged sideways price action. I think there is a high probability that the bottom for the halving selloff is in but simultaneously think there is an equal high probability that we are forming a re-accumulation range. Meaning expect sideways price action for longer than expected. #BTC pic.twitter.com/K24Md0TKXH — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) April 21, 2024 Interestingly, McKenna believes that this sideways movement could present an opportune moment for alternative cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins, to shine in the short term. Related Reading: Will Celestia (TIA) Hit $130? Analyst Makes Bold Prediction The recent resurgence in Bitcoin’s price has sparked optimism among investors and analysts alike.

42390941,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdR5Mp,1713790800,"Celo Chooses Optimism, Concluding Bake-Off Among Layer 2s","The primary developer behind the Celo blockchain has been on the hunt since last year for the technology for its planned layer-2 network atop Ethereum – and the selection process had turned into a surprisingly competitive bake-off between leading providers.  On Monday, the team officially proposed using Optimism’s OP Stack for the transition. The proposal will be discussed on a couple of community calls and then go to a vote among holders of the project's CELO tokens, under the chain's governance rules.  CLabs, Celo’s developer, has spent the past couple months evaluating technical proposals from various layer-2 teams on why they may be the best fit for their new blockchain. The big idea is that the Celo team sees a more prosperous future as a part of the broader Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, as a layer-2 chain, than in its current form as a standalone, or layer-1, chain.  When Celo originally announced it would migrate to a layer 2, cLabs had originally suggested choosing the OP Stack. That's where the team ended back at, eight months after its initial announcement, following extensive consideration of all of the competing layer-2 tech providers.  “We know a lot more than we knew back eight months ago when we first started really zooming in on this,” Rene Reinsberg, co-founder of Celo and president of Celo Foundation, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “I'm very happy we didn't just make a decision last year, but did all this due diligence.”  Optimism wins another  During the selection process, cLabs was considering whether to deploy on OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, zkSync’s ZK Stack or Polygon CDK.  In a blog post sent to CoinDesk, Celo mentions that ultimately OP Stack fit their needs, and that it could be compatible with components from other layer-2 teams, specifically including Polygon’s Type 1 prover.  “Even some of the stuff we learned on the other stacks, I think it's going to be helpful as the entire architecture kind of gets built and deployed over time,” Reinsberg told CoinDesk.  The OP Stack has become quite popular over the last few months among blockchain projects, with Coinbase tapping the technology last August to build out its own layer-2 chain, Base. Just last week, Worldcoin announced plans for a layer 2, World Chain, also built with OP Stack.  “It's super cool to actually see them [Celo] be keen on OP Stack, do deep due diligence and look at all these chains,” said Ryan Wyatt, chief growth officer at the Optimism Foundation, in an interview with CoinDesk. “I mean, there's a lot of opportunities around this build-a-blockchain out of the box. So I love that they did it and then ultimately concluded that we're going with OP Stack.”  Read more: Celo, Shopping for Blockchain Partner, Turns to the Delicate Issue of Money",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/22/celo-chooses-optimism-concluding-bake-off-among-layer-2s,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fea119c4caec8900b62444c2b2415786be3c5e23-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms are unprofitable on a Gross Profit level due to the business model’s poor operational leverage. After adjustments, I estimated that Riot Platforms has a Gross Loss of -$163.6 million, meaning it is losing money per Bitcoin produced. In my view, investors are much better off owning the actual Bitcoin than any Bitcoin miner. This is especially true for underperformers like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). While the actual Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) asset has skyrocketed, owning RIOT stock has been a money loser. In my view, this is not bound to change in the future due to the company’s difficult business economics. RIOT Stock Underperforms The bottom for Bitcoin prices was around September 2023. This can be the starting point we can use to compare the performance of Riot’s stock with the underlying Bitcoin asset. As seen in the chart below, buying Riot stock drastically underperformed both Bitcoin and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) which is the leader in this space, having the largest market cap. Data by YCharts In my article on Marathon Digital, I highlighted two main reasons that I believe Bitcoin miners in general will underperform owning actual Bitcoin. The first reason is centered around decreasing demand from investors for Bitcoin mining stocks, such as Riot Platforms, once Bitcoin ETFs become widely available. Since the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs last January, it has been much easier for the everyday layperson with a 401K to get Bitcoin exposure. The second reason is the difficult business economics suffered by Bitcoin miners. The more Bitcoins are mined, the more resources are needed to be spent to mine the next Bitcoin. On top of this, Bitcoin halving occurs every four years. Therefore, in one stroke, the number of Bitcoins that miners produce is instantly cut in half. This event essentially halves the company’s future revenues, which is more than any one-time gain a miner, like Riot Platforms, could see from Bitcoin’s price increase. Finally, most miners are unprofitable on a Gross Profit level due to the business model’s poor operational leverage. A simple definition from Wall Street Prep describes Operating Leverage as something that "" measures the proportion of a company's cost structure that consists of fixed costs rather than variable costs. "" Despite the headline numbers, it is my view that Riot Platforms suffers from the same issue as well. Riot Platforms Headline Results Look Strong The press headlines would make you believe that Riot Platforms is firing on all cylinders. However, after digging through the results a little bit more, it is in my opinion that is not the case. The company achieved all-time highs in 2023, ending the year with $281 million in total revenues compared to $259.2 million in 2022. The company produced 6,626 Bitcoins in 2023, an increase of 19% compared to the 5,554 Bitcoins the previous year. In the press release management commented that the increase in production was “ notwithstanding the impact of the Company’s effective employment of its power strategy, under which Bitcoin production was suspended while the Company received significant benefits from power credits earned. ” In other words, Riot Platforms earned $71 million in power credits by curtailing its operations and returning the electricity back to the power grid. I don’t like this aspect of Riot Platform’s business, as it ultimately is a form of “market timing.” In other words, management needs to make a call on whether to mine or return power back to the grid. Rather than produce the maximum amount of Bitcoin in 2023, Riot Platform was ultimately “betting” (or hedging) that the price of Bitcoin would remain stagnant or fall. It did not in 2023 as Bitcoin went on a massive rally. It is in my view that Riot Platforms missed some of these gains as for reference, Marathon Digital’s Bitcoin production was up roughly 3x in 2023 compared to Riot Platform’s 19%. This is a line item that I will continue to watch out for in upcoming releases. As of March 2024, the company has a strong balance sheet with $685 million in cash on hand and 8,490 unencumbered Bitcoin. This is about $1.3 billion worth of liquidity based on March month-end Bitcoin prices. The company has virtually no long-term debt obligations. The company also is on track with getting its Corsicana Facility in Texas to full operations. The company has an initial target of a total rate of 28 EH/s in 2024 (increased to 31 EH/s), 38 EH/s in 2025, and eventually 100 EH/s. According to the company’s press release . With the Corsicana Facility’s 400-megawatt substation now operational, we remain well on track to increase our self-mining hash rate capacity to 31 EH/s by the end of 2024, which will represent a significant increase in our operational capabilities. We are excited about the incredible pipeline for growth the Corsicana Facility provides over the next several years, and we look forward to further executing on that plan Adjusting Riot Platforms' Gross Profit In a previous article , I showed that Marathon Digital is unprofitable on a gross margin basis. Therefore, imagine my surprise when I read Riot Platform’s investor presentations and press releases that it is able to mine Bitcoin at a profit. This seemed sort of odd to me, as I viewed Bitcoin mining as a type of commodity business. When it comes to mining rigs and optimizing such, there isn’t any real “secret” to it. Most miners have the same access to 3rd party rig suppliers and technologies to lower electricity costs. Marathon is a major player in the space, with a market capitalization of $4 billion (compared to Riot Platforms’ $2.1 billion). Thus, it should have had access to the same technologies and strategies. Could Riot Platform be any different? Has it discovered some sort of “secret sauce” to Bitcoin mining? The short answer in my view is no. Rather, the differences between Riot Platforms and Marathon come down to an accounting choice on how to treat the depreciation of mining rigs. In 2023, the company reported a cost of $7,539 to produce one Bitcoin, giving the company a gross margin of 74% for the year. However, looking at Riot Platform’s Cost of Revenue comes with an important disclaimer “ Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue consists primarily of direct production costs of mining operations, including electricity, labor, and insurance, but excluding depreciation and amortization ” Riot Investor Presentation In other words, Riot Platforms' Cost of Revenues excludes the very important cost of the depreciation of its Bitcoin rigs/ miners. Remember that mining Bitcoin essentially only has two inputs, electricity and the machine/rig used to mine Bitcoin. As seen in the screenshot, Marathon Digital’s 10-K clearly indicates depreciation and amortization as part of its Cost of Revenues, giving the company a negative Gross Profit. Marathon Digital 10-K According to Riot Platforms’ 10-K , the company had a depreciation and amortization of $252.4 million in 2023. This cost, according to the notes, “was primarily attributable to the depreciation of our miners.” In my view, depreciation of mining rigs should be part of Cost of Revenues given the fact that mining rigs have a very short useful life. Riot Platforms only gives its mining rigs a useful life of 2 years, making it closer to a variable cost rather than a long-lived fixed cost. Re-classifying mining rigs from fixed costs (below Gross Profit) to variable costs (Cost of Revenues) shows that Bitcoin miners in general have poor Operational Leverage. Riot 10-K I want to note though that I am not making any claims on whether or not Riot Platforms’ treatment of this cost is appropriate from an accounting perspective. That is a question for the accountants/ auditors. I am merely making the adjustments to make the proper “Apples to Apples” comparison. So let’s make the proper adjustments. In 2023 Riot Platforms had total Revenue of $280 million. Its total Cost of Revenue was $254.3 million, consisting of $96.6 for Bitcoin mining, $97.1 for Data Center hosting and $60.6 for Engineering. Now let’s include 75% of the company’s depreciation expense, which is $189.3 million. In my opinion, 75% of depreciation expense is a conservative number considering that mining rigs make up a bulk of the company’s Property and Equipment and the relatively much shorter lifespan of such equipment. This gives us an estimated Gross Loss of -$163.6 million. This is much larger than Marathon Digital’s Gross Loss and demonstrates that Riot Platforms is losing money per Bitcoin produced. Riot 10-K Conclusion As mentioned in my previous article, I am not a fan of Bitcoin miners due to their overall poor business economics in my opinion. Riot Platforms is even worse than Marathon Digital, given that its Gross Loss is much larger. In my view, the company also failed to take full advantage of the massive Bitcoin rally due to its ""unique power strategy."" Riot Platforms might be among the cheaper options compared to other Bitcoin miners at 5x Price to Sales. However, with the easy availability of actual Spot Bitcoin ETFs, I would prefer to avoid Riot Platforms altogether.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Tokens associated with Bitcoin layer 2 solutions have outperformed bitcoin (BTC) since the Bitcoin blockchain's highly-anticipated mining reward halving took effect early Saturday. STX, the native token of leading Bitcoin layer 2 network Stacks, has risen nearly 20% to $2.87 since quadrennial halving reduced the per block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, according to data source CoinGecko. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained just over 4.7% to $66,300. STX is one of the best-performing top 25 cryptocurrencies of the past 24 hours, per Velo Data. Other layer 2 coins, like Elastos’ ELA token and SatoshiVM’s SAVM, have risen 11% and 5%, respectively, since halving. Bitcoin layer 2 solutions are projects that address scalability and transaction speed limitations on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and bring scalability by processing transactions off the main chain.  Grayscale, which currently offers the most expensive spot bitcoin ETF, revealed that it is planning a spinoff version of the fund with a 0.15% fee, which would be the lowest of them all, according to pro forma financials in its latest filing. The existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has a 1.5% fee. When Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) is introduced, the filing says the company will contribute 10% of the assets in GBTC to the BTC Trust. Shares of the BTC trust are to be issued and distributed automatically to holders of GBTC shares. (The pro forma financial statements are projections of future expenses and revenues based on a company's past experience and future plans.) Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust was conceived to offer GBTC investors a lower fee option that’s more competitively in line with other bitcoin ETFs approved back in January. Currently, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) at 0.19% is the lowest-cost spot bitcoin ETF.  Woo X is claiming bragging rights for being the first cryptocurrency exchange to offer retail customers exposure to tokenized U.S. Treasury bills. The yield-bearing product, unveiled on Monday, called RWA Earn Vaults (as in real-world assets) has been built in partnership with London-based institutional tokenization platform OpenTrade. The product's arrival was described as a “significant milestone” by Woo X Chief Operating Officer Willy Chuang. “For the first time, retail users on a centralized exchange can instantly access an interest-bearing account backed by U.S. Treasury Bills,” Chuang said in an email. “This initiative bridges a crucial gap between traditional financial securities and the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, offering our users an unprecedented opportunity to engage with low-risk, high-quality financial assets in a seamless, secure, and efficient manner.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the average annualized three-month basis or spreads between prices in bitcoin futures and spot markets on Binance, Bybit, Deribit, and OKX.  The premium has declined sharply to under 10% from 30% on March 31, denting the appeal of the cash and carry arbitrage strategy.

B3 Bitcoin Futures Sees Surge In Demand Following its launch of Bitcoin futures on April 17, B3 experienced a massive wave of demand and interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts eager to trade the newly listed Bitcoin futures. The stock exchange reported that on the debut trading day, more than 7,400 Bitcoin futures contracts were actively traded. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees 81% Daily Increase, But Why Is Participation Low? This unprecedented trading volume underscores investors’ strong interest in cryptocurrency derivatives as well as the increasing demand for BTC exposure among Brazilian cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts. Notably, B3 disclosed that the demand for Bitcoin futures on its exchange was so profound that it had hit 111,000 buy or sell orders on the trading screen. The market had displayed intense participation in the newly launched contracts, with the Director of Listed Products at B3, Marcos Skistymas, affirming that the heightened demand resulted from B3’s introduction of its first-ever derivative linked to a cryptocurrency. The introduction of Bitcoin futures marks a significant step forward for the stock exchange, aligning with its vision to expand its offerings to cater to users’ needs. Skistymas has also indicated that the market’s response to the recently listed Bitcoin futures was overwhelmingly positive, reflecting a significant potential for these contracts within the Brazilian market. BTC Futures To Act As A Hedge Against Market Volatility According to Skistymas, Bitcoin futures were a “suitable instrument” that could become a hedge against Bitcoin, potentially providing Brazilian investors a means to manage the flurry of risks associated with Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. For more clarity, a Bitcoin future is a contract between investors who wager on the future price of the pioneer cryptocurrency, providing exposure to Bitcoin without the need to purchase it. Given btc’s high volatility and price fluctuations during certain market conditions, accurately predicting the price of the cryptocurrency can be challenging. Additionally, only a handful of crypto analysts and investors have managed to forecast Bitcoin’s price actions with precision. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Walks Back $5 Trillion Crypto Marker Prediction, Unveils New Target At the beginning of the year, the price of BTC surged from below $50,000 to an all-time high of more than $75,000 in March 2024.

Irrespective of BTC’s unpredictability and price variations, the launch of Bitcoin futures on B3 has the potential to bring in a new era of adoption among Brazilian investors, providing them with fresh opportunities to diversify their portfolios with these regulated financial instruments.

42390927,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdR4hn,1713786707,Bitcoin Miners Have Raked in Abnormal Transaction Fees Since Halving: Bernstein,"Total miner revenue is currently about triple the pre-halving level, the report noted.  The spike in network fees indicates the level of developer interest in Bitcoin, and the fee revenue potential for miners, Bernstein said.  The broker expects 15% of miner revenues to be network transaction fees on a sustainable basis.  Since the reward halving of bitcoin {{BTC}}, miners have earned about 19 BTC per block on average, which is over and above the standard block rewards as a spike in network fees led to a tripling of revenue, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.  The quadrennial halving, which slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply, occurred on Friday evening.  “This is driven by speculative activity to mint new tokens (mostly meme tokens) by retail traders,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  The Runes protocol allows people to etch and mint tokens on the chain. The launch of the protocol over the weekend triggered a spike in network fees on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The report said that the total miner revenue is currently about triple the pre-halving level, at around 22 bitcoins versus 7 bitcoins before. Bernstein noted that daily revenues exceeded $100 million, with more than about $80 million coming from transaction fees, which is clearly abnormal, it said.  “Investors should not extrapolate these fees into the future, but it indicates the level of developer interest on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the fee revenue potential for miners,” the authors wrote.  The broker notes that Runes token launches have been speculative meme tokens so far, and such speculative activity may be short-lived.  Still, the fungible token market is largely untapped on the Bitcoin network, the report noted, and decentralized tokens and other utility tokens on the Ethereum network exceed more than $200 billion.  “We expect 15% of miner revenues to be network transaction fees, on a sustainable basis,” the note said, adding that seen as “speculative fervor” on blockchains can last for 6-18 months, the miners may continue to enjoy the above normal windfall for now.

26203731,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=604437,1713783829,Analyst Outlines XRP Price Scenarios Ahead Of Ripple-SEC Case Update,"In a chart analysis shared via X, the crypto analyst Dark Defender provided insight into the potential price movements of XRP ahead of this week’s Ripple-SEC case update. The analysis, conducted on a monthly time frame, reveals that XRP has been holding above a critical support trend marked in blue. With the crypto community’s eyes set on the new Ripple filings expected next week, there’s a mix of anticipation and caution. XRP Price Enters Potentially Crucial Week Dark Defender notes that although market news does not typically have a direct correlation with price movements, the “last puzzle piece” pertaining to the Ripple case may add a layer of enthusiasm to the market sentiment surrounding XRP. The question posed is: What could happen if XRP fails to maintain its position above the blue support line? According to the analysis, if XRP breaks below this blue support line, it will likely approach the two critical Fibonacci retracement levels at $0.4623 (38.2% retracement level) and $0.3917 (23.6% retracement level). These figures are derived from the swing high and low points on the chart, traditionally considered potential support levels where the price could stabilize or bounce back. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Roar: Analyst Foresees Explosive Surge With ‘God Candle’ On The Horizon In the context of the current chart, a drop below these levels, particularly if the price closes under $0.3917 for two to three days consecutively, would invalidate the bullish five-wave structure that Dark Defender suggests could propel XRP to a high of $5.85. On the flip side, should XRP reclaim the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $0.6044, it could signify a first step towards a strong upward move. Between the price range of $0.6649 and $0.3917, any price movement is considered a sideways trend. A breakout above the 70.2% level at $0.6649 would likely confirm a bullish trend, with the analyst highlighting this as a significant threshold for a positive price trajectory. Above this level, XRP would then eye the next Fibonacci extension levels of $1.8815 (161.8% extension) and potentially $5.8563 (261.8% extension), which are ambitiously projected targets. The chart also highlights a “Main Resistance Trend” line that has capped the price since the peak of early 2018, and the current price action is pinched between this descending resistance and the ascending support trend lines, forming a converging pattern that traders often interpret as a potential breakout signal. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again, But Are They Bullish Or Bearish? A breakout could be the first bullish indication of a larger rally, with at least one monthly close above the line required. In the past, several attempts at a breakout have failed, and even one monthly close was followed by a fall back below the trendline the following month. Ripple Vs. SEC: What To Expect This Week Ripple Labs is gearing up to file its response to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) remedies briefing on April 22, a pivotal moment in their protracted legal battle. This response from Ripple is in reaction to the SEC’s briefing that put forth potential remedies including disgorgement of profits derived from XRP sales and civil penalties. The financial stakes are high, with the SEC calculating fines that could reach around $2 billion, claiming that Ripple engaged in an unregistered securities offering with its XRP sales. The legal and financial communities expect Ripple to mount a formidable defense against the SEC’s claims. Key to this counter-argument will be undermining the SEC’s assertion of the necessity for disgorgement, given the alleged lack of demonstrable financial harm to XRP purchasers. Furthermore, Ripple is likely to leverage favorable recent legal decisions and regulatory developments, aiming to weaken the SEC’s position. According to the schedule, Ripple is expected to submit a public redacted version of its opposition brief along with associated declarations and exhibits today, if these materials are devoid of any SEC-designated confidential information. If confidentiality is a concern, Ripple will file the documents under seal and submit a redacted public version by April 24. Following this, the SEC will have the opportunity to reply, with their response anticipated to be filed under seal by May 6. At press time, XRP traded at $0.53.

42390951,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdR61r,1713782232,Bitcoin's Unique Volatility Profile in Focus as VIX and MOVE Spike,"BTC's implied volatility index, DVOL, has recently declined, maintaining a positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price.  Stock and bond market volatility indices, VIX and MOVE, have ticked higher amid risk aversion.  A continued rise in MOVE may weigh over bitcoin, one analyst said.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} price has recently corrected after weeks of unstoppable rally, tracking weakness in U.S. stocks and bonds.  BTC's pullback again stands out, exhibiting little fear or panic compared to stocks and bond markets, where expected or implied volatility indices, often called fear gauges, witnessed notable spikes.  Bitcoin's price has declined by 7% this month. Still, crypto exchange Deribit's BTC DVOL index, an options-based measure of expected price volatility over the next 30 days, has decreased from 75% to 70% on an annualized basis. That's an extension of the pullback from March highs at around 80%, according to data from TradingView.  In other words, despite the price drop, there has been little panic buying of put options or derivatives offering downside protection, which is usually the case in traditional markets. Implied volatility is influenced by demand for options.  Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of expected price turbulence over four weeks, has significantly increased from an annualized 13% to 19%. The index is based on options tied to the S&P 500 index, which has experienced a 5.4% decline this month.  The MOVE index, which measures expected volatility in U.S. Treasury notes, has increased from 94% to 111% alongside a decline in bond prices (and an uptick in yields).  The diverging trend in the BTC DVOL does not necessarily mean bitcoin is seen as a relatively safe asset and is a bull market feature. BTC's implied volatility has been positively correlated with its price since 2023.  ""Bitcoin, in this bull market is still very much in a positive spot/vol correlation regime. With the potential parabolic moves to the upside, BTC vol picks up as price starts to rally and softens as we sell off,"" David Brickell, head of international distribution at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, said.  ""Tradfi risk skew is still very much to the downside as the sell offs are typically sharper than the slower grinding rallies,"" Brickell added.  BTC's unusual implied volatility profile means traders may be better off taking bullish implied volatility bets during price rallies than during market swoons.  MOVE spike matters  Bitcoin bulls anticipating a resumption of the uptrend might want to watch out for a continued rise in the MOVE index.  That's because heightened volatility in U.S. Treasury notes, which dominate global collateral and securities and finance, often leads to tighter financial conditions and investor risk aversion.  ""Treasuries are often the collateral that are used by markets to borrow and gain leverage to trade in stocks and other riskier investments,"" the founders of newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said in Monday's edition.  ""When bond volatility spikes, then a greater haircut is applied to that collateral, meaning less leverage is able to be taken against it, which means reduced liquidity in the system. Alongside the strengthening dollar, this has been a squeeze on stocks and also on bitcoin,"" the founders added.  11:46 UTC: Updated VIX value.

The company's main source of income is Bitcoin mining, but it is considering expanding into offering high-computing solutions for other clients. IREN has seen an increase in assets and cash and has no financial debt, which could attract attention from investors. AI could be employed to diminish electricity consumption. Iris Energy Limited ( IREN ) recently noted a new 2024 harsh rate of 20 EH/s expected after the purchase of new NVIDIA GPUs, with two data centers to be completed in 2024. Assuming new operating efficiency from artificial intelligence and the double-digit growth of the Bitcoin mining industry, IREN could receive a significant amount of cash from investors to run operations. Yes, there are risks from increases in the price of electricity or changes in the price of Bitcoin, however under my DCF models, IREN does show significant upside potential in the stock price. Iris Energy Iris Energy is a company in the IT sector running data storage centers supported 100% by renewable energies. The company's income comes mainly from Bitcoin mining activity, in addition to transaction fees and various exchange mechanisms towards other types of digital currencies that are backed by traditional currencies. Source: Business Report Source: Investor Relations Presentation The company's strategy in relation to its assets has been the acquisition of low-cost spaces for the installation of its computing centers, with the condition that they are located near proven renewable energy sources. To date, the company has 4 active storage centers, three of them in Canada and the fourth one in the United States that, despite being active at this time, is under development to expand its mining capabilities. The company operates all of its Bitcoin mining activities through a single segment. The activities are carried out through high-performance computing centers under its ownership, oriented towards operating with renewable energy unlike traditional companies in this sector. This factor also becomes part of company's low-cost strategy associated with obtaining properties for the installation of its mining farms. 100% of annual revenue comes from Bitcoin mining, with no other sources of income currently. Iris is analyzing about expanding its business towards offering high computing solutions for other clients, although it is still a statement rather than something that translates into concrete actions. For now, the company's latest movements refer to small expansions in its feeding capabilities, as well as the development of the project in the United States to improve its performance. With that about the business model, I believe that the company could receive significant attention in the coming years given the expectations of other analysts. According to the information given by Seeking Alpha, analysts are expecting significant EPS increases in 2024 and 2025. Source: Seeking Alpha Growing Amount Of Assets And Cash, And No Financial Debt I think that the most remarkable thing about the company is the recent increase in the total amount of assets and cash. In December 2023, the company reported $90 million in cash, close to 33% more than that in June 2023. The total amount of property and equipment also increased close to 9%, and total assets stood at about $417 million, about 26% more than that in June 2023. Source: Investor Relations Presentation It is worth noting that the company does not report financial debt. With a healthy asset/liability ratio and given the increase in assets, Iris Energy could receive a lot of attention from market participants. As a result, I believe that we could see a decrease in the WACC as the cost of equity may decrease. Under my best-case scenario, I assumed a WACC of 9.5%. Source: Investor Relations Presentation The Company Sells The Bitcoin It Mines, Which May Offer Liquidity To Reinvest In Data Centers. Within Iris's business strategy, the company seeks to liquidate all Bitcoin values ​​obtained in one day, through the Kraken trading platform, which means that it does not have a positive liquidity balance in this sense. At present, the horizons are set on expanding its revenues into new markets, expanding the offer of high-performance computing services for clients in industrial or technological fields. To date we have utilized Kraken, a U.S.-based digital asset trading platform, to liquidate the Bitcoin we mine. The mining pools that we utilize for the purposes of our Bitcoin mining transfer the Bitcoin that we have mined to Kraken on a daily basis. Source: Prospectus Given the recent increase in the mining operations, I would expect a further increase in cash in hand. During the month of March, income in this sense grew by 57%, with a mining average of 7.3 EH/s , currently operating at 8 EH/s. Source: Investor Relations Presentation Data Center Expansion Will Most Likely Bring Capacity Increases, And Could Lead To 20 EH/s And Net Income Growth In 2024, the company noted that Childress Phase 1 and Childress Phase 2 could bring the company's operating figures to close to 20 EH/s. Optimized data center design could bring better figures than expected, so I believe that many investors will most likely be looking at Iris Energy in the coming years. Source: Investor Relations Presentation Among the different figures given recently, I believe that the following table is worth having a look at. With the new projects under construction in Texas, USA, total capacity stands at close to 2.160 MW. Under my best-case scenario, thanks to new capacity, I assumed that receipt from Bitcoin mining will continue to grow at the double-digit. Source: Investor Relations Presentation AI Could Also Bring FCF Growth At the last NVIDIA conference, where top developers of artificial intelligence tools attended, the company was recognized for the capabilities of its data storage centers and an ongoing plan to negotiate to expand to new capacities. There are a lot of analysts noting that AI could help Iris after the purchase of 248 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Customer negotiations for new capacity are also in progress, so I believe that we could receive further news in the coming months. Source: Investor Relations Presentation According to a paper published by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, AI could be employed to diminish electricity consumption. Besides, different algorithms could also enhance profit generation. As a result, I believe that Iris Energy could see net income growth thanks to new AI technologies, and the power provided by the new 248 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In this regard, I invite investors to read the following lines. AI techniques can be employed by mining pools to choose which cryptocurrency to mine and which mining pool to join in order to reduce the electricity consumption and increase their profit based on historical data - Source I also found out that Iris Energy could be using the 248 NVIDIA H100 GPUs to select mining pools, and make forecasts about the value of the block reward. There is also a lot of research done about the price prediction of cryptocurrencies using AI techniques. They learned from data obtained from mining with 5 pools (AntPool, F2Pool, BTC.com, SlushPool and BatPool) for 40 consecutive days using AntMiner S5. The data included parameters related to the mining pools (e.g. hash distribution and reward sharing method) and other parameters specific to the miner (e.g. its hash rate and electricity cost) in addition to the current value of the currency and the value of the block reward. They concluded that their prospect theoretic approach predicted their profits more accurately than the expected utility approach. Source: Cryptocurrencies and Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and Opportunities, in IEEE Access, vol. 8, pp. The global Bitcoin Miner Market is expected to grow at close to 26.7% CAGR from now to 2029. Besides, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow at close to 28% CAGR. With these numbers in mind, I believe that Iris Energy could experience FCF growth or net income growth close to these figures. Under my best-case scenario, median receipt from Bitcoin mining activities stood at close to 14%. The global Bitcoin Miner market, valued at US$ 11,546.70 million in 2022, is projected to reach US$ 23,842.76 million by the end of 2029, exhibiting a robust CAGR of 26.7% between 2023 and 2029. Source: Intel Market Research The market size is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2030) of 28.46%, resulting in a market volume of US$826.70bn by 2030. Source: Statista Under My Best-Case Scenario, I Obtained Price/NAV Of 0.87x And Price Target Of $13 Per Share Under my best-case scenario, I assumed further increase in capacity higher than 20 EH/s from now to 2034. I also took into account the expected increase in the Bitcoin mining market and the current amount of cash, which may serve for further development of data centers. With other analysts expecting positive FCF in 2025 and 2026 FCF of close to $212 million. I believe that my figures are quite conservative. Also, note that I tried to use the same cash flow statement structure seen in the company's 20-F report. Source: Seeking Alpha Source: 20-F Under my best-case scenario, I assumed receipts from Bitcoin to be close to $460 million with 2034 growth close to 7%, and median receipts from Bitcoin growth from 2024 to 2034 were also assumed to be close to 14%. 2034 payments for electricity, suppliers, and employees are projected to be close to -$10 million, with $0.1 million in interest received, accompanied by $0.1 million in other income received. With this information, a CFO of $449 million is estimated. By deducting the capex of around $20 million, 2034 FCF close to $429 million is obtained. Source: Financial Expectations For the assessment of the valuation, I used the Price/NAV multiple , which appears to be one of the most remarkable multiples used these days in the Bitcoin industry. Under this case scenario, I obtained a price/NAV close to 0.87x with a WACC of 9.5%. The WACC is not far from the estimate used by other analysts. In crypto mining company valuation, P/NAV is the single most significant valuation statistic. The ""net asset value"" of a mining asset is its discounted future cash flows less its debt and cash on hand, also known as its net present value. Source Additionally, I made a model with a terminal multiple close to 8x, a WACC of 9.5%, and assuming net debt of close to -$90 million. The results include EV of $1.9 billion. The equity valuation would stand at $1.9 billion. Now, dividing the equity by 141 million shares outstanding, the implied fair price would be close to $13.5 per share. Source: My Expectations The Price/NAV Under My Worst-Case Scenario Could Reach 3x, And The Price Target Would Be $2.1 Under this case scenario, I used 2034 receipts from Bitcoin of $189 million, reflecting growth of -5%. When analyzing previous years, it is observed that the median growth is 7%. Payments for electricity, suppliers, and employees are projected to be close to -$61 million, while around $0.6 million in interest received is expected, accompanied by $2 million in other income received. Additionally, interest paid is expected to be not less than -$4 million. With this information, a CFO of $125 million is estimated. By deducting the capex of around $20 million, FCF close to $105 million is obtained. Source: Financial Expectations With a EV/FCF multiple of 7.9x, and a WACC of 10%, the equity would be close to $322 million. Dividing the equity by 141 million shares, the fair price per share would be $2.1. I also obtained a P/NAV close to 3x. Source: My Financial Expectations Competitors Within the Bitcoin mining market, there are many types of participants, from large numbers of individuals to major companies with activity and size similar to that of Iris. Bitfarms ( BITF ), Cipher Mining ( CIFR ), CleanSpark ( CLSK ), Hive Digital Technologies ( HIVE ), Hut 8 Mining Corp, Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and TeraWulf ( WULF ) are the main competitors in this sector in terms of domestic positions within the United States and North America. On the other hand, the high-performance computer industry is occupied by CoreWeave, FluidStack Ltd, Lambda Inc, Applied Digital Corporation (APLD) , and RunPod Inc. It must be considered that Iris is not directly providing services, rather it intends to guide part of the business in this sense. Risks Without a doubt, the fact that all of its income comes from Bitcoin mining suggests some risks in the collection regarding variations in the exchange rate, even when the company has its strategies to cover itself in this regard. On the other hand, of course, any serious disruption in the activity of this currency, regulations, price drops, or complications with Kraken, the trading platform used to change it to stable currencies, can generate complications for the company. Along with this, any possible disruption in its storage centers must be noted. The risks related to the foreign origin of the company and the legal conditions in which this activity is framed must not be taken for granted within this analysis, mainly regarding the tax situation in relation to the company and its reports in the SEC. Finally, changes in labor law, increases in the price of electricity, or lower receipts from Bitcoin than expected could bring lower FCF growth than expected. As a result, I believe that analysts may lower their expectations, which may lower the implied stock valuation of Iris Energy. Conclusion Considering recent expectations with respect to data center expansion, the target hash rate given of 20 EH/s expected for 2024, and the growth of the Bitcoin mining industry, Iris Energy could experience significant business growth. Also, assuming operating efficiency increases thanks to AI after the purchase of 248 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, I believe that future FCF growth and hash rate could accelerate in the coming years. Yes, there are risks coming from changes in the price of Bitcoin, changes in the labor law, or higher prices of electricity. However, I believe that there is more upside potential than downside risk in the current stock valuation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4685041-impact-of-ai-on-iris-energys-bitcoin-mining-success?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26202134.jpeg

A spokesperson for Anjarwalla's wife told CoinDesk that reports of the executive's arrest in Kenya and his extradition are false.  The wife of Nadeem Anjarwalla, an executive at Binance who was caught in the crypto exchange's scuffle with Nigeria, has denied reports of his arrest in Kenya and subsequent extradition back to Nigeria.  Nigerian authorities have found Anjarwalla in Kenya and are working with Kenyan authorities to bring the executive back to the country, Nigeria’s Daily Post reported last week, citing government sources. Nigerian newspaper The Punch reported on Monday, citing unnamed government sources, that Anjarwalla could be returned to Nigeria within the week via the international criminal police organization (INTERPOL).  However, a spokesperson for Anjarwalla's wife has dismissed the Punch report of his arrest as false.  CoinDesk has reached out to INTERPOL, Kenya’s foreign ministry and Nigeria’s police force for comment.  Anjarwalla was detained alongside another Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, in February, as Nigerian authorities accused the crypto exchange of manipulating the local exchange rate, tax evasion and money laundering.  Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan dual national, reportedly fled the country in March using a concealed Kenyan passport.

The exchange recently began offering index-linked meme-coin perpetuals with market maker Wintermute.  Woo X is claiming bragging rights for being the first cryptocurrency exchange to offer retail customers exposure to tokenized U.S. Treasury bills.  The yield-bearing product, unveiled on Monday, called RWA Earn Vaults (as in real-world assets) has been built in partnership with London-based institutional tokenization platform OpenTrade. The product's arrival was described as a “significant milestone” by Woo X Chief Operating Officer Willy Chuang.  “For the first time, retail users on a centralized exchange can invest in USDC real-world asset vaults, with U.S Treasury Bills as the underlying assets,” Chuang said in an email. “This initiative bridges a crucial gap between traditional financial securities and the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, offering our users an unprecedented opportunity to engage with low-risk, high-quality financial assets in a seamless, secure, and efficient manner.”  Tokenization – especially involving bank-grade assets like U.S. Treasuries – has become popular, partly in response to interest rate increases, and now dovetailing with the current crypto bull run. Last year, crypto investment platform Finblox said it was planning to offer retail users access to tokenized T-Bills.

This unprecedented windfall, amassed on April 20th, underscores a significant shift in the revenue dynamics of Bitcoin mining operations. Related Reading: Will Celestia (TIA) Hit $130? Analyst Makes Bold Prediction The meteoric rise in transaction fees serves as a bellwether for the evolving economic landscape of Bitcoin mining. As the network adapts to new market demands and technological advancements, transaction fees have emerged as a crucial revenue stream for miners. This trend is particularly noteworthy given the scheduled reductions in block rewards, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of Bitcoin’s economic model. According to glassnode, affected by the Runes minting activity, on April 20, Bitcoin miner revenue reached US$106.7 million, of which 75.444% came from network transaction fees, both reaching record highs. https://t.co/lVSyqn1UaE pic.twitter.com/xjkkTor2I9 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 21, 2024 Runes-Fueled Minting Spree Boosts Miner Revenue Driving this surge in profitability is a recent minting spree focused on Runes, a pivotal development that has left a tangible mark on the network’s dynamics. Reports indicate that a staggering 75% of the total profits stemmed from transaction fees, marking a new pinnacle in the distribution of revenue among BTC miners. Runes is similar to Ordinals; they both let users permanently store data directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, like an inscription etched in stone. But there’s a key distinction in what they store: Ordinals are one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, similar to fancy trading cards. Runes, on the other hand, are designed to act more like meme coins, those widely tradable and often humorous tokens that have been a recent craze in the crypto world. BTCUSD trading at $66,144 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com This paradigm shift in income composition underscores the growing importance of transaction fees as a vital income source, especially as block rewards face planned reductions in the context of Bitcoin’s halving system. This financial triumph comes amidst ongoing debates surrounding the sustainability and profitability of mining activities. With escalating energy demands and mounting regulatory scrutiny, the viability of mining operations has been called into question. However, the recent data paints a reassuring picture of the economic vitality of Bitcoin mining, demonstrating its resilience in the face of external pressures. Implications For Bitcoin’s Future Beyond the immediate financial gains, the surge in transaction fees holds profound implications for the future trajectory of Bitcoin. The unprecedented collection of fees signifies robust network activity and user engagement, indicating strong demand and utilization of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The authorities have not named the entities they see as unauthorized, but have asked users to quickly withdraw their assets.  Authorities in Thailand have decided to block “unauthorized” crypto platforms to increase the efficiency of law enforcement in solving the problem of online crime, according to an announcement on Friday.  After a meeting of the Technology Crime Prevention and Suppression Committee, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC was ordered to submit information on unauthorized digital asset service providers to the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society to block access to the platforms.  The SEC has considered the impact on users, and will give them time to manage their accounts before being unable to use the service, the announcement said.  “Therefore, the SEC requests users of the said platform to quickly withdraw their assets from the platform,” the announcement said. The Thai SEC also cited earlier decisions by nations like India and the Philippines in blocking unauthorized platforms.  Thailand’s regulators have been attempting to find the balance between supporting the crypto ecosystem and preventing fraud. On the one hand, it has allowed institutional investors and very high-net-worth individuals to invest in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and allowed retail investors to invest without limits in digital tokens backed by real estate or infrastructure, but on the other hand, it has said custodians need to have a contingency plan if something goes wrong.

The average bitcoin production cost post-halving is about $53,000.  Some miners are actively managing financial liabilities and are using excess cash to pay down debt, the report said.  Crypto miners may shift towards artificial intelligence (AI) in energy-secure locations following the bitcoin {{BTC}} halving due to the potential for higher revenue, CoinShares (CS) said in a report on Friday.  The quadrennial halving, which slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply by 50%, occurred on Friday evening.  Coinshares notes that mining companies like BitDigital (BTBT), Hive (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) are already generating income from AI. At the same time, TeraWulf (WULF) and Core Scientific (CORZ) have existing AI operations or plans to grow in the space.  “This trend suggests that bitcoin mining may increasingly move to stranded energy sites while investment in AI grows at more stable locations, authors led by James Butterfill wrote.  The miners will be faced with substantial cost increases as a result of the halving, with electricity and overall production costs almost doubling, the report said. Mining companies can try to mitigate these higher costs by optimizing energy costs, increasing mining efficiency and buying better-priced hardware.  “The weighted average cash cost of production in Q4 was approximately $29,500; post-halving, it is projected to be about $53,000,” the authors wrote. The average electricity cost of production in the fourth quarter was about $16,300 per bitcoin, which is expected to increase to around $34,900 post the halving.  The hashrate could rise to 700 exahash by 2025, according to the asset manager’s forecasts, but may drop by 10% after the halving as miners turn off unprofitable machines. Hash prices are expected to fall after the event to $53/ph/day.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  CoinShares notes that the miners are actively managing financial liabilities, and some are using excess cash to pay down debt.

The outage, triggered by networking issues among validators, briefly disrupted services within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, specifically the layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium. Kaal detailed the cause and the subsequent resolution of the problem, stating, “There was a temporary Shibarium outage caused because of networking issues amongst the validators. Network is back up and running now.” He also noted that while the primary network functionality has been restored, some ancillary services such as Shibariumscan or external Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) may continue to face disruptions until additional remedial steps are completed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Jumps On Growing Support From 1.4 Million Holders Kaal emphasized the importance of collaboration among infrastructure teams to enhance communication and streamline operations. He urged external teams working on infrastructure-level elements such as RPC to coordinate closely with the Shibarium team. “If you’re an external team working on infrastructure level for Shibarium (e.g., RPC, etc.), please reach out so that we can streamline comms with you over shared telegram / slack channels,” he said. There was a temporary shibarium outage caused because of networking issues amongst the validators. Network is back up and running now, some services like shibariumscan or external RPCs can still remain down until the steps provided are implemented. If you’re an external team… — Kaal (@kaaldhairya) April 22, 2024 Shiba Inu Price Unfaced The recent price movements of Shiba Inu (SHIB) show no impact of the Shibarium outage. The four-hour chart for SHIB/USD illustrates a symmetrical triangle pattern that has governed the asset’s movement over the past several weeks. Contrary to a direct bullish sentiment, the price initially broke to the downside of the triangle on April 12, which typically signals a looming downtrend. However, in a swift change of fortunes, SHIB found substantial support at the 100-day EMA and is now testing the extended lower trendline of the once-confining triangle. At present, the price has surpassed the crucial resistance-turned-support level marked by the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002472. Notably, SHIB is also trading above all EMA’s in the 4-hour chart. The 200 EMA (blue line) is currently serving as crucial support after the first attempt to break above the extended trendline (black) failed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Insider Reveals Top 5 Shibarium Investment Rules A decisive and sustained break above this level could invalidate the prior bearish breakout, positioning SHIB for a potential bullish move to the north. However, volume activity on the chart indicates a tempered trading environment, lacking the aggressive spikes typically associated with decisive breakouts. This could suggest that the market is in a state of contemplation, with traders awaiting further confirmation before committing to a clear directional bias. Lastly, the RSI sits at a reading of 67, which is just shy of the overbought threshold. This placement implies that there is room for upward movement before the market becomes overextended. If SHIB battles above the extended lower trendline, the case for an imminent surge grows stronger, potentially leading to a rally towards the Fibonacci levels of 0.382 ($0.00002867), 0.5 ($0.00003203) and 0.618 ($0.00003527).

While Ethereum layer 2 solutions mainly focus on scaling the Ethereum smart contract blockchain, Bitcoin Layer 2 projects aim to scale and introduce programmability features to the main blockchain, which doesn't operate an Ethereum-like virtual machine.  The market-beating move of Bitcoin layer 2 coins comes amid the post-halving surge in transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain. Data tracked by Glassnode show the mean transaction fee soared to nearly 0.0020 BTC after halving, reaching the highest since early 2018.  The spike in fees could be explained by the launch of a new protocol called Runes that allows users to“etch” and mint tokens on the Bitcoinblockchain. Runes' debut saw speculators rush to mint tokens and trade meme coins, catalyzing increased transaction activity and higher transaction costs.  According to data source Ord.io, the total number of Runes inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain was 3,700 at press time.",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | STX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/22/bitcoin-layer-2-coins-stx-ela-savm-outperform-btc-after-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d4b5bb5e779bfcf1eb3ba9e756edfd5210ab989-1680x1131.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Runes was supposed to be the tool that maintained fee revenue post-halving  Bitcoin {{BTC}} started the week stable, changing hands above $65,800, as transaction fees have significantly lowered following the halving.  On-chain data from Mempool.space shows that medium-priority transactions are now costing $8.48 while high-priority transactions cost $9.32.  In the initial aftermath of the halving, these fees spiked to over $146 for a medium-priority transaction and $170 for a high-priority transaction.  The hashprice index, a metric created by Luxor to quantify how much a miner can expect to earn from a specific quantity of hashrate, has also dropped from $182.98 per hash/day to $81, a level below where it was at pre-halving.  While bitcoin miners anticipated that the halving would significantly cut revenue, the introduction of Casey Rodarmor’s Runes protocol – designed to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin – which went live at the halving, was supposed to be the antidote to this, given the level of activity it would create on-chain.  Instead, in the initial days after the event, floor prices for the runestone NFT collection have dropped by almost 50% in the last 24 hours with a floor price of nearly 0.037 BTC, according to Magic Eden, while ordinal collections like Bitcoin Puppets and NodeMonkes are up 11% and 8% respectively according to CoinGecko data.  It should be noted that these ordinal collections also generate considerable transaction fees but don’t appear to be the same revenue source as many hoped Runes would be.

DOGE could struggle to clear the $0.170 resistance zone. DOGE started a recovery wave from the $0.1280 support zone against the US dollar. The price is trading above the $0.1500 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price must settle above $0.170 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge. Dogecoin Price Faces Hurdles After a major decline, Dogecoin price found support at $0.1280. A low was formed at $0.1283 and DOGE started a decent recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.1350 and $0.140 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.2093 swing high to the $0.1283 low. However, the bears are still active and protecting more gains. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin is also below the $0.1650 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.1690 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.2093 swing high to the $0.1283 low. Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $0.170 level. A close above the $0.170 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1880 resistance. The next major resistance is near $0.200. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.220 level. Another Decline in DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.170 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1525 level. The next major support is near the $0.1475 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.1750 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1280 level. Technical Indicators 4 Hours MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. 4 Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.
