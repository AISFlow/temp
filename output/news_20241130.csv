37067542,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372774,1733010336,"Stablecoins Remain 1% of US Money Supply, FX Market but Experts Predict 10x Growth","With a current market cap of less than $200 billion, stablecoins represent a tiny fraction of global financial transactions – just 1% of US money supply and foreign exchange operations. However, a joint report by Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets research suggests significant growth potential, with experts projecting expansion to 10% of the US money supply (M2) and foreign exchange (FX) transactions. Regulation Could Unlock Stablecoins’ Full Potential According to the report titled ‘Stablecoins: The First Killer App,’ the utility of stablecoins has evolved well beyond their original role in cryptocurrency trading. Initially used as a bridge asset for trading, stablecoins are increasingly employed in cross-border payments, payroll, trade settlements, and remittances. These applications demonstrate their ability to address inefficiencies in existing financial systems, such as high costs, delayed transaction times, and limited accessibility in underserved regions. By providing faster and cheaper transactions, stablecoins offer a compelling solution for international remittances and business operations, positioning themselves as a pivotal tool in modern finance. The analysis also highlighted the implications of stablecoin adoption for the broader financial ecosystem. At present, stablecoins’ total market capitalization is dwarfed by the $21 trillion US M2 and $2.1 trillion in daily FX spot transactions. However, achieving a 10% share could transform them into a dominant force in global finance, thereby reshaping the landscape of digital payments and settlements. Regulation is seen as the key to this transition. While previous US administrations have made little progress in establishing stablecoin-specific policies, the report suggests that a Trump-led government in 2025 might prioritize these efforts. In fact, this regulatory clarity is expected to unlock stablecoins’ full potential, enabling them to scale and diversify their use cases further. Stablecoin Adoption Soars in Emerging Markets Geographically, USD-backed stablecoins dominate the market, comprising 99.3% of current stablecoin market capitalization. Tether (USDT) leads with a 73% market share, followed by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) at 21%. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered’s Thursday report cited a YouGov survey that found compelling use cases. Across five emerging markets – Brazil, Turkey, Nigeria, India, and Indonesia – it was observed that 69% of respondents use stablecoins for currency substitution, while 39% employ them for cross-border payments and goods and services transactions.

Qubetics Could Be Your Best Crypto to Invest In Amid Toncoin’s Evolution and Stellar’s Cross-Border Mastery,"Every day, we see new innovations reshaping how we interact with finance, technology, and even our daily lives. But with so many coins out there, it’s easy to wonder: which ones are worth it? Two cryptos are making waves for their unique functionalities and solid potential among the sea of digital assets. Toncoin has emerged as a leader in blockchain-based communications, offering seamless integrations for messaging platforms. Stellar, meanwhile, continues to innovate in cross-border transactions, providing fast and affordable financial solutions. But let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS)—the rising star that’s redefining the Web3 space. With an ecosystem that boasts groundbreaking tech like a decentralised VPN (dVPN) and an electrifying presale that’s got analysts predicting jaw-dropping returns, this one’s making serious excitement. This article will dive into Qubetics, Toncoin, and Stellar to help you discover your next top crypto to invest in. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Privacy and Security Qubetics is setting a new standard in Web3 infrastructure with its revolutionary decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralised systems that can log user data, censor access, or even suffer from single points of failure, Qubetics flips the script. Its dVPN runs on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network where no central authority has control. What does that mean for you? Total freedom and privacy online. Your data is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring anonymity while bypassing censorship. Multi-hop routing shields your internet traffic through multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace. Even better, Qubetics incentivises users to share the bandwidth by rewarding them with $TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining marketplace where security meets economic opportunity. In short, it’s not just a VPN; it’s a game-changer for online privacy. Toncoin: Redefining Blockchain-Based Communications Toncoin, the brainchild of the Telegram Open Network, is making strides in integrating blockchain and communication technologies. Built to complement messaging platforms, it enables seamless payments, smart contracts, and decentralised applications within the ecosystem. Its focus on scalability and ease of use has positioned it as a leader in the evolving crypto landscape. For those interested in projects that combine practicality with innovation, Toncoin is worth keeping an eye on. Stellar: The Powerhouse of Cross-Border Transactions Stellar continues to prove its value in the world of decentralised finance, specifically for cross-border payments. By offering a blockchain-based solution that’s fast, affordable, and inclusive, Stellar has created a platform that connects financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Whether you’re sending remittances or managing business transactions, Stellar’s network ensures low fees and reliable speeds. It’s a solid contender for anyone seeking the top cryptos. Early Bird Wins! Qubetics Presale Offers Massive Growth Potential If you’ve ever dreamed of catching the next big crypto before it takes off, here’s your chance. Right now, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.025 during the presale. Imagine this: $1,000 today gets you a whopping 40,000 $TICS tokens. Now, let’s talk numbers—because they’re wild. Analysts are predicting that $TICS could skyrocket to $10 in the near future. That means your $1,000 investment could balloon to $400,000—an astonishing ROI of 39,900%. And if it climbs even higher to $15? You’re looking at $600,000, with an ROI of 59,900%. These aren’t just numbers; they’re life-changing possibilities. But here’s the kicker—presales like this don’t last forever. The early bird gets the worm, and in this case, the worm might just be a golden ticket to your financial freedom. If you’re hunting for the top crypto to invest in , Qubetics should be on your radar. Conclusion: Which Crypto Will Shape Your Future? The right investment today could transform your tomorrow. Toncoin is innovating communication, Stellar is revolutionising cross-border finance, and Qubetics is pioneering Web3 privacy and security. Each has its strengths and potential to deliver significant returns. But if you’re looking for excitement, unparalleled potential, and a chance to be part of something transformative, Qubetics stands out. Its dVPN is set to reshape how we think about online privacy, and its presale is the kind of opportunity that investors dream about. Don’t wait—grab your share of $TICS tokens and secure your place in the next big crypto story. The future is here, and Qubetics is leading the charge.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/sheikh-musk-shemusk-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-16000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Heavyweights like $FIL (+19.67%) and $WLD (+26.08%) are dominating the spotlight, but the AI crypto sector, once dormant, has now awakened with a vengeance. Yesterday, we delved into Fetch.ai ($FET – link here ), showcasing its potential to redefine the AI blockchain sector. Today, the spotlight shifts to Render Network ( $RNDR )—the "" Nvidia of blockchain computing."" With Ethereum ($ETH ) approaching 0.040 BTC , signaling a potential altseason breakout, Render is gearing up to test its $10 psychological barrier, a critical level for reclaiming its March 2024 highs. Let’s dissect the setup for this fascinating AI infrastructure project and its roadmap toward a potential breakout. Render Network’s Core Value Proposition Render Network decentralizes GPU rendering by connecting creators and GPU node operators, leveraging blockchain technology to monetize idle computing power. It’s tailor-made for the growing AI-driven content creation sector. Key Metrics: Circulating Supply: 517.69M Market Cap: $4.69B Max Supply: 644.17M Render boasts strong tokenomics with minimal inflation risks. Coupled with its real-world utility in GPU rendering and AI applications, $RNDR is uniquely positioned to ride the next wave of AI and crypto adoption. Technical Breakdown: Where Are We Now? 1W Chart: The Battle for $10 The weekly chart shows a methodical recovery from its August 2024 lows at $3.40, a spring point in a textbook Wyckoff Accumulation schematic. Key Support Levels: The $6.90-$7.15 zone aligns with the 50W MA ($6.95) and previous resistance turned support, forming a strong base for accumulation. Critical Resistance Zones: $8.30-$9.90: Render is currently battling within this range, a pivotal zone left by March’s explosive “God Candle.” $10: The psychological threshold where confidence will either surge or falter. $13.85: The all-time high, a likely target for bulls once $10 is conquered. RSI: Slightly above 60, indicating momentum without overextension. Volume & Momentum: Weekly volumes are picking up post-U.S. election but remain below November 2023 levels, leaving room for explosive moves. As the 50W MA rises, dynamic support strengthens, increasing the probability of long-term upside. 1D Chart: The Anatomy of a Breakout Render’s daily chart highlights precise technical developments: Golden Cross Incoming: The 50D MA ($6.06) is set to cross above the 200D MA ($6.63), signaling the return of a long-term bullish trend. Dynamic Supports: The $6.90-$7.15 zone continues to align with horizontal support, bolstered by diminishing pullback volumes and volume spikes on breakouts. Battle for $10: Price is testing this psychological level, with RSI confirming strength. A breakout above $10 could trigger Price Discovery Mode. Explosive Rhetoric Alert: A clean break above $10 may lead to quick leg-ups toward $12 and $13.85, but volatility remains a factor—so patience is key. Render vs. Bitcoin (RNDR/BTC): Relative Strength Render’s BTC pairing highlights its relative outperformance: Support Flip: Render flipped 322 SATs (50W MA) into support, with minimal resistance toward 380 SATs. Volume Profile: Minimal resistance above current levels signals potential for accelerated price movement relative to Bitcoin. 3 Key Takeaways from Both Charts Consolidation Zones Building Momentum: Both charts highlight Render consolidating within major resistance zones ($8.30-$9.90), setting the stage for an explosive move. Golden Cross & Wyckoff Spring: The upcoming Golden Cross and Wyckoff Accumulation spring ($3.40 lows) are powerful confluences, signaling a strong bullish setup. Dynamic Supports Rising: Fast-rising moving averages bolster $6.90-$7.15 as a high-probability entry point for disciplined traders. 3 Entry Strategies for $RNDR 1. Closing Above $10 Rating: 8/10 – ""Parabolic Potential."" Rationale: A confirmed close above $10 signals strength and Price Discovery Mode, targeting $12 and $13.85. Stop Loss: $9.50 – Manage volatility. Advice: Wait for volume confirmation. Without it, false breakouts can be devastating. Take Profit Levels: $12.00-$12.50 – Immediate resistance zone. $13.85 – March ATH. $15-$16 – Short-term overshoot. 2. $6.90-$7.15 Zone (Dynamic + Horizontal Support) Rating: 9/10 – ""Solid Foundation."" Rationale: A confluence of horizontal support and the fast-rising 50W MA ($6.95). Stop Loss: $5.80 – Wide enough to avoid noise. Advice: Use laddered entries and monitor price action. Institutions are likely accumulating here. Take Profit Levels: $10-$11.95 – Psychological & technical resistance. $13.85 – March ATH. $20+ – If the trend accelerates. 3. $5.90-$5.00 (Stink Order Zone) Rating: 7/10 – ""Patience Pays Dividends."" Rationale: Flash crash levels aligned with historical pivot points and rising dynamic support. Stop Loss: $4.50 or monitor live. Advice: These levels are rare opportunities but require patience. Take Profit Levels: $8-$9.90 – Quick recovery zone. $11.95-$12 – Pre-ATH levels. $13.85+ – Aiming for the moon. Optimistic 2025 Targets Triple Market Cap Target: $27-$30 – A realistic target if Render triples its market cap. Parabolic Blow-Off Top: $50-$60 – The speculative climax of a 2025 bull run, driven by AI hype. Summary: The Battle for $10 Render’s battle for $10 is more than psychological—it’s the gateway to reclaiming its ATH and entering Price Discovery Mode. A clean break, supported by volume, could trigger the next leg up in its bullish cycle. Key Takeaways: Accumulate Smart: Focus on strong support zones like $6.90-$7.15. Don’t Chase Pumps: Wait for confirmations. Execute Strategically: Stick to your plan—volatile markets reward discipline. As November’s ""Moonvember"" comes to a close, here’s to another spectacular month ahead. Stay disciplined, and get ready for the next AI coin spotlight: Opulous ( $OPUL )—a project with even bigger potential than Render.

It is designed to be fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, XRP makes transactions irreversible and secure. It does not require a bank account for settlements, allowing for seamless transfers across different currencies. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled supply release. The name XRP, derived from ""ripple credits,"" reflects its aim to facilitate smooth payment transfers worldwide. Exploring ADA: Cardano's Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It helps developers make decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. ADA is its native cryptocurrency. Like Ethereum's ETH, ADA lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This is different from energy-heavy proof-of-work models. The blockchain has two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This setup can boost transaction processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. Cardano's native tokens allow secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Conclusion While XRP and ADA have been influential in the crypto arena, their short-term growth potential appears limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities. By utilizing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO maximizes earnings. Its features include attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Users enjoy a superior experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project. It has attracted strong interest from crypto whales and influencers, positioning itself at the forefront of the market.

37065229,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655900,1733005852,XRP Breaks Multi-Year Resistance – Main Target Remains $2,"XRP has broken through a key resistance level, reaching price points not seen since its multi-year highs set in 2021. The cryptocurrency has been on an aggressive upward trajectory for over three weeks, signaling strong bullish momentum in the market. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring XRP’s price action, as it shows no signs of slowing down. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a compelling technical analysis, suggesting that XRP is poised to reach the $2 mark in the near future. His analysis highlights XRP’s robust breakout above critical resistance levels, supported by strong trading volume and positive market sentiment. Martinez believes this momentum could propel the token to achieve its next significant milestone much faster than anticipated. As the altcoin market continues to flourish, XRP stands out as one of the top-performing assets , drawing increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether XRP can sustain its bullish pace and surpass further resistance levels. With technical indicators aligning with optimistic projections, XRP appears ready to continue its ascent, cementing its place as a leading cryptocurrency in this market cycle. XRP Testing Past Cycle’s Top XRP has reached an impressive $1.93, testing critical supply levels that marked the top of its last cycle. In 2021, Ripple was entangled in legal challenges with the SEC, creating uncertainty for the cryptocurrency. However, the landscape has shifted significantly since then, with Ripple gaining favorable momentum in the lawsuit and renewed investor confidence, propelling XRP to new heights. Martinez has provided an optimistic outlook, sharing a technical analysis on X that suggests XRP will likely surpass the $2 milestone soon. Martinez identifies this level as a key target as the cryptocurrency’s momentum builds. The price of XRP has surged by over 280% in less than a month, reflecting the strength of its current uptrend. Analysts are closely monitoring whether XRP can break above the psychological $2 mark, a level that would signal a continuation of its rally toward multi-year highs. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is further supported by increasing trading volume and strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. As the token approaches multi-year highs, the focus shifts to whether it can sustain this rally and break through the crucial resistance zone. For now, XRP continues to show remarkable resilience and upward potential, positioning itself as a standout performer in the crypto market. Technical Details XRP is trading at $1.93, following a remarkable 16% surge yesterday and an additional 7% rise today. The cryptocurrency continues its aggressive push toward the critical $2 level, capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. This sustained rally reflects growing confidence in XRP’s potential as it tests supply zones that once marked last cycle’s peak. Despite the bullish momentum, there’s a strong possibility that XRP may consolidate below the $2 mark for a few days. Such a pause could set the stage for a more explosive move as the broader crypto market gears up for a potential breakout. Historically, consolidations at key resistance levels often precede significant price rallies, and the current setup aligns with this pattern. XRP’s aggressive break above the $1.62 level was a pivotal moment, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the market. Many investors now expect XRP to challenge and surpass its previous cycle’s all-time high (ATH), setting the stage for a new price discovery phase. With momentum on its side and increasing interest from both retail and institutional players, XRP’s path forward could redefine its position in the market, marking a significant milestone in its price journey.

Initially designed as a three-year initiative, the company could achieve this goal in four months, thanks to its aggressive purchasing pace. This bold move is set to transform MicroStrategy’s financial future, with the company betting big on assets’ long-term value . Michael Saylor’s Strategy: A Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin journey began in August 2020, and the company has consistently made headlines with its purchases. This month alone, the firm spent $12 billion on BTC, including its most recent purchase. On Nov. 11, the company purchased 27,200 BTC for $2 billion, followed by another $4.6 billion worth of BTC on Nov.18 . Five days ago, the firm acquired another 55,500 BTC for $5.4 billion. These purchases are part of a strategy to consolidate its position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy follows a plan to acquire more Bitcoin, reflecting the vision of its executive chairman, Michael Saylor. With its latest acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 386,700 BTC, valued at nearly $22 billion at the current market price. MicroStrategy is willing to invest its financial resources in the acquisition of BTC. The company funded one of its latest Bitcoin purchases by leveraging its at-the-market share issuance program. To raise the required capital, MicroStrategy sold about 13.6 million shares. MicroStrategy Bet Big on Bitcoin, the Future of Digital Gold MicroStrategy’s approach also underscores its firm belief that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset. The firm believes BTC is a transformative financial instrument with the potential to reshape global finance. By accumulating over 380,000 BTC, the company has positioned Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its treasury reserve strategy . It is treating it as “digital gold,” a store of value that can withstand inflation and economic uncertainty. With Bitcoin trading near $100,000, MicroStrategy’s investment has more than doubled in value, turning its holdings into a formidable financial asset. However, this strategy has significant risks. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, with price swings that can lead to substantial losses as quickly as gains. Despite the risks, MicroStrategy’s bold moves have captivated attention. Crypto enthusiasts see the company as a pioneer and a symbol of Bitcoin’s growing mainstream adoption.

Polkadot (DOT): Enabling Secure Inter-Blockchain Communication Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that allows different blockchains to communicate securely. It enables value and data sharing between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, letting holders help develop the protocol and verify transactions. Developed by Gavin Wood and launched in May 2020, Polkadot aims for a future where blockchains are more connected and efficient. In the current market cycle, DOT's technology and potential for interoperability make it an attractive option for users and investors. Understanding Polygon (POL): Scaling Ethereum with Lower Fees and Faster Transactions Polygon is a layer two scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to make transactions faster and fees lower. It operates alongside Ethereum, allowing users to move assets to access many applications at reduced costs. POL is Polygon's native cryptocurrency, used for network fees, staking, and governance. The platform uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, enabling users to earn rewards by staking their tokens. Validators secure the network and process transactions, while delegators can stake their POL through trusted validators. Polygon's efficiency and low fees make it an attractive platform for engaging with DeFi protocols and other applications. In the current market cycle, the technology shows potential to enhance Ethereum's scalability and accessibility. Conclusion As DOT and POL offer less short-term potential, investors turn to DOGEN—a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by presale's end and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, offering real benefits and building a community of market leaders.

Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. It started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB's profile. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for NFT platforms and decentralized governance. These features contribute to its potential appeal in the current market cycle. Solana (SOL) A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana emphasizes faster transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency SOL is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network. The SOL coin underpins the operation of the ecosystem, allowing users access to various projects on Solana. With its technological approach, Solana has gained attention in the current market cycle for hosting high-activity products and services. Conclusion With the bull run of 2024 here, SHIB and SOL may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out as a token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of presale, it follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat.

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: The Meme Coin Turned Top Cryptocurrency Dogecoin, launched in 2013 by software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, began as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute, making it abundant. Initially considered a ""memecoin,"" it gained significant value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, surpassing $50 billion. This surge was influenced by social media attention and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's rise demonstrates the influence of community and social media on the cryptocurrency market. Its technology and widespread recognition contribute to ongoing interest, though its future in the current market cycle remains a topic of discussion among investors. PEPE Memecoin: Embracing the Pepe the Frog Phenomenon on Ethereum PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched without transaction taxes and embracing a lack of utility, PEPE maintains a pure memecoin identity. In mid-2023, it achieved a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, igniting a memecoin frenzy and building a vibrant community. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. Unique features like a burning mechanism enhance scarcity, while a redistribution system rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake security. Its presence on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin makes it accessible to many. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to engage crypto enthusiasts. Conclusion In the 2024 bull run, DOGEN stands out amid the lesser short-term potential of DOGE and PEPE. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN anticipates 700% growth by the presale's end, with possible thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. It started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB's profile. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for NFT platforms and decentralized governance. These features contribute to its potential appeal in the current market cycle. Stellar (XLM): A Decentralized Network for Global Fund Transfers Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized blockchain network enabling quick, low-cost global fund transfers. It supports any currency, including national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Since 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. Unlike cryptocurrencies that aim to replace financial systems, Stellar connects them, offering a unified network for collaboration. Individuals can transfer funds worldwide using Stellar apps. Businesses can develop blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency conversion. The Stellar Development Foundation promotes network use, including NFT creation and smart contracts. With its focus on enhancing existing systems, Stellar's technology shows potential in the current market cycle. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain for Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that employs fiat-pegged stablecoins to enable price-stable global payment systems. Launched in April 2019, it merges the price stability of traditional currencies with the censorship resistance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Terra Classic offers fast and affordable settlements using stablecoins pegged to various currencies, including the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was rebranded to Terra Classic after launching a new chain named Terra (LUNA). The platform's technology aims to enhance financial accessibility by providing a decentralized system for global payments, leveraging blockchain to facilitate efficient and stable transactions worldwide. PEPE Memecoin: Embracing the Pepe the Frog Phenomenon on Ethereum PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched without transaction taxes and embracing a lack of utility, PEPE maintains a pure memecoin identity. In mid-2023, it achieved a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, igniting a memecoin frenzy and building a vibrant community. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. Unique features like a burning mechanism enhance scarcity, while a redistribution system rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake security. Its presence on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin makes it accessible to many. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to engage crypto enthusiasts. Conclusion Although SHIB, XLM, LUNC, and PEPE may become well-known by 2025, their short-term potential seems limited. In contrast, DOGEN is crafted for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential for massive returns, it builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

Helium (HNT) Price Prediction, Eyes on 18% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News HNT, the native token of Helium, a blockchain-based network and leading DePIN token is poised for a notable upside rally as it has formed a bullish price action pattern. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT has broken out of a consolidation zone that it formed after breaking out of a falling channel price action pattern. This consolidation breakout has shifted the overall sentiment for HNT toward the bullish side. Source: Trading View Based on historical price momentum, the recent price action which began with a breakout followed by consolidation, is considered one of the more successful patterns. Following this development, there is a strong possibility that HNT could soar by 18% to reach the $8.10 level in the coming days. On the positive side, HNT’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential upside rally in the coming days, as its current value stands at 60, below the overbought mark of 70. Bullish on-Chain Metrics However, HNT’s bullish price action appears to have attracted significant trader interest over the past 24 hours, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Rising Open interest Recent data shows that HNT’s open interest (OI) has surged by 31% in the last 24 hours and 9.2% in the past four hours. This growing OI reflects traders’ strong confidence and interest in the top DePIN token amid a bullish price action pattern. HNT Spot Inflow/OUt flow In addition to traders, whales and long-term holders are providing further support for this altcoin, as revealed by the Coinglass data center. According to HNT spot inflow/outflow data from exchanges since the beginning of November 2024, there has been a significant outflow from exchanges. Source: Coinglass The data also shows that, out of the past 30 days, exchanges experienced inflows on only 7 days, with the remaining 23 days marked by continuous outflows. This trend suggests that whales have significantly accumulated HNT tokens over the past month, during which the HNT price has remained stable. Current Price Momentum At press time, HNT is trading near $7.20 and has experienced a price surge of over 10.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has increased by 50%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid a bullish market outlook.",POSITIVE,HNT,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | HNT,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/breakout-alert-helium-hnt-price-prediction-eyes-on-18-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once only available to a few. By using blockchain, Ondo makes financial systems better and more accessible to everyone. It has two main parts: one creates tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to make these products more functional and scalable. In a market that's often uncertain, Ondo stands out by focusing on trust and security. It works with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase to keep crypto assets safe. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and follows legal and regulatory rules closely. One of its key products, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but offers yields. It's backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, giving it stability. For non-US investors, this means access to top-quality, regulated, and clear financial products. With the current interest in secure and transparent crypto options, Ondo's approach could appeal to many looking for reliable investments in the blockchain space. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is turning heads in the blockchain world. It's a Layer-1 platform that's eco-friendly, boasts low fees, and processes transactions at lightning speed—up to 4,500 per second. One standout feature is its ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility and scalability. Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, ensuring transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. The platform operates with three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which handle different tasks like transactions and smart contract execution. AVAX serves as the backbone of the Avalanche ecosystem. It's used for paying transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and powering multiple Subnets. This strong utility positions AVAX well in the current market. With the growing demand for fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Avalanche stands out among competitors. Its eco-friendly approach and rapid transaction times address key challenges in the industry. While markets are always shifting, Avalanche's technology and versatility make it a noteworthy player in today's crypto landscape. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects these digital agreements to real-world data. This means a smart contract can access information like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink does this through a network of oracles, which are like messengers that bring data from outside sources to the blockchain. They use a reputation system to make sure the data is accurate and reliable. In the current market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a big problem: getting real-world data onto blockchains. This makes smart contracts more useful and opens up new possibilities. Unlike many other coins that focus on payments, Chainlink focuses on data and functionality. Its token, LINK, rewards those who provide data and helps secure the network. As more businesses look to use blockchain technology, the demand for Chainlink's services could grow. This unique approach makes LINK an interesting option to watch in today's market. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain platform that puts security first. It's designed to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a trustworthy choice for institutions and developers. With MANTRA, you get a blockchain that's open to everyone but can also support applications that need special permissions. This means businesses can build on MANTRA without worrying about breaking any rules. What makes MANTRA stand out is its strong technology foundation. It's built using the Cosmos SDK, which means it's compatible with other blockchains and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, so it's ready for large-scale use. Plus, it offers tools to create and manage assets that comply with regulations. In today's market, where many are looking for secure and compliant blockchain solutions, OM, the coin of MANTRA, looks promising. It could be a strong competitor to other coins that don't focus on regulatory compliance, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion While ONDO, AVAX, LINK, and OM are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a groundbreaking memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the 2024 bull run.

37063691,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620524,1733002225,"Justin Trudeau meets Donald Trump, unsure if Tariffs are off","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is still unsure if tariffs are off after a lengthy meeting with United States President-elect Donald Trump. According to reports, the meeting finished without Trump specifically saying he would hand off every tariff move he intended to make after being sworn in as president next year. Donald Trump has been vocal about his intentions to levy tariffs on specific countries, especially those with trading agreements with the country. Although Trump views the meeting as ‘productive’, he remains unsold on the idea of abandoning his tariff plans. Canada, on the other hand, has been lumped into the same category as countries like Mexico due to the increased flow of migrants and drugs into the United States. Justin Trudeau and Trump confirms positive conversations After the meeting between both leaders, positive intonations were echoed from both parties. While Trudeau described their conversation as ‘excellent’, Donald Trump said in a lengthy post on Trust Social that they discussed several topics they need to cooperate to tackle. Trump mentioned that one of the issues that needs to be addressed is fentanyl and the drug cartel that had destroyed many lives after entering the country illegally. Trump also confirmed they discussed fair trade deals that will not harm the American working population and the United States trade deficit with its supporters in the North. Trump revealed that Trudeau showed his commitment to helping the United States end the fentanyl menace that had destroyed many families. He said the Prime Minister assured him that the country will end the movement of fentanyl through its border into America. Donald Trump had planned a 25% tax on products entering the country’s borders from Canada and Mexico, a law that will take effect when he assumes office. The fentanyl scourge, without a doubt, has been America’s bane, with the country’s agents seizing 43 pounds of the product at the Canadian border. In addition, it also seized 21,100 pounds of the banned product at Mexico’s border. Detailing immigration numbers, border patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October while 23,731 individuals were arrested at the Canadian border from October 2023 to September 2024. However, Canadian officials mentioned new investments in security at its border to prevent these issues from happening. Trudeau details the implications of Trump’s tariff posts According to an anonymous source with inside knowledge, Justin Trudeau initiated the meeting with Trump following the latter’s post concerning Tariffs on Monday. The source mentioned that officials in other countries are interested in how the meeting was arranged, asking for advice. During the dinner, which sources said lasted about three hours, the officials talked about different topics including energy, and trade. The statement from Trudeau’s office mentioned productive discussions. Although Trump had bad words for the Canadian Prime Minister during his first tenure, Trudeau was the first to congratulate him. Before the meeting, Trudeau noted that Trump did not talk about tariffs during his campaign but suddenly wants to add 25% to the costs of goods coming into the country. He said that he feels Trump is serious about the tariff, noting that if the American president-elect says he wants to do something, nothing is stopping him. However, he pointed out that the move could hurt Americans and Canadians. “Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,” he said. If Trump goes ahead with the Tariff move, it could prove costly, destroying the trade pact both countries signed during his first term in office. However, Trudeau mentioned that they were able to renegotiate a deal, saying it was a win for both countries. During his first spell as president, Trump imposed higher tariffs and other countries cranked up theirs too. Canada announced billions in new duties against America in response to taxes on steel and aluminum from the country. Canada is the top export destination for most of the US states, accounting for $2.7 billion worth of goods every day. Canada is trade-dependent, with 77% of its goods being moved into the United States.

During the same period, fraud and rug pulls fell significantly, contributing to just $25,300 in total losses across two incidents. According to the latest report by Immunefi shared with CryptoPotato , decentralized finance (DeFi) was the primary victim, with $71 million in total losses recorded in November. This was the second-lowest monthly figure of the year and a stark improvement from the $343 million lost during the same period in 2023. Meanwhile, centralized finance (CeFi) reported no incidents for the month. Despite the decline, Immunefi said that the sector has reemerged as a “prime target” for hackers. Nearly 50% of YTD losses – totaling $724 million – stemmed from CeFi breaches. This is in sharp contrast to recent years when such attacks have declined. In Q3 2024 alone, CeFi hacks accounted for 72% of all losses, with a single incident at India’s WazirX exchange costing $235 million. Infrastructure vulnerabilities, especially those involving hot wallets, make these breaches particularly catastrophic. Just nine CeFi attacks this year caused as much damage as 200 DeFi breaches. Hackers have resorted to refining their strategies, employing techniques such as impersonating recruiters or planting fake hires to penetrate security systems. The rise in these sophisticated attacks highlights a growing threat that often remains unnoticed until significant damage is done. Zooming out, among the targeted blockchain networks, BNB Chain suffered the most significant impact, with 14 separate attacks accounting for 46.7% of November’s total losses. Ethereum followed with nine incidents, contributing to 30% of the month’s losses. On the other hand, Solana, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Aptos each experienced one attack, collectively representing 3.3% per chain. Year-to-date (YTD), the ecosystem has endured losses totaling $1.49 billion across 209 incidents, with May and July being the most devastating months, recording losses exceeding $359 million and $282 million, respectively.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB), inspired by Dogecoin, emerged in August 2020 with a new twist on meme coins. Created by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum's vast ecosystem. Starting with a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. His donation of SHIB to the India Covid Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the supply boosted SHIB's profile in the crypto world. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB leverages Ethereum's capabilities, enabling decentralized apps like ShibaSwap, its own exchange. Plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance showcase SHIB's potential beyond being a meme coin. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), SHIB's Ethereum integration positions it well within these trends. In the current market, SHIB's active development and strong community support may attract those interested in emerging Ethereum projects. However, as with any cryptocurrency, buyers should exercise caution and do thorough research. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a memecoin launched on Ethereum to honor Pepe the Frog, the internet meme created by Matt Furie. It aims to join the likes of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as a top meme-based cryptocurrency. With no taxes and a candid approach about its lack of utility, PEPE keeps things simple, appealing to meme enthusiasts. In late April to May 2023, its market cap soared to $1.6 billion, turning early investors into millionaires and building a strong community. This surge sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with other memecoins experiencing wild price swings. PEPE's roadmap includes getting listed on CoinMarketCap, trending on Twitter, and securing spots on centralized exchanges, aiming for a ""meme takeover."" As the crypto market anticipates the Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE showcases the potential of memecoins. Its rapid rise and dedicated community set it apart from other memecoins. For those fascinated by the meme coin trend, PEPE offers an interesting opportunity in the current market cycle. Bonk (BONK) BONK, a new player in the crypto world, is turning heads. This Solana-based memecoin, with its Shiba Inu mascot, aims to shake up the scene by shifting power from big investors to the community. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK's value soared over 100%. What's more, it handed out half of its total supply to participants in Solana's NFTs and DeFi projects. By mid-December 2023, it had become the third-largest memecoin by market cap and saw an astonishing year-to-date growth of over 10,000%. Despite the challenges of a huge supply and the wild nature of memecoins, BONK shows promise. It's becoming a key part of Solana's ecosystem, even launching its own decentralized exchange called BonkSwap. This integration with a booming network of decentralized apps sets it apart. In the current market cycle, where community-driven projects are gaining traction, BONK stands out as an attractive option. Compared to other memecoins, its strong community focus and real use cases could make it a noteworthy contender in the crypto space. SPX6900 (SPX) In a digital world where numbers hold immense power, SPX6900 has emerged from the depths of internet culture as the newest meme token capturing everyone's attention. Born with the audacious goal to surpass the S&P 500, SPX6900 sets its sights on a staggering $69 trillion market cap. The logic is simple yet bold: if 6900 is greater than 500, then SPX6900 must be superior to traditional financial instruments. In a market buzzing with innovation, SPX6900's playful approach resonates with a generation that values creativity and disruption. Powered by the belief that bigger numbers mean better investments, it taps into the same spirit that propelled other meme coins like Dogecoin to fame. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream attention, SPX6900 stands out with its ambitious vision and community-driven momentum. Whether it will achieve its sky-high goals remains an open question, but it undoubtedly adds a new flavor to the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion SHIB, PEPE, BONK, and SPX are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth in the upcoming rally.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 100,000 YouTube subscribers that if Ethereum ( ETH ) breaks through a key resistance level “the next few months are going to be life-changing.” “Breaking out would enable a massive influx of money flow into smaller altcoins. And Ethereum breaking out to new all-time highs would be a major catalyst on a technical side in making all these other altcoins rally quite substantially.” According to the trader, ETH needs to break through $4,000 to ignite massive altcoin rallies. “It’s weekly closes and successful retests [at the $4,000 level] that have enabled moves to essentially new all-time highs. So $4,500 would occur once we actually managed a weekly close inside here and retest this [$4,000 level] as support. That would enable a revisit of old all-time highs, and probably upon breaking $4,500, rally into essentially new all-time highs and price discovery.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Ethereum is trading for $3,595 at time of writing. He also shares an OTHERS chart, which depicts the total crypto market cap excluding the top ten coins to gauge altcoin market strength, and suggests that alts may surge like they did in 2021. “Now we’re seeing a weekly close and retest here, and a successful retest here would enable upside from $315 billion to $425 billion… When we weekly closed and retested this region [in 2021], we saw expansion in altcoin market cap to new all-time highs, essentially… If we’re able to hold here for a few weeks, that would enable a move into $425 billion.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube ?

This comes amid the recent XRP rally, with the crypto now targeting its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. Why The XRP Price Can Reach $10,000 In an X post, Vincent revealed that he had consulted with ChatGPT, and the AI chatbot had told him that the XRP price could easily reach $10,000 per coin. XRP’s market cap is one reason that has been used as an argument as to why the crypto can’t achieve such a price level. The analyst stated that ChatGPT also invalidated the market cap argument, stating that monetary market cap is an invalid metric. Vincent failed to provide a timeline for when ChatGPT said the XRP price could reach such an ambitious price target. However, he mentioned that he had discussed Ripple with the AI chatbot. This suggests that ChatGPT might have considered Ripple’s influence before making this $10,000 prediction. Indeed, Ripple could play a major role if the XRP price is to come close to or reach this $10,000 target. While predicting that XRP can reach $1,000, crypto analyst CryptoTank alluded to Ripple payments service and cited an instance where the crypto firm’s payment rails are used to process most cross-border transactions. XRP’s use case will increase as Ripple’s payment service enjoys mass adoption, providing a bullish outlook for the XRP price. Meanwhile, it is also worth mentioning the XRP ETFs, which are also bullish. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve these funds next year, especially with reports that pro-crypto Paul Atkins could replace Gary Gensler. These funds would drive institutional inflows into the XRP ecosystem, sparking a significant price rally. However, it remains to be seen if they could drive the crypto to five figures. A Rally To Double Digits In This Cycle Amid this lofty XRP price prediction of $10,000, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has predicted that the crypto could rally to double digits in this market cycle. This came as the analyst stated that XRP was giving 2017 kind of rally vibes, indicating that the crypto could replicate its legendary rally of over 61,000% in that 2017 bull run. In line with this, the crypto analyst predicted that XRP price would hit $2, experience a pullback, and then continue its vertical hated rallies to a new cycle top of probably $10. Using the Elliott Wave theory, crypto analyst Dark Defender predicted that XRP could rally as high as $18 in this bull run. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.90, up over 18% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-10000-2/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen interesting movements lately. Over the past week, its price increased by 5.61%. In the last month, it jumped by 38.61%. However, over six months, it dipped slightly by 0.63%. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.00002316 and $0.00002827. The recent surge suggests growing momentum. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00002522, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.00002509. This indicates a short-term bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 48.84, close to neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The stochastic value is 21.67, hinting at potential upward movement. On the downside, the nearest support level is $0.00001564. Should the price dip to this level, it would be a decrease of about 12.86% from the current lower bound. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $0.00001946 and $0.00001920 respectively, suggesting stable pricing. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 50.40 indicates a neutral market, while the Stochastic value of 26.55 may hint at a potential undervaluation. The MACD level is at 3.6640e-8, pointing to minor bullish momentum. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has shown remarkable movement in recent times. Over the past week, the coin's price has increased by 3.27%. In the last month, it soared by 112.32%, highlighting significant momentum. Looking back over six months, PEPE's price has risen by 25.99%, indicating sustained growth. Based on these figures, some might anticipate further upward movement. The current price range sits between $0.00001792 and $0.00002263. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00002505, and breaking through this could lead PEPE toward the second resistance at $0.00002975. If it reaches this point, it would represent an approximate increase of 31.47% from the current price range's upper limit. On the downside, the nearest support level is $0.00001564. Should the price dip to this level, it would be a decrease of about 12.86% from the current lower bound. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $0.00001946 and $0.00001920 respectively, suggesting stable pricing.

Ethereum whales are closely monitoring emerging opportunities to diversify their portfolios amid this competition. Most noteworthy is Lunex Network , a multi-chain project that has received over $3.6 million in ICO funding. Ethereum Surges to Five-Month High as Profitability Hits Record Levels Ethereum's performance revived investor optimism with a five-month high of $3,687 within the past 24 hours before slightly retreating. This rally marks the second phase of Ethereum’s bull run, as confirmed by CryptoQuant. Profitability levels are now at a remarkable high, with 90.8% of ETH holders in the green—a level not seen since June. Meanwhile, the remaining 9.2% of holders control just 2.8% of Ethereum’s total supply, minimizing potential sell pressure on the market. Interestingly, data from IntoTheBlock reveals that the unprofitable ETH was mostly purchased between $3,624 and $4,169, with 3.95 million ETH worth $14.33 billion held by 11.42 million wallets. For Ethereum to fully absorb this range, it would require a significant 33% price increase from current levels. On the flip side, profitable holders dominate the scene, commanding 134.69 million ETH, valued at an impressive $488.21 billion, spread across 115.22 million addresses. This highlights Ethereum’s growing resilience and its continued appeal among both retail and institutional investors. Analysts predict that ETH could reach $4,500 before the year ends if the bulls continue to dominate. Solana Eyes $300: Rising TVL and Bullish Sentiment Drive Recovery Solana rallied 8% from a low of $222 on Nov. 26 to $237.98 by Nov. 27 following a sharp correction from its all-time high of $263.80. Although Solana posted a modest 1% weekly increase, wider altcoin market capitalization gained 12% in the same period. Solana's strong fundamentals are also notable as its Total Value Locked (TVL) has increased by 48% in the last 30 days compared with BNB Chain's 14% and Tron's 13%. Solana's blockchain also has led the meme coin trading market, with tokens like BONK and POPCAT fueling speculative trading volumes. This recovery, combined with rising TVL and bullish sentiment in futures markets, paints a promising picture for Solana. While challenges such as reliance on meme coin activity remain, Solana’s expanding ecosystem and market optimism could pave the way for a push toward $300, particularly if broader crypto market conditions stay favorable. Ripple Whale Moves $27.2M as XRP Eyes Massive Price Surge A whale transaction for 18.78 million XRP worth $27.2 million has been transferred from Binance. This comes as Ripple strengthens its position in its legal fight against the SEC and XRP's rally hits a 200% run to a year-end high of $1.62. Ripple's collaboration with Archax to launch an XRP Ledger tokenized fund and the upcoming RUSD stablecoin shows its evolving ecosystem and a rising investor appeal in the XRP project. Despite pulling back to $1.45, XRP is up 30% in the last week and analysts project a surge to $13 with Elliott Wave projections. Ripple's leadership remains optimistic that its legal fight with the SEC will be advantageous, and momentum is building around XRP's long-term potential.

However, this is often easier said than done as it can be quite overwhelming to try and sift through hundreds of tickers in search of winners. This article will explore some of the safest bets that can yield substantial returns as the cycle progresses. On the layer 1 front, Solana (SOL) and Binance coin (BNB) are obvious choices. With memes taking the spotlight, rotating some funds into Dogecoin (DOGE) is never a bad idea. Polygon (POL) also appears primed for a major run. And lastly, Lunex Network (LNEX) , a newcomer in the DeFi space, is still in presale and already showing great promise. Let’s dive in! Dogecoin Is Ready For The Next Leg Up Dogecoin has grown into a behemoth since its sub 1 cent times, and it’s safe today that it transcended its meme coin status, becoming a staple in any long-term portfolio. In November, Dogecoin (DOGE) skyrocketed by over 200% in just a few weeks, topping headlines and kickstarting the next meme season. After peaking at $0.47, Dogecoin retraced, entering a narrow channel around the $0.40 mark. As Dogecoin consolidates, analyst Bluntz Capital has drawn attention to a breakout from an ascending channel on the DOGE chart. If the breakout is confirmed Dogecoin could soon soar to new heights, but it must first reclaim and hold the $0.44 resistance. Dogecoin’s massive rise can also be attributed to the most famous DOGE champion Elon Musk. Musk played a crucial role in the victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump during the US presidential elections. Moreover, he is also set to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, codenamed D.O.G.E. Solana ETF Talks Continue Heading into 2025, Solana is still poised to play a protagonist role in the crypto market, as a series of bullish catalysts are lining up. For starters, Solana’s meme coin factory is firing on all cylinders, driving millions in revenue every month as euphoria grips the market. In addition to this, there are increasing reports about a spot SOL ETF release that could take place at some point in 2025. Institutional investors and fund managers like Canary Capital, VanEck, and Bitwise have already filed for approval with the SEC. At press time, Solana sells for $238 with an 8% retracement from the $263 all-time high. Large buyers are already taking advantage of this dip. According to whale tracker Lookonchain , just the other week, a Solana whale snatched over 100,000 SOL tokens worth approximately $23.6 million. Why Lunex Network Could Be The Gamechanger That DeFi Needs Lunex Network is a new cutting-edge decentralized exchange that integrates all major blockchains, including Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Users will be able to perform near-instantaneous swaps across over 50,000 assets at the lowest possible fees Lunex Network also guarantees a passive income stream for holders of the $LNEX token. A percentage of the platform’s profits will be redistributed every week as staking rewards for up to 18% APY. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Lunex Network’s vast offering. Readers who want to learn more can head over to the official website and discover the wide array of features of the Lunex ecosystem. The Lunex Network presale is live and $LNEX tokens sell for just $0.0033 and so far nearly $3.6 million has been raised. Is A BNB Breakout Incoming? BNB demonstrated impressive resilience during the most bearish summer months of 2024. However, this did not immediately translate into significant movements for the BNB price as the market sentiment shifted to bullish in Q4. Today BNB trades at $650 with a 2% intraday increase and is still moving in a narrow trading channel around this mark. As BNB approached the $680 resistance, selling pressure intensified and the attempted breakout failed. This lack of progress led to BNB losing its 4th place on the crypto leaderboard, with Solana overtaking it and putting a $20 billion distance between them. However, things could soon turn around for BNB. Analyst Crypto Zeinab points out that in the 2-week timeframe, the BNB chart has been printing a multi-year cup & handle pattern. This formation could culminate with a massive upward move and send BNB to a new all-time high. Polygon’s Climb Continues As It Approaches Critical Resistance After months on the sidelines, Polygon (POL) has started showing signs of life again and surged by over 66% in less than a month. Today, Polygon sells for $0.56 with a 1.1% daily decline and a 22% drop in 24-hour volume, with roughly $353 million worth of POL traded on exchanges. This diminished buying interest signals that Polygon has entered a cool-off phase as it consolidates around the current levels. Polygon is in the process of transitioning from the MATIC token to POL. However, this rebrandhas been received with mixed feelings by the community as reflected by the generally underwhelming price action of the past few months, without taking into consideration the latest rally. However, large investors deem Polygon undervalued, and whales are taking action. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez has shared some on-chain insights, showing that large wallets have accumulated over 59 million POL tokens in the last two days, worth approximately $33 million. Conclusion With the crypto market heading into an explosive 2025, most cryptocurrencies are likely to experience significant gains. However, investors who want safe returns should consider starting with any of the above-mentioned projects, as they boast a robust track record and consistently capture the attention of the crypto community. This is key because attention almost always translates into green candles. Lunex Network, in particular, seems to be a gem in the making as it could vastly outperform all of the others, given its magnitude smaller market cap.

37062111,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620515,1732999203,President Trump threatens 100% tariffs and permanent breakup with Putin’s BRICS if they dethrone US dollar,"President-elect Donald Trump has issued a direct threat to the BRICS countries, telling them to back off from any plans to create a new currency. If they don’t, Trump says he’ll slap a brutal 100% tariff on their goods and cut them out of the US market for good. The warning comes as BRICS, led by his favorite frenemy Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, explores alternatives to the US dollar, something Trump has always made clear he won’t tolerate. In a fiery post on Truth Social, the president said, “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER.” He straight up demanded a firm commitment from these countries that they would abandon any plans for a BRICS currency or any other system designed to replace the dollar. “If they refuse,” Trump warned, adding that: “They should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. economy. They can go find another ‘sucker!’ There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America.” A global battle for currency control Throughout his campaign, Trump hammered the idea that the US dollar must remain the world’s reserve currency. He has called any attempts to challenge the dollar a direct threat to the US economy. His response? Make it financially devastating for anyone who tries. Trump’s team is already brainstorming ways to punish countries that trade in currencies other than the dollar. According to insiders, options on the table include labeling countries as currency manipulators, implementing strict export controls, and hitting them with heavy tariffs. The goal is amusingly simple: make it so costly to abandon the dollar that no one dares to try. The BRICS have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with the dollar’s dominance. Especially after US sanctions against Russia in 2022 made it clear how much leverage the US holds through its currency. During the annual summit Putin hosted in October this year, BRICS leaders discussed “de-dollarization.” Tariff war incoming? Trump’s strategy isn’t limited to BRICS. He’s threatening everyone. Over the past week, he outlined plans to impose a 10% tariff on goods from China and a massive 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada. These tariffs are tied to broader issues, including illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The president says he’ll implement these measures if those countries don’t step up efforts to secure US borders. The impact of Trump’s threats is already being felt. Markets are jittery, and currencies like the Canadian dollar have taken a hit. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rushed to Florida to meet with Trump after the tariff announcement. Over a three-hour dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the two leaders discussed trade, border security, and energy projects, including the Keystone XL pipeline, which had been scrapped under the Biden administration. Trudeau brought along his Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc and his chief of staff Katie Telford. On the U.S. side, the dinner included key Trump allies like incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Commerce Secretary pick Howard Lutnick. Despite the talks, no resolution has been reached, and Trump’s tariff threats remain on the table. Putin: Russia didn’t ditch the dollar—the U.S. ditched Russia Meanwhile, Putin is actually pushing back against the narrative that Russia is trying to ditch the dollar. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club earlier this month, Putin said Russia never chose to move away from the dollar—it was forced to. “We were merely denied the use of the dollar as a payment instrument,” he said, blaming the Biden administration for weaponizing the currency. He criticized America for undermining its own currency, calling the decision “foolish.” According to Putin, the dollar has been a cornerstone of American power, and risking its dominance could backfire. He made it clear that Russia isn’t actively trying to replace the dollar but is preparing for a world where it’s no longer dominant. “We’re not struggling with the U.S. currency,” he added. Instead, Russia is developing new tools and systems to adapt to a changing global economy. For Trump, none of this matters. Whether BRICS nations are actively trying to replace the dollar or not, his stance is clear: any move away from the dollar will be met with severe consequences. The situation is volatile. Trump hasn’t even taken office yet, and his threats are already shaking global markets. You can only imagine the effects when he does follow through with them.

37061755,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98197,1732998777,Ripple’s XRP Market Cap Hits $100 Billion For First Time Since 2018 As $2 Price Beckons,"For the first time since 2018, XRP’s market capitalization has skyrocketed above the $100 billion mark, fueled by bullish sentiment and regulatory optimism. The Ripple-promoted crypto asset has flipped BNB to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the market, now only trailing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether’s USDT, and Solana (SOL). Factors Driving XRP’s Market Cap According to CoinGecko data , XRP’s market cap jumped to $110.5 billion on Nov. 30, with the token’s price rising 11.2% to reach a peak of $1.93. The crypto asset is up an eye-watering 270% over the past 30 days. XRP’s price uptrend comes amid increasing speculation that a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) might be on the horizon, alongside optimism around the imminent leadership change at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Global ETF issuer WisdomTree recently filed paperwork for an XRP ETF with the state of Delaware. Then, the European XRP ETP rebranded to the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP, as Ripple announced it would invest an unspecified amount in the fund. XRP has been mired in a legal brawl with the SEC since late 2020 after the Wall Street regulator alleged the asset is an unregistered security. In July 2023, a New York judge found that XRP is not necessarily a security. Then in October of this year, the SEC appealed some key aspects of the ruling relating to the sale of XRP on crypto trading platforms and the personal sales by Ripple’s top executives. With current SEC chair Gary Gensler announcing his intention to resign as Trump reenters the White House, some dark regulatory clouds have lifted. There’s growing speculation that the SEC will drop the drawn-out Ripple lawsuit under the incoming Trump administration. What’s Next For XRP? If bulls continue to be in the driver’s seat, XRP could soon hit $2 in the near term. Widely-followed crypto analyst Mikybull recently noted the possibility of breaching the $2 barrier. “$XRP 2017 kind of rally vibes. Hit $2, experience a pullback, and then continue its vertical hated rallies to a new cycle top of probably $10.” However, a pseudonymous community analyst at on-chain data platform CryptoQuant, JA Maartunn, warns that the recent price surge is mainly spurred by leveraged trading — a factor that can trigger huge price swings. In the past, a similar event led to a 17% price drawdown. $XRP is experiencing a Leverage-Driven Pump! Open Interest is up 37% already—watch for volatility.

37064289,https://invezz.com/?p=2321232,1732998125,Ripple XRP and Stellar XLM price forecasts: more upside left?,"Ripple price had its best month on record, helped by numerous catalysts, including the rumored partnership with Swift, recent Trump win, and the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin launch. The XRP token jumped to a high of $1.9697, its highest level since April 2021. It has jumped by over 278% in November, its second-best month since December 2017 when it jumped by over 600%. Ripple’s surge triggered a big move surge in Stellar Lumens price. XLM, Stellar’s token, jumped to $0.6390, its highest level since May 2021. It has risen by almost 500% in the past 30 days, making November its best month ever. Why Ripple and Stellar prices jumped The main catalyst for the XRP price surge was November’s election of Donald Trump in the United States. Trump’s election meant that there would be big changes in terms of policy in the US, where Ripple has been under pressure. Ripple Labs was sued by Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which accused it of selling an unregistered security to investors in 2013. That was a big lawsuit that affected Ripple’s business by triggering the undoing of some of the deals that the company had done, including one with Western Union. Ripple won some parts of the lawsuit and was ordered to pay a $250 million fine earlier this year. While that was a big sum for the company, it was a tiny part of the $2 billion that the agency was seeking. The SEC has planned to file an appeal. Therefore, the XRP price rose because investors hope that the agency will not appeal under the Trump administration. Such a move will mean that the compan can pursue more deals and even launch its IPO. Ripple price has also jumped amid anticipation that the company was preparing to partner with Swift Society. Swift is a large organization, owned by global banks, that handles transactions worth billions of dollars a day. Swift and Ripple have not confirmed whether that deal will happen, meaning that all we have is speculation. Speculation tends to move cryptocurrency prices over time. Ripple is also preparing to becoming a big player in the stablecoin industry by launching RLUSD. RLUSD will be a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar that will aim to disrupt Tether’s success. Still, as we have seen with other stablecoins like USDD and PYUSD, dislodging Tether will not be easy. Stellar’s XLM token jumped because of its general similarity with Ripple . Gavin Wood, Stellar’s founder, was a co-founder of Ripple, and the two companies target the payments industry. Also, analysts believe that, with the Trump election, odds of spot XRP and XLM ETFs have risen substantially in the past few weeks.

On the weekly chart, we see that the XRP jumped to almost $2, moving slightly above its highest level in 2021. Ripple jumped above the key resistance at $0.9370, its highest level in July 2023. It has soared above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD also pointed upwards. Therefore, after the spectacular performance in November, a brief pullback cannot be ruled out. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $1.5. In the long term, there are signs that the coin will jump to a record high of $3.29, which is about 73% above the current level.

This surpassed the previous record of $295.5 mln set on November 11 by $37.4 mln, showing increasing investor interest in Ethereum-based ETFs. The massive contribution of $250.4 million from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, drove this unprecedented milestone. This development marked the strengthening of Ethereum’s position in the cryptocurrency market, especially since the cryptocurrency has gained momentum in institutional circles. BlackRock’s Ethereum Trust Propels Market Growth BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has been the best performer since its inception on July 23. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, pointed out on X that ETHA has already seen inflows of more than $2 billion. On November 29, the price of Ether jumped 1.88% to $3,662, adding to the optimism surrounding the asset. The unprecedented inflows further cement Ethereum’s position as a formidable alternative to Bitcoin among institutional investors. Ethereum Surpasses Bitcoin in ETF Flows For the first time, Ether ETFs outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts in daily inflows. Bitcoin ETFs had $320 million on the same day, shy of Ethereum’s $332.9 million. Crypto analysts have been quick to note the significance of the flip. According to Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, this could be a point of no return in Wall Street’s shift of focus to Ethereum in an “alt rotation” strategy. Ethereum Regains Tether Dominance Ethereum has reclaimed the top spot as the most used blockchain for Tether, with a supply of $60.3 billion, edging out Tron, which now holds $58.1 billion. The movement comes after the supply of USDT on Ethereum rose 9.3% in the last week while supply on Tron fell 1.5%. Stablecoins like Tether serve as a source of critical liquidity and thus allow for seamless trading in the crypto world. Ethereum’s regained dominance is reflected in its increasingly broadening usage by financial institutions in the tokenized assets area. Stablecoins Boost Ethereum’s Growth The total supply of Tether has reached a new high at $132.9 billion, with Ethereum significantly contributing to this growth. Its wider usability, especially in the sphere of DeFi and institutional tokenization, continues to make its position stronger. While Tron remains favored in high-inflation regions due to its low fees and fast transactions, Ethereum’s versatility has cemented its position as a dominant blockchain for stablecoins and beyond.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/u-s-spot-ether-etfs-hit-record-daily-inflow-of-332m/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Similar activity was recorded as the market flipped green, with bulls looking to rake in gains. This sequence is usually the trend in a price correction in the bull cycle and leads to growing market inflows. This year, several institutions have bought the dip, pouring funds in anticipation of price gains. This follows the bullish drive in Q1 2024, which saw Bitcoin hit a new all-time high above $73,000 after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs . On-chain Analyst Spot Whale Activities A new CryptoQuant report shows large transfers to whale addresses. In nearly 48 hours, whale purchases topped $1.5 billion as traders look to recover from the dip that wiped out almost $4 billion from the market cap. Fluctuations in BTC price stirred panic, leading to massive liquidations allowing bulls to accumulate assets. According to the report, the $1.5 billion seen in whale addresses does not include coins in centralized exchanges. There is a possibility that institutional players accumulated more assets but have not yet withdrawn them. Although the figures look impressive, these traders are mostly institutional traders with little input from retail. For Bitcoin’s price to break its all-time high, retail numbers need to go up significantly. Crypto enthusiasts reacted positively to recent crypto purchases from Bitcoin mining firms and other institutions. “Marathon Digital, $MARA, has acquired 6,474 BTC in November and has $160 million in cash reserved for potential future purchases. Marathon now holds 34,794 BTC, making it the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after MicroStrategy,” X user unusua_whales wrote. Impact on The Market Positive sentiments in Bitcoin translate to similar trading patterns in the wider market. This month, BTC surge to multiple all-time highs led to an upward swing in altcoins and meme tokens. Although Bitcoin maintained growing dominance, the market frenzy resulted in the total capitalization soaring past $3 trillion. Bitcoin currently trades at $97,094 as the asset tries to recover weekly losses. Altcoins like XRP have also marked gains recently with double-digit weekly numbers.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP.

The move stormed the community, with several analysts flagging reduced sentiments. This month, Ethereum and other crypto assets recorded huge gains, leading to bulls changing positions. While profit-taking soared, some traders bought the last dip, setting new highs. On-chain crypto firms flagged Wilcke’s transfers as a sale following a history of similar transactions. Despite the sale, Wilcke holds 106,006 ETH worth $384 million. Crypto assets tend to lose steam when bulls sell assets because of the influence of their holdings. Whale transfers usually shape small trader’s sentiments. Similarly, asset flows to centralized exchanges indicate possible sales, while transfers to other custodians signify long-term holdings. Series of Massive Transfers The wider community notes Wilcke’s transfer for several reasons. In May, he deposited 10,000 ETH worth $37.3 million before the market crash. He previously received 463,203 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation, which is currently worth $1.6 billion. From that stash, he transferred 356,805 ETH to exchanges. Before the 2021 bull run, Wilcke moved 290,505 ETH to exchanges but didn’t repeat the same in the 2022 bear season. In 2023, he began moving assets to exchanges as the crypto markets gained momentum. “ Jeffrey Wilcke, the Co-founder of #Ethereum, deposited 10K $ETH($37.36M) to #Kraken again 2 hours ago and currently holds 125,738 $ETH($472M). Jeffrey Wilcke has deposited a total of 46.3K $ETH($116.4M) to #Kraken at an average price of $2,515 over the past year.” What’s Next For ETH Price? As stated earlier, crypto prices are influenced by whale movements to exchanges. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,691, surging 2.9% in the last 24 hours. This plunging sentiment has taken out a chunk of weekly price gains after slightly recovering this week. Most analysts expect a rebound from this drop, setting higher price targets and citing macro factors. Institutional investors are still positive on Ethereum making a breakout and leading the altcoin season. These sentiments are shared across the board following massive gains seen after the U.S. elections.

Investors are flocking to acquire PCHAIN at the lowest price before the price increases drastically in the next stage. Let’s examine the project in detail and understand the reasons behind the increasing demand for the PCHAIN token presale. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Project’s Vision Real estate has been one of the most sought-after investment instruments for decades, and the industry has undergone significant changes. Despite this gradual evolution, real estate investors often face opaque pricing, fraud risks, low liquidity, and heavy reliance on intermediaries. PropiChain aims to address these issues and transform the sector using blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse. It has integrated these modern tools and technologies into its investment platform to create a more efficient future for real estate. Using blockchain, PropiChain has improved security and transparency for property investments. It has converted all properties into tokens, allowing users to trade real estate on the blockchain. The tokens represent fractions of the property, providing users with the benefits of fractional ownership, such as improved liquidity and more diversification opportunities. PropiChain users also have increased accessibility as multiple investors can combine their capital to acquire any property, regardless of value. Many investors have been impressed by the advanced platform and its features and are participating in the token presale to become a part of the future of real estate. Let’s examine these features and understand how they boost investors’ confidence in the token presale success. Revolutionizing Real Estate With AI and The Metaverse PropiChain offers an array of AI features to improve user experience. Users have 24/7 access to AI chatbots and virtual assistants, which solve any queries and guide investors throughout the investment process, assisting with complex and tedious paperwork. The PropiChain AI provides further investment help by providing accurate property valuations using the Advanced Valuation Models. These AI-powered algorithms analyze historical sales data and monitor current market conditions to generate valuations that match the actual property price in the real estate market. Investors can use these valuations to filter the real estate they want to invest in and virtually assess these properties. The Metaverse generates immersive 3D rendering of the properties, allowing users to experience them without traveling long distances. Thus, using the Metaverse PropiChain has broken the geographical entry barrier to real estate investment and amplified its users’ reach, allowing them to feel and invest in any real estate globally from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, PropiChain offers automated transactions to simplify the investment process further. Once the user has finalized a property after assessment through the Metaverse, they can just provide the AI with the exact valuation for which they want to purchase the property. When the property hits the specified valuation, the AI automatically executes the order and stores the details on the platform’s decentralized ledger to maintain investment security and transparency. After users purchase a property, PropiChain also provides the feature of automatic lease creation with the platform’s smart contracts. Users do not require manual paperwork and expensive lawyers, as smart contracts automatically trigger the lease upon signatures and completion of the fund transfers. The smart contracts also simplify rental payments. Tenants can set the rent amount, and the smart contracts automatically transfer the rent to the landlord. Landlords may also set a fixed late rent penalty, which will be added to the next cycle. The native token, PCHAIN , brings the entire platform to life. It is currently in stage one of the token presale. Let’s analyze the potential token presale returns and how to maximize them. Capture Enormous Returns With The PCHAIN Token Presale PCHAIN is valued at $0.004 in the first stage of the token presale. The tokens are selling out quickly as investors rush to acquire PCHAIN at the lowest price before it surges. PCHAIN will gain 175% within a few days as the price will hike to $0.011 by the next presale stage. Thus, the token presale can turn a $1,000 investment into $2,750 by the second stage and $8,000 when PCHAIN is launched at $0.032. Moreover, analysts foreshadow that PCHAIN will undergo a massive rally during the next bull run after the token presale and suggest that investors can capture up to 10,000x returns by investing in the first stage. Conclusion PropiChain is transforming real estate by using blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse to solve prevalent issues. AI simplifies the investment process, smart contracts simplify property leasing, and the Metaverse amplifies users’ investment range. Collectively, these platform features create an efficient and secure investment environment. For safety, the leading blockchain security firm, BlockAudit , has conducted rigorous platform testing and reported zero security vulnerabilities and complete regulatory compliance for PropiChain. Moreover, PCHAIN has already been listed on CoinMarketCap in the token presale phase. This early CMC listing has boosted the presale and the project’s growth. Thus, token holders can expect PCHAIN’s value to grow faster and the project to complete more crucial milestones soon. PCHAIN is currently available at the lowest price of $0.004 and offers a steady 800% gain by the end of the token presale. Additionally, experts predict PCHAIN will grow tremendously after the presale and say early investors can generate up to 10,000x returns.

From Dogecoin’s playful beginnings to Shiba Inu’s explosive growth, these coins have captured the imagination of investors and casual crypto enthusiasts alike. They’ve become more than just digital currencies; they’re cultural phenomena that spark communities and conversations around the globe. As we look to the future, it’s clear that new contenders are emerging, and one of the most exciting is BTFD Coin (BTFD) . BTFD Coin is poised to take the meme coin world by storm, flaunting unique features designed to engage users and foster a strong community. With its presale, kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin, many are starting to wonder if this could be the best meme coin presale to join today. Analysts are buzzing about the potential for BTFD Coin to replicate or even exceed the hype that Shiba Inu generated. Let’s dive into what makes BTFD Coin a compelling opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. BTFD Coin: The New Player in the Meme Coin Game BTFD Coin is not just another entry in the crowded meme coin market; it’s crafted with purpose and a vision for the future. One of its standout features is the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which invites users to engage with the platform while earning rewards in BTFD tokens. Imagine diving into a fun gaming experience where your skills not only entertain you but also pad your wallet! This gamified approach is designed to keep users engaged and foster a sense of community among holders. In addition to its P2E game , BTFD Coin offers attractive staking rewards. By participating in staking, holders can earn a solid annual percentage yield (APY) just for keeping their tokens. This feature is especially appealing for those looking to grow their investment passively while remaining part of a vibrant community. The combination of earning through gaming and staking creates a unique value proposition that could attract both seasoned investors and new crypto enthusiasts alike. Moreover, the BTFD community, known as the “Bulls Squad,” is a key aspect of the coin’s strategy. This initiative encourages participation and rewards engagement, creating a strong sense of belonging among its members. The more active you are, the more you stand to gain—not just in terms of tokens but in recognition and community standing. This focus on community is crucial, as a dedicated user base can propel a project to new heights. As for price predictions, analysts are optimistic about BTFD Coin’s potential. With a initial presale price of $0.000004 and a projected listing price of $0.0006, early investors could see significant returns. For instance, if you had invested $7,500 during the first stage of the presale, your investment could grow to about $112,500 when the price reaches $0.0006. That’s a staggering potential return that could get anyone excited about this project! Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin stands out as one of the best meme coin presales to join today due to its innovative features, community-driven approach, and potential for impressive returns. With a low entry price and engaging developments, it’s a prime opportunity for anyone looking to dive into the meme coin market. Shiba Inu: The Hype Machine Now, let’s take a moment to appreciate Shiba Inu, the meme coin that captured the hearts (and wallets) of many. Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu was created as an experiment in decentralized community building. Dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” it quickly garnered attention and built a massive following. The Shiba Inu community, affectionately known as the “Shib Army,” rallied together, driving the coin’s popularity and value to astronomical heights. One of the remarkable features of Shiba Inu is its commitment to charity and social good. The community has raised significant funds for various causes, including the COVID-19 relief efforts in India. This sense of purpose has helped solidify its standing in the crypto world, showing that meme coins can do more than just provide entertainment—they can also make a positive impact. Shiba Inu’s rise was also fueled by social media hype and endorsements from influential figures. Much like Dogecoin, it became a staple in memes and discussions across platforms like Twitter and Reddit. This viral marketing strategy created a perfect storm for its price to skyrocket, leading many to wonder if they had missed the boat. However, with great hype comes great volatility. While many early investors celebrated massive gains, others faced significant losses due to dramatic price fluctuations. The unpredictability of meme coins can be both thrilling and nerve-wracking. As the market evolves, Shiba Inu continues to maintain a loyal user base, but it faces increasing competition from new entrants like BTFD Coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? Shiba Inu has solidified its position as a legendary meme coin, thanks to its strong community and cultural significance. While it has provided significant returns for early investors, the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency means that new opportunities, like BTFD Coin, are emerging. Don’t Miss Your Chance! If you’re looking to dive into the exciting world of meme coins, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity that you won’t want to miss. With its innovative features, engaging community, and attractive presale price, BTFD Coin could very well be the next phenomenon in the meme coin space. As the presale continues, the excitement is palpable, and analysts are optimistic about potential returns. If you’re searching for the best meme coin presale to join today, consider signing up for the BTFD Coin presale before it swings past you.

According to a new post on the social media platform X by BitMEX Research sharing the decision against Dr. Wright, the judge in the case has decided that there is no way that Wright created BTC. “Among the key reasons for his decision were that [the judge’s] conclusions that (i) Dr. Wright had lied repeatedly and extensively to the court in his evidence and (ii) Dr. Wright had forged a large number of documents which he relied upon in support of his claim. Overall, the judge concluded that the evidence that Dr Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto was overwhelming.” Source: BitMEX Research/X According to the judge’s decision, there is no reason to continue the case. “The appeals have no prospect of success whatever and there is no other reason to hear them… Permission to appeal in CA-001771 and CA-001994 both refused as being totally without merit.” The original ruling that Wright could not be Nakamoto was made earlier this year in March. Said the judge at the time, “For the reasons which will be explained in that written judgment in due course, I will make certain declarations which I am satisfied are useful and are necessary to do justice between the parties. First, that Dr. Wright is NOT the author of the Bitcoin White Paper. Second, Dr. Wright is NOT the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Third, Dr. Wright is NOT the person who created the Bitcoin System. And, fourth, he is NOT the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Jeremiah Fowler says he recently found the non-password protected database on the cloud, containing records belonging to SL Data Services/Propertyrec. The firm provides property, vehicle and criminal records, as well as background checks. Fowler says the records in question contain full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, family members, social media accounts, criminal record histories, death and birth certificates, court records, vehicle records, property ownership reports and background checks. The database was located in an 713 gigabyte unencrypted Amazon S3 bucket. Fowler says he can’t determine how long the database was exposed or if anyone else has gained access to it. “Only an internal forensic audit could identify additional access or potentially suspicious activity. I did not receive a response from SL Data Services/Propertyrec after my disclosure notice or at any time before publication. It is not known if the database was owned and managed by SL Data Services/Propertyrec or a third-party contractor.” The incident follows a separate breach from a background check service company.

According to an announcement , the exchange has launched a crypto trading platform and a self-custodial wallet for users in Belgium. This new service allows Belgian residents to access various crypto services, helping OKX strengthen its presence in the European digital asset market. OKX Expansion to Belgium Brings Lots of Benefits This platform also allows Belgian customers to trade and convert over 200 cryptocurrencies, including 60 trading pairs with the euro. This wide range of options will appeal to experienced traders and those new to cryptocurrency. However, the launch is yet to get direct approval from Belgian authorities. Instead, OKX operates in Belgium with a non-rejection status, using its Malta-registered entity, Okcoin Europe, licensed by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Meanwhile, OKX has added Bancontact, a popular payment system in Belgium, to make euro transactions easier. Customers can also use SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) for more options to deposit and withdraw money, ensuring smooth and efficient transactions. The onboarding process for Belgium users is now easier through the Itsme app, a trusted digital ID tool. Furthermore, the new self-custodial wallet gives Belgian users better control over their digital assets while prioritizing security and transparency. This change meets the increasing demand for decentralized financial solutions in Europe. OKX Expansion and Global Outreach Recall that, the Web3 technology company launched its centralized crypto exchange and OKX wallet in the Netherlands in June. Likewise, in February, OKX launched crypto exchange services and its Web3 wallet in Argentina , marking a strategic move to capitalize on the region’s increasing interest in crypto and blockchain technology. Similarly, in January, OKX obtained a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in Dubai , signaling its commitment to serving the Middle Eastern market and a clear expansion strategy across different clients. Robinhood Expands Crypto Capabilities in Europe Retail investing platform Robinhood has expanded its crypto offerings in Europe . European users can now transfer cryptocurrencies in and out of the platform. The platform also affirmed that EU customers can deposit and withdraw over 20 digital currencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin. The functionality allows users to “self-custody” their assets, meaning they can manage their wallets instead of relying on third-party custodians. Robinhood’s expansion comes on the heels of the EU’s efforts to standardize cryptocurrency regulations across its member states. Robinhood offered a limited-time promotion for European customers, as part of the rollout. Users will receive 1% of the value of any crypto they deposit on the platform.

37059716,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655882,1732995048,Toncoin Price Explodes With 17% Rally — Can TON Sustain The Momentum?,"Toncoin price performance has been one of the brightest spots in the cryptocurrency market in a week that has been rather slow for the large-cap assets. While Bitcoin has struggled to achieve its dream of a $100,000 valuation, tokens like Toncoin (TON), Stellar (XLM), and XRP have continued to soar with double-digit returns. Specifically, TON seems to be finally coming to life after a somewhat sluggish start to the month of November. However, the question that would probably be lingering on several investors’ minds is — how long can the Toncoin price sustain this bullish momentum? Is TON Price Going To Continue Upward Trend? In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost shared an exciting analysis for the price of Toncoin over the next few weeks. According to the pundit, on-chain signals are currently bullish for the altcoin’s price. The relevant metric here is the “90-day percent return,” which measures the percentage change in the price of an asset over the last 90 days. It typically tracks the performance of the cryptocurrency within that period while providing insight into its short-term trend and momentum. According to data from CryptoQuant , the TON 90-day percent return recently turned positive following the upward movement of the Toncoin price. From a historical standpoint, when this metric flips to positive, the price action that follows is usually with significant momentum. Ultimately, this shift in the 90-day percent return suggests that investors’ confidence is increasing and are more willing to hold their assets. This is usually in anticipation of higher prices , as investors are expecting the bullish trend to continue. According to the Quicktake analyst, another on-chain signal that supports the bullish prognosis is the percentage change in open interest. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the on-chain metric has also flipped to positive, suggesting a continuation of the current bullish trend. Toncoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Toncoin stands at around $6.526, reflecting no significant change in the past day. The altcoin is still up by almost 18% on the weekly timeframe, according to CoinGecko data. This recent bullish run pushed the price of TON back above $6.5 for the first time since late August. Following the token’s fall to around $4.5 in September, the price has been moving mostly sideways before climbing the latest high this month.",POSITIVE,TON,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TON,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/toncoin-price-explodes-with-17-rally-can-ton-sustain-the-momentum/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37059716.jpeg

Investor optimism grows as SEC Chair Gary Gensler prepares to depart. ETH ETFs saw $90 million in inflows on Friday, fueling bullish sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) is now trading above $3,700, a five-month high, as its price has climbed by 40% over the past four weeks. This strong performance has analysts predicting ETH will soon break $4,000.

Seven US-based bitcoin mining companies, who spoke anonymously, claimed that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had directed the CBP to hold certain deliveries of Bitmain ASIC miners. Interestingly, other Chinese producers of ASIC mining equipment, like MicroBT and Canaan, have not been subjected to the same treatment. Miners Face Months-Long Delay According to Blockspace’s latest report , some shipments have been delayed for up to two months. The hold-ups occurred at ports across the country, including those in San Francisco and Detroit. The affected imports include Bitmain’s latest Antminer S21 and T21 models. Although the CBP has acknowledged the detention of these goods, it has not provided clarity on the reasons for the hold or a timeline for releasing the shipments. A source dealing with extended delays, now spanning “months,” said that CBP detentions exceeding 30 days without any formal requests to the Importer of Record (IOR) are highly uncommon and fall well below expected standards. They also mentioned observing Advanced Targeting Unit (ATU) personnel at certain ports and noted that businesses are increasingly advising peers to avoid specific entry points, particularly those along the West Coast. Another individual revealed that the CBP is withholding roughly 200 units. Despite repeated appeals for clarity, both the CBP and FCC have declined to respond while continuing to levy daily holding fees that have surpassed $200,000. To address the matter, the affected company has engaged a legal team to seek answers from the FCC. Sophgo’s Huawei Link Putting Antminers in the Crosshairs? While the exact cause remains unknown, one possible explanation is the presence of Sophgo chips in Antminer control boards. Sophgo has come under scrutiny for allegedly breaching US sanctions by supplying chips to Huawei, a company subject to trade restrictions since 2019. Sophgo and Bitmain share the same CEO, Micree Zhan. After a Sophgo chip was reportedly found in a Huawei device, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) ended its business relationship with the company. Although no definitive link has been established between the import halts and this controversy, sources verified that Bitmain uses the Sophgo CV1835 chip in the Antminer T21 and certain S19 models, including the S19 XP, S19 Pro, and S19j Pro.

This Best Crypto to Buy Now Can Transform Your Portfolio,"Have you been kicking yourself for missing out on AAVE’s wild ride? You’re not alone. The crypto world has been buzzing with excitement, especially after AAVE’s recent price surge, leaving many wondering if they’ll ever catch another golden opportunity. AAVE’s meteoric climb grabbed headlines, turning heads among both seasoned investors and crypto newbies. But what if I told you the next big thing is already here? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a game-changing Web3 aggregator poised to redefine how we interact with blockchain technology. Unlike many projects that fizzle out after the hype, Qubetics offers real-world solutions to issues like privacy, interoperability, and accessibility. With its revolutionary Decentralised VPN (dVPN) and innovative asset tokenisation features, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s a tool for change. AAVE: The One That Got Away AAVE’s journey has been nothing short of spectacular. As a leading decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, AAVE allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. It’s like a financial revolution in your pocket, and its growth reflects just how much people are buying into that vision. In the past month alone, AAVE’s price surged by over 24%, leaving investors speculating whether it could hit $200 soon. Analysts are optimistic, citing increasing adoption and new developments in the protocol. AAVE continues to expand its offerings, from allowing users to earn on stablecoins to introducing features that reduce borrowing costs. But here’s the catch: if you weren’t on the AAVE bandwagon early, jumping in now might not offer the same jaw-dropping returns. For many, AAVE feels like a missed lottery ticket—a reminder that timing is everything in crypto. So, what’s the next best crypto to buy in November 2024 ? That’s where Qubetics comes into play, offering what AAVE might not anymore: untapped potential. Qubetics: Revolutionising Blockchain Connectivity If you’re looking for more than just the buzz, Qubetics is a name you’ll want to remember. It’s not about riding the hype—it’s about solving real problems. Tackling Real-Life Issues Unlike most blockchain projects that operate in silos, Qubetics acts as a Web3 aggregator. Think of it as the Swiss Army knife of blockchain: it bridges networks, enabling smooth asset transfers and seamless collaboration. Whether you’re a developer tired of jumping through hoops or a business seeking reliable cross-chain solutions, Qubetics has you covered. Take its Decentralised VPN (dVPN), for example. In a world where centralised VPNs often fail to protect user privacy, Qubetics flips the script. It decentralises data routing, ensuring that users’ information isn’t stored on a single server vulnerable to attacks. Imagine running your online business without worrying about hackers or data leaks—that’s the power of Qubetics. And for individuals? Say goodbye to geo-restrictions and targeted ads based on your browsing history. With Qubetics’ dVPN, you control your online footprint. The Numbers Don’t Lie Here’s the part that should make you sit up: Qubetics is still in its presale stage, currently selling $TICS tokens for just $0.025 each. Over 239 million tokens have been sold to more than 5000 holders, raising $3.8 million. But here’s the kicker—analysts predict $TICS could hit $15 after its mainnet launch. That’s a staggering 58,213% ROI for early investors. Think about it: an investment of $5,000 at today’s price could fetch you 200,000 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, your $5,000 grows to $200,000. And if it hits $15? You’re looking at a cool $3 million. Why Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Buy Now What sets Qubetics apart isn’t just its potential for astronomical returns; it’s the utility. From asset tokenisation to decentralised internet access, Qubetics is building tools that people will actually use. Take asset tokenisation, for example. Imagine you’re a small business owner wanting to raise capital. Instead of relying on banks, you can tokenize your assets and sell fractional ownership to investors worldwide. Artists can tokenize their works, enabling fans to own a piece of their creations. Even real estate moguls can unlock liquidity by tokenizing properties. Qubetics turns abstract blockchain concepts into real-world solutions. It’s not just another crypto; it’s a gateway to new possibilities. Don’t Miss Out If AAVE taught us anything, it’s that being late to the party can sting. But the good news? Opportunities like Qubetics don’t come around often. With the presale in full swing and prices set to increase by 10% in just a few days, now’s the time to act. So, what’s holding you back? Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting out, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy now . Secure your $TICS tokens today and be part of the next big thing in crypto. Don’t let this one slip through your fingers—you might not get another shot like this.

The ETH token was trading at $3,725, its highest level since June 7, and 75% above its lowest level in August. Crypto analysts are bullish on Ethereum price The crypto community is largely divided about Ethereum as it continues to lose market share to Solana, Sui, and layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. Ethereum’s critics point to its weak inflows in the exchange-traded funds (ETF) industry. Recently, however, we have seen some movement as inflows have risen. The cumulative total inflows jumped to over $573 million, with most of these funds flowing on November 29, when they rose by $332 million. In an X post, Wolf, a popular crypto analyst with over 100k followers, predicted that Ethereum price would hit between 9k and 10k by May next year. He pointed to technicals, which included patterns like falling wedges and regressions. If his ETH forecast is accurate, it means that the coin will jump by 177% from the current level. Such gains are common in the crypto industry, as evidenced by the recent rallies by Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) have jumped by over 200% in the past few weeks. Freedom by 40, another crypto analyst, predicte that the coin would make a parabolic move soon. He cited the fact that it was in an impulsive Elliot wave pattern, which is often a bullish sign. His view is that the coin has been in the fourth wave, and that the bullish fifth wave was starting. Freedom By 40 @Freedom_By_40 · Follow $ETH Testing a pretty big level right now but when it does break then all of a sudden Ethereum will be cool again and it’ll move quickly imo. 5:29 PM · Nov 30, 2024 119 Reply Copy link Read 9 replies ETH price analysis: golden cross points to more gains The daily chart shows that the ETH price bottomed at $2,125 in August, and has now jumped by over 70% to the current $3,675. It has moved above several key resistance levels, with the most recent one being at $3,552, its highest level on July 22nd. The coin has also jumped above the key resistance level at $2,810, its highest level on August 24 and its lowest swing on May 1. It has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since September 6. Ether has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). In most periods, this is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. It has also jumped above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $3,488. Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued pointing upwards, a sign that it has momentum. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the ETH coin is bullish, with the next point to watch being at $4,093, its highest point this year, which is about 12% above the current level. The bullish view will be contigent on whether Bitcoin continues rising, and possibly pierces the important resistance at $100,000. If this happens, Ethereum could jump to over $5,000 in December. Ethereum has strong fundamentals Despite all its woes, Ethereum still has some of the best fundamentals in the crypto industry. Its DeFi total value locked (TVL) rose by 40% in the past 30 days to over $71 billion. This amount means that it is bigger than the other ten networks, combined. The biggest players in Ethereum’s DeFi network are the likes of Lido, AAVE, EigenLayer, Maker, Uniswap, Spark, and Ethena. Ethereum is still a big player in the DEX industry, where its DEX protocols have handled volume worth over $3.12 trillion over time. The biggest of these protocols are Uniswap, Curve Finance, Pendle, Balancer, and PancakeSwap. Ethereum is still the cash king in the crypto industry as it has made over $2.5 billion in fees this year. The other top networks are Tether, Tron, Lido Finance, and Bitcoin.

The formation of a golden cross is a significant technical signal often associated with long-term bullish trends. If confirmed, this setup could drive XRP to test its next psychological resistance at $2 and possibly push toward its all-time high of $3.31. However, as with any market movement, there are critical resistance levels and potential risks that must be considered. Key Resistance Levels XRP Must Overcome 1. Immediate Resistance: $1.88 to $1.96 XRP is currently testing resistance at $1.88, with $1.96 acting as a crucial hurdle. These levels are significant for short-term price action, as breaking above them would signal a continuation of the bullish trend. Veteran analyst Peter Brandt has pointed out that $1.96 is a key inflection point. Should XRP decisively break through this level, it could trigger a wave of buying interest, setting the stage for a rally toward $2. 2. Psychological Resistance: $2 The $2 mark holds psychological importance for XRP traders and investors. Breaking above this level would not only boost market sentiment but could also attract fresh capital inflows from both retail and institutional players. 3. Long-Term Target: $3.31 If XRP sustains its upward momentum, it could aim for its previous all-time high of $3.31. This milestone, achieved during earlier bull cycles, represents a critical resistance zone that would require strong market support to overcome. The Significance of the Golden Cross for XRP The golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, such as the 50-week MA, crosses above a longer-term moving average, like the 200-week MA. This technical pattern is widely regarded as a bullish signal that suggests sustained upward momentum. Why the Golden Cross Matters: Historical Precedence: In traditional and cryptocurrency markets, golden crosses have often preceded significant price rallies. Market Sentiment: The pattern reinforces investor confidence, encouraging both retail and institutional participation. Long-Term Implications: Unlike short-term price fluctuations, a golden cross hints at a broader shift in market dynamics, favoring a prolonged bullish trend. According to technical analysts, XRP’s current setup closely mirrors conditions observed in previous bull runs, adding weight to the optimism surrounding its price movement. Broader Market Context Boosting XRP’s Momentum 1. Positive Sentiment Surrounding Ripple’s Legal Battle Ripple, the parent company behind XRP, has made progress in its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Positive developments in the case have bolstered investor confidence, driving demand for XRP. 2. Increased Adoption and Use Cases Ripple’s global payment solutions continue to expand, enhancing the utility of XRP in cross-border transactions. The growing adoption of Ripple’s technology by financial institutions worldwide has contributed to the increasing relevance of XRP in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 3. Market-Wide Bullish Trends XRP’s rally aligns with broader bullish trends in the cryptocurrency market, where several assets have seen significant price increases. This macro environment further supports XRP’s upward momentum. On-Chain Metrics Signal Continued Growth for XRP Analysts have identified several on-chain metrics that support XRP’s bullish outlook: New Capital Inflows: Metrics such as “mean dollar invested age” indicate an increase in fresh capital entering the market, a precursor to higher prices. Reduced Selling Pressure: The amount of XRP held on exchanges has decreased, suggesting reduced sell-side pressure and a higher likelihood of sustained rallies. Volume Trends: On-chain volume remains below historical highs, indicating potential for further growth as trading activity increases. These factors collectively paint a positive picture for XRP, signaling a continuation of its upward trajectory. Potential Risks and Challenges for XRP 1. Failure to Break Resistance Levels While XRP has demonstrated strong momentum, failing to break above the $1.96 or $2 levels could result in a pullback. Key support levels at $1.75 and $1.60 would then become critical to watch. 2. Broader Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and sudden shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic conditions could impact XRP’s price. 3. Regulatory Uncertainty Despite progress in Ripple’s legal battle, the outcome remains uncertain. Adverse rulings could dampen investor enthusiasm and affect XRP’s performance. Conclusion: Is XRP Ready to Break Out? XRP is positioned for a significant breakout as it approaches a golden cross and tests critical resistance levels. Breaking above $1.96 could pave the way for XRP to reach $2, a key psychological level, and potentially target its all-time high of $3.31. While the bullish momentum and positive on-chain metrics are encouraging, investors should remain cautious of potential risks, including resistance at key levels and broader market volatility. With its growing adoption, strong technical setup, and positive sentiment surrounding Ripple, XRP appears well-positioned to capitalize on the current market environment.

This 47% rise highlights CryptoPunks’ dominance in the NFT market, outpacing competitors like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) , Milady Maker , and Pudgy Penguins , which recorded more modest gains during the same period. The overall recovery in the NFT market throughout November has been bolstered by increasing investor confidence and renewed interest in blue-chip collections, with CryptoPunks leading the way. CryptoPunks Outpaces Competing Collections Comparative Performance: While the NFT market saw an average floor price increase of 34.5% across major collections in November, CryptoPunks stood out with a 47% surge, significantly outperforming its peers. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC): +7% Milady Maker: +34% Pudgy Penguins: +28% This disparity underscores CryptoPunks’ resilience and continued appeal, even amid fluctuating market conditions. Why CryptoPunks Stands Out: Historical Significance: As one of the first NFT projects, CryptoPunks holds cultural and historical value in the digital art space. Institutional Interest: Increasing participation by institutional investors in the NFT sector has amplified demand for established collections like CryptoPunks. Blue-Chip Status: Considered a “blue-chip” NFT collection, CryptoPunks attracts collectors and investors seeking stability and long-term value in the volatile NFT market. Factors Driving the NFT Market Recovery 1. Renewed Investor Confidence The NFT market experienced a downturn earlier in 2024 due to macroeconomic uncertainties and declining trading volumes. However, November’s recovery signals a shift in sentiment, driven by: Improved Macro Conditions: Stabilizing global markets have reignited interest in alternative investments like NFTs. Market Resilience: The ability of blue-chip collections to maintain value has restored investor confidence. 2. Increased Adoption of Digital Collectibles Mainstream adoption of NFTs, fueled by collaborations with brands, celebrities, and gaming platforms, has expanded the market’s reach. 3.

Its strong performance in November highlights its continued relevance and influence. Record Sales: Several high-profile CryptoPunk sales in November further cemented its position as a premium NFT collection. Community Support: A dedicated and engaged community adds to its enduring appeal, driving demand and market activity. What’s Next for CryptoPunks and the NFT Market? 1. Sustaining Momentum While CryptoPunks has led the charge, sustaining this momentum will depend on broader market conditions and the continued evolution of the NFT ecosystem. 2. Competitive Landscape As newer NFT projects and metaverse initiatives emerge, established collections like CryptoPunks must innovate to maintain their market leadership. 3.

Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over the past 90 days. An index score of 65 indicates that a majority of altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin, underscoring the dominance of altcoins in the current market cycle. What Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures market dynamics by analyzing whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin: Altcoin Season (Score: 50-100): Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Bitcoin Season (Score: 1-49): Indicates Bitcoin dominance, where 25% or fewer of the top altcoins outperform Bitcoin. The index, updated daily, provides a snapshot of market sentiment and trends. Key Takeaways from the Current Index Reading 1. Market is Firmly in Altcoin Season The sustained score of 65 suggests that altcoins have maintained their lead over Bitcoin, reflecting strong investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. 2. Stability in the Market Cycle The unchanged score from the previous day indicates a period of relative market stability, with no significant shifts in Bitcoin or altcoin performance. 3. Broader Implications for Investors Altcoin Investors: A favorable time for altcoin investors, as the majority of coins outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Holders: Could signal reduced dominance and slower short-term growth for Bitcoin relative to altcoins. How the Altcoin Season Index Works Exclusion Criteria Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the index calculation to ensure a more accurate reflection of altcoin performance. Data Collection The index tracks price changes for the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC over a rolling 90-day period.

DeFi and Layer-2 Innovations Altcoins powering decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer-2 solutions continue to see increased adoption, contributing to their strong performance. 2. NFT Market Resurgence Altcoins associated with non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems, such as Ethereum-based tokens, are benefiting from renewed interest in digital collectibles. 3. Broader Adoption Trends Institutional and retail interest in altcoins beyond Bitcoin has fueled demand, as investors diversify their portfolios. Impact on Bitcoin and the Market as a Whole Bitcoin’s Role in Altcoin Season While Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency, its underperformance relative to altcoins during Altcoin Season highlights: Reduced Short-Term Dominance: Investors are shifting focus to alternative projects with higher growth potential. Catalyst for Diversification: The current market dynamics encourage diversification into high-performing altcoins. Overall Market Health Altcoin Season often signals a healthy cryptocurrency market, characterized by increased activity, innovation, and investment. What Could Shift the Market Back to Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Price Surge: A significant rally in Bitcoin’s price could attract capital back to BTC, reducing altcoin dominance. Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity or restrictions impacting altcoins could tilt market dynamics in Bitcoin’s favor. Market Corrections: A broad market downturn could see investors consolidating assets in Bitcoin as a “safe haven.” Conclusion: Altcoin Season Shows No Signs of Slowing The Altcoin Season Index’s steady reading of 65 reinforces the strong performance of altcoins in the current market environment. For investors, this is an opportune time to explore alternative cryptocurrencies as they continue to outshine Bitcoin.

37058341,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105781,1732992412,"Bitcoin Reserves Rise at Binance and Gemini, Decline at Kraken and Bybit","Bitcoin Reserves Shift Across Major Exchanges in 2024 The year-to-date changes in Bitcoin reserves across major cryptocurrency exchanges reveal a divergence in market behavior. According to a recent report by CryptoRank.io , Binance and Gemini have experienced increases in their Bitcoin reserves, while Kraken and Bybit have seen significant reductions. These shifts highlight broader market dynamics influenced by Bitcoin price movements and trading activity. Bitcoin Reserves: A Year-to-Date Comparison Binance and Gemini: Increases in Reserves Binance: Bitcoin reserves rose from 579,000 to 586,000, reflecting increased user deposits and confidence in the exchange. Gemini: Reserves grew from 124,000 to 127,000, signaling steady demand for the platform’s secure custody services. Kraken and Bybit: Declines in Reserves Kraken: Reported a reduction in Bitcoin holdings, indicative of outflows to private wallets or alternative platforms. Bybit: Experienced a similar trend, with users withdrawing Bitcoin, possibly due to market volatility or operational preferences. Understanding the Broader Trend 1. Rising Bitcoin Prices and Market Activity Periods of rising Bitcoin prices often correlate with reduced reserves on centralized exchanges. This trend occurs as: Investors Move to Private Wallets: Users secure their holdings in private wallets to safeguard against exchange risks. Increased Trading Activity: Higher market activity can lead to fluctuations in reserves as Bitcoin is moved in and out of exchanges for trading. 2. Exchange-Specific Factors Binance and Gemini’s Growth: Binance’s increase may reflect its dominance as the world’s largest crypto exchange, attracting new deposits. Gemini’s focus on institutional-grade security and regulatory compliance appeals to long-term holders. Kraken and Bybit’s Declines: Outflows from Kraken and Bybit could be driven by users seeking alternative platforms or non-custodial solutions. Why Bitcoin Reserves Matter Bitcoin reserves on exchanges serve as a key metric for understanding market sentiment and liquidity: Low Reserves: Often signal reduced selling pressure as users move Bitcoin off exchanges, indicating bullish sentiment. High Reserves: Suggest greater liquidity, enabling easier transactions but potentially increasing selling pressure during downturns. Potential Implications for the Crypto Market 1. Increased Institutional Interest The growth in reserves at regulated platforms like Gemini may indicate rising institutional participation. Institutions often prefer exchanges with robust security and compliance measures. 2. Bullish Indicators The decline in reserves at Kraken and Bybit aligns with a broader trend of users securing their holdings, a behavior typically observed during bull markets. 3. Shifting User Preferences User behavior varies by platform, influenced by factors like: Fee structures. Security features. Accessibility and trading options. How Exchanges Are Adapting to Reserve Shifts Binance: Continuing to dominate with its wide range of trading pairs, liquidity, and user incentives. Gemini: Focusing on security, regulatory compliance, and institutional services to attract long-term investors. Kraken and Bybit: Potentially reviewing strategies to retain users and mitigate reserve declines, such as introducing new features or improving user experience. Conclusion: A Dynamic Market Landscape The shifts in Bitcoin reserves at Binance, Gemini, Kraken, and Bybit reflect evolving market trends and user behavior. While Binance and Gemini show growth driven by user confidence and institutional interest, Kraken and Bybit face challenges in retaining reserves. For investors, these reserve trends offer valuable insights into market sentiment and liquidity dynamics. As Bitcoin continues to grow in prominence, understanding these metrics will remain critical for navigating the complex crypto ecosystem.

The index remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone, signaling heightened bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Provided by Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a widely-used indicator of market emotions, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). The index reflects the collective sentiment of market participants and can often predict potential shifts in market trends. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index How the Index Works The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is calculated using six weighted factors: Volatility (25%) – Measures recent price swings and compares them to average volatility. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) – Tracks trading volume and momentum to identify surges in buying activity. Social Media (15%) – Analyzes sentiment across platforms like Twitter to gauge public interest. Surveys (15%) – Incorporates polling data from investors (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – Evaluates Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%) – Measures interest in cryptocurrency-related searches. A score above 75 places the market in the Extreme Greed zone, while a score below 25 indicates Extreme Fear . What Does an Index Score of 84 Indicate? 1. Elevated Market Optimism The current score reflects widespread bullish sentiment, driven by: Improved Market Conditions: Recent rallies in Bitcoin and altcoins have renewed confidence among investors. Increased Participation: Higher trading volumes and social media activity point to growing interest. 2. Potential Overextension While a high score can signal optimism, it may also suggest that the market is overheated. Risk of Corrections: Extreme Greed often precedes market pullbacks as over-leveraged positions unwind. Factors Driving the Current Sentiment 1. Bitcoin’s Price Performance Bitcoin’s recent stability above key support levels has bolstered market sentiment. As the leading cryptocurrency, its performance heavily influences the index. 2. Strong Altcoin Momentum The Altcoin Season Index also reflects robust altcoin activity, complementing Bitcoin’s dominance and further boosting investor confidence. 3. Social Media Buzz Social platforms are rife with bullish discussions, signaling increased retail investor engagement. Memecoins and high-profile project updates have added to the excitement. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Bullish Scenarios: Continued Momentum: If Bitcoin and altcoins maintain their upward trajectory, the index could stay in Extreme Greed for an extended period. Institutional Support: Positive news from institutions or regulatory clarity could further strengthen sentiment.

37058299,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105787,1732992338,Brazil’s Central Bank Considers Ban on Stablecoin Withdrawals to Self-Custody Wallets,"Brazil Proposes Stablecoin Withdrawal Ban to Self-Custody Wallets The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has announced plans to regulate the withdrawal of stablecoins from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) to self-custody wallets. This proposed measure, aimed at protecting international capital flow integrity, signals a significant shift in how digital assets may be governed in Brazil. According to a report by CryptoSlate , the BCB’s proposed regulation is part of a broader effort to integrate digital assets into the country’s financial system while maintaining robust oversight. A public consultation period, open until February 28, 2025, will allow stakeholders to provide input on the potential impacts of the measure. Key Details of the Proposed Regulation 1. Targeting Stablecoin Withdrawals The regulation specifically focuses on stablecoins, digital assets pegged to fiat currencies or other assets, due to their perceived risk in cross-border financial flows. Why Stablecoins? Stablecoins offer the stability of fiat currencies with the efficiency of blockchain technology, making them a preferred choice for remittances and cross-border transactions. Centralized vs. Self-Custody: The proposed rule would limit users to keeping stablecoins within CEXs, restricting transfers to private wallets where the central bank has no visibility. 2. Protecting Capital Flows The BCB highlighted its commitment to ensuring the integrity of international capital flows. Preventing Illegal Activities: Limiting self-custody could reduce risks related to money laundering and tax evasion. Increased Transparency: Keeping stablecoins within regulated platforms would enhance monitoring and compliance. 3. Public Consultation Period The regulation’s public consultation phase, ending February 28, 2025, invites market participants to share their opinions and concerns. Inclusivity in Decision-Making: This approach reflects the central bank’s effort to balance innovation with regulation. Potential Adjustments: Stakeholder feedback may influence the final version of the regulation. Implications for Users and the Market For Individual Users: Loss of Autonomy: Restricting access to self-custody wallets could undermine the core principles of decentralization and financial sovereignty. Increased Reliance on CEXs: Users may have to trust centralized exchanges for storing and managing stablecoins, raising concerns about security and custodial risks. For Exchanges: Operational Adjustments: CEXs may need to implement additional compliance measures to align with the new regulation. Potential User Outflows: Restrictions could drive users toward decentralized platforms or non-stablecoin assets. For the Crypto Ecosystem: Impact on Innovation: Limiting self-custody could stifle innovation in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). Global Repercussions: Brazil’s approach could set a precedent for other countries evaluating stablecoin regulations. Why Is Brazil Considering This Regulation? 1. Aligning with Global Standards Brazil’s move mirrors global discussions on regulating stablecoins. G7 Recommendations: The G7 has emphasized the importance of regulating stablecoins to mitigate risks to financial stability. Other Jurisdictions: Countries like the United States and the European Union are also exploring frameworks for stablecoin oversight. 2. Integrating Digital Assets into Financial Systems The BCB aims to create a regulatory framework that integrates digital assets while ensuring financial system integrity. 3. Combating Financial Crimes Restricting self-custody wallets can enhance oversight and reduce opportunities for illicit financial activities. Concerns and Criticisms 1. Erosion of Financial Sovereignty Critics argue that restricting self-custody wallets undermines users’ ability to control their assets. 2. Potential for Overregulation Overly restrictive measures could drive innovation and economic activity away from Brazil to jurisdictions with more favorable policies. 3. Security Risks with CEXs Mandating the use of centralized exchanges increases reliance on custodial platforms, which are more vulnerable to hacks and operational failures. What’s Next? Public Consultation Phase: The consultation period provides an opportunity for stakeholders to voice concerns and propose alternatives. Potential Outcomes: The BCB may revise the regulation based on feedback. If implemented, the regulation could reshape how stablecoins are used in Brazil. Global Influence: As one of the leading economies in Latin America, Brazil’s regulatory approach could influence how other countries address stablecoin self-custody. Conclusion: Balancing Innovation and Regulation Brazil’s proposed regulation on stablecoin withdrawals reflects its commitment to maintaining financial oversight while integrating digital assets into the mainstream economy. While the measure aims to enhance transparency and security, it raises significant concerns about user autonomy and the future of decentralized finance. As the public consultation progresses, market participants will play a crucial role in shaping the outcome. The final decision will likely have far-reaching implications, both within Brazil and globally.

He promotes Bitcoin as a safe investment, alongside gold and silver, and advises against saving cash in traditional ways. Robert Kiyosaki believes that saving money the old way will cause people to lose wealth over time and it’s not a better way to get rich. He adds that investing in tangible assets like Bitcoin is a better way to protect and grow one’s wealth. In an X post , Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, the average and middle-class person will find it difficult to get involved in the crypto market. He believes that the ultra-rich, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will definitely dominate Bitcoin ownership as its price increases. Kiyosaki’s warning has created different opinions. Many of his followers on X disagreed with his statement, saying that Bitcoin is decentralized and can be bought in small fractions, and it will be accessible to anyone, no matter their wealth position. They even argued if Bitcoin hits $1 million, people can still invest in it with smaller amounts. Kiyosaki’s investment plan De spite his warnings, Kiyosaki revealed he plans to continue purchasing Bitcoin until it breaks the $100,000 barrier. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author shared his belief in the importance of owning safe assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, adding that holding cash is not a wise strategy today. He stated “Cash is trash,” a reminder to not rely on traditional currencies like the dollar or euro. Kiyosaki’s recent remarks on Bitcoin’s future come as the coin sees a 154% increase on a year-to-date and a 35% jump in the past month alone. Once Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, he stated that he will stop buying, to caution against greedy. Robert Kiyosaki’s strategy is to buy assets when prices are low and sell them once their value increases – something traders will refer to as “long-term value rather than short-term speculation.” The American businessman isn’t the only one predicting big things for Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, predicts that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 by 2025 and even reach over $1 million by 2030. Kiyosaki believes Bitcoin could go as high as $13 million per coin in the next decade.

37058234,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105815,1732992244,CryptoQuant Sets $146K Bitcoin Price Target Using Realized Price Valuation,"CryptoQuant Projects $146K Bitcoin Price Target Based on Realized Price On-chain data platform CryptoQuant has identified a $146,000 price target for Bitcoin, derived from the realized price valuation metric. According to CryptoQuant, the realized price —representing the average price at which Bitcoin was last moved on-chain—has historically provided critical insights into market cycles. The highest target price of $146K corresponds to the upper resistance band within the realized price framework. Notably, Bitcoin touched this upper band during its April-May 2021 rally, a period that coincided with the cryptocurrency’s cycle peak. What is Realized Price Valuation? 1. Realized Price Defined The realized price is an on-chain metric that calculates the average acquisition cost of Bitcoin across the network. Unlike the market price, which reflects current trading activity, realized price focuses on the value stored on the blockchain: Calculation Method: Realized price is the total value of all Bitcoins at their last on-chain transaction price divided by the total supply. Significance: It provides a deeper understanding of market sentiment and investor behavior. 2. Upper Resistance Band CryptoQuant uses the realized price to create valuation bands, with the upper band serving as a resistance level historically associated with market cycle tops. Historical Context: 2021 Bitcoin Rally During Bitcoin’s April-May 2021 rally, the price touched the upper resistance band derived from realized price. At that time: Cycle Peak: Bitcoin achieved its highest value in that market cycle, surpassing $60,000. Resistance Confirmation: The realized price band acted as a reliable indicator for overbought conditions, marking the market’s eventual pullback. Why $146K? Key Factors Behind the Target 1. Market Cycles and Realized Price Trends Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests a strong correlation between realized price resistance and market cycle peaks. The current cycle may follow a similar trajectory, with $146K representing the next potential peak based on these patterns. 2. Growing Institutional Adoption Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has accelerated, driven by: The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Increased participation from financial institutions. Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a hedge against inflation. 3. On-Chain Metrics Supporting Bullish Momentum Other on-chain indicators, such as the long-term holder cost basis and supply dynamics , align with CryptoQuant’s projection, indicating that the market is poised for further growth. Caveats and Risks to Consider 1. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s inherent volatility could lead to significant deviations from the projected target. External factors, such as macroeconomic conditions or regulatory developments, may impact its trajectory. 2. Over-Reliance on Historical Patterns While realized price has been a reliable indicator in the past, market conditions evolve, and historical patterns may not always predict future outcomes. 3. Resistance at Key Levels Bitcoin’s ability to break through psychological and technical resistance levels—such as $100K—will be crucial in achieving the $146K target. What Needs to Happen for Bitcoin to Hit $146K? 1. Sustained Bullish Momentum The broader cryptocurrency market must maintain its current upward trajectory, supported by strong trading volumes and positive sentiment. 2. Institutional Support Increased inflows from institutional investors, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs, could drive the price higher. 3. Macro and Regulatory Tailwinds Favorable macroeconomic conditions and regulatory clarity will be critical in fostering market confidence and sustained demand. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook with Caveats CryptoQuant’s $146K Bitcoin price target, based on realized price valuation, reflects a bullish outlook grounded in historical data and on-chain analysis. While the metric has proven reliable in identifying cycle peaks, achieving this target will depend on favorable market conditions and sustained demand. Investors should approach such projections with caution, balancing optimism with the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market.

37058233,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105834,1732992212,FTX Stock: Understanding Its Role in the Financial Ecosystem,"What Is FTX Stock? FTX was a leading cryptocurrency exchange, known for its innovative products and services, including derivatives, spot markets, and tokenized stocks. However, it is essential to clarify that FTX is not a publicly traded company , meaning there is no “FTX stock” available for trading on traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. FTX operated as a private company, backed by significant venture capital investments before its widely publicized collapse in 2022. FTX and Equity Investment Pre-Collapse Equity Funding Before its bankruptcy, FTX attracted substantial funding from leading venture capital firms and institutional investors, including: Sequoia Capital SoftBank Tiger Global Management These investments valued the company at $32 billion at its peak, making it one of the most valuable companies in the cryptocurrency sector. Tokenized Stocks FTX offered tokenized stocks, which allowed users to gain exposure to traditional equities in a crypto-friendly format. These products mirrored the price of real stocks but were not FTX equity themselves. Why There’s No FTX Stock Available Private Ownership FTX was a privately held company and did not go public, meaning retail investors could not buy shares through traditional stock exchanges. Bankruptcy Proceedings Following its collapse in November 2022 due to liquidity issues and allegations of fraud, FTX entered bankruptcy proceedings. Any potential equity associated with the company has been tied up in legal disputes and liquidation efforts. What Happened to FTX? Collapse Overview FTX faced a liquidity crisis in late 2022, exacerbated by mismanagement of customer funds and financial practices involving its sister company, Alameda Research. The scandal led to: CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s Resignation Global Regulatory Investigations Billions in Customer Losses Legal and Financial Fallout The collapse has triggered ongoing lawsuits, with investors, customers, and creditors seeking to recover lost funds. Lessons from FTX’s Downfall 1. Importance of Transparency The lack of financial transparency in FTX’s operations highlights the need for stricter regulations in the crypto space. 2. Risks in Centralized Platforms FTX’s failure underscores the risks associated with centralized exchanges, prompting a shift toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. 3. Due Diligence in Investing Investors are reminded to carefully vet companies, especially in volatile sectors like cryptocurrency. Future of Cryptocurrency Exchange Stocks Publicly Traded Crypto Companies While FTX itself is not a tradable stock, other crypto companies like Coinbase ($COIN) and Robinhood ($HOOD) are available on traditional stock exchanges. Potential Revival or Acquisition There have been discussions about the possibility of restructuring or relaunching FTX under new management. Any such revival could potentially involve equity offerings in the future. Conclusion: The Current State of FTX Stock Although there is no FTX stock available, the story of FTX serves as a cautionary tale about the risks and rewards of investing in the crypto sector.

VIRTUAL appears to be facing a similar fate to other coins that have experienced significant crashes in recent days, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) deeply lodged in overbought territory at 81. When the RSI reaches such levels, it typically signals that the asset has been exhausted by its recent gains, making a correction the natural and healthy next step to find more stable footing for its next leg up.

37057910,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311165,1732991596,"$16,800,000 Drained From Official Bank Accounts As Uganda Central Bank Hacked: Report","Uganda’s central bank just confirmed rumors of a hack, revealing a trove of cash has been drained from the nation’s official bank accounts. The Bank of Uganda says police are launching an investigation into the theft of 62 billion Ugandan shillings, worth $16.8 million, reports Reuters. The hacking group “Waste” claims it’s responsible for the breach, according to the state-owned news outlet Vision. State minister of finance, Henry Musasizi, says some initial reports on the hack are overblown. “It is true our accounts were hacked into but not to the extent of what is being reported. When this happened, we instituted an audit and at the same time, and investigation.” As the investigation kicks off, Vision says unnamed sources at the bank say some of the money has been sent to Japan, and half of the money that was taken has been successfully recovered. Meanwhile, the Daily Monitor, which is the largest independent newspaper in the country, says early indications suggest the breach may have been at least partially an inside job.

37057846,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620501,1732991048,Russia’s economy might’ve never been as strong as it seemed,"Russia’s economy is wobbling under a mountain of pressure, and the cracks are becoming harder to hide. This week, the ruble plunged to 114 against the dollar, its weakest since the chaotic days following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The timing couldn’t be worse for President Vlad Putin, whose forces are still bombing Ukrainian cities and eking out incremental gains on the eastern front. While Russia insists it has everything under control, the numbers tell a different story, one that suggests the economy may never have been as strong as the Kremlin made it out to be. Putin is not worried The latest ruble crash followed a fresh round of U.S. sanctions targeting Gazprombank, Russia’s primary financial artery for energy payments. These sanctions hit hard, disrupting Moscow’s ability to fund its ongoing war efforts. Russia’s Central Bank had to step in, halting foreign purchases of rubles to stabilize its battered currency. The intervention brought minor relief, with the ruble trading at 110 against the dollar by Thursday. But the damage is already done, and experts are questioning how long Moscow can keep up the facade of economic strength. Putin, as expected, brushed off concerns, saying seasonal factors and budget-related issues triggered the ruble’s slide. “There are absolutely no grounds for panic,” he told reporters. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also claimed the currency’s performance won’t affect ordinary Russians since their incomes are in rubles anyway. But for a country neck-deep in sanctions and fighting a costly war, this optimism feels like wishful thinking. China: Russia’s lifeline under sanctions Meanwhile, Moscow has found an unlikely savior in China. Beijing has become Russia’s largest supplier of goods banned under Western sanctions, filling critical gaps in everything from technology to machinery. The two countries now bypass the dollar in their transactions, relying heavily on the yuan. Economists warn that this dynamic could backfire in the long run. It’s easy to see why. The ruble’s decline isn’t just about sanctions. Inflation in Russia is climbing, fueled by skyrocketing government spending on the war. The Central Bank’s tight monetary policies are meant to keep inflation in check, but they’ve triggered a clash within Russia’s power circles. Officially, Russia’s economy seems to be holding up. The International Monetary Fund predicts 3.6% GDP growth for 2024, putting Russia among the world’s fastest-growing economies outside India and China. Russian officials proudly cite growth rates of 5.4% and 4.1% for the first two quarters of 2023. On paper, this looks like a victory for Mr. Putin. But critics argue that these numbers are more propaganda than reality. Since the invasion, the Kremlin has weaponized economic data, using it to project an image of resilience. Vladimir Milov, an economist and exiled opposition activist, has questioned the reliability of these figures, noting that the government’s tight grip on data makes it impossible to separate fact from fiction. Even William Pomeranz of the Wilson Center has warned that the economy might be sitting on a “social explosion,” with rising costs and falling incomes pushing Russians to the brink. Labor shortages and supply chain disruptions are adding to the strain. The war has drained Russia’s workforce, leaving industries scrambling to fill gaps. Meanwhile, the cost of living continues to rise, with food and energy prices putting extra pressure on households. The government has tried to put the blame on Western sanctions, calling them the main driver of inflation. Even the military budget, which has ballooned since the invasion, is feeling the squeeze. A recent decree cut state payments for certain categories of wounded soldiers, which brought outrage. Balancing butter and guns Moscow’s “guns over butter” strategy has its limits, and the flaws are showing. Putin has denied that rising defense spending comes at the expense of ordinary Russians. The government is pouring money into weapons production and military operations, leaving little room for other priorities. This imbalance is unsustainable, especially as sanctions tighten and oil revenues become less reliable. Energy exports have been Russia’s saving grace, keeping cash flowing even as Western markets shut their doors. Countries willing to ignore the war, like China and India, have continued buying Russian oil and gas. But even this lifeline is under threat. The global push for renewable energy and falling oil prices are eroding Russia’s energy dominance, leaving the Kremlin with fewer options. The IMF’s latest forecast predicts a sharp slowdown in 2025, with growth expected to drop to just 1.3%. Slower wage growth, reduced private investment, and a tightening labor market are all contributing factors. While Russia may claim short-term victories, the long-term outlook is bleak.

37057527,https://thecoinrise.com/pump-fun-metrics-plunge-following-livestream-feature-shutdown/,1732990664,Pump.Fun Metrics Plunge Following Livestream Feature Shutdown,"Pump.fun, a decentralized memecoin launchpad platform that once stood at the forefront of simplifying crypto creation, has hit a major stumbling block. The platform’s foray into live-streaming content, initially designed to engage and attract users, ultimately took a dark turn. The platform faced an overwhelming backlash that was impossible to ignore. This comes as the streams were flooded with disturbing content, including explicit material, violence, and death, making it impossible to ignore. Amid growing calls for its shutdown, Pump.fun finally pulled the plug on its live-stream function, but the fallout was immediate and severe. Pump.fun Sees A Sharp Decline in User Activity The immediate consequence of the livestream suspension has been a sharp decline in user engagement. According to data from Dune Analytics, the number of addresses creating new tokens fell by 50%. The platform saw an influx of 37,134 token creators slashed in half to just 14,952 in 24 hours. This loss of activity is hitting Pump.fun hard, especially in terms of its revenue from fees. Previously, the platform enjoyed steady daily fee revenues of over $2 million, with a peak of $14.35 million in November. 23. However, by November. 28, those figures took a dramatic turn, dipping under $2 million for the first time in nearly two weeks. This revenue plunge directly results from the falling user engagement and the steep drop in new token creators. Pump.fun’s Livestream Shutdown Takes a Heavy Toll The livestream feature had become central to the platform’s success, and its removal has left a void. In November. 27, active users peaked at 282,560, while new users hit 152,358. However, by November 28, those numbers had plummeted. Active users on the platform have dropped by 69.4%, falling to 86,245, and new users decreased by 76.5%, down to just 35,711. Even trading volumes took a massive hit, sinking by over 60%. Daily transactions fell from 3.27 million to 1.29 million, dragging total volumes from $283.62 million to $103.31 million. The Future of Pump.fun: Can It Recover? With the livestream feature now suspended, many are speculating what the future holds for Pump.fun. The platform’s decline in user activity suggests that the livestream was not just a side feature but a core driver of engagement. Some believe the team may reinstate live streaming once they improve content moderation controls. However, whether the platform can recover from this setback remains uncertain. One thing is clear: Pump.fun now faces a significant challenge. It is still being determined whether or not it can regain its footing without the controversial livestream feature. The next few weeks will reveal if it can maintain its position in the competitive world of crypto-based platforms.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pink-shiba-inu-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

These assets have raised their heads high amid discussions about their long-term potential. As these cryptos strive for a bullish success story, Rollblock, a new crypto, has entered the arena, capturing investors’ imagination with an exceptional use case that is hard to ignore. Rollblock’s innovation makes it a pioneering figure revitalizing the online gambling industry, worth over $500 billion and projected to grow by 50% in 2025. This text has everything we know about these developments and what they mean for investors. Rollblock: The breakout crypto sensation takes the market by storm While XRP and ADA make a show of their unprecedented rallies, Rollblock, the new crypto sensation, is quietly building steam and capturing investors’ interest as it prepares for its upcoming bullish trend. Experts believe Rollblock will dominate the upcoming bull run with its explosive presale momentum. Also, as the demand for GambleFi tokens like Rollblock continues to reach new heights, analysts predict that this new crypto will break out soon – delivering over 880% gains for its early adopters. Another reason behind the optimism surrounding the Rollblock token is the rich fundamentals that set it apart in the crowded crypto space. Besides big gains, Rollblock appeals to investors with its unique revenue-sharing model, which allows holders to enjoy passive income. Weekly, Rollblock allows its early investors to get a 40% share of its revenue through staking rewards on the platform. The remaining 60% will be used for regular token buybacks that are burned immediately to ensure the RBLK price soars to new heights. ADA growth to continue fueled by ecosystem expansion ADA’s recent performance has been impressive, with the Cardano price gaining over 40% from last month’s high. This growth emanates from ADA’s increasing network growth and rising user engagement. Analysts believe this growth will continue steadily to ADA’s ATH at $3. After a brief consolidation in Uptober, the Cardano price is gaining momentum again, and the on-chain metrics show its upward trend will continue in 2025. In addition to these positive sentiments, ADA’s ecosystem enhancement following the successful launch of the first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on the Cardano mainnet is propelling it to new resistance levels. This marks a major milestone in the layer-1 network, already reflected in the Cardano price. Ripple’s regulatory clarity drives optimism Like the Cardano price, XRP is riding positive momentum as its price spiked to $1.46 and gained over 25% from last month. This shift in momentum for the XRP price has given its token holders hope for a more lenient regulatory standing with the SEC. The XRP wave of positive momentum is poised to continue following the announcement of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation, scheduled for early 2025. Several XRP predictions have been made, with a more conservative approach predicting an XRP price surge to $1.70. However, more bullish predictions are seeing the Ripple price surge past its ATH and close to $4. Conclusion The momentum behind the Cardano price and XRP reflects the resilience and innovativeness of the crypto market, offering investors promising investment opportunities. For those seeking diversification, the Rollblock token presale presents a high-reward opportunity at $0.037. Take action before it’s too late!

Interestingly, popular analyst EGRAG Crypto has weighed in on the discourse around a highly-anticipated altseason, predicting a potential market inflow of $627 billion. Bitcoin Dominance To Crash By 33% As Altcoins Fly – Analyst In an X post on Friday , EGRAG Crypto provided valuable insight on the market growth potential of altcoins in the upcoming altseason. The analyst employed the Volume Range Visible Profile (VRVP), an analysis tool to identify key support and resistance levels based on trading volume, to study the trading activity of Bitcoin across different dominance levels. For context, the alt season is a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation. It is characterized by a relative decline in Bitcoin’s market share as capital moves into other cryptocurrencies. As shown in the weekly chart below, EGRAG Crypto notes that Bitcoin’s dominance is closing below its Value Area High (VAH) i.e. the upper boundary of heavy trading activity which currently acts as a resistance zone. This development is particularly bullish for altcoins as it signals increasing selling pressure on Bitcoin which may weaken its dominance over other assets. Importantly, EGRAG Crypto also highlights the Value Area Low (VAL) i.e. lower boundary of heavy trading activity which is likely to act as support and target level for Bitcoin dominance in this altseason. According to values drawn by the analyst, BTC Dominance will decline by 33.04% if it reaches its Value Area Low. Therefore, considering Bitcoin’s current market cap of $1.91 trillion, the altcoins are likely to record new inflows of $627 billion in the forthcoming weeks. In addition, EGRAG Crypto also states Bitcoin Dominance will have a Point of Control (POC) target of 42% in this altseason. The POC represents a pivotal price/dominance level with the most trading volume and a decline below which signals a confirmative shift in market interest from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum Remains Key To Altseason Charge With more expert commentary on the altseason, analyst Michaël Van de Poppe has appraised the positive price performances of altcoins in the past month. Furthermore, the analyst states that if Ethereum (ETH) , the largest altcoin by market cap, closes above 0.035 on the ETH/BTC chart for November, it will suggest a strong bullish period for altcoins in December. At the time of writing, the altcoin market remains valued at $1.39 trillion representing 41.4% of the total crypto market cap.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-set-for-627-billion-inflow-as-altseason-prepares-for-takeoff/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37056829.jpeg

37058828,https://cryptonews.com/?p=314780,1732989600,Central Bankers’ Enthusiasm for CBDCs Wanes Despite Growing Research: OMFIF Survey,"Central bankers are losing enthusiasm for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) despite a continued rise in research efforts. While CBDCs once appeared to be a promising tool for enhancing cross-border payments, their popularity has declined sharply, according to the latest annual Future of Payments survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF). The report detailed that only 13% of respondents in 2024 favored CBDCs as a solution, down from 31% in 2023. Central Bankers Favor Interlinking Instant Payment Systems Instead, nearly half of the surveyed central bankers (47%) chose interlinking instant payment systems, such as the U.S. FedNow service, as the preferred path forward. Stablecoins, by contrast, received zero votes for the second consecutive year, reflecting a lack of confidence among central bankers in their ability to enhance the global financial infrastructure. The decline in CBDC interest coincides with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) withdrawing from Project mBridge, a multi-CBDC project led by China and other nations less aligned with Western geopolitical interests. While the BIS denied political motivations, the move underscores tensions surrounding the adoption of CBDCs on the global stage. Furthermore, the survey emphasized the U.S. dollar’s enduring dominance, with just 11% of central banks reporting a reduction in dollar usage, largely due to geopolitical uncertainties driving demand for the dollar as a safe haven. What will shape the future of cross-border payments? With the market projected to reach US$290 trillion by 2030, EY’s latest report on the future of global payments is an important deep dive into drivers behind this growth and the innovations reshaping the industry. Swift’s… pic.twitter.com/BJK0Vnhug2 — Swift (@swiftcommunity) November 29, 2024 The survey also highlighted challenges facing the correspondent banking system, which has long facilitated international settlements but is increasingly seen as outdated and costly due to complex Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. The delayed adoption of the ISO 20022 messaging standard is likely to exacerbate this decline, pushing central banks to explore alternatives like tokenization. Over 40% of developed-market central banks view tokenization as a promising innovation, with plans to begin work on it within the next three to five years. Tokenized systems, which streamline compliance checks, could redefine cross-border payments. Traditional Instant Payment Systems Remian Preferred Solution Despite this, traditional instant payment systems remain the preferred solution for central bankers. The BIS’s Project Nexus, which relies on the ISO 20022 standard, is creating a unified platform for linking instant payment systems globally. Meanwhile, projects like Agora, involving wholesale CBDCs, are exploring tokenized solutions. However, the OMFIF survey suggests that for now, the future of cross-border payments lies firmly within the realm of legacy financial systems, rather than blockchain-based innovations. Just recently, India’s Reserve Bank (RBI) announced that it is moving forward cautiously with the rollout of its CBDC, the e-rupee. While the RBI sees the potential of CBDCs in reshaping the financial landscape, Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar stated that a full understanding of the technology’s impact is necessary before expanding its usage. More than 130 countries, representing nearly 98% of global GDP, are actively exploring digital currencies, according to the Atlantic Council. China, Jamaica, and Nigeria are among the nations already advancing their CBDCs, with India closely monitoring global developments as it progresses with its digital currency.

Hold $SLAP in your wallet Connect your wallet to the site SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP Get ranked on the leaderboard $SLAP rewards coming soon Get slappin: https://t.co/WIxjg08wEb pic.twitter.com/dn6RyrzN9G — CatSlap (@CatSlapToken) November 29, 2024 Not only is there new P2E functionality but the next burn will take place when the Catslap Slapometer reaches 25,000,000 – it is currently at 23 million. Slap-to-Earn plus Burns and Buybacks will help send $SLAP to the moon The burn program is a genius move by the team that backs the viral appeal of the feline slapper with real utility. Go to the Catslap Burn Dashboard to see all the transactions. Next burn milestone: 25,000,000 slaps Get slappin: https://t.co/WIxjg08wEb pic.twitter.com/XQyziaon4U — CatSlap (@CatSlapToken) November 30, 2024 From the outset tokens are burned when stakers unlock their tokens early, so there are two burning streams bolstering the value of the circulating supply. Meanwhile, the team has been buying back tokens in the open market – a new Catslap Buyback Dashboard shows the transactions. Buyback is yet another price-supportive initiative from the Catslap team, and it is paying off. $SLAP tokens are trading at $0.0034 in decisive steps higher over the past 24 hours after some consolidation. Huge liquidity of $4.4m shows Catslap is ready for prime time – start slapping! All of this comes on the back of a gigantic increase in liquidity in the SLAP/ETH trading pair on decentralized exchanges to $4.4 million; preparing the market for the entry of a wall of new money. Fully diluted market capitalization has surpassed $30 million and the community social media footprint of followers is growing by around 10% a day. The number of followers on X is now 10,100 and 2,271 on Telegram. There are now two ways to slap. Users can continue slapping like usual without earning leaderboard points – selecting the character they wish to slap the most. Alternatively, users can select ‘Slap to Earn’, which will bring up the leaderboard, with a wallet connect option. Once the wallet is connected and holding $SLAP tokens, the user can then slap to earn points and rank in the leaderboard. Consequently, users will notice that there is an additional leaderboard listing the rankings of users’ wallet addresses alongside the original leaderboard showing the country rankings. All of this adds to the addictive competitive fun. Users see their own individual slap count clearly displayed. Click on the country leaderboard and you will see the Slapometer total. The next burn will likely be happening in the next couple of hours as there are less than two million slaps to go before the next burn event takes place, when the 25 million milestone is reached: Next, let’s take a closer look at the Catslap Burn Dashboard . To date, 12,560,571 tokens, valued at $46,175, have been burned. There’s not long to wait for the milestone burn event, so expect another price pump. $77,969 worth of $SLAP buybacks to help the price kill another zero The Catslap Buyback Dashboard, launched yesterday, is accessible from a link at the top of the homepage. The team’s $SLAP token buybacks total 21,206,509, equivalent to $77,969. As stated on the buyback dashboard page, this frenetic activity is aimed at contributing to slapping a zero off the token price. Community members are impressed by the trouble-free rapid rollout of the new features, as can be seen in the price, but also the reaction of the highly engaged community on Telegram. And there’s staking too – earn 40% a year rewards Staking has been up and running since the launch of the project and token holders can earn 40% a year in $SLAP rewards. To quote directly from the team: Staking means locking up your Catslap tokens to earn rewards. When you stake, your tokens gradually unlock over 7 days—this is called vesting. If you decide to unstake early, any tokens that haven’t unlocked yet will be burned (permanently lost). For example: After 3.5 days (half of 7 days), 50% of your tokens will have unlocked. If you unstake then, you’ll get back the unlocked 50%, but the remaining 50% will be burned. If you wait the full 7 days, all your tokens will unlock, and you can unstake without any loss. You can stake or unstake your tokens here: https://catslaptoken.com/en/staking Lastly, the centralized exchange (CEX) listing will be announced in four days’ time, which is also driving FOMO around the project. In addition to trending on DexTools and Dexscreener, Catslap has been appearing regularly on Crypto.com’s ‘most popular’ viewed tokens rankings. It is not known whether Crypto.com will list $SLAP, but CEXs are hungry to be the first to grab the trading volumes of up-and-coming meme coins like Catslap. Buy $SLAP using Best Wallet or directly from the Catslap website Web3 crypto wallet Best Wallet is fast making a name for itself in crypto and its ‘Upcoming Tokens’ feature may be the star that makes it shine so brightly.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) was introduced in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. Created by software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it features the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin is designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially perceived as a joke, it quickly developed a substantial online community and gained attention for its playful approach to digital currency. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge in value, becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization with a total value exceeding $50 billion. This growth was influenced by social media activity and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. The coin is based on Litecoin’s technology, offering quick transaction times and low fees. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains a widely recognized cryptocurrency with active community support. Its accessibility and active trading make it a notable participant in the crypto market. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum. It was created as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme by Matt Furie, which gained popularity in the early 2000s. The project aims to capitalize on the success of other meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE seeks to establish itself among the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. It appeals to the crypto community with a no-tax policy and transparency about its lack of utility, embracing its identity as a pure memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market cap reaching a high of $1.6 billion at one point. Early holders saw substantial gains, and a strong community formed around the coin. This surge contributed to what some refer to as a “memecoin season,” with many new memecoins experiencing rapid price movements. The PEPE roadmap includes three phases, starting with listings on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter, progressing to listings on centralized exchanges, and culminating in “tier 1” exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” The coin’s performance reflects the dynamic nature of the memecoin market in the current cycle. First Neiro On Ethereum (NEIRO) Neiro Token is a new cryptocurrency launched on the Ethereum blockchain, inspired by Neiro, a recently adopted Shiba Inu dog owned by the same woman who cared for Kabosu, the famous dog behind the Doge meme. This project serves as a tribute to Neiro and is the first token dedicated to her on Ethereum. Completely owned and managed by its community, Neiro Token aims to build a supportive network around the charm of Neiro. Utilizing Ethereum’s established blockchain technology, Neiro Token benefits from a secure and decentralized platform. The community-driven nature of the project allows holders to influence its development and direction. In the current market cycle, where community engagement and meme-inspired tokens have significant attention, Neiro Token adds a new dimension by connecting to the legacy of the Doge meme. Its appeal lies in the combination of a beloved cultural icon and the active participation of its community members. Popcat (POPCAT) The POPCAT token is a meme coin that draws inspiration from the Popcat internet meme of October 2020. The meme features two images of a cat named Oatmeal—one with a closed mouth and another edited to show an open, ‘O’-shaped mouth. This simple yet amusing meme gained widespread popularity online. The POPCAT token captures the essence of the meme, existing as a token with no inherent value or financial expectations. It is intended solely for entertainment purposes. As a meme coin, the POPCAT token draws attention through its connection to a popular internet meme. It leverages community engagement and social media buzz. In the current market cycle, where meme coins have seen significant interest, the POPCAT token may pique curiosity among enthusiasts. Its appeal lies in its entertainment value and its potential to foster an online community centered around the Popcat meme. Conclusion Embracing meme coins like DOGE, PEPE, NEIRO, and POPCAT can lead to gains, but XYZVerse (XYZ) combines sports and memes for unmatched potential this bull run.

According to a screenshot shared by Marina Markezic, Coinbase is letting European Economic Area (EEA) clients know that USDC staking is coming to an end due to Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. “MICA is kicking in -> Sunsetting USDC Rewards in the EU Due to MiCA.” Source: Marina Markezic/X Said Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz on the matter, “It’s funny how often regulations prevent companies from doing things that are unarguably pro-consumer.” It was reported in October that Coinbase would end support for non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins. “Given our commitment to compliance, we intend to restrict the provision of services to EEA users in connection with stablecoins that do not meet the MiCA requirements by December 30, 2024.” MiCA provides rules covering the supervision, consumer protection and environmental safeguards of crypto assets. The legislation includes measures that aim to reduce financial crimes including market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing. MiCA also placed stablecoin issuers under the European Banking Authority and is requiring them to hold sufficient liquid reserves. The part of the legislation covering stablecoins took effect in June, while the rest is scheduled to roll out in December.

Kinley received a check from the Small Stock Association and initiated an electronic deposit using Chase’s mobile app. But instead of giving her the money, the bank shuttered her account the very next day.

Notably, the DeFi protocol Hyperliquid is now one of the largest airdrops in history with its genesis event on Nov. 29, as it distributed 310 million HYPE tokens to its community. At the launch, the HYPE token was valued at $3.90, placing the total distribution at $1.2 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. HYPE is currently trading at $8.4, up over a massive 60% in the last 24 hours. It has already hit a market cap of $2.84 billion. According to the protocol, it has distributed 31% of its $1 billion HYPE tokens on the genesis event, with 38.8% of the remaining supply allocated for future emissions and community rewards, 6% to the Hyper Foundation Treasury, and 0.3% to grants. Core contributors will receive 23.8% of the total supply under a 1-year lock period, with vesting schedules ending after 2028. Notably, there are no allocations for private investors, centralized exchanges, or market makers, said Hyperliquid in a statement. Crypto Community Lauds HYPE Airdrop The crypto community is all praises for Hyerliquid’s approach to airdrop. Notably, one of the biggest whales received 508,985 tokens through the HYPE airdrop, making almost $350 million per current price. Someone commented that they had already made $300,000 in profits from the airdrop influence HYPE price rally. Evan Luthra, a notable crypto entrepreneur, also went on to explain why Hyperliquid could be the BNB of this crypto cycle. He noted that HYPE is the token of 2024 and has the adoption, real utility (gas, staking, and more), and volume to hit $100B+ market cap. He noted that while most tokens launch with big promises, HYPE is delivering before it even starts. You missed $BNB and $UNI at launch?

But Will The Momentum Sustain? However, what is concerning is that most crypto tokens with airdrop end up tumbling down right after the launch due to building selling pressure. The same happened with the X Empire and Hamster Kombat, with their prices struggling till date. However, this is not the case with HYPE, with the price soaring higher since its launch. $HYPE chart doesnt even seem real lol…infinite twap w. 0 sellers. fwiw it'll eventually have some pullback but I don't know if it comes before $10. at some price, investors will take profits. but it's got such great tokenomics/community that any dips will be shallow. pic.twitter.com/C6AmNQbb3k — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) November 30, 2024 There are more than 333 million HYPE tokens in circulation.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK.

As investors look for fresh avenues, the best new meme coins to buy this week are certainly making waves. Among these, BTFD Coin has grabbed attention with its impressive presale success, proving that meme coins can offer substantial returns while keeping the fun alive. BTFD Coin kicked off its presale with a bang, raising over $200,000 in the first 24 hours alone. Now in its fifth presale stage, the project has accumulated more than $300,000, selling over 10 billion coins to more than 900 holders. The excitement is palpable as the fifth stage is activated with 10 billion BTFD coins having been sold. With a current price of $0.00005 and predictions suggesting it could soar to $0.0006 by the end of the presale, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to buy this week for anyone looking to dive into the crypto world. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at BTFD Coin and compare it with two other notable projects: Book of Meme and Just a Chill Guy. Each of these meme coins offers unique advantages for investors seeking alternatives to traditional financial instruments. Let’s explore what makes these tokens tick, beginning with the standout BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin is leading the charge in the meme coin revolution, showcasing what a well-executed presale can do for a project. Within just the first day, it raised over $200,000, and as it moves through stages, it has already surpassed $300,000 in total funds raised. Selling over 10 billion coins to more than 900 holders is no small feat, and it’s generating excitement among investors eager to join the action before the price rises.

Book of Meme: The Story of Community and Creativity Next, we turn our attention to Book of Meme, a project that thrives on creativity and community engagement. While it may not have the same presale numbers as BTFD Coin, Book of Meme has successfully captured the hearts of its audience with a unique concept that resonates well with meme enthusiasts and investors alike. Book of Meme positions itself as a platform where creativity meets cryptocurrency. The project encourages users to create and share memes, fostering a vibrant community that thrives on humour and innovation.

The meme coin world is buzzing with fresh opportunities that could turn a modest investment into jaw-dropping returns. While these tokens were once dismissed as mere internet jokes, they’ve transformed into serious contenders in the crypto space, powered by innovative features, strong communities, and a little bit of that signature meme magic. One coin making waves is BTFD Coin , a rising star in the presale scene, already setting records and attracting a flood of investors. If you’ve been waiting to get in early on a project with serious potential, BTFD Coin’s presale is one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. It’s selling fast, and the price is set to rise in the next stage, meaning this is your moment to dive in before it’s too late. Let’s look at three meme coins currently redefining what it means to mix fun and finances: BTFD Coin, Snek, and Pepe Coin. BTFD Coin: The Meme King with Utility Built around the ethos of seizing opportunities during market downturns, BTFD Coin is all about making the most of the lows for maximum highs. But it’s not all slogans and memes; the project has serious utility baked in. The ongoing BTFD Coin presale is gaining momentum like a bull on a sugar rush. With over 10 billion tokens sold to more than 900 holders, it’s already raised $300,000. The current presale price is $0.00005, but this won’t last long. Once the presale ends, the price is set to rocket to $0.0006. For early-stage buyers, this means a potential 15x ROI—or nearly 1,479% returns. That’s what makes this coin one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. Imagine putting $7,000 into BTFD Coin during its presale at $0.00005. That investment secures over 150 million tokens. Once the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your initial $7,000 could grow to an impressive $100,000. Not bad for a coin that’s just getting started! BTFD Coin stands out with unique features like its high-APY staking rewards (an impressive 90% on average), a play-to-earn (P2E) game that offers token rewards, and its community-centric Bulls Squad. Each Bull character—like Nerdy Bull and Peoples Bull—brings personality and collective hype to the project. Snek: Slithering into the Spotlight If you thought meme coins were all about dogs and cats, think again. Snek slithered into the crypto scene with a unique, reptilian twist that sets it apart from the usual furry contenders. What started as a quirky token has grown into a strong community-driven project. Snek doesn’t overpromise but delivers on what matters most: a tight-knit community and a clear roadmap for growth. With its low entry price and high volatility, it’s a favorite among risk-tolerant traders looking for their next meme coin moonshot. Snek’s charm lies in its meme-worthy branding, and it’s quickly becoming a cult favorite. With a strong meme narrative and a loyal following, Snek is steadily climbing the charts. For those looking for the best new meme coins to invest in right now, this slithery contender deserves a spot on the radar. Pepe Coin: The OG Meme Powerhouse No meme coin roundup would be complete without Pepe Coin, the frog that hopped into the hearts of crypto enthusiasts everywhere. Pepe Coin pays homage to the internet’s favourite amphibian, combining nostalgia with high-octane trading action. Pepe Coin has had its share of wild price swings, but that’s part of the allure. Traders who thrive on volatility have found it irresistible, making it a mainstay on the meme coin leaderboard. While Pepe Coin’s early adopters saw meteoric gains, it remains a solid option for investors who believe in its cultural staying power. Even though Pepe Coin isn’t as “new” as some of its peers, it continues to hold its own, thanks to a robust community and meme-driven marketing. It’s a living testament to the power of internet culture in driving financial ecosystems. Why Meme Coins Are Worth a Second Look Meme coins are more than just fun—they’re a testament to the creativity and community spirit of the crypto world.

37055975,https://finbold.com/?p=216070,1732987967,"Analyst traces Bitcoin roadmap as BTC price edges closer to $100,000","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) remarkable rally hit a brief pause after November 22, as investors grew impatient waiting for the cryptocurrency to breach the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. Now teetering just below this critical psychological level , Bitcoin appears primed for a breakout that could propel it to new highs. Despite losing some market dominance amid an ongoing altcoin surge, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency sector, supported by strong technical patterns and robust fundamental drivers. Technical outlook: Key levels and bullish signals Notably, prominent analyst RLinda highlights Bitcoin’s consolidation phase as a precursor to significant growth. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency has formed an ascending triangle pattern, a classic bullish indicator that reflects sustained buyer interest and mounting pressure to breach resistance. BTC price analysis. Source: RLinda/TradingView Currently, key support levels are established at $94,700, $91,250, and $89,200, while resistance lies at $99,000 and $100,000. The $99,000 mark is identified as a critical trigger point. Breaking this level could open the door for Bitcoin to test the $105,000 milestone and potentially move even higher. RLinda also notes that recent pullbacks have likely served as liquidity traps, designed to attract large institutional buyers ahead of the next leg up. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the ascending price channel reflects strong market confidence and growing institutional interest, further solidifying the bullish outlook. Fundamentals driving Bitcoin’s rally Bitcoin’s rally is underpinned by strong fundamentals, driven by large-scale accumulation by whales and institutional investors, reflecting long-term confidence in its growth potential. During the recent market correction, whales strategically accumulated 16,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.5 billion, as highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst Cauê Oliveira. Whales take advantage and accumulate US$1.5 billion in #Bitcoin “On Tuesday, almost 16,000 $BTC entered whale reserves, a number that continued to increase yesterday, corresponding to almost US$1.5 billion in on-chain accumulation.” – By @caueconomy More details 👇… pic.twitter.com/hOTP43YmHU — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 28, 2024 This buying followed the sale of nearly $4 billion in BTC at a loss by short-term holders, showcasing the ability of larger market participants to capitalize on market dips. This whale activity is consistent with broader institutional movements. MicroStrategy, for instance, has significantly expanded its holdings, adding Bitcoin worth $5.4 billion to its reserves. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs from major issuers like BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK ) and Fidelity Investments have attracted $6.2 billion in inflows throughout November, surpassing February’s previous peak of $6 billion. Favorable policy discussions and renewed market interest in cryptocurrencies have further fueled the rally. Figures like Donald Trump continue to play a pivotal role in driving sentiment toward digital assets. Despite Bitcoin’s market dominance slightly declining due to an active altcoin season, its strong fundamentals, combined with historical performance, suggest significant upside potential. Historical data provides further optimism for Bitcoin’s trajectory. According to analyst Ali Martinez , Bitcoin has historically surged by 30% and 46% in December following the U.S. presidential elections, achieving significant gains in the last two cycles. Martinez suggests that this trend could repeat, potentially propelling Bitcoin’s price to trade between $125,000 and $140,000 by the end of December. BTC price analysis: Momentum builds for the next move As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $96,682, reflecting a 1.6% decline over the past 24 hours. However, on the monthly chart, BTC remains resilient, showing an impressive 36% gain, signaling robust upward momentum. BTC one-week price chart. Source: Finbold As Bitcoin hovers near the pivotal $100,000 milestone, both technical and fundamental indicators continue to align in favor of a bullish trajectory. The combination of strong institutional demand, accumulation by whales, and favorable market sentiment strengthens Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. With momentum steadily building, Bitcoin is on track to not only break this psychological barrier but to set new milestones, reaffirming its position as the flagship leader of the cryptocurrency market.

Losing momentum briefly, it resurged this week but is yet to break higher due to a rejection. The recent surge in ADA’s price has been remarkable as the price rallied through key resistance levels without any hassle. Despite several bearish interceptions, it has continued to show strength as the bulls commit well. Following the monthly rally, the trend now appears extremely bullish on the lower timeframe, though things are still looking good as the crypto maintained a higher high and higher low pattern on the 4-hour chart. Facing a slight rejection in the past hours, ADA failed to push above the previous high and now trades calmly around $1 – its opening price. A daily close below it could trigger a small drop as the market seemed due for a correction from a short-term outlook. If that happens, we may see a double-top formation as the price may roll back under $0.8. A further surge in volatility should bring more growth before making a pullback. One of the things to pay attention to right now is the daily volume indicator, which has been falling for weeks. Technically, the price is expected to mirror this volume direction soon. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview If ADA breaks up the suppressing $1.154 resistance level, the next rally point would be the $1.25 and $1.4 levels in the near term. Long-term targets are $2, $3 and $4 respectively. In case of a drop, $0.875 is the level to consider for support. Breaking down this level could roll the price back to the $0.765 and $0.65 levels. $0.6 and $0.522 are lower supports to watch for a deep retracement. Key Resistance Levels: $1.154, $1.25, $1.4 Key Support Levels: $0.875, $0.765, $0.69 Price: $1 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Qubetics Hailed as the Best Crypto to Join in December 2024 Amid Solana’s dApp Ecosystem and Hedera’s Growth,"The world of blockchain is exciting, with innovation pushing boundaries like never before. Developers and investors are diving headfirst into projects promising transformative tech and explosive growth. Among these, a few standout coins are sparking serious excitement. Solana, a high-performance blockchain, continues to captivate with its unmatched speed and scalability. Meanwhile, Hedera’s enterprise-grade network is building momentum with its unique governing council and energy-efficient design. But the real opportunity? It’s all about Qubetics ($TICS). Positioned as the best crypto to join in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s rewriting the rules with groundbreaking interoperability features and a presale that’s making waves. Keep reading as this article dives deep into Qubetics, Solana, and Hedera—three coins that could define the next chapter of blockchain innovation. Qubetics: The Web3-Aggregated Chain Revolutionising Interoperability In today’s fragmented blockchain world, most networks operate in silos, making cross-chain communication a massive headache. Qubetics flips this script by introducing a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies networks into one seamless framework. Imagine a blockchain where assets, data, and functionalities flow freely—no barriers, no inefficiencies. Qubetics empowers developers and enterprises to build decentralised apps that span multiple ecosystems, unlocking previously untapped opportunities. Whether it’s seamless asset transfers or next-level data sharing, Qubetics is bridging the gap to create a truly interconnected blockchain universe. This is the best crypto to join in December 2024 for anyone looking to ride the wave of innovation. Solana: The Speed King of Blockchain Solana has earned its place as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain networks in the world. With its unique Proof-of-History consensus, Solana processes up to 65,000 transactions per second—making it the go-to choice for developers building scalable apps. Its low transaction fees and vibrant ecosystem of decentralised apps (dApps) have positioned it as a favourite among both developers and enterprises. This high-performance blockchain continues to evolve, staying ahead of the curve in a competitive market. Solana’s innovation and speed make it a top crypto contender. Hedera: The Enterprise Blockchain Hedera stands out with its focus on enterprise solutions and sustainability. Leveraging its unique Hashgraph consensus, Hedera offers lightning-fast transactions with near-zero energy consumption.

If you’re hunting for life-changing ROI, the Qubetics presale is where you need to be. Currently, in Presale Phase 10, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025. But here’s the kicker: each phase brings a 10% price hike, and the final stage will see a 20% jump. That means the earlier you invest, the bigger your gains. With over $3.8M already raised, the demand is red-hot. Let’s break it down: a $200 investment today nets you 8,000 $TICS tokens. If the price hits $10 (and analysts are optimistic), that $200 turns into a jaw-dropping $80,000. Think that’s wild? If $TICS climbs to $15, your $200 would balloon into a mind-blowing $195,000. The presale momentum, combined with the unmatched interoperability features of Qubetics, makes this the best crypto to join in December 2024 . Don’t wait—every passing week means higher prices and fewer opportunities. Conclusion The crypto market is heating up, and 2024 is shaping up to be a game-changer for investors. Solana’s unmatched speed and Hedera’s enterprise-grade network offer compelling opportunities, but the real star of the show is Qubetics . Analysts predict the jaw-dropping potential for $TICS, with the presale offering an unmissable chance to get in early. If you’re searching for the best crypto to join in December 2024, Qubetics is leading the charge. Its revolutionary approach to interoperability, combined with a presale designed for explosive growth, positions it as the crypto to watch.

While it appeared highly bullish daily, we may see a small pullback before rallying hard. This month saw Algo through its highest buying volatile period since it initiated a major correction in the first quarter of the year. It encountered resistance last week and took a little break after posting over 200% gain. It advanced bullish this week and broke out to mark a new yearly high at $0.484 a few hours ago. That high was slightly rejected but the bulls are still showing signs of interest. If they push higher, we can expect more gains to surface. April’s 2022 low is the closest level to watch for tests. Following yesterday’s breakout, Algo may pullback a little to retest the broken resistance before resuming bullish at full speed. A deep pullback may bring us back into the $0.20 range before finding a solid ground. While the bulls are gaining control from a short-term perspective, they may face tougher hurdles until the price reaches its current all-time high. So far, it has increased by over 3x since the price bounced back from a low of $0.1 earlier this month. Bigger moves lie ahead. Algo’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing above today’s high, the immediate resistance level to watch for a test is $0.537. The next resistance above this level is $0.7, followed by the key $1 level. The $0.4 level has produced support for the market in the past hours. A fall below this level could trigger a pullback to the $0.33 support that broke as resistance yesterday. Another support level for drops is $0.25.

Over the past day alone, ADA gained over 7%, depicting its revival with the onset of the bull market. Furthermore, a crucial on-chain metric has reached heights last seen over two years ago, further validating the bullish thesis. Catalysts Fueling ADA’s Run IntoTheBlock’s latest on-chain data highlights an impressive uptick in network activity, with over 840,000 transactions recorded recently, generating total fees of 279,000 ADA. This surge in usage mirrors levels last seen in March 2022, demonstrating increased interest and adoption within the Cardano ecosystem. An analyst citing ITB data said, “Few months before this time, $ADA was mostly used as a speculative asset. However, $ADA recorded sustained growth in the number of holders from July 2022 till today. This suggests growing confidence in the Cardano Blockchain/ ecosystem.” ADA has been one of the best-performing crypto assets this bull run, reclaiming the crucial $1 mark. During this week’s minor dip, large ADA investors were observed to have bought over 130 million tokens worth approximately $130 million. This acquisition tightens the supply, potentially boosting the asset’s value if demand remains constant or grows. Additionally, these significant purchases might signal confidence to smaller investors, inspiring them to enter the market. Zooming out, ADA whales have accumulated $10 million worth of tokens in the past month alone, thereby increasing their positions by a staggering 146% Milestone for Cardano Ecosystem On the ecosystem side, Cardano recently reached a critical milestone with the successful deployment of its first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract, Halo2, on the mainnet through the Plutus v3 ledger language. This move essentially allows zero-knowledge applications and integration with partner chains like Midnight. On November 25, the Input-Output (IO) Research team demonstrated Halo2’s capabilities by verifying the Ad-hoc Threshold Multi-signatures scheme (ATMS) on the mainnet, confirming 50 out of 90 signatures. The transactions included a 0.16 ADA fee for locking funds and 2.03 ADA for unlocking them after proof verification.

The move specifically targets stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies, like the USD-backed Tether ( USDT ), which is widely used in Brazil. Notably, a Chainalysis study from October 2024 highlights an impressive growth in stablecoins’ value received by local exchanges in Brazil. The volume of stablecoins in Brazilian exchanges from July 2023 to July 2024 surged by more than 200% over the last period.

Source: Chainalysis According to the proposal, VASPs would be prohibited from transferring stablecoins to self-custodial wallets like Ledger or MetaMask. Instead, all operations would need to occur within regulated platforms. Livecoins , a local crypto media outlet, reported on the matter on X. 🚨Banco Central propõe restrição para saques de stablecoins para carteiras próprias (auto custódia). Consulta pública que regula corretoras de criptomoedas no mercado de câmbio: ""É vedado à prestadora de serviços de ativos virtuais efetuar transmissão de ativo virtual… https://t.co/GDRW2OxjND pic.twitter.com/7KYGRo4ok4 — Livecoins (@livecoinsBR) November 29, 2024 The BCB emphasizes that only authorized VASPs can operate in the foreign exchange market, and they must collect detailed customer information, including transaction purposes and counterparties. “These measures aim to enhance legal security and allow the development of new business models, increasing market efficiency,” the BCB stated in its note. BRL collapse spurs regulatory actions Interestingly, the BRL has reached a historic low in the forex market, trading at R$6.11 per USD. This surpasses the previous record from May 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, the currency’s collapse intensified after Finance Minister Fernando Haddad announced cost-saving plans that failed to convince foreign investors. USD/BRL – US Dollar vs. Brazilian Real, weekly forex chart from ICE. Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Consequently, the weakening Brazilian Real has raised concerns about economic stability, potentially leading to the increased control attempt over stablecoins. The Central Bank cites “instability” as a reason for stricter regulations on foreign-backed currencies that work as a more accessible alternative for the Brazilian people. While the regulator claims it aims to mitigate risks related to consumer protection, illicit activities, and fiscal integrity, critics argue that the measure will have the opposite effect. Industry reacts to proposed stablecoins ban to self-custody wallets The crypto community in Brazil has expressed significant concerns over the proposed ban on the self-custody of stablecoins. Legal expert Pedro Torres criticized the measure, arguing that it infringes on constitutional rights. “The ban on self-custody of stablecoins violates fundamental principles like free enterprise and property rights,” Torres told Livecoins . “It undermines the very essence of decentralization and user autonomy that cryptocurrencies offer.” Industry analysts warn that restricting self-custody could hinder Brazil’s burgeoning crypto sector. Stablecoins account for 70% of all crypto transactions between domestic and international platforms in the country. With over $90 billion in digital assets traded between July 2023 and June 2024, Brazil has emerged as a Latin American leader in cryptocurrency adoption. The public consultation on the proposal is open until February 28, 2025. The Central Bank invites feedback on several key questions, including the necessity of additional limits for VASPs and mechanisms for valuing transacted virtual assets in sovereign currency terms. In closing, the Central Bank’s proposal marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation in Brazil. As the BRL struggles against the USD, authorities are seeking to tighten control over digital assets to allegedly protect economic stability and investor interests. However, the proposed restrictions on stablecoin transfers to self-custody wallets have sparked debate about user rights, intervention in foreign exchange markets, and the future of crypto innovation in the country. The coming months will be crucial as stakeholders provide input and the BCB considers adjustments to its regulatory approach. Featured image from Shutterstock.

37055145,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620448,1732986016,Global markets headed for a December cooldown after Trump-driven rally,"November sent global markets into overdrive after Donald Trump clinched the U.S. presidential election on the 5th. Wall Street lit up, the dollar flexed its muscles, and Bitcoin charged ahead like it had something to prove. And prove, it did. But not everyone got a piece of the pie. While U.S. assets soaked up investor dollars, European currencies, Mexico’s peso, and tariff-sensitive industries felt the heat. It’s been a month of winners and losers, with Trump’s economic shadow looming over global trade and investment. Now, December is knocking, and it’s looking more like a minefield than a red-carpet runway. Analysts warn of a potential bond market backlash to Trump’s fiscal policies. Inflation is also lurking, fueled by tariff-driven supply chain snarls. BCA Research said : “Elevated (U.S.) equity valuations reflect complacency as the more challenging environment we expect is not priced in.” Currency carnage as the dollar dominates The dollar crushed its rivals in November, rising 2% against major currencies and steamrolling markets that weren’t ready for Trump’s tariff threats. The euro, in particular, had its worst month since 2022, dropping nearly 3% to around $1.05. A weak German economy and political headaches in France added to the euro’s tumble. The question now: How low can it go? Mexico’s peso didn’t fare much better, sliding 2% against the dollar. This isn’t just a bad exchange rate—it’s a reflection of fears about Mexico’s future under Trump’s trade policies. Sterling dropped over 1%, while China’s offshore yuan fell 1.5%. Even the Korean won and Canadian dollar couldn’t escape the dollar’s bulldozer effect, joining the list of currencies losing value since late September. Bitcoin blows past expectations If there’s one asset that truly stole the show in November, it’s Bitcoin. The apex crypto exploded by 37%, inching dangerously close to the $100,000 milestone, falling only $300 short. Expectations of crypto-friendly regulations under Trump lit a fire under it. The last time Bitcoin went on a rally like this was back in February when demand for new exchange-traded Bitcoin products shot through the roof. But Bitcoin’s volatility is no joke, and some analysts fear that the recent surge could pave the way for a steep correction. If the market overshoots, unprepared investors might find themselves caught in a sharp downturn. Still, hitting the $100,000 mark would be a landmark event, thrusting Bitcoin further into the mainstream, especially as it looks clear that President Trump is coming through with all the promises he made to the industry. Tech thrives, but risks remain The tech sector has had a field day in November too, with the Nasdaq 100 recording its best month since June. Trump’s election sent Tesla soaring by 33%, while Nvidia basked in the glow of unrelenting AI hype. But not everything in tech land is sunshine and rainbows. Trump’s tariff plans could wreak havoc on global supply chains, hitting tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon where it hurts. Some investors are already hitting the brakes on AI stocks. The European Central Bank piled on, warning about the ripple effects if the AI bubble bursts. For now, tech stocks are riding high, but there’s a sense that the sector is skating on thin ice. But the month was actually a tale of two banking sectors. In the U.S., banking stocks skyrocketed by 13%, their best month in a year. Investors are betting on deregulation and a Trump-fueled economic boom to keep banks flush with cash. European banks? Not so lucky. The sector slid 5%, weighed down by a weakening economy and expectations of rate cuts. But here’s the twist: European banks have still managed a 16% gain year-to-date, thanks to earlier rate hikes. Hedge funds, however, remain skeptical. JPMorgan reported that hedge funds are net sellers of European banks, even with their recent performance. Deutsche Bank suggested that European banks need to move toward higher-margin businesses like wealth management and investment banking to stay competitive. Trump’s win has clearly tilted the scales for everyone. Bond markets break rank But the bond market’s usual rhythm has been thrown off, with major regions moving in wildly different directions. U.S. Treasury yields stayed mostly flat for the month but have risen 60 basis points since mid-September. Strong economic data and Trump’s promises of fiscal largesse are driving expectations for higher inflation and larger deficits. Capital Economics predicts that U.S. Treasury yields could hit 4.5% by the end of the year, up from their current 4.24%. Germany, though, saw the opposite trend. Its 10-year yields dropped nearly 30 basis points to 2.11%, marking their biggest monthly fall this year. Economic weakness, Trump’s tariff threats, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict all contributed to the decline. Japan, meanwhile, experienced a sharp rise in bond yields, partly due to speculation about a potential rate hike following the yen’s post-election slide.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin slows, Shiba Inu eyes $0.0002, but experts predict DTX Exchange may surpass it with bigger gains. Table of Contents Bullish price predictions for SHIB fuel optimism Shiba Inu vs. DTX Exchange: New DeFi project to overtake the top meme coin? DTX Exchange: Profits on the way DTX Exchange raises over $8 million in its presale When Bitcoin surges, meme coins spike. But with Bitcoin’ s uptrend slowing down, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other top crypto projects are now in the spotlights as experts debate what directions they might take. One analyst is tipping SHIB to hit the $0.0002 mark. While that would be quite impressive, the DTX Exchange (DTX) project is contending with Shiba Inu, and experts predict bigger surges for the new project than the meme coin. Here’s more on the two impressive crypto projects! Bullish price predictions for SHIB fuel optimism Since Bitcoin started its bullish run after the US elections, Shiba Inu’s SHIB has been on an impressive run. The top meme coin has gained 46% in the monthly timeframe. But now that the Bitcoin pump is losing steam, observers have become unsure what to expect from Shiba Inu. One expert, Charting Guy, has made bold, bullish predictions for the SHIB token. His prediction supports a Shiba Inu rally. The SHIB price can jump to $0.0002 if Shiba Inu continues pumping. The SHIB price is currently about $0.0000253 on CoinMarketCap, and with some other market experts sharing the same opinion about the meme coin, one can look forward to Shiba Inu making impressive movements on the price charts. Read more: Investors eye DTX Exchange for DeFi profits after profiting from Dogecoin, Uniswap Shiba Inu vs. DTX Exchange: New DeFi project to overtake the top meme coin? Shiba Inu is getting the bullish nod from most of its investors, and the next question is how long that streak will last. Sure enough, users seem to have been accumulating for the past few months, as the amount of SHIB in centralized exchanges is at an all-time low, but we all know how fast a meme coin can switch. The new DTX Exchange platform, on the other hand, has a plan for longevity, as its hybrid features are clearly the pick of the market. DTX Exchange offers multiple trading markets at once, ensuring that users have enough investment opportunities to stay in profit almost every time. Frankly, simply holding onto DTX tokens is enough to bring profits from the platform. It’s a horde of trading options on DTX Exchange, and a lowdown is waiting for users who are itching to know more about the project. DTX Exchange: Profits on the way It’s a crypto exchange, but that doesn’t mean DTX Exchange will only be favorable to the traders. While the platform sports a horde of features to upgrade DeFi trading generally, DTX investors could still get quite the returns on their investments. First, there’s staking. That’s the staple on any PoS network launching these days, and on DTX Exchange , deposits are significant to the platform’s progress. Staked assets on DTX add to the liquidity on the exchange, ensuring that traders and their activities are well-regulated by the protocol. Then, there’s DTX Exchange’s plan to reward every token holder. The reward comprises users getting a percentage of the daily trading revenue, which is essentially traders’ fees from the day. The community on DTX Exchange will have very little choice but to be active. While the platform is still under development for launch, DTX Exchange has prepared the Phoenix Wallet for downloads and beta testing. The wallet allows web3 enthusiasts to access various operations in the web3 space from their DTX Exchange accounts. Phoenix wallet still differs from the DTX Unified wallet, where DTX traders can monitor their portfolios at a glance. DTX Exchange raises over $8 million in its presale The Shiba Inu meme coin price might be rising, but DTX Exchange is stealing the spotlight quickly. The presale has gone on for only a few months, but everyone—traders and investors alike—is going bullish on the project, and it has now raised over $8 million. The presale is in Stage 5 now, where each token is worth $0.10. There’s a 100% ROI expected from the presale when the token launches at $0.20, but that’s nothing compared with the anticipated 100x post-launch surge analysts are projecting for the DTX token.

Ives, who works at Wedbush Securities, highlighted that automobile and technology company’s share could experience a major boost due to its foray into the technology. Aside from AI, Tesla has also been majoring in autonomous driving. Ives noted in an interview with CNBC that self-driving cars are also expected to increase the company’s value, noting that it is presently what most car manufacturers are trying to achieve. He added that the two ventures could be the decisive trigger to drive the company’s growth in the next 18 months. Wall Street analyst highlights AI’s influence on Tesla’s growth Ives mentioned that the market needs to watch and see how the company’s stock doubles from now till over 18 months. “I think get the popcorn out because I believe Tesla’s stock could ultimately double from here over the next 18 months. It’s been obviously a parabolic move, but as you talk about autonomous itself, we think it’s worth $1 trillion,” he said. He explained that while Tesla has been enjoying a nice surge, the stock still has the potential to grow. According to Ives, he feels that with the company’s autonomous driving and AI ventures, its stock could go as high as $600 over the predicted period. He also talked about the firm’s stabilized margin, an indicator that would boost investor confidence. Although skeptics have dismissed the company’s potential for growth in the future, Ives believes that they are refusing to see the bigger picture. He also believes the company’s market cap could hit $2 trillion, projecting it to happen in the same time frame. With Tesla already making its mark in the automobile industry, Ives feels it could become a key player in the sector over the next few years. Trump’s impact and the future of Tesla Ives believes Tesla stock will benefit greatly from Donald Trump’s second administration. With close ties between Donald Trump and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, Ives believes that autonomous driving could be something to expect on a federal level. He added that the removal of a $7,500 tax credit on electric vehicles could also help Tesla’s market position. Meanwhile, other analysts are still skeptical about the company’s AI venture. One such is UBS analyst, Joseph Spak, who has warned about the dangers of speculating on the company’s valuation, shattering the optimism shared by Dan Ives. Spak said he still maintains a sell rating for the stock, despite pushing his target from $197 to $226. “We understand that the market increasingly views TSLA as an AI play rather than an EV player. However, when the value you can tangibly attribute to the auto business reaches the recent average (~17%), the stock tends to enter a downward channel,” he said. $TSLA going out at a 32-month closing high.

37054093,https://finbold.com/?p=216054,1732984348,"Why Bitcoin could trade at $140,000 in December","If Bitcoin ( BTC ) replicates past cycle performances, the asset could trade at $100,000 or higher in December. Notably, the cryptocurrency market remains on edge, anticipating Bitcoin’s push to the six-figure valuation amid the ongoing post-election rally. Historically, Bitcoin has shown a tendency to rally in December following the United States presidential election years. Specifically, during the last two such cycles, the cryptocurrency posted significant December gains of 30% and 46%. For 2024, on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez has suggested that history might repeat itself, potentially propelling Bitcoin to trade between $125,000 and $140,000 in December, he said in an X post on November 30. Bitcoin monthly returns. Source: Ali_charts Indeed, on-chain metrics hint at the possibility of Bitcoin rising higher in the coming days. Data shared by Martinez indicates that over 55,000 Bitcoins (worth approximately $5.34 billion) have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past 72 hours. Bitcoin balance on exchanges. Source: Glassnode/Ali_charts These movements point to the possibility of reduced selling pressure and increased long-term holding. Such outflows have historically preceded price rallies as they lead to a supply squeeze, which can boost Bitcoin’s ongoing momentum amid sustained demand for the digital currency. Bitcoin’s need for a decisive breakout On the flip side, crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted Bitcoin’s struggle to break above a one-week lower-high trendline, which is a critical resistance level. In this case, a daily close above $97,000 could propel BTC toward $100,000, but failure to do so risks further rejection and potential moves to lower levels. The analyst noted that the asset needs to make a decisive breakout to alleviate any fears of a possible correction below $90,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has faltered in its push to claim the $100,000 level—a bullish move that gained traction following Donald Trump’s election . Bitcoin narrowly missed the $100,000 mark last week before experiencing a recent pullback. The drop has been welcomed by some quarters, as it alleviates fears of the asset being overbought. At the same time, the maiden digital asset might face further volatility in the short term, considering that such movements are typical towards the end of the month. Additionally, the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision is likely to impact the asset’s price in December. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,682, having declined by about 1.6% in the past 24 hours. In the weekly timeframe, BTC is down by over 2%.

In recent days, SOL appears to be consolidating, while during the same period, XRP has soared nearly 95%, reaching a market capitalization of $106.5 billion by outperforming Binance Coin (BNB). Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels However, this consolidation on the four-hour time frame appears as a bearish inverted head-and-shoulders price action pattern. According to expert technical analysis, SOL appears bearish, and if it fails to hold the $226 level, there is a strong possibility of a 10% decline, potentially reaching the support level at $202. Source: Trading View Conversely, if SOL closes a four-hour candle above the $245 level, this bearish thesis may fail. On the positive side, SOL is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both daily and four-hour time frames, indicating an uptrend. Meanwhile, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that the altcoin still has the potential to rally in the coming days. Currently, SOL’s RSI stands at 49, near the oversold area, further highlighting a potential buying opportunity. Whale Activity Signals Interest in SOL In addition to technical analysis, on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported that whales have shown strong interest in the altcoin. According to SOL spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have recorded a significant outflow of $182 million worth of SOL since November 23, 2024. This notable outflow suggests that whales may be transferring the tokens from exchanges to their wallets. Source: Coinglass The crypto community views this significant token withdrawal as a potential buying opportunity, suggesting a possible upside rally. SOL Current Price Momentum At press time, SOL is trading near $240 and has registered a price drop of 1.75% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has fallen by 3%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors amid ongoing price consolidation.",NEUTRAL,SOL | XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/solana-risks-losing-4th-spot-will-xrp-beat-sol/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37054067,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655920,1732984250,"Dogecoin Price Completes First Bull Phase Similar To 2021, Here’s What Comes Next","Crypto analyst KrissPax has revealed that the Dogecoin price has completed the first part of its bull phase, similar to what happened in the 2021 bull run. The analyst further provided insights into what is to come next for Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Completes First Bull Phase In an X post, KrissPax mentioned that the Dogecoin price has completed its first up-phase this bull cycle, similar to the 2021 and 2017 bull runs . He noted that those previous cycles recorded two additional up-phases with huge percentage gains. Based on this, Dogecoin could record two more up-phases before its price tops in this market cycle. The crypto analyst called for patience with the Dogecoin price while it chops sideways a bit, possibly until the next leg of the up-phase begins. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also mentioned how Dogecoin would test market participants’ patience in this parabolic run. He added that, just like in 2017 and 2020, the TD Sequential has shown a sell signal, which could lead to a brief correction before the bull rally continues. Meanwhile, in a previous analysis, KrissPax provided insights into how high the Dogecoin price could reach in this market cycle and what levels could mark the local tops for remaining up-phases. The crypto analyst predicted that Dogecoin could reach $3 in this bull run. However, he said the first step is for DOGE to reach $1. Therefore, the next up-phase could lead the Dogecoin price to $1. Once that is done, the next up-phase could be a rally to $3, as KrissPax predicted. However, Martinez’s chart showed a channel that could lead DOGE to rally to as high as $14 if it gets to the upper boundary of the channel. The median of the channel puts Dogecoin just above $1.5. Almost Time For The Next Leg Up Crypto analyst Kevin Capital suggested that it is almost time for the Dogecoin price to enjoy its next leg up. In an X post, he stated that Dogecoin has consolidated long enough and that the meme coin has also reset some key indicators on the daily time frame. In line with this, he believes Dogecoin will start heading higher. The crypto analyst added that the next leg will give market participants a good idea of the macro top for the Dogecoin price down the line. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi suggested that the next leg for Dogecoin will come unexpectedly. In an X post, he said that when it happens, it will happen fast. His accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price will break above its current all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up and rally to as high as $1.08. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.42, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-bull-phase-2021/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 299,900 followers on the social media platform X that altcoin/Bitcoin ( BTC ) pairs are flashing bullish signals. “Best case here is BTC goes sideways for a week and alts pop off in turns over the weekend. Many alt/Bitcoin charts are indicating this is a likely scenario.” Bluntz goes on to name prominent layer-1 blockchains – including Ethereum ( ETH ), BNB Chain ( BNB ) and Sei ( SEI ) – that are positioned to take advantage of Bitcoin’s sideways action. “Should be a good weekend for layer-1s. SEI, NEAR, INJ, BNB, hell even ETH all look good in USD and more importantly BTC pairs.” According to the strategist, Near Protocol ( NEAR ) skyrocketing is “imminent.” “Not only has [the] NEAR/USD pair already broken out but NEAR/BTC breaking out now too. The sending is imminent.” Source: Bluntz/X NEAR is trading for $6.87 at time of writing, a 1% increase during the last 24 hours. Other digital assets that Bluntz says are on the cusp of a breakout include popular meme asset Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Jupiter ( JUP ). According to Bluntz, Jupiter should hit a new all-time high this cycle. “Even despite being up 100% from the lows, JUP looks like it’s been accumulating for six months and the real mark up phase hasn’t even really begun. No doubt in my mind this sees fresh all-time highs before this cycle is done in my opinion. Many SOL [ecosystem] coins look similar.” JUP is trading for $0.00087 at time of writing, a 9.1% decrease on the day.

Fees are reduced to 1.9% for BNI and BRI transactions, 2.3% for QRIS, 3.5% for DANA, 3.9% for ShopeePay, and 4.2% for OVO payments.

Indonesia has particularly witnessed a surge in cryptocurrency interest among younger generation, looking for alternative investment opportunities and digital payment solutions. Additionally, the government’s receptive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, along with widespread mobile payment adoption through platforms like QRIS, DANA, and ShopeePay, has created a fruitful ground for crypto growth.

Wright’s claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto faced a legal blow as the court dismissed his appeal application. Court Refutes The Craig Wright Allegations of Judicial Bias According to the report, Lord Justice Arnold stated Wright lacked a reasonable prospect of success, and his evidence proved insufficient to support his claims. Wright had appealed based on the grounds of alleged judicial bias against him and improper treatment of presented evidence, However, Lord Justice Arnold pointed out that Wright’s claims reflected his disagreement with the judge’s ruling. He emphasized that Wright lacked substantiated evidence to back his claims of actual or apparent bias against him. According to Lord Arnold, the previous judge offered Wright a fair trial. Furthermore, the court ruled that Wright’s prayers to serve as a substitute expert witness were needless. Notably, Wright had a suitably qualified expert witness, and the judge maintained that his criticism of the treatment of expert witnesses lacked merit. According to the judge, Wright’s expert witness largely agreed with COPA’s witness on several crucial issues. This alignment in views weakens Wright’s case. Repeated Setbacks in the Quest for Recognition In an earlier ruling, the UK’s Supreme Court dismissed Wright’s case , claiming the identity of the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In that case, Peter McCormack, a renowned Bitcoin advocate, had challenged Wright’s claims of being Nakamoto. Wright responded by trying to use legal means to silence his critics. However, the UK’s Supreme Court blocked the move. Wright’s various attempts to gain recognition as Nakamoto have failed over the years, and he has been accused of plagiarism several times. In March, a UK court granted a worldwide freezing order (WFO) application instituted by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). Judge James Mellor then froze £6 million in Wright’s assets . The Elusive Identity of Satoshi Nakamoto The identity of Satosi Nakamoto remains an unsolved puzzle and a subject of interest in the cryptocurrency world. HBO even claimed it would reveal Nakamoto’s identity in a documentary to end the speculation about the creator of Bitcoin’s true identity. However, no conclusive evidence has supported all claims of unveiling Nakamoto.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-santa-trump-to-skyrocket-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-dogecoin-shib-and-pepe-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This is a 350% YoY increase and the largest total since the 2021 bull market. Recovering from a Slump Indonesia’s crypto journey has been turbulent since its peak of $54 billion in 2021. In 2022, transactions fell sharply to $19.4 billion due to new tax policies, including a 0.1% levy on crypto gains alongside standard taxation. The decline continued into 2023, with only $6.5 billion recorded in transactions. However, 2024 has seen a great rebound, with transaction volumes exceeding those of the last two years combined. This recovery underlines Indonesia’s resilience and its position as a key player in the Oceana/Asia cryptocurrency ecosystem. Indonesia’s Position in Global Crypto Adoption Indonesia ranks third in Chainalysis’ Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, behind India and Nigeria. In fact, seven of the top ten countries in the index are from Asia and Oceana. A key factor driving adoption in Indonesia is the country’s young demographic. More than 60% of crypto investors in Indonesia are under 30 years old, highlighting a shift to digital asset investment among the younger generation. This contrasts with the older, more traditional markets of Europe and the US, where crypto adoption comes from an older age bracket. Policies and Market Impact Government regulations have also played a role in Indonesia’s crypto resurgence. CoFTRA Regulation PerBa Number 9 of 2024, which eased restrictions on institutional investments, had a great influence on the September market rally. On the top, the newly elected government led by President Prabowo Subianto revisits financial policies, including the dual taxation policy on crypto, considered highly controversial. These efforts will go toward smoothing the regulatory environment and giving way to growth in the digital asset sector. Future Prospects Indonesia’s $30 billion milestone marks the country’s rising importance in the global crypto landscape. With potential policy reforms and a strong base for adoption, the nation is poised to continue growing well past its previous highs. As Asia and Oceana remain at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption, Indonesia remains a very important market to watch. By fostering innovation and relaxing restrictions, it could become a hub for global cryptocurrency activity.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/indonesian-cryptocurrency-transactions-cross/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

A U.S. court recently granted its request to accelerate the final judgment in the XRP lawsuit. This decision signals significant progress in resolving a case with far-reaching implications for Ripple and its digital asset, XRP. The court’s latest ruling modifies an earlier decision, paving the way for a quicker resolution. According to filings, both Ripple and the plaintiffs agreed to avoid further delays, emphasizing that most class claims have already been addressed. In addition, Ripple’s request for an amended judgment was approved to address outstanding uncertainties regarding the case’s finality. Despite these advancements, one specific claim remains unresolved and will depend on the outcome of the appeals process. To expedite matters, both parties have committed to filing a motion to lift the stay within 30 days following the resolution of the appeals. Ripple has also submitted detailed records of its legal expenses, showcasing the extensive resources dedicated to defending against the allegations. Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit This development follows Ripple’s previous victories in its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The case, which has garnered significant attention, continues to shape discussions on cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. Jeremy Hogan, a pro-XRP lawyer, has suggested that the lawsuit against the SEC could be fully resolved by mid-2025, potentially influenced by changes in SEC leadership. Ripple’s executives have expressed optimism, viewing these legal victories as a foundation for advancing the company and the broader digital asset industry. The expedited judgment is a critical milestone that could set a precedent for similar cases within the cryptocurrency sector. It also reflects Ripple’s steady progress in overcoming regulatory challenges that have previously hindered its growth.

Recently, XRP surged to a three-year high of $1.63 following reports that SEC Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, coinciding with the beginning of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term. Although XRP has since retraced to $1.5, the cryptocurrency has recorded a substantial 15% gain over the past week. Market analysts remain optimistic, with projections indicating that XRP could surpass its all-time high of $3.38 before the year ends. Ripple’s achievements in court and the anticipation of regulatory clarity, are expected to strengthen investor confidence in XRP. As the company moves closer to resolving its legal challenges, the implications for the broader cryptocurrency market will be significant.

While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade around the $96,600 range, altcoins, such as Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM), recorded triple-digit gains over the past month. Join us as we explore the altcoin market and investigate the hottest projects expected to rocket in 2025. Stellar (XLM) Gains Over 460% in 30-Day Charts Stellar (XLM) made headlines in recent weeks for its massive gains. Over the past 30 days, XLM gained nearly 470%, currently trading at $0.52 . The Stellar network is similar to the Ripple (XRP) network - a decentralised payment platform and cryptocurrency that facilitates quick and low-cost cross-border payments, promoting financial inclusion for individuals and businesses globally. The Stellar network was created to support digital representations of any currency but has its native token called Lumens (XLM). Developed as a fork of the Ripple protocol, Stellar aims to create a global network connecting financial institutions, payment processors, and individual users, making cross-border money transfer easier and providing access to essential financial services. XLM, in conjunction with XRP, is expected to play a significant role in the new global financial system. XRP is uniquely designed to optimize institutional liquidity for cross-border transactions, while XLM’s infrastructure, on the other hand, was built to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and retail-level remittances efficiently. Financial experts envision a two-tiered monetary framework using XRP and XLM at different levels for specific purposes. Algorand (ALGO) Gains Nearly 50% Algorand (ALGO) is a self-sustaining, decentralized blockchain network that supports a wide array of applications. The platform was built to process many transactions at higher speeds and lower costs, and it is one of Ethereum’s biggest competitors. The platform’s native currency, ALGO, secures the Algorand blockchain and is used to pay the processing fees for Algorand-based transactions. ALGO recently caught the attention of investors, resulting in a 288% surge in value over the last month. The project is one of the top altcoins, gaining nearly 50% in the past week alone to trade at $0.48 . Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $15.7 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 225%. SHIB is one of the biggest Solana-based memecoins, which quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 13th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). SHIB surged in popularity thanks to its dedicated community of investors, its charm, and the support of industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. SHIB gained over 45% over the past month and is expected to be one of the most significant gaining altcoins in the next bull run. Husky Inu (HINU) to Thrive in 2025 With renewed optimism and interest in the crypto market since Donald Trump’s election win, crypto projects are expected to surge as the president-elect plans to implement pro-crypto policy. Husky Inu (HINU), the latest memecoin sensation from the Solana network, will surely reap the rewards of industry news. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $588,000, with numbers expected to rise rapidly as the crypto market explodes. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu is close to hitting its fundraising target, so investors are urged to hurry before missing the opportunity to take a stake in this exciting project.

37054210,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51071,1732981355,Expert Says XRP to $2 Isn’t Even a Question. $8-$20 Is Inevitable,"XRP has experienced a resurgence in the cryptocurrency market. It has reclaimed the $1 mark after three years and peaked at $1.93 on November 30. Although it has retraced slightly, now consolidating around $1.46, experts remain optimistic about the asset’s future trajectory. Notably, many suggest that a rise to $2 is imminent, with some projecting long-term targets as high as $20. Analysts Point to $1.60 as Key for XRP’s Path to $2 Angel investor and crypto analyst Armando Pantoja has shared an optimistic outlook for XRP. In his recent analysis, Pantoja emphasized the asset’s sustained upward momentum throughout November. XRP’s performance this month has been remarkable, recording an over 200% surge as it climbed from under $0.50 to over $1.60. According to Pantoja, the market exhibits strong technical indicators that support further growth. He noted significant whale activity and improving sentiment as foundational drivers of the current rally. Despite these gains, he observed that XRP’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator stabilizes rather than overheating. Similarly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet entered overbought territory. These conditions, he argued, suggest the rally is poised to continue sustainably. Pantoja highlighted the $1.60 price level as a critical hurdle. He stated that breaking this resistance could lead to minimal opposition toward $2, further fueled by potential FOMO from traders. Additionally, he identified $8 to $20 as plausible long-term targets based on XRP’s historical performance and projected market trends. $XRP to $2 isn’t even a question. $8-20 is inevitable 1. Bullish patterns = long-term setup 2. Whales accumulating hard 3. MACD cooling off + RSI neutral 4. $1.60, then no resistance to $2 5.

His review of a 4-hour XRP chart identified the Fibonacci level at $1.44 as an essential support, which the asset has successfully retained. He argued that this stability positions XRP for a continued rise toward $1.63, the next major resistance level. Dark Defender also highlighted potential resistance at $1.88 and $1.96. He noted that XRP benefits from strong support within the Ichimoku cloud, which enhances the likelihood of further gains. He suggested that a sustained movement above $1.44, could act as a springboard for an extended rally. He added that breaking the $1.96 barrier could trigger a significant price surge, a scenario echoed by veteran trader Peter Brandt, who anticipates a sharp rally if this level is surpassed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Symmetrical Triangle Pattern On XRP Chart Meanwhile, analyst Mikybull has identified a symmetrical triangle pattern on XRP’s 4-hour chart, signaling consolidation. According to his analysis, a similar pattern appeared earlier this month after XRP crossed $1, leading to five days of sideways movement before rallying to $1.63. Mikkybull suggested that the current triangle pattern, which formed after XRP retraced from its recent high, could precede another breakout. He anticipates that a successful breakout would position XRP to target the $2 range. A Bullish Consensus Emerges The consensus among analysts is clear: maintaining support at $1.44 and overcoming resistance at $1.63 will be critical for XRP’s continued ascent. These technical levels are widely viewed as potential catalysts for the asset’s next phase of growth, with a $2 price target firmly within reach. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, XRP’s ability to sustain its rally will depend on technical and market-driven factors.

37052897,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620437,1732981328,Bank of England flags global economic threats from rising trade barriers,"The Bank of England (BoE) has warned that escalating trade barriers are a ticking time bomb for the global economy. The central bank’s latest financial stability report didn’t hold back, detailing how higher restrictions on international trade are shaking up economic growth and creating massive uncertainty around inflation. It’s a cocktail of risks that’s already affecting financial markets, with borrowing costs creeping higher for both businesses and households. The message from Threadneedle Street is pretty much: ‘Brace yourselves.’ But the fallout doesn’t stop there. The BoE pointed to a growing breakdown in international financial cooperation, which could seriously destabilize the system’s ability to absorb shocks. Translation: if global regulators can’t get their act together, future crises could hit much harder than they need to. And while the BoE didn’t name names, the timing of this report—just days after President Donald Trump issued his very first trade threats—feels far from accidental. The UK’s fragile spot in a shaky world BoE Governor Andrew Bailey, ever the diplomat, dodged questions about the direct impact of Trump’s win. Instead, he kept the focus broad, saying, “We are seeing increased risk of global fragmentation. But I would say this: there are quite a lot of causes of that, and I don’t think it’s right to pin it on one particular event.” Still, the risks for the UK are uniquely worrying. As an economy that thrives on openness and global trade, Britain’s financial system is wide open to shocks from outside. The BoE acknowledged that households and banks are in decent shape for now, but it flagged serious vulnerabilities. The report highlighted public debt levels worldwide as a major concern, along with the unpredictable nature of financial markets. “Uncertainty around, and risks to, the outlook have increased,” the BoE said. Meanwhile, new Finance Minister Rachel Reeves has accused the central bank of stifling growth by being too heavy-handed with regulations. Bailey pushed back, saying, “Put simply, there is not a trade-off between financial stability and growth. This is a fundamental point.” But he admitted that regulators have some wiggle room in how rules are applied. Case in point: the BoE will now conduct full stress tests on banks every two years instead of annually, a move Bailey says will help make the financial sector more competitive. Volatile markets and the hedge fund wild card The report also pulled no punches about financial markets, calling them “vulnerable to a sharp correction.” Rising trade barriers, growth risks, and inflation jitters are creating the perfect storm. If markets go into a tailspin, borrowing costs could skyrocket, hitting UK businesses and households where it hurts most. And then there’s the wildcard: hedge funds and other non-bank financial institutions. These players might look like big shots on paper, but the BoE isn’t buying it. Hedge funds, the report warned, could face a sudden shock that forces them into a fire sale of assets like British corporate bonds. Such a move could spread chaos through financial markets, further cranking up borrowing costs. The BoE is watching these risks closely, but the reality is that non-banks operate outside its traditional sphere of control. On the brighter side, UK banks are holding up well. They’re well-capitalized and flush with liquidity, passing the BoE’s resilience tests with flying colors. But even here, the central bank is easing up. Starting in 2025, those stress tests will shift to a biennial schedule, freeing up resources to focus on other risks. During off years, the BoE will conduct less intensive desk-based reviews as needed. The central bank is keeping its countercyclical capital buffer steady at 2%. This so-called “rainy day fund” is meant to help banks weather tough times. But with so many unknowns on the horizon—fragmenting global ties, shaky markets, and towering public debt—the BoE is clearly keeping its options open.

The case focuses on unregistered securities offerings tied to crypto mining and debt rehabilitation businesses. According to the SEC complaint, Taing and Touzi Capital raised $95 million for cryptocurrency mining projects and another $23 million for debt rehabilitation initiatives between 2021 and early 2023. The investments were marketed as “stable and predictable,” and Taing reportedly likened them to high-yield savings accounts. But the SEC alleges the investments were far from safe, describing them as “highly speculative and illiquid” ventures that relied on risky third-party operations. Related News: Legendary Bullish Forecaster Tom Lee Assesses Bitcoin's $250,000 Target Next Year, Answers the Question of Whether Altcoin Season Will Come The complaint also alleges that the funds raised were shuffled between unrelated businesses and misappropriated for Taing’s personal use. The SEC also accuses Touzi Capital of concealing operational failures and continuing to solicit funds from investors even when the businesses began to collapse. “Touzi Capital’s investors have not received a response from the company or Taing,” the SEC said, alleging that Taing has stopped contacting affected parties. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer and director ban against Taing to prevent Taing from leading public companies in the future. *This is not investment advice.

The Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges says it’s rolling out the largest-ever guaranteed income pilot program for college students. The program is targeting community college students in health-related fields. “Aligning with the mission to advance equity and opportunity in education, the Building Outstanding Opportunities for Students to Thrive (BOOST) program, a Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI) initiative, will provide $3 million in unrestricted monthly payments to LACCD students pursuing health careers.” A total of 250 students will be picked to participate in the guaranteed income program with each participant set to receive $1,000 per month for one year. “The program aims to bridge the widening gap between financial aid, wages, and students’ cost of living and will be available at four LACCD colleges: East LA College, LA City College, LA Trade-Technical College, and LA Southwest College.” The Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges says the guaranteed income program’s funds are sourced from donations. “The program is made possible through generous funding from The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation ($3,175,000) and the Young Adults Forward Fund, an initiative of the California Community Foundation ($867,500).” Some selected participants have already started receiving the funds. “The timing of BOOST’s launch couldn’t be more fitting, as the first round of funds will reach students just before Thanksgiving.

Yet, XRP outperformed most cryptocurrencies in November, threatening to surpass SOL in the capitalization rank. As of this writing, Solana goes with a $115.2 billion market cap, trading at $242.49 per token. Meanwhile, XRP has a recently accomplished $104.7 billion capitalization, at $1.84 per token, according to data from Finbold. Solana (SOL) and XRP market capitalization and price. Source: Finbold Both cryptocurrencies have earned institutional and retail investors’ interest throughout the years, experiencing remarkable growth in market demand and valuation. This happened despite having considerably high supply inflation in comparison to other less-capitalized projects, challenging known economic fundamentals and reason. xAI’s Grok 2 weighs in an XRP or Solana buy for 2025 In this context, Finbold turned to xAI ’s Grok 2, looking for insights on whether SOL or XRP make a better buy for 2025’s upcoming “ mother of all bull markets ” or “ the biggest crypto bull run ever ,” according to analysts. Grok has itself made headlines by challenging Google ’s and other artificial intelligence (AI) models’ dominance. The xAI stands out against its competitors by being able to real-time scan the web and X for up-to-date data. Analysis of XRP vs. Solana for 2025 investment Notably, Grok mentions XRP’s solid fundamentals for cross-border payments and real-world utility backed by Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions. The main price catalyst, according to the AI, is related to a potential favorable resolution of the ongoing legal battle against the Securities and Exchange (SEC) commission. “​Given the bullish sentiment and potential regulatory resolution, XRP might aim for $4 to $6 if market conditions are highly favorable, according to some expert predictions. However, a more conservative estimate might place it around $1.5 to $2, considering a moderate growth scenario.​” – Grok 2 On the other hand, Solana is noted for its high transaction throughput and low costs, directly competing with Ethereum ( ETH ). The main price catalyst, in this case, was the memecoin boom, attracting significant retail capital. Moreover, Grok mentions positive expectations related to a SOL exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) to earn institutional interest and capital. “Analysts predict a wide range for Solana due to its innovative capabilities. Predictions go from a conservative $300 to an optimistic scenario where it might reach $1,000 or even higher if the bull run is particularly strong.” – Grok Analysis of XRP vs. Solana for 2025 investment. Source: Grok / X / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Conclusion: XRP or SOL for 2025? In conclusion, Grok’s AI believes XRP is a better buy for investors looking for potential regulatory clarity, while Solana has a higher appeal for those interested in robust technological infrastructure and other blockchain applications besides finance. “Solana might have a slight edge in terms of technological innovation and ecosystem development, but XRP’s clearer path toward regulatory resolution could make it a more immediate choice for those betting on a recovery triggered by legal clarity.” – Grok Conclusion on XRP or SOL price predictions for 2025. Source: Grok / X / Finbold / Vini Barbosa The AI predicts XRP could trade around $2 to $3 by the end of 2025, and SOL could hit or exceed $500 by then.

37054916,https://cryptonews.com/?p=314793,1732980601,"Bitcoin Still Finds Unbreakable Resistance Around $99k, But This Analyst Says We Could See $100k This Weekend","Whilst Bitcoin (BTC) CME futures were able to break back above $100,000 this week, spot prices continue to struggle against an unbreakable sell wall around $99,000, though optimism is growing that an upside breakout could soon ensue. Bitcoin was last trading just under $97,000, a solid recovery from Tuesday’s dip back below $91,000. 10x Research founder and CEO Markus Thielen is optimistic that a breakout above $100,000 will likely occur in the near future, he told members of the crypto press earlier this week. Bitcoin came within a few hundred dollars of hitting $100,000 last week, and Thielen noted that the recent pullback has helped to “alleviate its overbought technical condition”. Weakness towards the end of the month is also normal for BTC, Thielen said. He also warned that a surprise decision by the US Federal Reserve to hold rates steady in December could be a short-term headwind. However, “despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident that Bitcoin will surpass the $100,000 milestone within the coming weeks, maintaining a bullish outlook for 2025”, Thielen concluded. How High Can Bitcoin Go as New Crypto Golden Age Beckons? Since President-elect Trump’s November election victory, Bitcoin has been riding a wave of optimism surrounding the likelihood of accelerated global adoption in the coming years under a pro-crypto Trump administration. Trump has promised to establish a national bitcoin stockpile and to never sell the US government’s BTC holdings. Polymarket’s betting market are also currently pricing a 29% chance that Trump goes a step further and establishes a national Bitcoin reserve in his first 90 days.

Senator Cynthia Lummis recently put forward a bill saying the US government should sell gold to fund the purchase of 1 million BTC, while Trump ally and Healthy Secretary pick RFK Junior has advocated for buying up to 4 million BTC. Meanwhile, a pro-crypto Republican controlled Congress is expected to pass pro-Bitcoin/crypto legislation in the coming session. US #Bitcoin Reserve of 4,000,000 $BTC Unreal pic.twitter.com/YIbbla1cLC — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) July 26, 2024 It’s no wonder then that at the dawn of a new golden age for crypto in the USA (and globally), Bitcoin continues to test $100,000. And if the US actually started buying BTC, this would presumably kickstart a global race to accumulate the asset. That could fast-track Bitcoin’s market cap towards that of gold, last around $17 trillion. Given Bitcoin’s current market cap around $1.9 trillion, that could mean gains of 10x are still possible in this scenario. Of course, that would still likely take many years and there would be many major drawdown events. Bitcoin Investment Strategy to Consider Assuming Bitcoin is on the fast track to supplant gold as the world’s most important reserve asset in the decades ahead, investors with a long-term vision ought to get started accumulating as much as possible as soon as possible. One strategy to consider is “dollar cost averaging” ( DCAing ). This is where investors allocate a set amount of their monthly savings to Bitcoin every week/month, regardless of its price. They continue to buy regardless of market conditions and aim to hold indefinitely, but at least for 8 years. Over time, they should secure a very favorable average price as they buy both market peaks and troughs. This is one of the most conservative investment strategies in crypto. Riskier strategies include investing in alt-coins and meme coins, which are more volatile than BTC. Whilst DCAing into BTC over the next 8 years is highly likely to bring strong returns, traders may be able to make the same returns over a very short time period in the coming months should alt-season really get going. Of course, they should bear in mind that they run a much higher risk of losing everything. One of the alt-coin sectors that is most likely to deliver strong gains is meme coins – indeed, these have led the gains in crypto in 2024. Established meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) , Pepe (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT) could easily deliver 10x gains. But newer, lesser-known meme coins with smaller market caps could deliver even bigger gains, potentially of as much as 100x . One new meme coin that analysts at cryptonews.com have been watching and think has massive potential is Pepe Unchained (PEPU). Pepe Unchained, set to launch in just 15 days, has raised a whopping more than $60 million so far in its presale, one of the biggest raises so far this year of any crypto project. Investors have been piling money into the new meme coin because Pepe Unchained is way more than just your average meme token. Pepe Unchained is a layer-2 Ethereum scaling blockchain that has been busily building out entire meme-focused trading and DeFi ecosystem. Pepe Unchained L2 Sneak Peek!

37052272,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620431,1732980121,JPMorgan predicts ECB will cut Eurozone rates by half a point in December,"JPMorgan has shaken the markets with a revised bet for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates by half a percentage point next month. The banking giant, originally expecting the move in January, now believes December will be the tipping point for a larger rate cut. Their reasoning? “Economic data is unraveling faster than anyone anticipated.” Eurozone business activity shrank in November. Inflation in Germany missed forecasts, and the core inflation rate for the region didn’t budge as expected. These signals, according to JPMorgan, make a strong case for the ECB to take more aggressive action. Traders wasted no time reacting. Money markets doubled their bets on a 50-basis-point cut, raising the odds to 20%, up from 10% just days earlier. German bonds followed, with two-year yields dropping five basis points to 1.95%—a level not seen since late 2022. JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi, in a client note, explained the shift, citing several factors. The sharp decline in the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), sluggish service-sector inflation, persistent trade uncertainties, and rates that remain overly restrictive formed the backbone of his argument. Divided ECB leadership fuels speculation The ECB is no stranger to mixed messaging, and this time is no different. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a Governing Council member, called for continued rate cuts but stopped short of specifying the pace. He left the door open for future decisions to be based on evolving conditions. Isabel Schnabel, however, had a sharper take earlier this week. She argued that borrowing costs were already near a neutral level, suggesting further cuts might not be as urgent. Despite these differing views, JPMorgan’s Fuzesi thinks the data speaks louder than internal politics. “Even though internal dynamics in the Governing Council can at times result in hard-to-understand outcomes, the data have moved in a way that makes a 50bps cut compelling already in December,” he wrote. The upcoming rate decision will mark the ECB’s fourth cut this year. Markets have largely priced in a smaller 25-basis-point reduction, but the case for something bigger is gaining momentum. Inflation in the eurozone climbed to 2.3% in November, back above the ECB’s 2% target. Core inflation—excluding volatile items like energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco—held steady at 2.7% for the third straight month. The stickiness of inflation in services, which dropped slightly to 3.9% from 4%, adds another wrinkle to the ECB’s calculations. Economists had expected higher inflation in Germany, but it failed to materialize, adding more pressure on policymakers to act decisively. Economic data sets the stage for December The eurozone’s economic backdrop is looking shaky. Business activity, as measured by the PMI, continues to decline. Inflationary pressures, while ticking upward overall, remain uneven across sectors. The recent rise to 2.3% from 2% in October comes after months of softer figures, partly due to energy price deflation fading from the equation. Despite this, the ECB isn’t operating in a vacuum. External factors, like the global fallout from Donald Trump’s recent election as U.S. president, add layers of uncertainty. Trade tariffs, if implemented, could choke European exports, further complicating the ECB’s task. These risks will weigh heavily on the central bank’s updated staff projections, expected just before its December 12 meeting. Melanie Debono, senior Euro economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, doubts a half-point cut is in the cards. She points to the bloc’s record-low unemployment and higher wage growth in the third quarter as factors that might hold the ECB back. “The final decision will remain a close call,” Debono said, predicting the ECB will likely stick to a smaller 25-basis-point move in December, with similar cuts following in January and March. Markets are jittery but remain cautious. Speculation of a larger cut faded after slightly improved growth forecasts and rebounding inflation in October. ECB policymakers, including Schnabel, have also stressed the importance of measured action, signaling that going big might not be the answer just yet. Bond markets and political risks Beyond inflation and growth concerns, the ECB faces pressure from bond markets. German bonds surged after JPMorgan’s report, but not everyone is convinced the central bank will intervene aggressively. Governing Council member Joachim Nagel made it clear the ECB won’t act to address government bond fluctuations caused by political risks. Speaking in Frankfurt, Nagel said, “What happens with individual government bonds is typically a reflection of what may be happening politically in the country at the time.” The ECB has tools like the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) to stabilize markets when monetary policy is at risk. Introduced in 2022, the TPI allows the ECB to buy government bonds under strict conditions. However, Nagel dismissed using this mechanism for political issues, saying, “It’s not the task of monetary policy to bail out individual countries.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jpmorgan-predict-ecb-will-cut-eurozone-rates/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37052272.jpeg
37052321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51068,1732979976,Projects Like XRP and Hedera Will Soon Be Bigger Than Bitcoin. Here’s why,"Nick, known as “Crypto Crusader” on X, has stirred conversation in the cryptocurrency community with his views on the future of Bitcoin. He predicts that projects with utility like XRP and Hedera (HBAR) will ultimately surpass Bitcoin in terms of value and relevance as the market evolves toward prioritizing real-world applications. Nick questioned Bitcoin’s reliance on the “store of value” narrative, arguing that the market’s shift toward utility-driven valuation could render older technologies less competitive. He emphasized that newer cryptocurrencies with advanced technology and established use cases are better positioned to dominate in the long term. At some point in the future projects like $XRP & $HBAR will be bigger than #Bitcoin . Many will read that and laugh or say that it's impossible. Let me ask you this serious question. When this space's value is determined by utility, what utility does Bitcoin actually provide?… — Nick | Crypto Crusader (@NCashOfficial) November 27, 2024 Community Responses Highlight Diverging Opinions The tweet sparked varying reactions. Some community members supported Nick’s perspective, while others raised counterarguments. One user suggested that Bitcoin’s scarcity and the potential for governments to accumulate it could reinforce its status as “digital gold,” potentially offsetting its lack of utility. Others were critical of Nick’s guidance. A user regretted advice he gave in the past, arguing that Bitcoin’s performance over the last few years would have been a more profitable investment. Nick countered this by highlighting the recent outperformance of assets like XRP, Stellar (XLM), and Telcoin (TEL) compared to Bitcoin’s gains over a month. He also acknowledged Bitcoin’s significant rally from $15,000 to nearly $100,000 but maintained that utility-focused projects could achieve even greater results in the future. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Debate on Bitcoin’s Role Nick’s comments reflect a broader debate in the cryptocurrency space about Bitcoin’s relevance as newer blockchain technologies emerge. While Bitcoin remains the most recognized and widely adopted cryptocurrency, critics often cite its energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism and limited scalability as drawbacks. Supporters of Bitcoin argue that its simplicity, security, and decentralized nature make it unparalleled as a digital store of value. Institutional interest, including the possibility of government accumulation, could further cement its position as a reliable hedge against inflation and a digital equivalent of gold. However, proponents of newer projects argue that cryptocurrencies like XRP and HBAR offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and practical applications that Bitcoin cannot match. These features could make them more attractive for enterprise use and global adoption , particularly as blockchain technology integrates into various industries. The future of cryptocurrency hinges on how the market values different attributes such as security, decentralization, and utility. While Bitcoin’s historical significance and growing institutional adoption cannot be overlooked, its position as the leading cryptocurrency may be challenged as utility becomes a more prominent driver of value.

In a note to clients, the exchange explained that the move had been triggered by “new requirements for e-money tokens” that are expected to come into effect with the upcoming adoption of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations in the region. USDC Reward Program Set for Sunsetting The USDC rewards program allows Coinbase users in over 100 jurisdictions to earn interest on their stablecoin holdings. The yield, whose rate varies from country to country, is paid monthly and automatically deposited into users’ accounts. According to the note , eligible users living within the EAA will continue earning interest on their USDC until November 30, with the program sunsetting the following day. Additionally, the exchange confirmed that customers will still be able to receive their payouts from the scheme within the first ten business days of December. That gives them until December 13 to claim their funds. Crypto Companies Adjusting to MiCA MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the European Union (EU) to govern the crypto sector. It creates a uniform set of rules for the issuance, trading, and provision of crypto-related services across all 27 EU members. It has caused many digital asset companies operating in Europe to rejig their offerings to stay compliant. In October, Coinbase announced that it would remove all non-compliant stablecoins from its EU platform. On its part, Bitstamp has delisted Euro Tether (EURt), Tether’s euro-pegged stablecoin, which it said did not satisfy MiCA requirements. Tether is developing MiCA-compliant products following its acquisition of a stake in Quantoz, a fintech company based in the Netherlands. It also stated it would stop supporting EURt, with holders given until November 27, 2025, to redeem their tokens. While Coinbase’s decree covers customers across the EAA, three countries, Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein, are not members of the EU, where MiCA will be active. However, to ensure their participation in the EU’s internal market, they often adopt many of the measures fronted by the union. As such, while not automatically bound by MiCA, analysts believe they may choose to adopt similar regulations.

This move is part of a broader effort to align cryptocurrency operations with traditional financial regulations and address risks related to investor protection and market stability. The draft proposal, unveiled on November 29, specifically targets stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies. If approved, cryptocurrency exchanges in Brazil would no longer allow users to move these tokens to private wallets. The regulation aims to treat cryptocurrencies similarly to other financial assets like foreign direct investments and international credit, requiring service providers to adhere to global financial rules and share customer information with the central bank. While the central bank acknowledges the potential benefits of virtual assets—such as improving foreign exchange efficiency and expanding investment opportunities—it also highlights risks like cybersecurity threats, illicit activities, and economic instability. These concerns underline the necessity of stricter rules, according to the regulator. Brazil’s crypto market has seen massive growth, with over $90 billion in digital assets traded between July 2023 and June 2024, according to data from Chainalysis. Stablecoins , particularly USD-backed tokens, have played a pivotal role, accounting for 70% of all crypto transactions between domestic and international platforms. These tokens are popular for their stability and are frequently used in cross-border transactions , especially by businesses seeking to preserve value. However, industry analysts warn that this new restriction could hamper Brazil’s thriving crypto sector, which has become a leader in Latin America. Stablecoins are integral to the ecosystem, with the global market cap of these tokens now reaching $190 billion. The public can provide feedback on the proposal until February 28, 2025, though the central bank will have the final say on implementing the rules.

FLOKI Price Sees Huge 13% Weekly Drop, What’s Next?","Bullish Floki price projections appear to be showing cracks as the meme coin seemingly struggles to garner any significant momentum today, down 0.14%, seemingly defeated by the week’s 12.85% decline. An issue that seems all the more worrying considering the notable discrepancy compared to the rallies seem from other prominent meme coins . While Floki has seen a 58.02% increase over the past month, it has been outpaced by others in the space. Indeed, interest in Floki appears to have waned somewhat this cycle. As trading volume surges 25% reaching 407 million today, it seems holders are jumping ship. Floki Price Prediction: Can Floki Catch Up? While the past month has been disappointing so far, Floki appears to be playing catch-up as technical indicators lend to a potential rally. FLOKI / USDT 1D chart, symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: Binance. The upside so far this month could be part of a wider breakout, guided by a symmetrical triangle pattern formed against the support trendline that has governed Floki’s lows so far this year. While the breakout seems to have come to a standstill, a fully materialized pattern sets sights on a price target around $0.0036650, in line with the resistance trendline that has marked Floki’s highs over the same period. With this almost 70% increase from current prices, Floki would match the growth seen by its biggest competitors so far this month. This potential rally seems all the more credible following a bullish golden cross last week, as the 50SMA surpassed the 200SMA, bolstering Floki’s bullish trajectory running into 2025. The next move up may come sooner rather than later as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appears to have levelled out at 56 after its stint in oversold territory at 80 just two weeks ago. However, the bulls have yet to affirm control over the Floki price trajectory as the MACD line maintains its position below the signal line. The downside could continue into next week. Is Floki Really the Play This Cycle? With all this in mind, the question still remains: Is Floki really the play this cycle? After all, by the time Floki reaches its target, its competitors will likely have already seen rallies of their own and raised the bar. Therefore, its no surprise that investors are looking elsewhere in search of meme coins with the potential for bigger and faster gains .

The prominent crypto asset recently surged to $8.81, representing its highest price point in the past five months. However, as the Polkadot market remains ravaged with positive sentiments driven by price action and recent network reports , crypto market expert with X username Rekt Capital has shared a valuable cautionary insight. Polkadot Must Stay Above $8.60 — Analyst In a recent post on X , Rekt Capital highlighted a crucial support level needed for DOT to maintain its current upward trajectory. The analyst explains that following its recent 35% rally in the past seven days, Polkadot has now recorded a weekly close above $8.60, a previous resistance level now turned support. Rekt Capital predicts the altcoin is likely to retest to this price level in a move that previously spurred a bullish run to the token’s current all-time high of $55.00 in 2021. However, the crypto pundit notes that Polkadot has also experienced a failed retest at this support zone in April 2024 sliding to $5.8 i.e. a potential 32% decline from the asset’s current market price. Therefore, DOT bulls need to ensure a successful retest of $8.6 to ensure the coin maintains its current upward momentum. Importantly, a monthly close above this support level indicates the potential for significant price gains in the coming weeks. If this successful retest occurs, Polkadot is expected to rise to $12.61, suggesting a possible 46.11% increase in the asset’s price. Interestingly, Rekt Capital’s DOT prediction is similar to that of fellow analyst Ali Martinez who had forecasted the coin to reach $11 following a breakout to $6 one week ago. DOT Price Overview According to data from CoinMarketCap, Polkadot continues to trade at $8.68 following a 2.12% gain in the past. In tandem, the altcoin’s daily trading volume has surged by 21.78% and is now valued at $795.37 million. Data from Coincodex shows that general market sentiment on the altcoin remains highly bullish as indicated by multiple factors including a Fear & Greed Index of 78 that represents extreme greed. Furthermore, stablecoins adoption on Polkadot continues to grow as the total valuation of USDT and USDC on the blockchain network recently reached $120 million . This development indicates increased liquidity and trading activity that could spur demand and price increases for DOT. Considering these factors combined with a booting altseason and high market enthusiasm towards the incoming Donald Trump administration, Polkadot is tipped largely to retain its upward trajectory. However, these projections are not guaranteed and are subjective to all market conditions.",NEUTRAL,DOT,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polkadot-dot/polkadot-dot-must-retest-crucial-support-to-sustain-uptrend-details/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Ripple is preparing for a potential launch as early as December 4, Fox Business reported , citing sources close to the matter. The anticipated approval positions Ripple to enter New York’s heavily regulated digital finance market, further solidifying its presence in the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Ripple’s Business Revolves Around RippleNet Ripple’s flagship business revolves around RippleNet, a decentralized payments network offering a faster and cost-efficient alternative to traditional banking systems like SWIFT. The network relies on blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border transactions. While RippleNet’s operations are closely tied to its native cryptocurrency, XRP, the token faces legal scrutiny in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security, a case now under appeal in the Second Circuit. The ongoing legal battle has fueled volatility in XRP’s price, which surged to $1.70 following Donald Trump’s electoral victory, amid expectations of regulatory leniency under his administration. New York Regulator To Approve Ripple’s Regulated Stablecoin, RLUSD, By December 4 Ripple is poised to launch its regulated stablecoin, RLUSD, on December 4th, pending approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This milestone would make RLUSD a compliant… pic.twitter.com/74jh0udNk2 — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 30, 2024 Ripple’s move to introduce RLUSD reflects a strategic shift. By offering a regulated stablecoin, the company can provide customers with a reliable digital asset insulated from the price swings and regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP. RLUSD’s approval would pit Ripple against established U.S. stablecoin issuers like Circle, Paxos, and Gemini, all operating under New York’s stringent regulatory framework. The NYDFS is renowned for its high standards, requiring companies to meet rigorous criteria for transparency, security, and consumer protection. Ripple has positioned itself for this regulatory milestone through its June acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company, a limited-purpose trust chartered by the NYDFS. This acquisition allowed Ripple to fast-track the issuance of RLUSD, as Standard Custody already held licenses to provide custodial services for digital assets. RLUSD will serve as a key element in Ripple’s efforts to compete in the $190 billion global stablecoin market, which is poised for further growth under a pro-crypto federal government. Ripple Labs CEO Faces Backlash for Shilling XRP and CBDCs in Alleged Trump Meeting Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently come under fire after rumors surfaced of a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump where he promoted XRP and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). At the time, former Messari CEO Ryan Selkis accused Garlinghouse of “shilling XRP and CBDC implementations.” Speculation about the meeting’s role in the rally has added fuel to the ongoing controversy. During a recent Fox Business appearance, Garlinghouse declined to confirm or deny the meeting but praised Trump’s relationship with the crypto industry. “Trump has embraced the crypto industry, and I think he recognizes its potential for innovation and entrepreneurship,” Garlinghouse said, expressing optimism about the sector’s future under the new administration. Garlinghouse also noted the market’s positive response to Trump’s election victory, citing the hostile stance of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as a major factor suppressing U.S.-based crypto projects. Trump’s promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office has garnered widespread support from crypto enthusiasts.

How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pink-shiba-inu-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-wif-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37052320,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51066,1732978463,$1.5 Billion In XRP Profits Last Week,"Long-term XRP holders reaped substantial profits of over $1.5 billion last week as the cryptocurrency reached its highest price level since 2021. The impressive performance has brought XRP into the spotlight, highlighting market dynamics influenced by investor sentiment, technical indicators, and broader developments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Profit Realization and Market Dynamics According to recent data , profit-taking among XRP investors reached levels not seen since April 2021. This is a typical response to significant price rallies, driven by investors’ propensity to secure gains after extended periods of price stagnation or growth. However, this does not necessarily reflect a shift in long-term sentiment towards the token. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a critical metric for assessing market sentiment and valuation, surged to 217% earlier this week. This data, derived from the blockchain analytics platform Santiment , suggests that XRP’s market valuation is much higher than its average purchase price. While a high MVRV ratio underscores the profitability of current holders, it also signals a potential overvaluation, which could temper the rapid pace of XRP’s price increase. The MVRV ratio is calculated by dividing the total market value of a cryptocurrency by the aggregate realized value (the price at which coins last moved on the blockchain). Elevated MVRV values often precede corrections, as overvaluation can prompt additional profit-taking or cautious sentiment among investors.

On Wednesday, Ripple announced plans to invest in the newly rebranded Bitwise Physical XRP Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) , previously known as the ETC Group Physical XRP. The investment underscores Ripple’s commitment to expanding XRP’s presence in institutional markets. This ETP, trading under the ticker GXRP on Germany’s Deutsche Börse XETRA, provides European investors, with a secure and regulated avenue to gain exposure to XRP. The product is fully backed by XRP, ensuring transparency and credibility. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the growing global demand for crypto-backed investment products, stating, “With the U.S. regulatory environment for crypto finally becoming more clear, this trend is poised to accelerate, further driving demand for crypto ETPs, such as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP.” Outlook for XRP The recent developments surrounding XRP reflect both the opportunities and challenges within the cryptocurrency market. While the significant profit realization and elevated MVRV ratio may indicate a short-term cooling period, the combination of regulatory clarity, innovative projects, and strategic investments positions XRP for sustained interest among retail and institutional investors. As the market continues to evolve, the long-term trajectory of XRP will likely depend on broader market conditions, technological advancements, and Ripple’s ability to drive adoption through initiatives like the GXRP ETP.

37051294,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620425,1732978321,Wall Street outshines global rivals yet again as U.S. stocks keep surging,"Wall Street crushed it this week. While European and Asian markets barely managed to tread water, U.S. stocks were off breaking records like they didn’t get the memo about inflation and tariffs. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% during a week where half of Wall Street was on holiday and Trump’s latest trade threats were making headlines. It wasn’t even close. Europe’s Stoxx 600 scraped up a measly 0.4%, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index did slightly better with 0.8%. American markets are running circles around the rest of the world, and they look set to keep doing so. U.S. large-cap stocks are about to close out their best year against global competitors since 1997. Corporate America’s borrowing machine is running smoothly, even with interest rates, and day traders are raking in profits on everything from leveraged ETFs to crypto. It’s fascinating to witness. Trump, tariffs, and treasury yields This week was pure chaos for us geopolitically, but you wouldn’t know it by looking at the S&P 500. Trump announced his pick for Treasury Secretary, sending investors into a frenzy of optimism. A few days later, he stirred up more volatility with brand new threats of aggressive tariffs against close U.S. trading partners. Meanwhile, inflation data for October came in hot, showing prices climbing yet again. Did any of this faze Wall Street? Not even a little. The S&P 500 ended the week in the green, while the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) (the market’s fear gauge) dropped to its lowest level in four months. Treasury yields took a nosedive, with the 10-year benchmark falling 22 basis points. For context, French bonds had a rough week thanks to yet another political drama, hitting their widest yield gap against German bonds since 2012. EPFR data from Barclays showed that while money poured into U.S. stocks, Europe and emerging markets saw outflows. Japan’s yen was a rare bright spot, strengthening past 150 against the dollar for the first time in over a month. Tokyo inflation data came in higher than expected, with core prices rising in line with estimates. Traders are now betting on a 60% chance that the Bank of Japan will hike rates next month. That’s big news for Japan, but it’s not enough to steal Wall Street’s thunder. China, meanwhile, is struggling to keep up. Miners like Anglo American Plc got a boost from speculation that Beijing might roll out new stimulus measures, but overall, Asian markets are lagging. Wall Street has beaten global markets in 13 of the last 15 years. Frankly, Europe and Asia are just background noise at this point. The Wall Street machine Why does Wall Street keep winning? Simple: the U.S. economy is literally built differently. Since the pandemic, American growth has outpaced every other developed nation. Trump’s policies—whether you love them or hate them—are laser-focused on boosting domestic markets. Economists are raising their growth forecasts for the U.S. next year while cutting projections for Europe. The numbers don’t lie. Ben Kumar, head of equity strategy at Seven Investment Management, explained it like this: “You have to own the U.S. because it’s just doing something different.” He’s not wrong. The S&P 500 is packed with companies that print money like it’s a hobby. Tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are leading the charge, and the market is rewarding them handsomely. For UBS, it’s all about operational leverage. The U.S. has the lowest among major markets, meaning it’s better positioned to weather a global slowdown. Add potential tax cuts and deregulation to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for continued dominance. “The U.S. should benefit from Trump relative to elsewhere,” the strategists wrote . The risks are still real Of course, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Trump’s tariff threats could backfire spectacularly if other countries retaliate with their own trade barriers. Adam Slater at Oxford Economics warned that the market’s optimism might be “premature” if this turns into a full-blown trade war. That’s a valid concern, but investors are too busy raking in profits. The Federal Reserve is also in play. Speculation about rate cuts has been a major driver of this year’s gains, especially for speculative assets like crypto. Max Kettner, chief strategist at HSBC Holdings, pointed out the parallels to 2019, when trade tensions were at their peak, but the Nasdaq was on fire. “This is still a cutting cycle. It’s a fantastic set-up,” he said. Nobody knows for sure how long this streak will last, but Wall Street isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. With $141 billion flowing into U.S. equities this month alone, the market is firing on all cylinders.

According to data from Farside, the $332 million figure surpasses the previous inflow record of $295 million set on November 11. Much of the credit can be directed towards BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, accounting for about $250 million of the total inflows recorded on November 29. Spot Ether ETFs daily inflow record by months. Source: Farside According to the ETF Store’s president, BlackRock’s ETHA has done well since its launch on July 29. Geraci pointed out that the investment vehicle has inched above $2 billion in inflows since its creation. Ethereum has had a moderate reaction to the development, trading at $3,662, with a small rise of 1.88% in the last 24 hours. ETH may be primed for a rally as Ether ETF inflows grow Many analysts see Bitcoin’s declining dominance of the overall crypto market share as the perfect opportunity for altcoins, including Ethereum to make their mark in the bull market. According to pseudonymous trader Pentoshi, this is the early sign of what is to happen to Ethereum. He noted that with increased inflows, sellers begin to get absorbed, which can lead to a surge. Meanwhile, another analyst also pointed out a remarkable achievement, noting that Ether ETF inflows were higher than Bitcoin ETFs on the day. Although only a difference of $10 million, it is still a remarkable feat for the second-largest digital asset according to market cap. Hartmann Capital founder Felix Hartmann was happy with the achievement, noting that Wall Street has decided to join the fun. “Don’t midcurve it, alt rotation has begun last week and Wall Street is officially joining the fun,” he said . Ethereum becomes top USDT network Ethereum ETF inflows are increasing at a time when Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing outflows. For instance, Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of $224 million between November 22 and 27. In comparison, Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $35 million, largely affected by the outflows recorded on November 25. Ethereum was also boosted by its decentralized finance (DeFi) system’s legal victory this week, boosting investor confidence. Meanwhile, Ethereum has inched above TRON as the blockchain for USDT, with a supply of $60 billion. Ethereum flipped TRON due to a 9.5% increase of USDT on the network, coupled with a drop of 1.5% of USDT on TRON. With TRON dropping to around $58 billion, Ethereum finally has its first lead since August 2022. Total USDT supply also closed at $132 million, with the all-time high figure seen as a reflection of the wider bullish trend in the crypto market. Tether, as a stablecoin, has been integral to the progress of the crypto industry, providing liquidity and facilitating capital glows within the system. Ethereum’s dominance may be linked to its large-scale use by financial institutions to tokenize US dollar-backed assets. Meanwhile, TRON is still the go-to in inflation-prone countries because of its low fees and transaction speed, helping users save more USDT. Ethereum’s lead began on November 21 and increased the gap on November 23. This was due to Tether choosing to mint $2 billion on Ethereum compared to $1 billion on TRON.

For example, a coin like Dogecoin rose from its humble beginnings to a market cap of a staggering $64.2 billion at the time of writing). A more recent example is the success of PEPE in captivating the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. These successes have put a stamp on the immense potential of digital assets to give astronomical returns. While these meme coins have created excitement, the smart investor is now looking at another kind of innovation FUEL, a next-generation cryptocurrency wallet positioned to change asset management in the blockchain space. The market evolution: From Dogecoin to PEPE Dogecoin has grown to become the 7th largest cryptocurrency by market cap with a market cap of $59.3 billion thanks to its simplicity, widespread adoption and celebrity endorsements. In recent weeks, Dogecoin has lost double-digit values as the crypto market experienced a temporary dip. However, the coin has since recouped its losses and is now up 2% in the past week. This growth trajectory will continue in the anticipated bull run this December. Meanwhile, the PEPE coin was designed to satisfy crypto investors’ appetite for speculative investments. The coin, which promises no utility to its investors, quickly gained success after launch, growing to become the 19th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $8.3 billion. At the time of writing, PEPE is up 107% in the past month. Like Dogecoin, it has experienced significant declines in the past weeks, dropping by over 7% in the last 7 days. Although temporary, the recent declines in Dogecoin and PEPE have prompted investors to seek more rewarding investments, and what better coin to turn to than 1FUEL.

ChainLink’s oracle technology remains the gold standard for connecting blockchain data to the real world. Avalanche offers lightning-fast transactions and scalability. As innovation continues in the DeFi sector, 1FUEL (OFT) is the latest player to bring so many benefits to the table. With its support for one-click cross chain transactions, 1FUEL is the bridge that connects many blockchain networks together. It does not come as a surprise that analysts regard 1FUEL as important to the DeFi ecosystem as Avalanche and ChainLink. As for investors, where are they placing their bets – Avalanche, ChainLink, or 1FUEL? Avalanche: Building DeFi Avalanche has an important role to play in the DeFi space. Its native utility token is called AVAX. It powers transactions, projects, and smart contracts within its ecosystem. Avalanche’s TVL has been rising. The layer-1 network stands out among its competitors due to its advanced features and user-friendly design. It is based on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This makes it energy-efficient and scalable. Avalanche attracts a wide range of DeFi users and investors due to its innovative features. How to Simplify DeFi With 1FUEL The DeFi ecosystem still has room for growth despite its achievements in the last few years. This prompted the creation of 1FUEL, a secure crypto wallet for cross-chain transactions. As a privacy-focused cryptocurrency it is changing how users interact with blockchain transactions. It has a built-in mixer to anonymize transactions. This helps users hide their digital trail and protect themselves from prying eyes. One of 1FUEL’s most important features is cold storage for crypto. Crypto users have lost more than $70 million in hacks in November alone. Hackers target hot wallets such as exchange wallets. With 1FUEL’s military-grade cold storage for crypto, users are assured that their holdings are safely locked away from potential exploits. This new project has been called one of the top crypto presales of 2024 because of its investor-friendly tokenomics. 1 billion 1FUEL tokens have been minted, with half of the token supply reserved for presale buyers. Holders can also earn passive income through generous staking rewards, in addition to that 1FUEL offers physical and virtual debit cards to users. These cards are linked to users’ 1FUEL wallets, allowing real-time crypto transactions. Its P2P exchange is great for converting fiat to crypto or vice versa. Many people have been burned while trying to cash out their digital holdings. Moreover, the underbanked have no clear access to crypto. With the P2P exchange platform, 1FUEL is the great equalizer. Another important factor is security. Many projects have been hacked because of lax security infrastructure. The team behind 1FUEL is staying on top of the game by constantly having its smart contract audited for potential exploits. The smart contract audits have indicated a clean bill of health so far. ChainLink Unveils Technical Milestone ChainLink recently launched two privacy-enhancing features as it aims to beef up its capabilities.

With this, the bulls appear to have become active as the buying pressure has begun to mount. After a massive rise in the last week, the price remains consolidated within a range. Does this suggest the Bears are about to take over the rally? The weekly chart of LINK price suggests the bears are trying hard to gain control over the rally. The Gaussian channel has turned bearish while the 50/200 day MA is again trying for a bullish crossover after a failed attempt a few weeks before. However, the RSI remains elevated while the OBV levels undergo a small rise, suggesting the traders are bullish on LINK. Moreover, the trade setup suggests the next weekly candle could be a strong bullish one, incurring more than 30% gains and reaching 1 FIB at yearly highs close to $25. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum had a bearish beginning to its trading journey after hitting the highs; however, the token further raised to mark a new ATH at $2.4. Meanwhile, the token faced a massive pullback, marking the bottom, followed by a healthy rebound after a brief consolidation. Currently, the ARB price is in the middle of a fine ascending trend, with the upper targets at around $1.22. As seen in the above chart, the ARB price is testing the trend reversal zone just below $1 for the past few days. Unfortunately, the bears have held the range, which suggests yet another pullback could be fast approaching. Besides, the drop in buying volume suggests the MACD may undergo a bearish crossover, which substantiates the bearish claim. Therefore, the ARB price may head back to $0.92, followed by a rebound above $1 and reaching the upper resistance zone around $1.22 before the end of 2024. Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis Polygon or POL price has maintained a healthy ascending trend since the start of the month with a massive growth in buying volume. Moreover, the price has entered a crucial range, clearing which could revive a strong rise towards the higher targets. The technicals are in bullish favor, and hence, the price is believed to rise and reach the pivotal resistance soon. After a massive descending trend, the MATIC price has begun to rise, aiming to reach the crucial resistance. Meanwhile, the Gaussian channel turned bullish after remaining bearish for over 6 months. This suggests the price is expected to remain elevated as the 200-day MA is offering strong support to the price. Therefore, the price appears to be primed to rise and reach the important range, which is also the trend reversal level around $0.8 before the end of 2024.",NEUTRAL,LINK | ARB,ALTCOIN | LINK | TRADING | ZRX | ARB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoins-are-gaining-extreme-strength-here-are-the-top-3-100x-gems-which-are-ready-to-explode/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

While speaking about the often-criticized nature of memecoins due to their perceived lack of real-world applications, Conlan said there has been a shift towards focusing on projects with built-in utility and strong community engagement. “Memecoins have gotten a lot of negative coverage because of their lack of use case,” Conlan acknowledged. “But we know there are new memecoins that have that use case, which is really what we all need because we need that use case.” Related News: Legendary Bullish Forecaster Tom Lee Assesses Bitcoin's $250,000 Target Next Year, Answers the Question of Whether Altcoin Season Will Come Conlan explained that Binance’s undercover research team uses a multi-faceted approach when evaluating potential listings, with a strong emphasis on community input and trends. “It’s definitely important to watch what the community trends and insights are on this topic, as well as feedback and input from the community,” Conlan said, rejecting the idea that hype alone drives listing decisions. The CMO also discussed the potential for exponential growth in the crypto community over the next 18 to 24 months.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK.

Marcus took to microblogging platform X to reveal that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was indirectly involved in the project’s death. The former PayPal president decided to clear the air on the issue after Marc Andreessen discussed the project on the Joe Rogan Show. According to Marcus, the project was on course to become a transformative global payment system until political machinations led to its death. Marcus noted that he needed to shed light on the incidents that went on behind the scenes and ultimately led to the project’s failure. David Marcus discusses issues surrounding Libra’s lunch According to David Marcus, the company had the initiative to create a stablecoin-powered payments system based on a blockchain to solve the problem of cross-border payments in 2019. The initiative led to the birth of Libra, which Marcus concedes immediately started to raise eyebrows. He noted that even though the project was backed by about 28 companies, it immediately entered the crosshairs of regulators. How Libra Was Killed. I never shared this publicly before, but since @pmarca opened the floodgates on @joerogan ’s pod, it feels appropriate to shed more light on this. As a reminder, Libra (then Diem) was an advanced, high-performance, payments-centric blockchain paired with a… — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) November 30, 2024 Marcus mentioned that within weeks of the announcement, he faced the Senate Committee on Banking and the House Financial Services Committee to defend it. However, those summons were smaller compared to the scrutiny the project will face later. He mentioned that in the next two years after its unveiling, there were so many efforts to address certain concerns from regulators. Marcus noted that regulators had concerns related to financial crimes, money laundering, and consumer protection. After scaling through those concerns, the company eventually secured the green light for the project to move forward in 2021. However, he noted that the approval was for the limited pilot rollout and it was given by some members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. “By spring of 2021 (yes they slowly played us at every step), we had addressed every last possible regulatory concern across financial crime, money laundering, consumer protection, reserve management, buffers, and so much more, and we were ready to launch,” Marcus added. Janet Yellen warned Fed Chair about backing Libra’s launch In his X post, David Marcus clarified that while the lead-up to the proposed launch did not come without hiccups, the company had been ready for a slow, small-scale pilot rollout. He even noted that Fed Chair Jay Powell and the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve supported the project. However, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen threw a wrench in their plans when she got involved in the discussion. Marcus highlighted that he was not in their bi-weekly meetings but as he was told, Yellen told the Fed Chair that if he backed the Libra project, it may result in “political suicide.” She went on to intimate that she wouldn’t be there to back him if it eventually happened. Notably, Marcus noted that he did not witness the conversation, but that was when the Libra dream died. “I wasn’t in the room when this conversation happened, so take these words with a grain of salt, but effectively this was the moment Libra was killed,” he said. After Yellen’s warnings, Marcus noted that the Fed called the financial institutions participating in the program, discouraging them from moving ahead with the project. Marcus said each bank got a statement that read: “We can’t stop you from moving forward and launching, but we are not comfortable with you doing so.”, noting that the banks started to pull out of it after that. Marcus mentioned that the project passed all regulatory and legal checks, meaning its death was politically motivated. However, Marcus said he left the ordeal with many lessons, noting that the design was hailed across the technology industry. He also highlighted that if any entity wants to build an open money grid for the world, it should do it on a neutral and decentralized network, just like Bitcoin. David Marcus has moved on from Libra and is currently working at Lightspark, an open payment method built on the lightning network.

The bipartisan interest in DOGE underscores growing momentum for cutting federal spending and increasing accountability in government operations. Besides, DOGE has also drawn support from a growing roster of private-sector leaders, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman,and former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. “We are entrepreneurs, not politicians. We will serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees. Unlike government commissions or advisory committees, we won’t just write reports or cut ribbons. We’ll cut costs,” noted Musk and Ramaswamy in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. Musk’s activities and statements around political circles has grown increasingly, and he has even broadly stated that he would be firing some federal employees when Trump takes over.

While some projects promise quick wealth and internet-fueled hype, they also pose major risks for users and platforms. Rachel Conlan, chief marketing officer at Binance, stated the importance of due diligence in evaluating such projects during her appearance at Aus Crypto Con 2024. “The team does a lot of due diligence on the founders of the project, who is involved, and what’s potentially on their roadmap,” Conlan stated in an interview. She highlighted the critical steps exchanges like Binance take before listing tokens . Despite the ongoing skepticism surrounding memecoins, she acknowledged the potential of some to evolve beyond hype and deliver genuine utility—a factor she believes is essential for long-term success. Memecoins: More Than Just Hype? Memecoins have historically attracted negative attention due to their perceived lack of utility and susceptibility to scams. Conlan noted that while the ecosystem has its share of frivolous projects, emerging tokens with real-world applications could shift the narrative. She stated: “But we know that there are up-and-coming memecoins that have that utility built in, which is really what we all need because we need that use case,” she explained. Binance’s listing process takes community feedback, trends, and project insights into account, though no single factor guarantees a token’s inclusion. Conlan also forecasted rapid growth in the crypto space over the next 18 to 24 months, urging the industry to focus on innovative blockchain applications being developed during the current bear market. Her sentiments echo those of Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who recently expressed frustration with the memecoin sector. In a November 26 post on X, CZ remarked that the ecosystem, once funny and engaging, had become increasingly “weird.” “Let’s build real applications using blockchain,” CZ urged, emphasizing the need for substance over speculation. High Risks, High Rewards Despite the controversies, memecoins continue to produce stories of financial success . A recent example involves a Solana-based memecoin trader who turned a modest $160 investment into millions by betting on a viral meme project. While such stories captivate audiences, they underscore the volatility and unpredictability of the space. Exchanges, therefore, are left balancing user protection with the demand for high-risk, high-reward projects.

Here’s how the increasing liquidity could impact Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market. Can The Increasing Stablecoin Cap Push Bitcoin Price To $100,000? Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed in its weekly report that the stablecoin market capitalization has experienced notable growth in the past month. According to the crypto firm, the stablecoin market cap surged past $190 billion this week for the first time since late April 2022 when Bitcoin price was hovering around the $40,000 mark. This impressive growth comes on the back of Bitcoin’s unprecedented run to a six-figure valuation and the explosion of the total market capitalization to over $3.4 trillion. IntoTheBlock noted that stablecoins have seen increased adoption in the past few weeks, as investors continue to run toward riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Specifically, this expansion has primarily been in favor of Tether’s USDT, which continues to completely dominate the stablecoin market. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that USDT holds about 72% of the market share, with a market capitalization of over $133 billion — reminiscent of the crypto market highs of 2021. Interestingly, the demand for the Tether stablecoin appears to be climbing, with a weekly mint of over $3 billion of new USDT tokens. Most notably, over $13 billion USDT has been minted since the start of November, with the stablecoins largely flowing toward centralized exchanges. This injection of fresh liquidity into centralized exchanges has been reflected in the market, especially with the strong bullish momentum witnessed in the past few weeks. Historically, increasing stablecoin inflows into exchanges is positively correlated with market prices, as they often represent higher “buying power” for the investors. As such, the continuation of this positive trend could be pivotal to the dream of Bitcoin price surpassing $100,000. While the flagship cryptocurrency has seemingly recovered from its recent slump beneath the $93,000 level, it has not exactly shown strength sufficient to surpass the six-figure milestone. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin continues to hover around the $96,500 mark, reflecting a more than 2% increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is still in the red on the weekly timeframe, with a 3% decline in the past seven days. BTC Market Becoming Stable And Mature: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock also disclosed in its weekly report that Bitcoin’s market climate seems to be maturing, as volatility is currently trending downwards. According to the blockchain platform, the market’s high volatility has been a long-standing criticism point for BTC as a store of value. However, IntoTheBlock noted that investors can expect the Bitcoin price performance to be more stable, as retail and institutional adoption increases and volatility diminishes. Hence, the premier cryptocurrency could become an even more reliable store of value.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stablecoin-market-capitalization-nears-200-billion-bitcoin-price-to-resume-rally/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37048533.jpeg

Community Feedback and Insights When asked what factors lead to a token being listed on Binance, Conlan clarified there are no guarantees. “A few different factors are considered by this secret research team,” she stated. “Community feedback and input, as well as watching what community trends and insights are around this, are definitely important,” Conlan added, emphasizing that hype alone does not drive listings. Conlan acknowledged the criticism surrounding memecoins, saying they often receive “a lot of negative coverage” due to their lack of utility. “But we know that there are up-and-coming memecoins that have that utility built in, which is really what we all need because we need that use case,” she explained. Keeping the Community Engaged Conlan predicted significant growth in the crypto community over the next 18 to 24 months. This, she said, will require a sharper focus on projects with real use cases. “It is born and frivolous at the beginning, but if you want to keep the community involved, it is critical,” she noted. Conlan highlighted the importance of innovation, stating, “What we should be talking about more is the innovation that’s going to come out, like the innovation that’s been prepped in this bear cycle. What people are building.” Her views echo those of Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who recently criticized the memecoin ecosystem. “Let’s build real applications using blockchain,” CZ wrote in a Nov. 26 X post, describing memecoins as becoming “a little” weird. Despite ongoing scams in the memecoin space, notable success stories remain.

37048183,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372644,1732972791,"Russia Advances Crypto Taxation Bill, Awaiting Putin’s Signature","Russia is one step closer to implementing a comprehensive framework for taxing cryptocurrency transactions and mining. Its Federation Council approved a federal bill on November 27, following its passage in the State Duma. The legislation, which awaits President Vladimir Putin’s signature to become law, classifies digital currencies as property and exempts crypto transactions from value-added tax (VAT). New Crypto Framework in Russia Under the new law , income from cryptocurrency sales will be subject to a personal income tax of 13%- 15%, aligning with the tax rates for securities transactions. Crypto mining operators, however, are also exempt from VAT on mined coins but are required to report their activities to tax authorities. Income derived from mining will be taxed based on the market value of the digital assets at the time of receipt. Non-compliance with reporting requirements will result in fines of 40,000 rubles, approximately $360. This move comes as Bitcoin reaches record highs against the Russian ruble, reflecting a growing interest in digital currencies within the nation. The bill also recognizes the use of digital currencies in foreign trade agreements under Russia’s experimental legal crypto framework. Notably, authorized mining infrastructure operators’ services will remain tax-free within the country. Once enacted, these measures aim to formalize Russia’s crypto economy, providing regulatory clarity while introducing oversight to align with the government’s tax objectives. The latest development comes a week after officials announced plans to curb cryptocurrency mining this winter to prevent electricity shortages. As reported earlier, mining will be suspended in Siberian regions like Irkutsk and Buryatia from December to mid-March and face similar seasonal bans through 2031. Year-round bans will take effect in 2024 in the North Caucasus and Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine, including Donetsk and Kherson. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak’s government commission approved the measure. Russia’s Crypto Exchange Traffic Climbs 8% Over the past month, Bitcoin has witnessed massive growth nearing $100,000 which spurred global excitement in the cryptocurrency market, including notable activity in Russia. Research by MegaFon, a leading Russian telecommunications provider, revealed that internet traffic to major crypto exchanges in the country grew by 8% in early November. In addition to Bitcoin’s price, this spike was also driven in part by recent changes in local cryptocurrency regulations. This mirrors a global trend, as MegaFon’s findings indicate an 8% to 10% month-over-month increase in web visits to the 20 most popular crypto exchanges. Russian users accounted for an estimated 27% to 30% of the overall traffic to these platforms, highlighting their growing interest in the evolving crypto market.

This Best New Meme Coin Presale Promises a 15,000% ROI—Don’t Sleep on It","Meme coins have evolved from being internet jokes to serious contenders in the crypto world. Remember the Dogecoin phenomenon? It skyrocketed from meme status to global fame, minting millionaires along the way. But if you didn’t get in early on Doge’s moon mission, you might’ve felt like you missed the train. Well, here’s the good news: the crypto universe always has room for the next big thing. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a revolutionary meme coin that’s making waves right out of the gate. With a presale price of just $0.000004 and an ambitious listing price of $0.0006, BTFD is positioning itself as a game-changer. The potential 15,000% ROI isn’t just a headline—it’s a clarion call for investors looking to capitalise on the next big crypto success story. BTFD Coin: The Best New Meme Coin Presale Stealing the Spotlight BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coins. It’s not just about viral branding or catchy slogans—though it has those in spades—it’s about utility, engagement, and financial potential. Launching at a presale price of $0.000004, BTFD is setting the stage for jaw-dropping gains. A post-presale listing at $0.0006 translates to a staggering 15,000% ROI for early investors. But there’s more to BTFD than just numbers. This coin is creating a full-fledged ecosystem that’s as fun as it is rewarding. At the heart of its appeal is a cutting-edge Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, allowing players to earn real rewards while diving into an immersive gaming experience. Think of it as gaming with financial perks—it’s where entertainment meets opportunity. For those looking to grow their portfolios passively, BTFD offers staking rewards with impressive APYs. This means you can let your tokens work for you while you focus on other things. And let’s not forget the Bulls Squad , BTFD’s passionate and rapidly growing community that’s driving its hype and adoption. Imagine this: you invest $10,000 in the BTFD presale.

Riding the wave of internet culture, it launched with a bang, pulling in a loyal following and a hefty chunk of market share. Its quirky branding and community-driven ethos made it a standout, and the early returns? Nothing short of spectacular. At its peak, Brett was a hot commodity. Investors were cashing in on its viral appeal, with the coin’s value riding high on a wave of hype and optimism. But, as with many meme coins, its momentum faced a cooling-off period. While Brett remains a notable name in the space, its trajectory has levelled out, giving newer coins like BTFD the chance to shine. Brett’s strength lies in its community, which continues to champion its cause. But without additional innovations or significant market moves, it’s unclear whether Brett can reclaim its early glory. Why BTFD Is Poised to Shine? While Brett has made its mark as a staple in the meme coin landscape, BTFD offers something Brett doesn’t: a forward-thinking ecosystem packed with features. The P2E game, staking opportunities, and its ambitious roadmap position BTFD as more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Brett’s rise was driven by its dedicated community, and while that’s admirable, BTFD is proving it can do more.

In the last 24 hours alone, the number of SHIB tokens sent to burning has crossed 1.28 billion with a 2,055% rise in the burn rate.

Notably, Algorand’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has increased by 59% this week, rising from $117.39 million on November 22 to $187.55 million at the time of writing, according to DefiLlama . This growth indicates heightened user activity and ecosystem development, which are critical drivers of price appreciation. Simultaneously, CoinGlass data reveals that Algorand is showing strong bullish momentum, as evidenced by a 147.45% surge in derivatives trading volume, reaching $2.00 billion, and a 34.34% increase in open interest (OI) to $165.93 million. Algorand derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass These metrics reflect significant market interest and new capital entering the market, often a precursor to further price increases. The long/short ratio across platforms leans bullish, with Binance’s ALGO/USDT ratio at 1.2202 and OKX’s ratio at 1.09, indicating traders are largely optimistic. Liquidation data supports this sentiment, as 24-hour short liquidations totaled $2.98 million, significantly outpacing longs at $1.47 million, suggesting shorts are being squeezed as the price rises. Additionally, top trader data from Binance highlights a strong long bias, with a long/short position ratio of 1.9423. Overall, the data suggests a continued bullish outlook for ALGO, though traders should remain cautious of potential corrections given its rapid gains and overbought RSI levels. Finbold has also identified the buy signal flashed by ALGO last week, based on technical indicators aligning with the token’s impressive bullish momentum. Technical indicators: Strength and caution Technical indicators have also presented compelling bullish signals. The formation of a “ Golden Cross ,” where the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA, suggests a robust upward trend and has historically been a reliable buy signal. ALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView However, caution is warranted as the RSI stands at 71 on the weekly chart, indicating that ALGO has entered the overbought territory. This increases the likelihood of a short-term pullback or consolidation, which could present a strategic entry point for traders aiming to capitalize on the next potential upward move. AI prediction for Algorand by year-end Amid this backdrop, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o for insights into Algorand’s potential year-end price. According to the AI model, if the current bullish momentum continues and investor interest remains strong, ALGO could realistically reach $0.70 to $0.85 by the end of the year.

It’s essential to note, however, that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and actual prices may differ from predictions. Thus, investors should conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors when evaluating potential investments.

Ethereum’s price pattern indicates potential for a breakout toward $4,000, while Solana aims for a $400 target. At the same time, a new Play-to-Earn (P2E) token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), is gaining attention for its unique gaming use case and growing presale participation. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Forms Bullish Pennant Pattern Currently, Ethereum has been on the rise with its recent gains taking it close to the $3,700 level which is a crucial resistance level. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital explained that for Ethereum price to extend its upside, it must close above $3,700 on a weekly basis. In this case, a successful breakout would open the way up to the $4,000 level. However, Rekt Capital noted that the rejection from the area of interest indicates that the market is still not ripe for the breakout. The bullish setup of Ethereum is also backed up by rising funding rates, which shows that investors are becoming more optimistic. This is a clear indication that there is increased demand in the futures market as seen by the rise in funding rates of Ethereum. Solana News: SOL Shows Strong Momentum Solana, on the other hand, has seen significant gains and the recent price action appears to be a continuation of this trend. Solana price has recently climbed to an all-time high of $264 but has retraced slightly to trade at $236 at the time of writing. Nevertheless, the overall outlook is positive and Solana’s price is buoyed by several positive drivers such as the change in leadership at the SEC and the heightened interest in Solana’s ecosystem. Solana price is in its best position to surge past $265 with predictions pointing to a surge to $400 in the near future. Looking at on-chain metrics, the selling pressure from the validators is starting to pick up as the core stakeholders aim to profit from the recent price gain. However, the general bullish trend for Solana is still evident, and holders are waiting for the $270 level to be broken to see further advances as SOL ETF chances increase. Yeti Ouro: A New DeFi Altcoin Gaining Attention Apart from Ethereum and Solana rallies, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) has emerged as a noteworthy project. Yeti Ouro is an ERC-20 token tied to the Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn racing game powered by Unreal Engine. Players can earn YETIO tokens by participating in races and challenges within the game. The token’s supply is capped at 1 billion, ensuring scarcity and potentially increasing its value as demand grows. Still in the presale stage, Yeti Ouro has garnered over $730,000 in investments from interested users. The development team has also posted updates on the game’s progress, such as behind-the-scenes footage which can only increase interest in the project. Yeti Ouro is also providing a 20% discount during its Black Friday sale from November 29 to December 2, making it even more attractive for early investors. Consequently, with its unique combination of gaming and decentralized finance, Yeti Ouro is positioned to break into the top 10 cryptocurrency rankings in the future.

37047530,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98187,1732971238,XRP Eyes Massive Wins On Trump Overhaul as Ex-CFTC Chair Says SEC May Drop Ripple Fight,"Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo has hinted at a potential pivot in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach to its high-profile legal battle against Ripple over XRP. In a Fox Business interview on Wednesday, Giancarlo suggested that the SEC might abandon its appeal against Ripple after a series of courtroom defeats. When asked by reporter Charles Gasparino, whether the SEC would drop the XRP case, Giancarlo responded, “I think they should… I bet they would ,” emphasizing the need for regulatory agencies to reconsider cases they’ve lost at the trial court level. “I would recommend, it’s time for regulatory agencies to drop a lot of these cases which they have lost at the trial court,” he noted. Giancarlo’s remarks come as optimism surges in the crypto community following Trump’s election victory, raising hopes for a more crypto-friendly agenda. This renewed confidence follows years of backlash against the “regulation by enforcement” approach championed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, exemplified by the XRP lawsuit . Notably, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, accusing the company of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After years of legal battles, a landmark ruling in July 2023 concluded that XRP is not inherently a security, especially when sold on secondary markets. Later, Ripple Labs was fined $125 million for the improper sale of XRP tokens. However, both parties have since cross-appealed aspects of the decision, prolonging the case’s uncertain outcome. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has been vocal about the impact of the lawsuit on Ripple’s U.S. operations. In a recent interview , Garlinghouse criticized the Biden administration’s “hostile” stance toward cryptocurrency, calling it an “unlawful war” on the industry. He expressed optimism that a Trump administration would provide the clarity and support needed for crypto to thrive in the U.S., potentially making the country a global leader in digital assets again. That said, Trump’s election victory has brought hope for regulatory change. According to the Kalshi prediction website, reports suggest that Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner with a pro-innovation stance, is the frontrunner to replace Gensler. Atkins is widely respected for his deep understanding of cryptocurrencies and the SEC’s operations, making him a likely ally for the crypto industry. Additionally, Trump’s team has indicated plans to decentralize crypto oversight, potentially shifting some responsibilities to the CFTC and appointing a dedicated “crypto czar.” Meanwhile, the SEC’s potential retreat from its appeal against Ripple could signal a broader shift in crypto regulation. As the incoming administration prioritizes innovation and clarity, the crypto industry may see a significant turnaround in its U.S. prospects, paving the way for growth and investment.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-massive-wins-on-trump-overhaul-as-ex-cftc-chair-says-sec-may-drop-ripple-fight/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Their potential for rapid growth and targeted use cases can make them exceptionally profitable for those seeking long-term investments. Among the standout choices are BlockDAG (BDAG), a leading Layer 1 blockchain; Tron (TRX), a leader in decentralized content creation; Tether (USDT), the reliable stablecoin for portfolio stability; and Sei (SEI), a powerhouse built for DeFi. Let’s uncover what makes them the best altcoins for long-term investment. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Unmatched Layer 1 Potential BlockDAG (BDAG) stands apart from traditional blockchains with its unique directed acyclic graph (DAG) architecture, enabling the fastest transactions in the industry while maintaining scalability and security. With the coin presale currently underway, BlockDAG has already broken records by raising over $152 million and selling more than 16.6 billion BDAG coins. Starting at just $0.001 in batch 1, BDAG’s price has now climbed to $0.0234, marking an impressive 2240% increase. This growth reflects strong confidence in the platform’s potential, making it one of the largest presales in the crypto space. From November 29 to December 2, BlockDAG is also a massive Black Friday bonus, allowing buyers to receive 150% extra BDAG coins by using the code BLACKFRIDAY150 during checkout. With the presale advancing quickly through batch 26, this limited-time opportunity adds to the excitement. As BDAG’s price is expected to rise further, crypto enthusiasts looking to maximize their holdings may find this the perfect moment to join the BlockDAG ecosystem, especially before the bonus ends. 2. Tron (TRX): A Key Player in the Web3 Era Tron (TRX) is a blockchain platform designed to revolutionize digital content by empowering creators through decentralization. By removing intermediaries, Tron enables a direct connection between creators and audiences, ensuring fair rewards and reduced costs. The 2018 acquisition of BitTorrent added decentralized file-sharing to its ecosystem, enhancing its utility. TRX, the network’s native token, powers transactions, and dApps while supporting its energy-efficient Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus. With its focus on Web3 and creative freedom, Tron positions itself as a key player in the future of digital content and entertainment. 3. Tether (USDT): The Backbone of Crypto Stability Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin that plays a critical role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing a dependable link between digital assets and fiat currencies. Pegged to the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 ratio, USDT offers stability amidst the volatility of crypto markets, making it one of the best altcoins for long-term investment. While not designed for speculative gains, Tether addresses key challenges in liquidity and risk management. Its widespread adoption across exchanges ensures seamless transactions, making it an indispensable asset for navigating and stabilizing a crypto portfolio. 4. Sei (SEI): The Future of DeFi Infrastructure Sei (SEI) is a specialized Layer 1 blockchain tailored for the unique demands of decentralized finance (DeFi). Its ultra-fast transaction speeds and low-latency execution make it an ideal choice for trading-focused applications and high-frequency trading platforms. Designed to optimize liquidity and enable instant settlements, Sei addresses the limitations of traditional blockchains in DeFi. As decentralized applications continue integrating with Sei’s robust ecosystem, the utility of SEI tokens grows, powering transactions and securing the network. With its innovative approach, Sei is carving its place in the evolving DeFi landscape. Why These Altcoins Are the Best For Long-Term Investment Altcoins are vital components of the cryptocurrency market, offering specialized solutions that cater to diverse needs and solve real-world problems. BlockDAG (BDAG) impresses with its DAG architecture and record-breaking $152 million presale, making it a strong contender for scalability-focused holders. Tron (TRX) revolutionizes digital content creation, fostering decentralization and creative empowerment. Tether (USDT) remains indispensable for its stability, acting as a reliable anchor during market volatility. Meanwhile, Sei (SEI) is carving its niche in the DeFi sector with its ultra-fast, liquidity-optimised ecosystem. Whether it’s scalability, decentralization, stability, or DeFi innovation, these coins represent the future of the altcoin market. Each project demonstrates strong potential to be among the best altcoins for long-term investment. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The Top 3 Best Cryptos For 2024 — BlockDAG, Solana & Hedera","2025 is set to be a captivating year for the cryptocurrency world. The market is gearing up for a major shift, driven by evolving regulations, technological advancements, and new players entering the space. As governments, institutions, and industries embrace digital currencies, the potential for explosive growth in the sector is undeniable. However, this rapid expansion also means that smart, strategic investments made in 2024 will set the stage for wealth-building opportunities in 2025. Choosing the right projects to back now can make all the difference when the market begins its next major growth cycle. If traders wait too long, they risk missing out on early entry advantages. Here’s a look at three top cryptocurrencies, BlockDAG (BDAG) , Solana (SOL), and Hedera (HBAR), that have the potential to lead the charge in 2024. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Future of Scalable Blockchain BlockDAG isn’t just another blockchain project, it's changing the game as it introduces new functionality to the market. Unlike traditional blockchains, which process transactions sequentially, BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, allowing multiple transactions to occur simultaneously. This parallel processing dramatically increases scalability and speed, making it an ideal solution for industries that require high transaction throughput, like DeFi, supply chain management, and digital payments. The coin is currently priced at $0.0234, whereas the BlockDAG crypto presale has raised over $152 million, with 16.6 billion coins already sold. Early buyers have seen an impressive 2240% return on investment, and as the presale moves into batch 26, there’s still a lot of momentum behind the project. The combination of scalability, speed, and low transaction costs makes BlockDAG an integral player in the future of blockchain technology. As more industries seek blockchain solutions capable of handling high volumes of transactions in real time, BlockDAG stands out as a top-tier project for long-term growth. The upcoming years are sure to reveal even greater potential for this disruptive technology, making now the perfect time to get involved before it takes off. 2. Solana (SOL): The Go-To Blockchain For Developers Solana (SOL) continues to impress with its rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees, making it a leading choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and NFTs. Its strong developer community and scalability have played a key role in its growth, positioning Solana as a go-to blockchain for developers looking for an efficient, high-performance platform. While the early days of Solana offered explosive growth, investors might find that the returns in the short term are not as eye-popping as they once were. The project’s early success has led to its current standing as a reliable and relatively safe choice, but future growth may be slower compared to newer, more innovative projects like BlockDAG. 3. Hedera (HBAR): Federal Payment Integration Hedera (HBAR) stands out as a blockchain solution with real-world use cases, especially in the financial sector. Its integration with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FedNow payment system is a testament to its potential to transform how payments are processed on a national scale. Hedera’s speed, security, and scalability make it an ideal choice for businesses and institutions looking to adopt blockchain technology for practical applications. While Hedera has made significant strides in institutional adoption, its reliance on centralized governance can be a turn-off for some decentralized purists. Despite this, Hedera’s role in real-world blockchain adoption places it in an excellent position for steady, long-term growth. All Three Are Worth Watching, But Which One Stands Out? As we look toward 2025 and beyond, the opportunities in the crypto market are clear. Solana and Hedera each bring unique strengths to the table. Solana offers a strong, reliable platform for DeFi and NFTs, though its explosive growth might be slowing. Hedera’s real-world applications in financial systems and blockchain’s integration into government platforms make it a compelling investment, particularly for those interested in institutional adoption. Ultimately, BlockDAG presents the best potential for high returns, especially by showing its holders a huge 2240% ROI. An impressive ROI goes a long way in impressing traders. But BlockDAG isn’t just a great ROI opportunity, it is also introducing scalable fast tech. This means BlockDAG will show traders great returns for years to come. But the time to make a move is now, as these opportunities don’t come around very often.

37047158,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/11/s-cardanos-ada-price-rally-to-2-still-on,1732970590,s Cardano’s (ADA) Price Rally to $2 Still on?,"Cardano (ADA) has been one of November's top performers in the cryptocurrency market. During its 140% rally, ADA reached a multi-year high of $0.80. However, ADA has faced a 5% pullback in the past day, trading at $0.78 as of this writing. However, the question remains: Can Cardano maintain its speed and reach the elusive $2 mark? Or can oncoming technical and market hurdles indicate otherwise? ADA's $2 Dream Might Take a Deeper Hit While ADA's recent gain has been spectacular, multiple technical signs signal that big challenges lay ahead. First, a bearish RSI divergence is emerging on ADA's daily chart, indicating that purchasing pressure is waning despite the market's rising trend. ADA RSI is currently near 68, approaching the overbought zone, indicating a possible correction. Second, the long-term resistance at $0.90 is a crucial obstacle. This level corresponds to key Fibonacci retracement trends and has previously indicated large sell-off zones for ADA. Past rallies have reversed sharply after reaching this stage, resulting in price declines of more than 65%. Furthermore, broader market dynamics, such as lower trading volumes and tighter liquidity in the altcoin sector, increase the possibility of a price reversal. To reach $2, ADA would need to overcome these limitations decisively—a feat that would necessitate considerable institutional interest and market sentiment. Although this feat is not elusive, experts predict it might now happen in 2024, as earlier projected. Instead, Q2 2025 is a more realistic timeframe for Cardano to reach the $2 milestone. Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Might Be the Smarter Bet Right Now While Cardano’s projected climb to $2 confronts difficulties, another token is gaining traction: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is a transformational force in the cryptocurrency space, revolutionizing asset tokenization and capturing the market's attention with its creative ecosystem. Rexas Finance offers real-world asset (RWA) tokenization using blockchain technology, exposing investors to real estate, artwork, and commodities. This democratization of high-value markets lowers barriers, increases liquidity, and offers regular investors new opportunities. The project has seen phenomenal acceptance in the ongoing presale stages, with the first five phases completed ahead of schedule. Currently, in Stage 6, Rexas Finance has raised $11.5 million and sold 191 million RXS tokens. The token is currently priced at $0.08, with a price increase to $0.09 scheduled for Stage 7. After the presale, RXS will officially list on at least three tier-1 exchanges at $0.20, with tremendous upside potential for early investors. Notably, Rexas Finance stands out for its strategic decision to forego venture capital funding in favor of a full public presale to assure decentralization. This decision has resulted in a dedicated and involved community while upholding the project's essential ideals. Rexas Finance recently completed a Certik audit, strengthening the project's confidence and demonstrating its dedication to security and transparency. It has also been included on important tracking websites such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, increasing visibility and reaching a larger audience. For investors aiming to optimize their investments, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway. The top 20 winners will each receive $50,000 in RXS tokens. This effort not only rewards early adopters but also creates a thriving community around the coin. RXS is positioned for a significant rally thanks to its novel approach to the enormous RWA market, well-defined roadmap, and upcoming mega listings. Experts predict a huge increase in price once the coin is listed on major exchanges, making now the ideal moment to invest. Conclusion While Cardano's rally to $2 might face some technical issues, Rexas Finance appears as an intriguing alternative with unrivaled growth potential. Don't pass up the opportunity to participate in RXS during its presale stage—join Rexas Finance today and position yourself for future benefits.

Rexas Finance's smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by CertiK, therefore guaranteeing a safe ecosystem given security is a priority. Listing on CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko has improved RXS's profile and drawn retail and institutional investors. The platform's $1 million giveaway promotion, whereby 20 participants will each receive $50,000 in RXS, has stoked enthusiasm and community development even more. Utility-Driven Ecosystem: RXS is not merely buzz. Its practical uses— Tokenized fundraising, safe asset management, and DeFi integration—set it apart. The investor thinks RXS could follow in Ethereum's early success since it can transform conventional finance. Polkadot (DOT) Because of its innovative approach to interoperability, Polkadot (DOT) stays a mainstay in the investors' portfolio. Polkadot helps blockchains to easily share data and communicate, so building a single network of distributed apps. Why is Polkadot? Polkadot's unmatched scalability made possible by its parachain technology makes it a first choice for business solutions. Growing numbers of initiatives are based on Polkadot, therefore enhancing the value of the ecosystem. Investors can stake DOT to get pleasing returns, therefore generating a passive income source. The investor perceives Polkadot as inexpensive with untapped potential even though it’s currently valued at a mere fraction of its peak in 2021. Hedera (HBAR) Popular for its energy efficiency and fast transactions, the Enterprise Blockchain Hedera (HBAR) has grown to be a preferred choice for corporate blockchain solutions. Why Hedera Stands Out Enterprising Adoption Hedera's governing council consists of companies including Google, IBM, and Boeing, therefore highlighting its credibility. Low energy usage of HBAR fits with world sustainability targets, hence it is a popular alternative for environmentally minded investors. With a market valuation of $5.36 billion and trading at $0.1402, Hedera has shown fortitude in declining markets. The investor regards Hedera as a long-term investment tool for anyone looking for exposure to blockchain adoption pushed by businesses. Cronos, or Driving Blockchain Adoption via Crypto.com One of the biggest crypto exchanges worldwide, Cronos is the natural token of the Crypto.com ecosystem. The token's use covers staking incentives, trading fee discounts, and involvement in the DeFi ecosystem run of Crypto.com. CRO runs the Visa cards, NFT marketplace, DeFi services, and Crypto.com platform. The rising need for CRO is predicted as Crypto.com grows internationally. At $0.1874 with a market capitalization of almost $5 billion as of writing, the investor regards CRO as an inexpensive stock with great potential for growth. Cronos is positioned to gain from the growing acceptance of crypto services given its close integration into the ecosystem of Crypto.com. Kaspa, or High-Performance Blockchain Emerging blockchain platform Kaspa stresses decentralizing, scalability, and speed. Constructed using the blockDAG protocol, Kaspa is among the quickest blockchains available since it lets transactions be handled in parallel. Why he is Purchasing Kaspa? Kaspa's blockDAG design presents unparalleled scalability and speed, so it is a game-changer in blockchain architecture. The active community and developer environment of Kaspa guarantees ongoing innovation. Kaspa has great growth potential with a price of $0.1545 and a market capitalization of $3.89 billion. Kaspa presents to the investor a high-upside gamble on next-generation blockchain technologies. Conclusion The investor's approach stresses utility, creativity, and diversification as the 2025 bull run gets ready. Rexas Finance is his first choice as its real-world asset tokenizing system shows great expansion possibility. This portfolio is meant to strike the best of both worlds—stability and exponential gains—along with basics like Polkadot, Hedera, Cronos, and Kaspa. The window to act is available right now; for those brave enough to grab it, the benefits could be transformative for their life.

As stablecoins take center stage for liquidity and trading pairs, Bitcoin appears to be solidifying its status as a store of value rather than a transactional asset. This confluence of reduced sell pressure, increasing institutional trust, and market maturation creates an intriguing setup for Bitcoin. While short-term price movements remain unpredictable, the broader trends suggest that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory is underpinned by strengthening fundamentals. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the focus is shifting from short-term speculation to sustainable growth and adoption. Investors and enthusiasts alike should be prepared for Bitcoin to surprise the market once again, potentially rewriting expectations as it marches forward in its journey.

37046946,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/11/this-solana-sol-alternative-below-015-is-set-to-rise-to-45-in-only-6-weeks,1732970094,This Solana (SOL) Alternative Below $0.15 is Set to Rise to $4.5 in Only 6 Weeks,"With its high-speed blockchain and outstanding distributed exchange (DEX) volume, Solana (SOL) has created waves in the crypto sector and become a major participant. Solana's DEX exceeded $100 billion in November 2024, attesting to its status as among the most promising cryptocurrencies. The SOL meme coin fever, which has seen rising activity from both whales and new retail investors, has helped to drive this surge in some measure. Though Solana has great momentum, other altcoins are starting to attract investors, including Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance, a radical participant in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization field, quietly creates waves as the market heats up and the crypto world watches for the next great thing. At less than $0.15, Rexas Finance is poised for a rapid climb, maybe rising 41x in six weeks. Let's examine more closely the reasons for the great confidence of analysts and specialists about this Solana substitute. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Revolutionary Platform with Strong Growth Potential Rexas Finance is changing the scene of asset tokenization. Unlike most blockchain initiatives, Rexas Finance is committed to making real-world asset tokenization available to anyone and provides a user-friendly interface that enables companies and people to quickly tokenize actual assets. Rexas Finance simplifies the procedure for property, vehicles, or other high-value assets, therefore introducing blockchain technologies' capabilities to sectors typically slower to embrace. Strong community support and a robust technological basis have drawn attention to the platform. Rexas Finance is a unique offer in a changing industry since it can democratize access to asset-backed tokens, therefore drawing investors from all walks of life who see great long-term potential. Rexas Finance has advanced remarkably since its early September 2024 inception, especially concerning its presale events. Having seen great demand for its RXS tokens, the project has effectively finished several phases. Rexas Finance is in Stage 8 of its presale as of writing; tokens run at $0.10—up from $0.09 in Stage 7. Out of a $20,750,000 target, the presale has already raised $16,853,181 with 251,029,539 tokens sold from a total supply of 290,000,000 tokens. The expanding understanding of Rexas Finance's special market position fuels this demand. Rexas Finance is a creative answer to a long-standing asset management issue unlike other crypto ventures, which can suffer volatility and lack real-world use cases. Rexas Finance is creating fresh opportunities for investment and financial development by letting individuals tokenize and exchange actual assets on the blockchain. Rexas Finance's Price Projections and Massive Upside Potential Rexas Finance presents an interesting chance in a market where many investors concentrate mostly on high profits. Based on Rexas Finance capitalizing on the continuous bull run and rising acceptance of its real-world asset tokenizing strategy, analysts are projecting a 41x gain in value inside the next 6 weeks. Currently less than $0.15, Rexas Finance offers a reasonable starting place for those wishing to profit from its expansion. Experts think that the value of RXS tokens could rise to as high as $4.00 by the end of this year as the platform picks more traction and enters more general market acceptance. This is in sharp contrast to well-known cryptocurrencies like Solana, whose price performance—despite its optimistic future—is projected to be limited in the near run due to overbought situations and resistance levels. Although Solana is a powerful competitor, Rexas Finance's creative strategy to address practical challenges offers it a possible edge that might result in more quick expansion. Why Rexas Finance is a Strong Solana Substitute Solana has a great reputation, but lately, its price trend has halted because of market conditions and rising competition. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, has great potential to grow quickly in a short period since it leads the front in the unexplored sector of real-world asset tokenization. Moreover, the great interest produced by Rexas Finance's presale suggests that the initiative has great investor trust. Features like the Rexas Token Builder and AI Shield, together with strategic alliances and audits (like Certik's most recent verification), guarantee that Rexas Finance is a safe and scalable platform for consumers and investors. Rexas Finance stands to see a significant price increase as the token moves through its presale phases and final listing on main exchanges. Conclusion In terms of blockchain and asset management, the tokenizing platform of Rexas Finance offers a revolutionary prospect. Rexas Finance can rival big cryptocurrencies like Solana by using its creative strategy and strong market acceptance, thus becoming a major participant in the altcoin scene. Investing in Rexas Finance below $0.15 could be your way to diversify your crypto portfolio and experience a 41x return in the next few weeks—a possible growth opportunity that could surpass other prominent cryptocurrencies in a market ready for disturbance.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-santa-trump-will-skyrocket-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-dogecoin-shib-and-pepe-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

These euro- and US dollar-referenced e-money tokens, issued on the Ethereum blockchain, reflect growing adoption of compliant stablecoin models. This trend aligns with increasing demand for transparency and regulatory adherence in the digital asset space. However, innovation in the crypto world continues to clash with regulatory pressures. Legal battles, such as those surrounding Tornado Cash, highlight the delicate balance between fostering technological advancement and addressing compliance concerns. As the crypto landscape advances, stablecoins are becoming more than just a tool for trading—they are a foundation for financial innovation. With institutional players increasing their stakes and regulated stablecoins gaining traction, the stage is set for the next phase of growth in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The regulatory green light is anticipated within days, potentially enabling the stablecoin’s launch as early as December 4. Ripple’s RLUSD is designed to serve the growing demand for trusted and transparent digital dollar solutions. This move represents Ripple’s strategic foray into the competitive stablecoin market, currently dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). A New Chapter in Cross-Border Payments Ripple Labs first announced its plans to develop RLUSD in April 2024, aiming to integrate the stablecoin into its cross-border payment ecosystem alongside XRP. The company envisions RLUSD as a complementary product, emphasizing that it will not replace XRP but instead enhance liquidity solutions. “There is a clear demand for stablecoins that deliver trust, stability, and utility,” Ripple stated earlier this year. With RLUSD’s impending launch , Ripple intends to leverage the stablecoin and XRP to streamline global payment flows, providing faster settlement and improved customer experiences. RLUSD has undergone rigorous testing on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet, with Ripple planning to expand support to additional blockchains. Moreover, the company has outlined a robust framework for transparency, committing to third-party audits and monthly reports on the stablecoin’s reserves, which will include cash and short-term equivalents. Ripple’s Expanding Ecosystem Ripple has already secured partnerships with prominent exchanges, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, and MoonPay, to facilitate RLUSD’s adoption. These alliances underscore Ripple’s commitment to building an extensive infrastructure for its stablecoin while maintaining regulatory compliance through its New York Trust Company Charter. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s co-founder and CEO, has reaffirmed the company’s dedication to advancing its broader ecosystem. He noted the dual role of XRP and RLUSD in enhancing liquidity and enabling seamless cross-border transactions. Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market aligns with its projection of a $2 trillion industry capitalization by 2028. The company sees ample room for innovation and competition, positioning RLUSD as a reliable and compliant alternative in the growing digital asset space.

This New ICO Could Change Your Mind,"Have you ever wondered how different your life would look if you’d taken a chance on crypto early? Imagine being among the first to spot a promising ICO, but instead, you hesitated, unsure of its potential. For many, Tezos (XTZ) was one of those missed opportunities. As a blockchain project that introduced self-amending technology, Tezos had the potential to stand out from the crowd. Fast forward to today, and while Tezos remains a solid choice for long-term holders, its early investors were the ones who truly reaped the rewards. Now, if you’ve ever felt like you’re late to the crypto party, here’s the good news: Qubetics ($TICS) is shaping up to be a similar opportunity. Offering cutting-edge solutions like its multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is designed to fix the gaps that its predecessors struggled with. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, this might just be the moment you’ve been waiting for. Missing the Qubetics Presale Could Be a Big Loss Imagine a world where you can manage all your crypto assets in one place without breaking a sweat. That’s the vision behind the Qubetics multi-chain wallet . From feeless $TICS transfers to integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay, this wallet is redefining how people interact with digital assets. Whether you’re a business owner juggling international payments, a freelancer dealing with overseas clients, or someone who’s just tired of clunky crypto apps, Qubetics has got you covered. Picture a small business owner in the US paying suppliers in Europe. Instead of dealing with high bank fees and delays, they use the Qubetics wallet to convert $TICS into stablecoins, making payments faster and cheaper. Or imagine a freelancer in Asia who gets paid in crypto but needs to use those funds for daily expenses. With the Qubetics virtual card, they can make instant transactions without waiting for fiat conversions. The wallet’s planned instant crypto-to-stablecoin conversion ensures reliability for merchants and service providers, creating a seamless payment experience. The Qubetics presale is already making waves. Now in its 10th stage, over 239 million $TICS tokens have been sold to 4,800+ holders, raising $3.6 million. At $0.025 per token, it’s one of the best crypto to buy now. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, projections suggest $1 (3787% ROI), $5 (19,337% ROI), and even $15 after the mainnet launch (58,213% ROI). Here’s how it stacks up: a $25,000 investment today at $0.025 gets you 1,000,000 $TICS tokens. By the presale’s end, when $TICS hits $0.25, that $25,000 becomes $250,000. Post-presale, at $1, it jumps to $1,000,000. If $TICS reaches $5, you’re looking at $5,000,000. And if it climbs to $15, that same $25,000 turns into $15,000,000. Missing this presale isn’t just a loss—it’s walking away from life-changing potential. Tezos’ Journey and What It Means for Investors Tezos has always been a trailblazer. It introduced the concept of a self-amending blockchain, allowing it to upgrade itself without needing a hard fork. During its ICO in 2017, Tezos became one of the largest fundraising events in crypto history. Priced at just $0.47 per token, early investors watched their investments skyrocket when Tezos hit over $9 in 2021. Even though its current price is lower, Tezos remains a strong player, thanks to its focus on governance and adaptability. It has found its niche in areas like decentralised applications and tokenised assets, with a growing number of projects choosing its ecosystem. Analysts see steady growth potential, making Tezos a solid choice for long-term holders. The lesson is clear: the best opportunities often lie in early-stage projects. For those who missed Tezos’ ICO, Qubetics offers a second shot at being part of something transformative. This New ICO Could Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For Crypto is full of stories about people who missed out. But the Qubetics presale is a chance to rewrite that narrative. With its innovative multi-chain wallet and a vision to make crypto accessible and practical for everyone, Qubetics is more than just a token—it’s a solution. At $0.025 per token, it’s easily the best crypto to buy now. With prices set to rise 10% in the next stage, waiting could mean missing out on a golden opportunity. Don’t let this presale pass you by. Visit Qubetics today and secure your $TICS tokens before it’s too late. This could be your ticket to turning missed chances into massive wins.

It’s not just another blockchain project—it’s a revolution for banks and institutions, offering transparency, speed, and massive cost savings. If you’re looking for a crypto that combines innovation with serious ROI potential, Qubetics might just be your golden ticket. 1. Qubetics: Transforming Cross-Border Payments The Qubetics Network is turning heads for all the right reasons. Imagine a world where banks and financial institutions can zip payments across borders faster than you can finish your morning coffee. That’s exactly what Qubetics is doing with its $TICS token. Leveraging blockchain tech helps banks ditch outdated, clunky payment systems and replace them with something far more efficient. The result? Instant settlements, reduced costs, and unparalleled transparency. It’s no wonder so many institutions are rushing to partner with the Qubetics Network. And here’s why it’s the best crypto to buy now . Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 10, and things are heating up. At just $0.025 per $TICS token, you can snag about 4,000 tokens for a $100 investment. But don’t wait—prices jump 10% each week, and the final phase will see a whopping 20% increase. With over $3.8M raised, 239M tokens sold, and more than 4,800 holders, investors are clearly taking notice. Once the presale ends, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, promising a staggering 900% ROI. Remember that early birds catch the worm, especially in crypto, if you’re still on the fence. 2. Bittensor: AI Meets Blockchain Bittensor is carving out its niche by marrying artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. This forward-thinking project is building a decentralised network for AI models, allowing developers to train and monetise their creations without being beholden to tech giants. It’s a win-win situation: AI gets smarter, and developers get fairly compensated. What’s exciting is how Bittensor is designed to scale. The project is gaining traction among AI enthusiasts who see it as a fairer, more transparent alternative to centralised systems. Plus, its staking mechanism ensures that contributors are incentivised to keep improving the network. For anyone interested in the intersection of AI and blockchain, Bittensor is worth a second look. That’s why it made this list. 3. Tezos: Sustainability Meets Innovation Tezos has been a quiet disruptor in the crypto world, focusing on self-upgrading technology and sustainability. Unlike many blockchains that fork when upgrades are needed, Tezos can evolve without splitting into two chains. This feature alone makes it a top pick for developers looking for stability. Even better, Tezos has committed to being eco-friendly. Its proof-of-stake mechanism significantly reduces energy consumption compared to traditional mining systems. With gaming, art, and finance partnerships, Tezos is proving it’s not just another blockchain. It’s adaptable, green, and future-focused, so it earns its spot on this list. 4. Tether: The Stablecoin Powerhouse Tether (USDT) is the go-to stablecoin for millions of crypto users worldwide. Backed by fiat reserves, it offers the stability of traditional currency while maintaining the flexibility of crypto. Whether you’re trading, hedging, or moving funds across borders, Tether is a reliable choice. Its widespread adoption speaks volumes. Tether is integrated with nearly every major exchange and serves as a lifeline for investors during volatile market swings. If stability in a rollercoaster market is what you’re after, Tether is a no-brainer. That’s why it’s on this list. 5. Ethereum: The OG of Smart Contracts Ethereum doesn’t just sit at the top—it practically built the throne. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum opened the door for decentralised apps, DeFi, and NFTs. Its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0, with a proof-of-stake mechanism, has significantly reduced energy usage while improving scalability. Developers flock to Ethereum because of its massive ecosystem, and its unparalleled network effects. It’s a blockchain that continues to innovate, proving its staying power repeatedly. For anyone serious about crypto, Ethereum is a must-have. That’s why it’s here. Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy Now Based on the latest research, the best cryptos to buy now include Qubetics, Ethereum, Tether, Tezos, and Bittensor. Each coin offers something unique, whether it’s innovation, stability, or sustainability. But Qubetics stands out with its groundbreaking approach to cross-border payments and jaw-dropping ROI potential. If you’re still undecided, consider this: investing in Qubetics during its presale could be a life-changing move. With prices set to soar and the $TICS token already making waves, there’s no better time to jump in. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just dipping your toes into the crypto waters, Qubetics is the opportunity you don’t want to miss. So, why wait?

37046454,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98183,1732969084,Cardano’s 189% Surge Hits Speed Bump as Crypto Markets Cool — What’s Next For ADA Price?,"Cardano (ADA) recently took the most hits of the top ten crypto assets by market capitalization. At press time, the asset is down 3% in the last 24 hours, trading at $1.09. This represents the state of the wider crypto market, with assets slowly declining from last week’s highs. The total crypto market cap stands at $3.4 trillion, declining 1%, while daily trading volumes are at $180 billion. Crypto prices tanked for several reasons, including activities in the derivatives market, meme coin swings, and high-profit taking. Data from Coinglass shows total market liquidations crossing $489 million in six hours. Cardano’s Drive Loses Steam Last week, Cardano gained momentum alongside other assets as on-chain factors flipped green. The asset’s drive was lauded by its community after it surged to multiple double-digit gains. The flipping of $1 was a bullish trigger as bulls leveraged on similar highs in Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA price maintains double-digit weekly gains amid a slump in the last two days. While weekly figures stand at 24%, monthly figures are at a staggering 189% rise. However, the frenzy faded, with the market cap falling to $33.7 billion. Other assets, such as BTC and ETH, posted 1% losses in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Solana and BNB recorded 2.69% and 3%, respectively. As expected, meme coins were also part of the sharp decline due to low sentiments. Meme tokens move in line with major assets, although their low market capitalization and community frenzy can lead to massive swings. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu recorded similar losses, while smaller meme tokens saw double-digit outflows. What’s Next For The Market? ADA bulls project a rebound from this low, citing several macro and industry factors. A major key point is the incoming pro-crypto regulations in the United States, which will increase the space’s adoption and innovation. Bitcoin whales also showed signs of dragging sentiments out of the red zone with few accumulations. Crypto analysts suggested the market is in a bull run, with one expected surge following this dip. “ The steady decline in Bitcoin reserves across all crypto exchanges indicates that we are likely in the middle of a sustained bull run. Some market participants who have not properly accumulated Bitcoin earlier are likely doing so now, realizing that this is likely the last downward correction before another upward price surge,” a CryptoQuant analyst wrote.",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-189-surge-hits-speed-bump-as-crypto-markets-cool-whats-next-for-ada-price/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
37046820,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51061,1732969056,XRP to $2 Before Ripple CEO On “60 Minutes” Airs,"The cryptocurrency market has been abuzz with discussions surrounding XRP, as the digital asset shows strong upward momentum. Following recent developments, Zach Rector, a finance analyst active on X, predicted XRP would reach $2 before Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s interview airs on 60 Minutes this Sunday at 7:00 PM EST. This bold prediction has further fueled excitement within the XRP community. XRP recently hit a multi-year high of $1.8474 and is currently trading at $1.82, reflecting a 15.3% increase over the past 24 hours. The asset’s bullish trajectory follows several notable announcements, including the resignation of Gary Gensler , current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler’s departure is seen as a positive shift for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly with Ripple’s ongoing legal battle against the SEC. There is also growing institutional interest in XRP, as multiple companies have applied for XRP-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Approval of these financial products would be a game changer, as ETFs notably helped Bitcoin hit an all-time high in March. They could boost XRP’s price and solidify its status as a key player in the finance space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Excitement for an XRP Surge in the Community Many community members are excited about the interview and the potential price surge for the digital asset. Rector’s forecast was echoed by other community members, some of whom have extended the timeline for XRP’s potential growth. One commenter predicted a climb to $1.95-$2.00 before Garlinghouse’s interview, with a subsequent surge to $3.50-$5.00 within one to two weeks. The same post envisioned XRP reaching $7-$10 by Christmas, attributing the projection to increasing market confidence and positive media coverage. Increasing Interest in XRP The upcoming 60 Minutes feature is a significant milestone for Ripple and the broader XRP ecosystem. The interview with Garlinghouse is expected to shed light on Ripple’s fight for regulatory clarity and efforts to advocate for pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the political aisle. Ripple is finally getting the recognition it deserves after years of fighting for the crypto market and proper regulation in the U.S. Prominent experts believe the new administration will dismiss the SEC’s long-running lawsuit . This could further boost XRP’s adoption and growth. All eyes are on XRP to see whether it can meet or exceed these ambitious targets after the interview.

Table of Contents XRP on-chain indicators signal price growth XRP eyes retest of April 2021 peak XRP derivatives traders turn bullish Strategic considerations XRP on-chain indicators signal price growth XRP traders increased their on-chain activity between Nov. 16 and 29, and Santiment recorded several spikes in the active addresses metric. The spikes represent the increase in activity, accompanied by a spike in transaction volume across exchange platforms. The network realized profit/loss metric used to identify the net profit/loss of all tokens traded on a given day shows that XRP traders have been transacting profitably since Nov. 4. Positive spikes above the neutral line indicate traders’ profit-taking. Typically, large positive spikes are associated with the likelihood of higher selling pressure on XRP; traders need to watch this metric closely for signs of a reversal in trend. The ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss is 6.73, meaning profitable transactions are dominant as XRP price rallies. The on-chain metrics support a bullish thesis for XRP price alongside technical and other indicators.

A successful break past this level could erase the losses for traders for the past three years. The relative strength index reads 88, meaning XRP is overvalued. While typically, this is considered a sell signal and could indicate an impending correction in XRP, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator signals further gains are likely. Green histogram bars above the neutral line support a thesis of XRP price rally. The $3 target is a psychologically important level for XRP; in January 2018, the altcoin hit a record high at $3. The altcoin has yet to revisit the level in the past six years. XRP/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news XRP could find support between $1.2643 and $1.4033 in the imbalance zone. A correction could send the altcoin to this support zone before further correction. Once the fair value gap is filled, XRP could resume its climb toward the April 2021 peak of $1.9669.

37045861,https://crypto.news/?p=14314932,1732968060,It’s time for a crypto-funding reboot | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. It seems like hardly a day goes by without a new decentralized finance project promising to reshape how users think about money and investing. Lately, this trend has only intensified. You might also like: The transformative potential of Bitcoin in the job market | Opinion In the rapidly evolving DeFi world, new initiatives push the boundaries of what digital assets can offer. For many, the excitement surrounding these projects highlights the potential for a more transparent and accessible financial future. While DeFi protocols have the potential to disrupt and democratize finance, many of these projects face significant challenges in securing capital to develop innovative products and stay consistent with their roadmaps. We can chalk this up to a few key reasons that mainly stem from the core tenets of decentralized business models. For instance, traditional businesses can rely on bank loans or public markets to raise funds, a luxury that DeFi projects don’t have due to their reliance on decentralized governance and existing in an unclear regulatory environment. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. For one, many DeFi projects cannot access capital pools typically available to traditional tech startups. While venture capital firms specializing in web3 and crypto exist, the number of startups exceeds the number of VCs ready to invest, creating a highly competitive funding environment. The need for alternatives In recent years, the rise of entrepreneurship has heightened the demand for alternative funding solutions, which has caused funding avenues like crypto launchpads to gain popularity. It’s easy to see why—crypto launchpads provide a different route for projects by tapping into a global pool of investors and fostering a more inclusive network of contributors. However, the launchpad ecosystem has deteriorated as platforms rely heavily on token sale models, which prioritize short-term financial gain over sustained community engagement. Token sales can attract speculative investors looking for quick profits rather than those committed to the project’s vision. This approach often leads to an imbalanced distribution of funds, with little to no involvement from community members, affecting a project’s long-term success. So, projects have become disillusioned with the fundraising options available to them. They face either having to go down the VC route or deal with a hyper-competitive crypto launchpad marketplace that may not align with their needs. However, some projects have taken notice of this oversaturation and taken steps to provide an alternative. Astrovault , for example, has developed a new fundraising platform that draws from its experience as a decentralized exchange. The platform, titled Outbid, has been presented for integration directly into the Cosmos Hub to facilitate new ways for projects to raise funds. Outbid is a decentralized, gamified launchpad designed to create a transparent fundraising pipeline for projects in the vast, loosely integrated Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. By gamifying the fundraising process through an auction-style micro-sale mechanism, Astrovault has facilitated a way to get communities on Cosmos more actively involved in raising money for projects they see potential in. And since all projects are parameterized, Outbid’s platform can help fundraise for any type of deal or stage of development. The project suggests that the platform would be governed by any DAO selected by Cosmos, who would be responsible for overseeing marketing and business development activities. Additionally, the platform plans to support fundraising efforts by matching donations, allowing early-stage projects to gain exposure and backing from the community. Ultimately, every worthy project deserves a safe and transparent place to begin its journey and connect with people who will help bring its vision to life. By fostering a community-driven approach to fundraising, projects can build trust, engage with early supporters, and lay the groundwork necessary for long-term success. By focusing on creating more collaborative models for fundraising, founders can feel empowered while ensuring their projects have the support they need from users who truly understand their value.

37045817,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655745,1732968059,Worldcoin (WLD) About To Breakout? Analyst Sets Next Target After 4-Month High,"Worldcoin (WLD) has seen a nearly 40% surge in the last week, briefly testing the $3 mark. The cryptocurrency hit a 4-month high after nearing the upper zone of a multi-month range. Its recent performance has fueled investors’ optimism about a possible breakout, which could send the token to new highs. Worldcoin Hits 4-Month High Worldcoin has seen a considerable decline since hitting its all-time high (ATH) of $11.74, retracing around 75% from its March high. During the Q3 retraces, the cryptocurrency lost the $3 support, diving below the $2 mark after August’s “Black Monday.” Since then, WLD has hovered between the $1.3-$3.2 price range, consolidating below the $2.5 for the past couple of months. Following the November Post-election rally, Worldcoin has surged around 75% in three weeks, reclaiming the $2 zone. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency’s momentum propelled WLD above the $2.5 resistance level for the first time in three months, turning it into support the following days. Moreover, the token surged 23% intraday, hitting its four-month high on November 28 after momentarily trading above the $3 mark. Crypto analyst Yuriy suggested that a “big move” is coming for the cryptocurrency. The analyst noted that WLD’s open interest (OI) has significantly surged this month, rising 135% since election day. According to Coinglass data , Worldcoin’s OI jumped from $184 million to $433 million in three weeks, recording its second-highest day on Wednesday. Additionally, it has seen a 9.65% in the last 24 hours and a 12% jump in the past hour, signaling heightened confidence and participation in the cryptocurrency. To Yuriy, the cryptocurrency could follow the steps of Cardano (ADA), which recently saw its price hit a 2-year high. Following its OI increase, the token recovered from its 75% decline and broke out of its multi-month consolidation range, reclaiming the long-awaited $1 mark. WLD’s Breakout To Target $3.5 The analyst explained that, after the recent WLD price action, the $2.8 mark is a crucial support level to confirm, as it served as a significant resistance level earlier this month. As a result, consolidating above this level could propel the token’s price to the next target . The token is nearing a breakout from the 4-month range, which could target the $3.5 price range in the short term. Analyst AMBcrypto pointed out that the $3.5 mark is the next major resistance for Worldcoin, indicating that a breakout from this level “will push it towards the previous high” of $11. As of this writing, Worldcoin trades above $2.9, having surged 31% in the last month. Additionally, the token has seen a 42% increase in daily activity, registering a trading volume of $1.67 billion in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,ADA | WLD,ADA | BUSINESS | TRADING | WLD,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/worldcoin-wld-about-to-breakout-analyst-sets-next-target-after-4-month-high/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37045817.jpeg

In the meantime, the Cardano price , which had remained consolidated for quite a long time, has broken above the range. The price has surged over 200% in a month and a bullish close is expected to kick off a strong rally until the end of the yearly trade. Therefore, the price is expected to initiate a fresh rise, which could push the levels close to the ATH. On the other hand, after integrating with Bitcoin (OS), the ADA has gained over $1.3 trillion in BTC liquidity. This has paved the way for the star token to expand it’s decentralised finance or DeFi, ecosystem. Moreover, Cardano users can now securely access Bitcoin without intermediaries, enhancing cross-chain functionality. Besides, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson reveals plans for Quantum Hosky, which is expected to integrate major memecoins & GameFi into a unique metaverse. While the Cardano chain is about to revolutionize with BOS making it Bitcoin’s DeFi layer and Quantum Hosky promising to unite fun and innovation. Moreover, with the Cardano ETF on the horizon, here is what to expect from the ADA price rally. The long-term price action of the Cardano price remains bullish as the action is stuck within the parabolic recovery curve. However, after a massive rise, the ADA price is expected to undergo a small pullback as the +Di is displaying a bearish divergence after undergoing a significant rise. Besides, the RSI has reached the overbought zone and could be preparing for a small plunge. This could drag the ADA price slightly below $1, close to $0.86 to $0.88. While this could be a short-lived pullback that may attract huge liquidity over the platform.

Speaking on Speak Up with Anthony Scaramucci, the Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder and chief investment officer touched on Bitcoin’s strong potential, fueled by historical trends and market dynamics. Lee attributed his bullish view to Bitcoin’s halving, a major event where the reward for mining Bitcoin blocks is cut in half, slowing the rate at which new coins are mined. This event, which has occurred previously this year, has historically preceded significant price increases. “The sweet spot for this price increase is towards the end of this year and into next year,” Lee said, adding that Bitcoin’s price has been closely followed by previous halving cycles. Another important factor in Lee’s optimism is the potential for positive U.S. government policies. Lee noted the new administration’s pro-Bitcoin stance and the possibility that the U.S. would accept Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. He said this move could significantly bolster Bitcoin’s legitimacy and increase demand. “If the U.S. government eventually reaches one million Bitcoins, it will be the largest holder of Bitcoin in the world,” Lee said, comparing the strategy to MicroStrategy’s successful use of Bitcoin as a balance sheet asset. Related News: Analytics Company Shares Key Price Levels That Will Determine Bitcoin's Fate While Lee is firm on his Bitcoin prediction, he also sees potential in other cryptocurrencies. Along with Ethereum and Solana, he expects altcoins to perform well, especially as Bitcoin’s dominance in the market could wane in 2025. “The stronger Bitcoin is, the stronger the ecosystem is,” Lee says, predicting a productive altcoin season next year. When pressed by Scaramucci for a definitive prediction, Lee confidently said, “I think a year from now Bitcoin will be something around $250,000.” *This is not investment advice.

RCO Finance soars as November’s top altcoin by offering unique AI features like an AI Robo Advisor, access to numerous assets, and 1000x leverage. With these features, experts believe that RCO Finance could witness double-digit gains with an investment of $500, yielding $50k by 2025. Let’s see how this could happen! >>> Join RCOF Presale Shiba Inu Secures Its Price Breakout With Massive Token Burns Shiba Inu’s successful breakout from its consolidation phase signals increased investor optimism. Yet, its recent activity hasn’t caused any significant changes in its price movement, as SHIB’s price has only witnessed a 1.9% gain over the past week. Recently, Shiba Inu shared its roadmap for removing 99% of SHIB tokens from circulation, which raised concerns among investors who saw this as an impossible feat. Despite the potential for Shiba Inu to witness increased demand from its massive token burns, experts believe that burning 99% of the token supply would make Shiba Inu too expensive. Due to the shortcomings of Shiba Inu’s planned burns, investors have targeted double-digit gains by 2025 on RCO Finance. Solana Faces Losses Due To Market-Wide Price Corrections Solana has experienced a price correction, falling to $234 due to market-wide corrections. This comes after a 30% pump over the past month. Despite this, Solana’s DEX ecosystem hit a new milestone of $125 billion monthly trading volume in November. Experts say this spike in DeFi trading volume results from Solana’s low transaction fees. It has also been driven by rising interest in meme coins minted on Solana’s Pump.Fun. However, the ongoing correction has led to slightly negative sentiments surrounding Solana’s price performance. This price retracement has also forced investors to shift attention to alternatives like RCO Finance, which has a huge potential for massive gains. RCO Finance’s Lucrative Presale And Superior AI Financial Tools Could Help It Surpass Other Tokens RCO Finance’s presale is one reason experts say the AI-based project can outrun Solana and Shiba Inu. Interested investors can now buy the RCOF token for $0.05 and earn a whopping 1,100% profit when the presale ends. The protocol also stands out with its advanced AI features powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. The AI Robo Advisor is central to the RCO Finance platform, which uses investors’ financial goals and risk tolerance to provide personalized investment strategies.

The platform offers stocks, bonds, cryptocurrency, ETFs, and tokenized real-world assets like real estate, allowing users to strengthen their portfolios. Furthermore, the KYC-free system promotes anonymity and privacy, allowing you to prevent your personal information from going out while you enjoy the platform’s features.

This measure ensures that all operations on RCO Finance are secure and free of vulnerabilities. Why You Should Buy RCOF Today: Get 1,100% Returns By 2025! Because of multiple investment opportunities, analysts are bullish on RCO Finance’s potential to turn $500 investments into $50,000 by 2025.

The project distributed a massive 310 million HYPE tokens to its community, valuing the giveaway at $1.2 billion based on an initial token price of $3.90, as reported by CoinGecko. The excitement surrounding HYPE skyrocketed soon after the launch. Within 12 hours, the token’s value surged by 63%, reaching $6.16 and propelling its market capitalization near the $2 billion threshold. The buzz reflects growing confidence in Hyperliquid’s ecosystem, built on a high-performance, proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain designed to process up to 200,000 transactions per second. Tokenomics and Strategic Allocation The genesis event distributed 31% of Hyperliquid’s one billion HYPE tokens, with the remaining supply allocated for sustained growth and ecosystem development. Approximately 38.8% is reserved for future emissions and community rewards, while 6% is designated for the Hyper Foundation treasury and 0.3% for grants. Notably, core contributors will receive 23.8% of the total supply, locked for one year with vesting schedules extending to 2028. Hyperliquid’s decision to exclude private investors, centralized exchanges, and market makers from token allocations underscores its commitment to community-focused decentralization. HYPE tokens serve as the backbone of the Hyperliquid ecosystem, acting as both the staking asset for its proof-of-stake consensus and the gas token for its Ethereum-compatible HyperEVM layer. This dual functionality positions the token as a critical driver of scalability and efficiency in the DeFi landscape. Joining the Ranks of Legendary Airdrops Hyperliquid’s monumental airdrop secures its place in DeFi history, rivaling iconic events like Uniswap’s 2020 distribution. During that airdrop, over 250,000 wallets received 400 UNI tokens each, initially valued at $3.40 per token. Recipients who held onto their tokens saw UNI’s value soar to over $42 during the 2021 DeFi boom. Another notable airdrop was Arbitrum’s 2023 event, which distributed native tokens to more than 625,000 eligible wallets, with a market value totaling $812,500 at launch. Airdrops have become a pivotal strategy in the crypto space, rewarding early adopters and amplifying project visibility. According to CoinGecko, more than $26.6 billion worth of tokens have been distributed through such events, showcasing the immense potential of this approach in fostering blockchain adoption. Hyperliquid’s successful launch and record-breaking airdrop highlight its ambition to become a cornerstone of the DeFi sector, setting the stage for further innovations.

Here’s the Next Target,"XRP has witnessed a significant price surge, recently breaking a multi-year resistance level. This breakout, highlighted by the prominent crypto analyst CryptoBull, positions XRP for a potential move toward $2. The analyst attached a chart showing XRP surpassing its critical resistance point, sparking bullish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, XRP has reached $1.86, reflecting an 11% increase over the past 24 hours. The digital asset also recorded a multi-year high of $1.92. CryptoBull also previously noted the importance of XRP’s resistance level. #XRP broke multi year resistance. Next is $2. pic.twitter.com/SrKmOe5VsJ — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 29, 2024 The current price action indicates that the asset remains on a strong upward trajectory. If XRP attains the predicted $2 level, it will exceed its 2021 peak of $1.96 and further solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Factors Fueling XRP’s Price Increase A combination of market optimism and regulatory developments appears to be fueling XRP’s rise. One key catalyst for the recent rally is the announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, effective January 20, 2024. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by contentious regulatory actions in the form of frivolous lawsuits against major companies in the crypto industry, including a high-profile lawsuit against Ripple, XRP’s parent company. The news of his departure has reinvigorated confidence among investors and traders, contributing to XRP’s renewed momentum. Additionally, multiple applications for XRP-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are under review. The approval of these ETFs could provide institutional investors with easier access to XRP, potentially driving increased demand and price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market participants closely monitor these developments, as they may help to determine XRP’s medium- to long-term trajectory. While challenges remain, particularly near the $2 mark, the outlook for XRP appears increasingly promising. The technical indicators support a bullish scenario for XRP. The weekly chart shows strong upward momentum. When combined with these other factors, the digital asset might be unstoppable. With XRP approaching $2, it is important to note that trading veteran Peter Brandt has also weighed in on XRP’s outlook, suggesting that the asset could experience a significant price surge if it reclaims its 2021 peak. Such a move would validate the current bullish trend and pave the way for further price exploration above the $2 level, potentially targeting its all-time high of $3.84.

Kiyosaki predicts what will happen after Bitcoin hits $100,000","As Bitcoin ( BTC ) lingers below the $100,000 mark, financial educator and author Robert Kiyosaki has predicted a possible shift in the asset’s ownership once the six-figure milestone is attained. Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ believes that if this record high is achieved, it will be almost impossible for the average person to catch up, as he said in an X post on November 30. According to Kiyosaki, the real shift will occur once Bitcoin reaches $100,000. At that point, only the ultra-wealthy will have the financial power to acquire significant amounts of the maiden digital asset. He warned that the rich will get richer while the poor and middle class will fall further behind in such an environment. To this end, Kiyosaki stressed the importance of ‘Fear of Missing Out’ ( FOMO ), urging investors to act before the asset becomes more expensive. “The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Once Bitcoin breaks $100,000 only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence. FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind,” he said. While Kiyosaki is advocating for FOMO, this psychological effect can lead to poor financial decisions , such as spending beyond one’s means or making impulsive choices, potentially resulting in losses, especially if Bitcoin doesn’t perform as expected. Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin price prediction Notably, in anticipation of Bitcoin’s price growth, Kiyosaki has made a bold prediction , noting that the asset could reach a valuation of $500,000 by 2025. However, he clarified that this forecast comes from an unnamed artificial intelligence (AI) platform, not his analysis. Kiyosaki had previously forecasted that Bitcoin would hit $300,000 in 2024. Overall, the financial educator has maintained that Bitcoin is an ideal asset for wealth protection, as he predicts a possible massive economic crash. In addition to Bitcoin, the author has maintained that gold is another alternative while stressing that there should be no debate about which asset is better. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $96,280 by press time, correcting by less than 0.1% in the last 24 hours. The asset has shown weakness in the past week, down over 2%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As things stand, Bitcoin is bearish at a time when the asset’s technical setup and fundamentals, such as institutional interest, have soared—factors that were anticipated to help push the asset to a six-figure valuation. Currently, the focus is on Bitcoin holding the $95,000 support level.

Top Indicators to Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With an exceptional 30-day growth of 474.0%, Stellar has outperformed almost all the top ten cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, (34.1%), Ethereum (38.5%), Solana (38.6%), and even XRP (262.3%). The current XLM price of $0.5404 is just 36.102% lower than the 2021 peak of $0.7355. XLM enthusiasts anticipate that the XLM price could hit $1 by December. Let analyse whether the market’s technical and fundamental scenarios support this expectation. Ready? Stellar’s Impressive Price Performance On May 11, 2021, the price of Stellar stood at a yearly peak of $0.7355. On May 19, 2021, the price sharply plummeted from $0.6464 to $0.4429, marking a significant single-day drop of 31.48%. The current XLM price is the highest recorded since May 20, 2021. At the start of this month (November, 2024), the XLM market was at $0.0933. Since November 5, the market has surged by over 492.54%. During this upward momentum, the market experienced only one major correction; it was when the price sharply dropped from $0.5359 to $0.4384 between November 25 and 26, marking a 18.19% fall. However, with a sharp rebound of 25% between November 27 and 29, the market swiftly recovered from the correction. Yesterday, the market touched a peak of $0.5480.. In the last 24 hours, it has experienced a rise of 4.9%. Can Stellar Hit $1? Technical Outlook The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of Stellar stands at $0.1858. The 100-day SMA is at 0.1401, and the 200-day SMA at $0.1196. The 50-day SMA crossed above the 200-day SMA on November 16, and the 100-day SMA surpassed the 200-day SMA on November 18. Right now, both the 50-day SMA and 100-day SMA remain far above the 200-day SMA, indicating a strong bullish sentiment. The MACD indicator also reinforces the bullish outlook. However, XLM’s RSI ( Relative Strength Index )remains in the overbought zone at 77.57. This indicates that the Stellar market can experience a short-term correction before it continues its upward journey. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Cardano Price Prediction for 2024: Here’s Why ADA Price is Poised for a 40% Upswing in December , Stellar’s Fundamental Developments Grayscale Investments recently offered private placements for Stellar.

Recently, ADA has experienced a remarkable surge, climbing by 211.1% in just 30 days—making it the top performer among the leading Layer 1 coins. But despite this impressive growth, ADA’s price of $1.1117 is still a long way from its all-time high of $3.101. So, could Cardano reach as high as $10 in this bull cycle? The potential is there, but what factors are truly driving this momentum? Let’s dive in. Whale Activity Signals Growing Momentum In the last 24 hours, whale transactions in Cardano have hit at least 26.09 billion ADA. Weekly data shows a substantial increase in whale holdings, jumping from 26 billion to 41.83 billion ADA. This uptick in whale activity suggests rising liquidity, which could set the stage for further price gains. If these large holders continue accumulating, ADA could see a strong upward push. Developer Activity Keeps Cardano Competitive Cardano is widely regarded as one of the most active Layer 1 networks in terms of development. The recent Chang hard fork introduced decentralized governance, while the Hydra Doom testing campaign showcased its ability to scale with community involvement. These continuous improvements enhance Cardano’s appeal and maintain user confidence, reinforcing its position as a leading Layer 1 blockchain. Bitcoin Correlation and Why It Matters Cardano has a correlation coefficient of 0.94 with Bitcoin, meaning its price often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements. In the past month, Bitcoin has gained 34.2%, hitting a record high of $98,888.09 on November 22. Currently trading at $96,732.87, Bitcoin is just 3.37% away from the $100K milestone. As institutional investors continue to back Bitcoin, many expect it to break $100K soon. This could positively impact Cardano, potentially driving ADA closer to its $10 target. Cardano’s price outlook is shaped by several factors: increasing whale activity, ongoing developer upgrades, and its strong link to Bitcoin. If these elements remain aligned, ADA could be well-positioned to approach the $10 mark. Cardano’s path to $10 is paved with innovation, liquidity, and a strong market correlation—an exciting future awaits.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardano-price-prediction-analyzing-key-factors-that-could-drive-ada-to-10/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37044474,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98179,1732965058,Bitcoin Retail Investment Crawls Amid Bullish Crypto Market,"Bitcoin retail numbers have dropped significantly after the recent price retracement this cycle. On-chain factors show the market is still in a bull phase; however, major indices differ from previous cycles. Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s CEO, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that retail investors are not at the Fear of Missing Out stage. He said the analysis was drawn from trading counts on all centralized exchanges and other markets. Reduced sentiments from smaller players are present amid a general bullish price for several reasons. A look at the charts shows a significant drop in retail holders compared to the previous crypto bull run. Traders Set Sights on Quick Profits The rapid growth of BTC prices above $99k changed the dynamics for various levels of traders. While several whales increased buying pressure, smaller investors looked to rake in profits. The recent pullback in prices heightened sales and movements to centralized exchanges. At the time of writing, the BTC price had nosedived to $96,310, a 0.4% drop today amid low sentiments. According to CryptoQuant, short-term Bitcoin holders are transferring assets at a loss to centralized exchanges, triggering panic among traders. These transactions are mostly retail traders, as most institutions continue to set price levels. Institutional appetite surged the market to present levels after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This group of holders targets a run above $100K, although some have taken profits. Profit-taking sends prices lower, with traders repositioning their assets for the next bull swing. Profit Taking On Binance Hits New Level The largest exchange by trading volumes has seen users offload assets to avoid losses. As Bitcoin takes a step back, the wider market is affected, with altcoins posting large outflows. Ethereum, Solana, and BNB dipped 3%, 2.2% and 1% respectively. Crypto traders have also liquidated holdings over fears of exits in institutional holdings. “ Tracking the realized profits of the Binance cohort provides valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and behavior, especially considering Binance consistently handles higher volumes than any other exchange. This metric helps us understand whether investors are taking profits aggressively (Above 10M) or steadily, which can be crucial to confirm the strength of the ongoing trend,” CryptoQuant wrote.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-retail-investment-crawls-amid-bullish-crypto-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37043844,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98177,1732964185,Solana Price Dive Sparks Whale Movement To Centralized Exchanges,"Solana (SOL) has taken a nosedive as whale movements mount to centralized crypto exchanges. The wider market drop led to negative sentiments from several categories of traders. Solana remains key for an altcoin season after hitting levels above Ethereum in institutional flows. At press time, losses continue to accumulate for the community-dubbed ETH killer. SOL traded at $240, plunging 0.28% in the last 24 hours, bringing weekly losses to similar figures. Crypto assets retracing amid bullish markets come with high volatility. Solana Whale Dumps Asset Data from Lookonchain shows a Solana whale depositing 44,950 SOL worth approximately $10.5 million on Binance. The assets were withdrawn from staking to the centralized exchange, likely to prevent losses. Crypto movement to centralized exchanges usually indicates a sale due to the ease of transfers. On the other hand, transfers off exchanges to other custodians indicate long-term holdings. Another factor that affected Solana outflows in terms of whale address activity was Pump.fun’s transfer of 99,999 SOL worth about 22.7 million to Kraken. The transfer raised lots of eyebrows, and some users suggested a sale. Lookonchain previously wrote on X (formerly Twitter), calling it a sale before stating it was only a deposit. Pump.fun has gained traction since its launch as the community embraces the meme coin launch pad. Meme coins grew this quarter, with multiple tokens picking up double-digit wins before the price correction. Can Solana Change the Tide? Solana bulls are optimistic about an upward swing in prices. While bulls have locked in mo re positive targets, bears opine that recent setbacks could wipe out huge gains. However, on-chain factors tip a bullish scenario for the asset as the network fee drops. Crypto user Peter Horton explained the bullish scenario of the asset. “ Solana’s chain gdp reached a new ath in october, both in absolute terms ($300M) and in market share (45%). chain gdp takes the sum of all fees collected by projects on a network. in october, solana projects collected more fees than projects on Ethereum and its L2s combined.”",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solana-price-dive-sparks-whale-movement-to-centralized-exchanges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

While Bitcoin’s price has dipped slightly to $96,926, its dominance has dropped to 58.84%, sparking speculation about a potential shift towards altcoins. Despite Bitcoin’s minor setback, altcoins are starting to gain attention , with some showing strong growth. So, could an altcoin season be on the way? Notably, altcoin’s dominance is also at 58% breaking its 525-day accumulation phase, this phase signals a market bottom where prices hit their lower levels and stabilize. Since altcoins rising from this phase this is could be the best time to accumulate the altcoins showing signs of a breakout. Here are some of the top buys of the season. Yusko’s Bullish Take on Solana and Cautious Stance on Others Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, is optimistic about Solana’s future. After a major price surge from $13 to $240, he sees strong growth potential for Solana, thanks to its solid development team and recent achievements. November alone saw Solana’s price jump over 40%, and it surpassed Ethereum in monthly fees, generating $183.46 million compared to Ethereum’s $181.42 million. Yusko believes Solana could be a major player in the long term. However, Yusko is more cautious when it comes to other altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and Hedera. While these projects have promise, particularly as bridges between traditional finance and crypto, Yusko sees them as riskier investments. He is especially cautious about XRP due to ongoing regulatory uncertainty , but he believes things will become clearer once a new SEC chair is in place. However, Yusko also warns against meme coins like Dogecoin, acknowledging their speculative nature but stressing that they carry significant risk. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s XRP Is Worth More Than Solana: Bill Morgan Reveals Shocking Miscalculation , Altcoin’s Current Status Meanwhile, Altcoins, excluding Ethereum, currently make up 30.2% of the total crypto market, a drop from 41% during the 2021 bull cycle.

The overall crypto market cap has surged to $3.23 trillion, with Bitcoin contributing $1.85 trillion and altcoins at $785.67 billion. For altcoins to trigger a sustained rally, they need to break through the 70 mark on the Altcoin Season Index.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field.

BNB has grown impressively in the last 30 days and has surged nearly 5% from $592 to around $618 It’s currently trading above both its 20-day and 30-day EMAs. This suggests that the momentum and optimism among market analysts have increased massively. For instance, market expert Ali has shared a bold prediction for BNB that it could potentially reach $1630 if it manages to break above the $662 resistance level. Is a bullish surge on the horizon for XRP price? The XRP price has been on an impressive trajectory in recent weeks. In fact, XRP has surged by over 100% from its monthly low, and the momentum isn’t slowing down. Trump’s pro-crypto win, and the positive regulatory outlook that followed were important factors that bolstered positive sentiment. Adding to this, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation has given XRP a breather from regulatory scrutiny. The RSI has crossed 80, signaling overbought conditions. The 10-day Volume-Weighted Moving Average and the 9-day Hull Moving Average are also trending upwards, indicating strong buying pressure that supports the bullish outlook for the XRP price. Conclusion All we need is a little patience and a lot of faith in these promising utility tokens. With their potential to revolutionize various industries and deliver substantial returns, BNB, XRP, and Lunex Network are well-positioned to dominate the crypto market in the near future and beyond.

With sights on a startling $56 billion market capital value by 2025, experts estimate that this real-world asset (RWA) tokenization scheme might rocket to $10 in less than three months. Here’s why Rexas Finance merits your attention and your investment if you’re searching for the next great crypto prospect. RXS Presale: An Incredible Trip The presale of Rexas Finance has been outstanding. RXS started at $0.030 in stage 1 and has jumped 240% to reach its present price of $0.10 in stage 8. With 252 million RXS tokens sold out of a planned $20.75 million, this outstanding performance has already drawn almost $16.9 million from passionate investors as of writing. There is no slowing down of the momentum. There are just a few presale stages left, hence now is the time to act before the price rises to $0.20 upon release on three top-tier exchanges in early 2025. In the crypto realm, security and openness are top priorities; Rexas Finance satisfies all the requirements. Leading blockchain security company Certik has thoroughly checked the platform to make sure the smart contracts are dependable and the RXS tokens are safe. This audit gives investors more confidence, therefore differentiating Rexas Finance from many other initiatives on the market. Real-World Tokenization: A Revolution Blockchain technology is transforming the purchase, sale, and management of actual assets under Rexas Finance. Targeting large markets, their platform addresses: Real estate boasts a market worth $379.7 trillion. Gold and commodities market valued at $121.2 trillion .Art and Collections: $65 billion yearly volume Rexas Finance’s creative method helps anyone to easily tokenize actual assets. Users of tools like the Token Builder can generate tokens without writing one line of code. To guarantee general compatibility, the platform supports well-known token specifications including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. Why Does the Trader Foresee a $10 Burst? Several important elements help to support the audacious estimate that RXS might reach $10 by 2025: Rexas Finance has developed a devoted network of private investors unlike many initiatives supported by venture money. This grassroots support guarantees steady development and lowers the possibility of unannounced sell-offs. Strategic Listing on Top Exchanges: By early 2025, RXS will be launched on 3 out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges worldwide, hence raising its profile and availability. Great Prospect for Mass Expansion: An unrealized trillion-dollar market is real-world asset tokenization. Rexas Finance is positioned to grab a sizable portion of the market, therefore stimulating demand for the RXS token. Rexas Finance is sponsoring a $1 million giveaway to involve its expanding community more. Already more than 317,000 people have entered as of writing; 20 lucky winners will get $50,000 worth of RXS each. Along with increasing community involvement, this campaign raises project potential awareness. Individuals can boost their chances by finishing activities on the Rexas Finance website. Rexas Finance presents special benefits when compared to a well-known token like Cardano. At under $0.10, RXS presents a low-cost entrance with great upside potential. While ADA concentrates on blockchain technology, RXS handles real-world asset integration—a sector with great future expansion. The presale from Rexas Finance presents a comparable ground-floor potential and should RXS meet its expected $10 price, the market cap would be $15 billion, a reasonable aim considering the magnitude of the markets it targets. Rexas Finance is ideally positioned to spearhead this change as blockchain use in real estate, goods, and art gathers steam. In Summary, Don’t Miss Rxs Rexas Finance is a ground-breaking initiative meant to close the distance between actual assets and blockchain technology, not only a crypto token here. Strategic alliances, an established track record, and a community-driven strategy help RXS to be ready for explosive expansion. The presale is almost over, hence now is the time to invest and maybe get 100x profits since the launch price is $0.20, but RXS is priced at $0.10 as of writing. Time runs out. Come along with the movement and get your RXS tokens right now.

What started as a joke has turned into a multi-billion-dollar industry that continues to capture the imagination of investors. With so many meme coins flooding the market, it can be challenging to separate the ones with true potential from the rest. But don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in today, this list has got you covered. From the exciting presale of BTFD Coin to the iconic status of Dogecoin and the ever-growing Baby Doge Coin, these meme coins are set to make some serious waves in 2024. The market is buzzing with talk of new opportunities, and whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the meme coin space, there’s no better time than now to get involved. Let’s dive in and see why these three coins are some of the best new meme coins to invest in today—and how you can position yourself for potential massive returns. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Changing the Game If you’re on the hunt for the best new meme coins to invest in today, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. This meme coin is capturing the attention of investors with its bold premise: Buy The Dip. Its tagline reflects the philosophy of investing during market downturns, resonating strongly with meme coin enthusiasts who believe in capitalising on crypto’s volatility. BTFD Coin is currently in its presale, and the performance so far has been nothing short of spectacular. Within just a few days, the presale raised over $295,000, and billions of coins have been sold. At the presale price of $0.00005 per token, getting in early on BTFD Coin could set you up for some incredible returns as its price surges upon listing on major exchanges. Let’s take an example. If you were to invest $4,500 in the presale, you could secure yourself 90 million BTFD Coins. When BTFD Coin hits $0.0006—just a modest increase from its presale price—that investment could grow to $54,000. That’s the kind of potential we’re talking about when it comes to BTFD Coin . So why should you be paying attention to this token? First, it offers a strong community and engaging features, including staking rewards with a potential 90%+ APY and a Play-to-Earn game tied to its ecosystem.

37042869,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655698,1732962629,Bitcoin Flows To Binance Hit Historic Lows—Is Market Confidence Soaring?,"The Bitcoin market continues to sees major shift, with recent data showing significant changes in trader behaviour. A CryptoQuant analyst, Joao Wedson, has recently highlighted an important trend concerning Bitcoin (BTC) flows between exchanges. Specifically, Bitcoin transfers from other exchanges to Binance have reached historic lows. This shift, as seen in the Exchange to Exchange Flow metric, marks a potentially positive transformation in the market , reflecting “increased stability and confidence.” Bitcoin Exchange Flows Hit Historic Lows: What This Means for the Market It is worth noting that this trend of reduced flow of Bitcoin into an exchange like Binance is quite notable given Binance’s position as the largest cryptocurrency exchange by global trading volume. Wedson attributed this trend to several key factors. Firstly, the analyst mentioned that “liquidity consolidation” on Binance is a major driver. As the dominant exchange in terms of trading volume, Binance eliminates the need for traders to transfer assets from other platforms to access liquidity. Wedson noted that this simplification appeals to many market participants who now prefer to operate directly on Binance without inter-exchange movements . Secondly, the rise of stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) has reduced Bitcoin’s role as an intermediary asset for exchange transfers. In the past, BTC was commonly used as a bridge currency. However, stablecoins, offering lower volatility and transaction costs, are now the preferred choice for such transactions, further decreasing the reliance on Bitcoin. Lastly, the analyst attributed the reduced flow of Bitcoin to Binance to “growing confidence in both Binance and the broader cryptocurrency market. ” Wedson wrote: Historically, during dump scenarios, large amounts of BTC were sent to Binance, signaling panic and mass selling. Today, this reduced flow likely reflects greater investor confidence in Binance and the market overall. Why Is This Positive? The historic low in Bitcoin exchange flows to Binance has broader implications for the crypto ecosystem. As the crypto analyst highlighted, the reduced movement of BTC during price drops suggests less panic-driven activity among investors. $BTC Flow from All Exchanges to Binance Hits Historic Lows “This drop in the indicator is not a sign of weakness but rather a reflection of market stability and confidence in Binance as the leading global exchange.” – By @joao_wedson Read more https://t.co/3mHT5OhsvH pic.twitter.com/EH3jAXZpM1 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 29, 2024 This behavior may indicate a more informed and experienced investor base, which bodes well for the long-term stability of the cryptocurrency market. Wedson added another point, noting: Strengthening the Ecosystem: Binance is solidifying its position as a hub for traders, reducing the need for inter-exchange transfers.

The move comes as Bitcoin inches closer to the landmark $100,000 price point. Between November 19 and 28, the company exchanged 14,200 Ethereum for 515 Bitcoin, boosting its total Bitcoin holdings to 3,183 BTC, valued at approximately $310 million. Boyaa Interactive Moves to Bitcoin In its latest statement, Boyaa Interactive revealed that the Ethereum tokens were originally acquired for $39.45 million, at an average price of $2,777 per ETH. With Bitcoin now trading at around $97,300, the strategic swap has amplified the value of the firm’s digital asset portfolio. This transaction is part of Boyaa’s broader cryptocurrency investment strategy. Last year, the gaming giant pledged to invest up to $100 million in various digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The company’s commitment underscores a growing trend among corporations diversifying their treasuries with digital currencies. Bitcoin Draws Corporate Giants Boyaa Interactive isn’t alone in leveraging Bitcoin’s dominance. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, often referred to as Japan’s MicroStrategy, has also been accumulating Bitcoin aggressively. Since announcing its Bitcoin purchase strategy in April, Metaplanet has amassed $53 million worth of the cryptocurrency. The firm recently unveiled plans to raise an additional $62 million to further expand its Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, U.S.-based MicroStrategy, the pioneer of the Bitcoin treasury model, has set the standard for corporate cryptocurrency investment. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy announced a massive purchase of 55,500 Bitcoin worth $5.4 billion, bringing its total holdings to an industry-leading 386,700 BTC. This stash now exceeds $37 billion in value, cementing the firm’s role as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The momentum around Bitcoin adoption by corporations continues to grow. Other public companies, such as Marathon Digital Holdings, have also recently added to their Bitcoin reserves, further signaling confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. With Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 milestone, Boyaa Interactive seems poised to benefit significantly from the cryptocurrency’s meteoric rise.

37043099,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51054,1732962197,"Stern XRP Critic Reveals Major XRP Game Changer, Shares Ripple-SEC Case Prediction","Charles Gasparino, a stern XRP critic and Senior Correspondent at Fox Business has pinpointed Donald Trump’s victory as the major game changer for XRP. He suggested a significant shift could be on the horizon for Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a recent post on X, Gasparino highlighted comments made by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo during a Fox Business interview. According to Giancarlo, there’s a good chance the SEC will drop its appeal against Ripple once Donald Trump takes office in early 2025. Gasparino notes that Trump’s re-election is a game-changer for XRP. Speaking on the likelihood of the SEC dropping the lawsuit against Ripple, Gasparino stated, “My view is that’s very plausible.” The Prolonged Legal Battle The infamous lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC has been a focal point for the cryptocurrency industry since it began in December 2020. The SEC tried to regulate XRP and other digital assets as securities under existing securities laws. However, the court partially disagreed with this stance. The SEC has faced backlash from the courts, the financial world, and the crypto market. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a landmark ruling that non-institutional sales of XRP did not violate federal securities laws. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The SEC attempted to file an interlocutory appeal but was denied by the court. Subsequently, the regulator dropped its aiding and abetting charges against Ripple’s executives. In August of this year, Ripple won another major victory, when the court ordered the company to pay a penalty of $125 million instead of the $1.95 billion sum the SEC initially requested. Ripple and XRP were finally free, but this freedom did not last, as the SEC appealed the ruling almost two months later, keeping the case unresolved and prolonging uncertainty for Ripple and the wider crypto sector. Is the Ripple Lawsuit About to End? Giancarlo is well known for his pro-crypto stance. He’s widely called “Crypto Dad.” He is a front-runner for the role of Crypto Czar , a role insiders believe Trump will create in his administration. His experience in financial and regulatory spaces and expertise has given credence to his prediction that the SEC will drop the lawsuit.

37042412,https://crypto.news/?p=14315151,1732961767,4 tokens with potential to grow a $340 portfolio into $34000 in 3 months,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Small investments like $340 can yield life-changing returns in crypto with tokens like RXS, HBAR, DOT, and WIF. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Making wave in real-world assets tokenization Hedera: A promising solution for scalable blockchain solutions Polkadot : Making communication across blockchains a reality Dogwifhat: A good meme coin that appeals to its community Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities for life-changing returns, even with relatively small portfolios such as a $340 investment. Investing in the right altcoins can appear to be a game of gambles with massive payoffs. Four standout tokens poised for great growth are Rexas Finance (RXS) , Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), and Dogwifhat (WIF). These tokens, when used properly, are destined for a high-growth portfolio due to their innovation, strong fundamentals, and community backing. Rexas Finance: Making wave in real-world assets tokenization Rexas Finance is a blockchain player that concentrates on real-world asset tokenization. Trading assets that are usually illiquid—such as property and artwork—RXS tokenizes them and allows investors to access a one-trillion-dollar opportunity. Moreover, the possibilities of thriving and creating long-term value are huge for Rexas Finance, as the first mover in this niche. The tokenomics of Rexas Finance highlights great balance and strategy regarding its ecosystem. For the total token supply of 1 billion tokens, early adopters have been offered a presale amounting to 42.5% (425 million) of the total. 22.5% (225 million) is set aside for staking and other benefits. Another 15% (150 million) is used for liquidity purposes, and 10% (100 million) is for the treasury to ensure the operation of the platform. Lesser amounts are set aside for marketing, team, giveaways, and partnerships, demonstrating the project’s focus on sustainable development. RXS has a presale price of $0.10 in Stage 8 of its presale and has already generated $16.87 million, selling 251 million tokens across all presale stages. The coin is currently available on reputable listing websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which will help increase the visibility of the token. All of these features place RXS among the best competitive coins with high growth potential. What makes the platform even more appealing is its $1 million giveaway that is currently ongoing. The competition will see 20 winners take home RXS tokens worth $50,000 each, which will definitely connect users to the community more and extend its reach. Investors can easily acquire RXS tokens by visiting the official Rexas Finance website, linking wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and making transactions with ETH or USDT . This ease of use makes it ideal for both experienced and new investors. Hedera: A promising solution for scalable blockchain solutions Hedera is a network not just bound to be a decentralized ledger technology. With the right partnerships, including those offering healthcare or financial services, it has growing potential. With an attractive price of $0.1416 and a $5.4 billion market cap, HBAR is the 30th largest crypto coin. Its offerings in terms of speed and security to developers remain strong. The novel hash graph consensus algorithm ranks well for enterprise or government networks. Their major offerings can be integrated into the network securely, and decentralization cannot be ignored in HBAR’s future expansion plans. HBAR remains underestimated, even while other companies are embracing less mainstream technology, such as fully decentralized systems. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Polkadot : Making communication across blockchains a reality Polkadot still has improvement plans, making it suitable for long-term gains. Priced around $8.36, with a market cap of $12.7 billion at the time of writing, it is expected to grow as news spreads. With the industry focusing more on Web3 and identity implementation in the Polkadot network, its expansion rate is accelerating. DOT’s purpose of securely transacting data and assets across different virtual ecosystems remains relevant and crucial for development. Parachains are gradually joining the Polkadot ecosystem, increasing its worth. Polkadot has the newest and most rapid vertical expansion rate in its space, and its value remains appealing as its ecosystem grows. Polkadot connects all aspects of the blockchain world, with a vast and adaptable architecture. Dogwifhat: A good meme coin that appeals to its community The Dogwifhat ecosystem is a unique meme coin with a passionate community and distinctive offerings. People buy WIF at $3.05, with a market capitalization of $3.0 billion. However, that’s not all—WIF also offers utilities within its ecosystem, including NFT integrations and DeFi solutions. Its strong entry price and active community make Dogwifhat an interesting prospect in any portfolio. With meme coins gaining traction during bullish cycles, WIF’s growth seems plausible. Conclusion Short-term investors seeking high returns within a short time should consider these four tokens. Rexas Finance stands out for its focus on real-world asset tokenization and robust tokenomics. Hedera and Polkadot offer scalable blockchain technology and interchain interaction. Dogwifhat adds the appeal of meme coins and community-driven growth. These tokens create opportunities for stability and exponential growth.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Credible Crypto tells his 441,400 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is rapidly approaching a trouble area when paired against Bitcoin ( BTC ). Based on the analyst’s chart, it appears that he is suggesting that the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair (ETH/BTC) could fall by roughly up to 20% from its current level. Source: Credible Crypto/X Ethereum is trading at 0.0369300 BTC ($3,568) at time of writing. On the Ethereum/US dollar pair, the widely followed analyst says that if ETH is unable to go above the resistance level around the $4,000 price, the second-largest digital asset by market cap could pull back by roughly up to 24% from its current level and revisit prices last recorded in early November. “A rejection here and lower high would give us a push into weekly demand, which, paired with an approximately 10% correction on BTC would give us our major $2,700-$2,800 buy zone.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Turning to Bitcoin, the analyst says that the crypto king is primed for a significant price correction before it can go higher. “Obviously I still think we are ultimately headed to $100,000+ but the timeline is going to change now and the move below $94,000 has opened the doors to the potential for a larger move downside first (as stated many times).” Bitcoin is trading at $96,809 at time of writing, up by around 7% from the one-week low of around $90,700.

Some altcoins are pulling ahead, chipping away from Bitcoin’s dominance, which is currently consolidating around the $97,000 mark. The total market capitalization is around $3.56 trillion. Bitcoin’s Price Rests Around $97,000 Bitcoin’s price has experienced considerable volatility throughout the past week, dropping to a low of almost $90,000 at one point before bouncing back and forming a V-shaped recovery. Yesterday, the bulls attempted to push it toward $99,000 but were unable to do it. The price is currently at about $96,700, which has been consolidating for the past hours. It’s interesting to see whether or not the buyers will be able to take another shot at the coveted $100,000 level or if we will see another correction. Source: TradingView As mentioned above, however, Bitcoin’s dominance—the metric used to gauge its share relative to the rest of the market—has been dwindling.

With countless projects vying for attention, only a select few truly stand out. Among them, some are reshaping asset management, while others are driving decentralised finance (DeFi) to new heights. And then there’s a trailblazer working to unify the fragmented blockchain landscape like never before. Recently, Hedera announced its groundbreaking Asset Tokenization Studio, setting the stage for a new era in digital asset management. Meanwhile, Aave continues to capture headlines with explosive growth in its loan volumes and total value locked (TVL). But what about Qubetics ($TICS)? Its presale isn’t just creating buzz—it’s rewriting the rulebook for what’s possible in crypto investing. This article explores Qubetics’ unique features, the excitement of its presale, and the latest updates on Hedera and Aave. If you want the best crypto to join today, read on! Qubetics ($TICS): Bridging Blockchains, Building the Future In today’s blockchain ecosystem, isolation is the enemy. Most networks operate in silos, unable to communicate or share data effectively. This lack of interoperability stifles innovation, limits adoption, and makes scaling decentralised applications harder. Qubetics is here to change that. Positioned as a Web3-aggregated chain, Qubetics is designed to unify multiple networks into one seamless framework. It allows for smooth asset transfers, effortless data sharing, and robust cross-chain functionality. By enhancing interoperability, Qubetics is opening doors for developers, enterprises, and users to realise the potential of decentralised technology fully. Imagine a world where blockchains aren’t rivals but allies—Qubetics is making that vision a reality. If you’re looking for the best crypto to join today, Qubetics is the frontrunner. Hedera Hashgraph: Pioneering Tokenisation with ATS Hedera is revolutionising asset management and trading with its new Asset Tokenization Studio (ATS). Launched in Q3 2024, ATS simplifies asset management with features like compliance integration, on-chain metadata, and Ethereum interoperability. Hedera’s focus on security and scalability is evident across industries, from carbon credit tokenisation with DOVU to fractional real estate ownership with RedSwan. Tokenisation—the process of converting physical or financial assets into digital tokens—is at the heart of this innovation. Hedera democratises access to traditionally exclusive investments by enabling fractional ownership and greater liquidity. With ATS, Hedera solidifies its position as a leader in the tokenisation revolution. Aave: Riding the Wave of DeFi Growth Aave has been on a tear this year, breaking through the $161.21 resistance level and positioning itself for even more growth. With loan volumes tripling to $10 billion and its TVL surging by 26.7% to $15.96 billion, Aave has cemented its status as a DeFi powerhouse. Its annualised revenue of $113.84 million—a jaw-dropping 1,628% increase—highlights the platform’s growing dominance. Despite these successes, Aave faces new challenges as the market evolves. Can it maintain its upward trajectory, or will external factors slow its rise? Either way, Aave’s recent performance underscores its resilience and the opportunities it offers to DeFi enthusiasts. Qubetics Presale: Don’t Miss This Opportunity The Qubetics presale is making waves in the crypto community—and for good reason. Currently, in Phase 10, the presale offers weekly price hikes of 10%, with the final stage seeing a 20% jump. Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, with over $3.6M raised, 4,800+ holders, and 239 million tokens sold. The next phase is just around the corner, and the post-presale target price of $0.25 makes this an opportunity you don’t want to miss. Consider this: a $100 investment today gets you around 4,000 $TICS tokens. If analysts’ predictions hold true and $TICS hits $10, that $100 becomes $40,000. And if it climbs to $15? You’re looking at $60,000—an ROI of 59,900%! The potential here is mind-blowing. Whether you’re an experienced investor or new to crypto, Qubetics is the best crypto to join today . But time is running out—act fast before the next phase kicks in. Conclusion: What is the best crypto to join today? Hedera, Aave, and Qubetics each bring something unique to the table. From tokenisation breakthroughs to DeFi innovation, these projects are shaping the future of blockchain. But if you’re searching for the best crypto to join today, the numbers don’t lie— Qubetics is in a league of its own. With its weekly price hikes and massive ROI potential, the ongoing presale makes this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Whether you’re aiming for short-term gains or long-term growth, Qubetics offers a pathway to incredible rewards. Don’t wait—join the Qubetics presale and secure your place in the next chapter of blockchain history.

The latest regulatory framework, established on June 25, 2024, by Resolution 082/2024, has resulted in a 112% growth in virtual asset trading. This expansion coincides with an increase in electronic payment instruments, which has attracted approximately 252,000 people who use various platforms. According to data from the BCB, transactions on the Binance platform increased considerably, from $13.7 million in July to $23.7 million by October 2024. The BCB highlighted a significant increase in overall transaction volumes, which jumped from around Bs 575,000 to Bs 20.7 million in the same span. This chart demonstrates the growing acceptability of cryptocurrency in the Bolivian market. Furthermore, the BCB highlighted a growing interest in virtual assets as an investment option, which has resulted in a rise in the number of Financial Intermediary Entities (EIFs) involved in virtual asset activities, from five to nine in just four months. Individual investors accounted for the majority of transactions (88%), with women leading the way, completing 1,029 deals, or 62% of total activity. Ripio Partners with Win investments to tokenize football players Sebastián Serrano, co-founder and CEO of Ripio and Ripio Ventures, has announced a strategic relationship with Win Investments, a company that specializes in the tokenization of football players, effective 2023. This agreement intends to improve Ripio’s cryptocurrency offerings across Latin America. Ripio Ventures, the latest investment in Win Investments, plans to use its knowledge and infrastructure to support the tokenization of sports assets. Win Investments has announced a $3 million Bridge Pre-Series A financing round, to expand its footprint to more nations by 2025. Valentín Jaremtchuk, co-founder and CEO of Win Investments, is optimistic about the relationship, recognizing Sebastián Serrano’s impact in the Latin American crypto business and the potential for their platform to develop with Ripio’s enormous user base of over 11 million. Both companies anticipate tremendous progress by 2025, with Win Investments having already established operations in seven Latin American nations within two years of its founding. They presently have 103 tokenized football players from 12 clubs, including Alexis MacAllister and Emiliano “El Dibu” Martínez. Serrano noted how tokenization is transforming digital economy participation, supporting their commitment to building a strong blockchain ecosystem that connects communities and global markets. Ecuador: Businesses closed for scanning Irises in exchange for cryptocurrencies In a recent coordinated effort involving the National Police and the Metropolitan Agency for Control (AMC), authorities in Quito, Ecuador, shut down two businesses that were enticing customers by offering cryptocurrency rewards for their biometric data. These establishments provided between 50 and 60 different cryptocurrencies in exchange for users’ iris scans, according to information from the AMC’s official website. Located in the La Mariscal and San Bartolo neighbourhoods, the businesses also organized paid conferences focused on digital identity, technology, and cryptocurrency. The recruitment for iris scans largely took place through social media, attracting many with scant information about the procedure. Once participants arrived, their irises were scanned using specialized devices to create unique digital identifications, with assurances that the data wouldn’t be stored and would remain under the users’ control. However, this operation raised significant concerns about the legitimacy and safety of such practices, especially given the potential risks associated with large gatherings. Inspections also uncovered that the businesses did not have the necessary operational licenses or permits from the Fire Department, endangering public safety even further. The combination of these unregulated activities and insufficient safety protocols prompted authorities to take decisive action to close the establishments, aiming to better protect consumers and uphold legal standards in the growing digital and cryptocurrency industry.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Avalanche targets Cardano, but rising star IntelMarkets shines with QuantumX wallet and AI platform launch. Avalanche (AVAX) is gearing up to overtake one of the biggest winners of the last bull cycle-Cardano (ADA). But while these crypto giants strive for comebacks, a new star of the crypto space is putting all its foot on the table, IntelMarkets (INTL). By announcing the QuantumX wallet launch and an AI-driven platform, IntelMarkets promises more upside potential than standard altcoins. IntelMarkets: Leading the next wave of crypto innovation Quickly getting all the attention is IntelMarkets . Shaping up to be a leader in transforming the $36 billion crypto trading sector with a unique AI- DeFi narrative. QuantumX wallet is a first of its kind “future-proof” wallet. With the increase in cybersecurity attacks combined with the threat of quantum computing, IntelMarkets provides the first retail solution to address this problem. IntelMarkets has already shown its credibility in the presale phase, garnering well over $2.5 million. Currently, at the sixth presale stage, early investors saw a 500% increase from the initial price of $0.009, with INTL tokens now priced at $0.054. With low entry and high growth potential, IntelMarkets is an excellent investment for those who get in early.

Providing a platform based on solid fundamentals, AVAX went on to gain a reputation for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and robust DeFi ecosystem. Facing stiff competition in the Layer 1 space has caused Avalanche to go above and beyond to remain competitive. AVAX is not only competitive, but is preparing for a historic rally. Avalanche currently sits at $43.56, far below its all time high of $146.22, which was reached back in November 2021. In the last month, AVAX has risen by a whopping 67%, and is still on the rise. But, Avalanche’s outlook remains optimistic, with predictions claiming AVAX could surge to $70 by the end of the year. Cardano: Claiming $1 price tag with a 200% increase on the monthly charts One of the larger blockchain platforms, Car dano, was one of the biggest winners this cycle. Seeing large attention, Cardano placed their main focus on scalability and sustainability. A top 10 cryptocurrency, ADA has made strides, but hasn’t made the pivot back to its all time high of $3.10 back in September 2021. Currently, Cardano is traded at above $1, experiencing a triple from its price of $0.30. ADA has stepped up to a 25% increase over the past seven days, slowing down slightly. Cardano could rally to $1.50 by the end of 2024, but more external factors would have to go ADA’s way to reach its previous highs. Conclusion While Avalanche prepares to rally over Cardano, the $2.5 million presale is leading the way. With the QuantumX wallet and AI-powered features, IntelMarkets has significant upside potential. At just $0.054, INTL tokens have yielded early investors with 500% gains already.

37041245,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620364,1732959548,Inside the Bitcoin megaforce that is MicroStrategy,"Once a fading software company struggling to stay relevant, MicroStrategy (MSTR) has outstandingly become the ultimate Bitcoin buying powerhouse, hoarding nearly 2% of the world’s entire BTC supply. What’s driving this wild transformation? Ambition, audacity, and billions in borrowed cash. In the past month alone, MicroStrategy announced plans to raise a staggering $42 billion through equity and debt. It also spent $10.2 billion snapping up Bitcoin. But the real spectacle was its fifth convertible bond offering of the year. The terms? ZERO interest and a conversion price set at a ridiculous 55% premium to its current stock price. Investors are essentially giving MicroStrategy free money, banking on Bitcoin’s price (and its stock) continuing to skyrocket. It’s no wonder the company’s stock has jumped over 450% this year, pushing its market cap to $90 billion. That’s a jaw-dropping number for a company whose original software business is bleeding cash and shrinking every quarter. The Bitcoin spiral: A high-stakes loop MicroStrategy’s entire business model now revolves around Bitcoin. Here’s how it works: they raise money through stock sales and convertible bonds. Then, they take that cash and buy Bitcoin —lots of it. These purchases boost Bitcoin’s value, which in turn raises MSTR’s price. The company can then raise even more funds at higher valuations. It’s a cycle so audacious that critics don’t know whether to call it genius or madness. Right now, MicroStrategy owns 386,700 bitcoins, worth $37 billion. But the company’s $90 billion market cap far exceeds the value of its Bitcoin reserves. Unlike companies like Tesla or Block, which dabble in Bitcoin by using surplus cash, MicroStrategy is all in. CEO Phong Le unveiled a plan called “21/21” last month, aiming to raise $42 billion over three years. Half of that will come from stock sales, and the other half from debt. The plan’s name is a cheeky nod to Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit and a reference to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy , where “42” is famously the answer to life’s ultimate question. If nothing else, the company’s confidence is almost as colossal as its balance sheet. Free money and big bets The $3 billion convertible bond issued this month was an unprecedented move, even by MicroStrategy’s standards. Investors lent the money with zero interest and a conversion price of $672 per share—a 55% premium over the current stock price of $406. The gamble here is obvious: if Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, MicroStrategy’s stock will follow, making the bonds profitable. If not, those investors are left holding the bag. But not everyone holding these bonds is just sitting around, waiting for Bitcoin to climb. Many are deploying sophisticated trading strategies. Techniques like gamma trading, delta hedging, and volatility arbitrage allow investors to profit from fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price or MicroStrategy’s stock. These tactics depend on volatility—a condition Bitcoin has delivered in spades, although its swings have calmed somewhat in recent years. The bond offering is essentially a massive bet on Bitcoin’s future. If the cryptocurrency’s price crashes or remains stagnant, the house of cards could collapse. Critics argue that the entire operation feels like a Ponzi scheme , where early investors profit while new ones push up the stock price. Regulators have kept a close eye on Bitcoin, and for now, it is safe from being labeled a security. The SEC has declared it an exception, much to the relief of Bitcoin enthusiasts and companies like MicroStrategy. But that’s not the only legal challenge. U.S. regulations discourage company executives from making speculative predictions about stock prices. Michael Saylor , MicroStrategy’s co-founder and Bitcoin evangelist, hasn’t been shy about sharing his opinions. He’s predicted Bitcoin will hit $13 million by 2045, making the company’s current Bitcoin holdings worth $4.3 trillion. Statements like these could invite scrutiny, especially if the company’s strategy begins to unravel. The Bitcoin monopoly MicroStrategy’s dominance over Bitcoin’s supply is raising eyebrows. BTC was designed to be decentralized, but MicroStrategy’s aggressive buying spree has caused concerns about corporate concentration. Despite these worries, MicroStrategy’s approach has inspired other companies to follow suit. Bitcoin miners like Marathon are now borrowing MicroStrategy’s playbook, issuing zero-interest bonds to fund their operations. Marathon’s recent bond sale carried a 42.6% premium, proving that MicroStrategy’s bold moves are reshaping how businesses interact with Bitcoin. But not everyone is impressed by MicroStrategy’s high-stakes strategy. Skeptics argue that it’s reckless, unsustainable, and heavily reliant on Bitcoin’s price continuing to rise. They point to Bitcoin ETFs as safer alternatives for investors who want exposure to cryptocurrency without the risks of MicroStrategy’s leveraged model. But supporters see it differently. They highlight the company’s ability to raise money at virtually no cost, thanks to its 0% bonds. They also argue that MicroStrategy offers more than just Bitcoin exposure. According to Saylor, the company provides flexibility for investors. Its stock can be leveraged, borrowed against, or even traded like an option. For now, Wall Street remains divided.

In an analysis today, market commentator Rekt Capital has suggested that meme coins could be up for a bullish upswing. His commentary, which featured the sector’s alpha Dogecoin, speculated “another round of money flow” for meme-inspired tokens.However, Rekt Capital insisted that Dogecoin (DOGE) would have to validate the bullish pattern. The analyst stated that a daily close above the pattern top at $0.43 would confirm what he believes is a breakout from the prevalent ascending triangle structure.Dogecoin to Target New All-Time HighMeanwhile, analyst Javon Marks confirmed the presiding bullish momentum on the Dogecoin ecosystem.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-santa-trump-santrump-will-skyrocket-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-dogecoin-shib-and-pepe-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The HBAR token was trading at $0.1670 on Saturday, a few points below the year-to-date high of $0.1866. It has jumped by over 300% from its lowest point this year. Analysts are bullish on Hedera Hashgraph price Crypto analysts are extremely bullish on the HBAR price. In a recent statement, Trader Rocko, a popular analyst in the industry, noted that the coin would soon jump to $0.20, up by about 20% from the current level. He believes that the coin would jump to $1 in the long term. GripeCoin, another popular analyst predicted that the Hedera Hashgraph price would jump to $15, implying a 8,830% surge from the current level. If that happens, it would push Hedera’s market cap from the current $6.4 billion to over $570 billion. Meanwhile, More Crypto Online, noted that the HBAR price would continue rising, potentially to $0.23. As shown below, he pointed to Elliot Wave, which is one of the most popular harmonic patterns in the industry. More Crypto Online @Morecryptoonl · Follow $HBAR : This looks like an attempted upside breakout from an Elliott Wave triangle. The move to the upside is very extended and could form a price top at any point, but one more high is likely developing. The next upside levels to watch are $0.176, $0.20 and $0.23. #HBAR 10:44 PM · Nov 29, 2024 221 Reply Copy link Read 8 replies HBAR’s ecosystem is doing well Hedera Hashgraph’s network is doing relatively well as investors move to its network. Data by DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked (TVL) soared to over $121.7 million, its highest level since April this year. This is a strong recovery since the network had about $44 million in assets. SaucerSwap, the biggest player in the network, had over $92.9 million in assets, a 132% increase from the same point last month. Stader, a top player in the liquid staking industry, has over $76.9 million in assets, while Bonzo Finance, HbarSuite, and HeliSwap have over $3 million in assets. The volume of cryptocurrencies traded in Hedera’s DEX protocols has been in a strong uptrend in the past few weeks. Data shows that the total trade volume rose to over $1.8 billion as the number of trades has risen to over 6.1 million. Just last week, it had a record weekly volume of over $132 million.

Analysts hope that the ETF will be approved in 2025 when Donald Trump becomes president. Hedera Hashgraph price analysis The daily chart shows that the HBAR token price has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months, as we predicted . It has formed a golden cross chart pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) have crossed each other. A golden cross is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved to the overbought level and the MACD indicator has continued rising. Most importantly, the HBAR price has formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish sign in the market. Therefore, if we measure the depth of this pattern, which stands at 75%, we can estimate that it will surge to $0.28. The bullish view will become invalid if the Hedera Hashgraph price falls below the important support at $0.14, its highest point on March 13.

This surge comes after Ripple’s favorable ruling in its case against the SEC. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan highlighted Ripple’s strong financial position, noting that the company could easily cover its legal penalties. He also flagged a potential market cap miscalculation, suggesting XRP might have already surpassed Solana, even if some tracking platforms haven’t updated their rankings yet. Ripple Is In a Good Position Ripple frequently releases XRP from its escrow account to maintain liquidity and control supply. Morgan pointed out that Ripple recently released 200 million XRP tokens, which, if sold, could cover the penalty imposed by Judge Torres three times over at current prices. If Ripple sold 200 million of the XRP released from escrow just this month at this moment it could pay the penalty ordered by Judge Torres three times over. — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 30, 2024 Morgan emphasized that XRP sales generate significant revenue for Ripple. His remarks were backed by the XRP community, which views Ripple as well-positioned to deal with its legal battle with the SEC. Is XRP Undervalued? Morgan also identified an interesting discrepancy in XRP’s market cap calculations . He explained that with fewer than 38 billion XRP tokens still in escrow, XRP’s actual market cap should have been nearly $118 billion when its price hit $1.90. This is significantly higher than the $107 billion reported by platforms like CoinMarketCap. There is less than 38 billion XRP left in escrow which means than when XRP reached $1.90 it’s market cap was almost $118 billion not $107 billion which is not being shown on @CoinMarketCap . If so it has already flipped Solana. pic.twitter.com/oKHLdDwuNY — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 30, 2024 If Morgan’s calculations are correct, XRP has already surpassed Solana’s market cap of $116.45 billion.

37040157,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105878,1732957697,NFT Wash Trading and Scams: How to Protect Yourself in the Digital Art World,"The rise of NFTs has opened exciting opportunities for artists and collectors; at the same time, it has attracted fraud. NFT scams, including wash trading and other manipulative practices, threaten the integrity of digital art marketplaces. Understanding these risks and learning how to protect oneself is crucial if you are into this space. Here goes a deep dive into common threats and some practical ways of safeguarding your investments. What is NFT Wash Trading? NFT wash trading is a form of market manipulation where individuals repeatedly buy and sell the same NFT to give the appearance of value appreciation. The idea behind it is to create an illusion of high demand for the purpose of driving up prices artificially. This tactic misleads potential buyers into thinking the asset is more valuable or desirable than it really is. Key characteristics of NFT wash trading include: Repeated transactions: The same NFT changes hands frequently between the same parties. Inflated values: Transactions occur at prices far above the market average. Fake demand: Activity makes the NFT seem like a popular item, tricking buyers. This practice damages NFT market integrity by distorting genuine price signals and eroding trust in marketplaces. Understanding Other Common NFT Scams Setting aside the wash trading, the field of NFTs is teeming with scams targeting hapless users. Some common perils include the following: Rug pulls: Where a creator sells NFTs or tokens and then pulls out, never to materialize any of the roadmap promised; Phishing attacks: Fraudsters sending fake links or emails, hoping that someone would lose their wallet credentials; or just outright faking artworks and selling them as being the creations of themselves as some well-known creators. Pump-and-dump schemes: Bad actors inflate the price of an NFT and then sell their holdings, leaving buyers holding valueless assets. These scams make scam awareness in NFTs and thorough research a must when buying. How to Spot NFT Wash Trading and Scams For protection, knowing how to identify suspicious activity is paramount. Watch for the following warning signs: Red Flags Why It Matters Unusually high transaction volume May indicate wash trading. Check if the same wallet addresses are involved repeatedly. Extremely high prices for similar items Overpriced NFTs may signal fake demand or market manipulation. Lack of creator verification Unverified creators can more easily sell fake NFTs or disappear after rug pulls. Sudden spikes in activity Rapid price increases can be signs of pump-and-dump schemes. Requests for private wallet keys No legitimate platform or artist will ever ask for your private keys. By staying alert to these signs, you can better navigate the NFT marketplace securely. Steps to Protect Yourself from NFT Scams You don’t need to avoid NFTs altogether, but taking precautions can save you from becoming a victim. Here are practical ways to protect yourself: Verify creators: Only purchase NFTs from verified accounts or well-known platforms. Research transactions: Use blockchain explorers to analyze transaction history and look for repeated trades. Use secure wallets : That are able to protect your assets with their strong security features. Be careful with links: Never click on any unsolicited links since this may be phishing attempts. Understand market trends: Know what is a normal price for NFTs of the same categor Wash Trading Prevention and Market Integrity Ensuring NFT marketplace security is not only an individual responsibility but also a collective effort. Platforms and regulators are working to counteract fraudulent practices and improve trust. Some strategies include: Implementing stricter verification processes: NFT marketplaces can require ID verification for sellers and buyers. Using AI tools: Advanced algorithms can detect unusual transaction patterns indicative of wash trading. Educating users: Awareness campaigns help users recognize scams and protect their wallets. Monitoring and penalizing offenders: Platforms should blacklist wallets or impose penalties on users caught engaging in wash trading. Why Wash Trading and Scams Persist Despite these efforts, NFT fraud continues to be an issue. This is largely due to: Anonymity of blockchain: Users are allowed to create multiple wallets, making it difficult to track fraudulent activities. Lack of regulation: The NFT space is still largely unregulated, which provides opportunities for scammers. High profits for fraudsters: The potential gain is often much more than the risk of being caught. Understanding these challenges highlights why personal vigilance is critical. Best Practices for Safe NFT Trading Follow these best practices to minimize your risk: Tip Description Research creators and projects Check social media, reviews, and community discussions to verify legitimacy. Use reputable marketplaces Stick to established platforms with a history of reliable service and good security measures. Diversify your investments Avoid putting all your funds into one NFT or collection to reduce potential losses. Avoid impulsive purchases Scammers often create urgency to rush decisions. Take your time to assess any deal. Stay informed about trends and risks Regularly read about new scams and emerging security features in the NFT world. These practices can help you navigate the NFT space confidently. The Role of Community in Fighting NFT Scams The NFT community also plays a vital role in combating fraud. Sharing information about scams, reporting suspicious activity, and educating newcomers are all ways to contribute. Platforms can also benefit from user feedback to improve security measures and transparency. NFT wash trading and scams are serious risks for anyone involved in digital art or blockchain assets. Nevertheless, with proper knowledge and precautions, one can shield oneself and benefit from the marvels of this innovation.

Among these promising contenders is XYZVerse (XYZ) , a meme coin that unites sports fans across football, basketball, MMA, and esports into one dynamic ecosystem. Combining meme culture with sports enthusiasm, XYZ aims to outperform previous tokens’ impressive gains. XYZVerse: The meme coin combining sports and profits As meme coins dominate the crypto scene, XYZVerse emerges as a must-have token for investors seeking the next big breakout. XYZ isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a gateway to a sports-fueled crypto ecosystem designed to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports while delivering explosive growth potential. Imagine the intensity of Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the U.S. presidential election, amplified by the viral hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports.

Predictions for 2024 position XYZVerse as a top contender in the meme coin arena, with a staggering 14,900% growth target by the Token Generation Event (TGE). Forget the modest gains of previous tokens like BOME’s 5,000% rise or WIF’s 1,000% rally.

Don’t wait for the crowd to storm the field—position yourself now for a front-row seat to the next crypto success story. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) , inspired by Dogecoin, emerged in August 2020 with a new twist on meme coins. Created by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum’s vast ecosystem. Starting with a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. His donation of SHIB to the India Covid Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the supply boosted SHIB’s profile in the crypto world. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB leverages Ethereum’s capabilities, enabling decentralized apps like ShibaSwap, its own exchange. Plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance showcase SHIB’s potential beyond being a meme coin. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), SHIB’s Ethereum integration positions it well within these trends. In the current market, SHIB’s active development and strong community support may attract those interested in emerging Ethereum projects. However, as with any cryptocurrency, buyers should exercise caution and do thorough research. Pepe PEPE is a memecoin launched on Ethereum to honor Pepe the Frog, the internet meme created by Matt Furie. It aims to join the likes of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as a top meme-based cryptocurrency. With no taxes and a candid approach about its lack of utility, PEPE keeps things simple, appealing to meme enthusiasts. In late April to May 2023, its market cap soared to $1.6 billion, turning early investors into millionaires and building a strong community. This surge sparked a “memecoin season,” with other memecoins experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes getting listed on CoinMarketCap, trending on Twitter, and securing spots on centralized exchanges, aiming for a “meme takeover.” As the crypto market anticipates the Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE showcases the potential of memecoins. Its rapid rise and dedicated community set it apart from other memecoins. For those fascinated by the meme coin trend, PEPE offers an interesting opportunity in the current market cycle. Bonk BONK, a new player in the crypto world, is turning heads. This Solana-based memecoin, with its Shiba Inu mascot, aims to shake up the scene by shifting power from big investors to the community. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK’s value soared over 100%. What’s more, it handed out half of its total supply to participants in Solana’s NFTs and DeFi projects. By mid-December 2023, it had become the third-largest memecoin by market cap and saw an astonishing year-to-date growth of over 10,000%. Despite the challenges of a huge supply and the wild nature of memecoins, BONK shows promise. It’s becoming a key part of Solana’s ecosystem, even launching its own decentralized exchange called BonkSwap. This integration with a booming network of decentralized apps sets it apart. In the current market cycle, where community-driven projects are gaining traction, BONK stands out as an attractive option. Compared to other memecoins, its strong community focus and real use cases could make it a noteworthy contender in the crypto space. SPX6900 In a digital world where numbers hold immense power, SPX6900 has emerged from the depths of internet culture as the newest meme token capturing everyone’s attention. Born with the audacious goal to surpass the S&P 500, SPX6900 sets its sights on a staggering $69 trillion market cap. The logic is simple yet bold: if 6900 is greater than 500, then SPX6900 must be superior to traditional financial instruments. In a market buzzing with innovation, SPX6900’s playful approach resonates with a generation that values creativity and disruption. Powered by the belief that bigger numbers mean better investments, it taps into the same spirit that propelled other meme coins like Dogecoin to fame. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream attention, SPX6900 stands out with its ambitious vision and community-driven momentum. Whether it will achieve its sky-high goals remains an open question, but it undoubtedly adds a new flavor to the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion Though SHIB, PEPE, BONK, and SPX are promising, XYZVerse merges meme culture with sports, aiming for 20,000% growth, making it a standout in the bull run.

Despite bearish market sentiment following Binance’s announcement to delist the token, GFT experienced a dramatic 181% rally before plummeting back to its prior levels. The token’s wild price movements have raised questions about the role of market makers in this volatility. A controversial rally amid Binance’s delisting On November 26, Binance announced its decision to delist Gifto’s GFT/USDT trading pair among other pairs, effective December 10, as part of a broader effort to remove underperforming assets. This announcement triggered immediate bearish sentiment, with GFT’s price dropping by 25% due to fears of reduced liquidity and accessibility. However, the market took a surprising turn on November 30. GFT surged 181%, climbing from a low of $0.006864 to a high of $0.02289. This sudden rally was short-lived and by the end of the day, GFT had retraced to $0.01046—still 50.2% higher than the previous day. Source: CoinGecko Market watchers were quick to point out the suspicious timing of this price surge, especially after GFT’s earlier crash. Critics suspect that market makers could be influencing the token’s price in a coordinated effort to profit from the volatility, taking advantage of traders’ reactions to the Binance delisting. Earlier Gifto (GFT) minting and dumping add to the suspicion Adding fuel to the fire, Gifto’s actions in the days leading up to this volatility have drawn significant backlash. On November 28, the Gifto team minted 1.2 billion GFT tokens, valued at $8.6 million, and reportedly dumped them onto the market. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that these tokens were deposited into exchanges, further eroding investor confidence. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow On Nov 26, #Binance announced it would delist $GFT on Dec 10, 2024.The #Gifto team minted 1.2B $GFT ($8.6M) in the past 8 hours and deposited it into exchanges. #Gifto may have dumped these tokens onto the market, and the price of $GFT has dropped by ~40%.… 7:06 AM · Nov 28, 2024 193 Reply Copy link Read 37 replies This move triggered a steep 40% price drop, compounding the bearish impact of the Binance delisting announcement. The crypto reacted strongly, with many labeling Gifto’s actions as a textbook example of the risks associated with centralized token management. Critics argued that such practices undermine trust, leaving retail investors at a disadvantage. Some have called this episode a cautionary tale, emphasizing the need for decentralized projects that cannot execute similar “exit strategies.” As things unfold, GFT’s price remains extremely volatile and with December 10 looming as a crucial date, GFT holders face uncertainty about the token’s future, underscoring the importance of transparency and decentralized governance in the evolving digital asset landscape.

37051838,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103439,1732957443,BitBoy Says Ethereum Can Run But Cannot Hide from XRP,"Popular media personality Ben Armstrong (BitBoy) has commented on the recent achievement of XRP, in which the asset has moved an inch closer to Ethereum. In a tweet on Friday, Armstrong reiterated his long-held belief that XRP will overtake Ethereum in market cap during this bull run. This latest disclosure comes as XRP now ranks as the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap, surpassing Binance Coin (BNB).The flip occurred yesterday when XRP reached the $1.70 price point, elevating its market cap to $97 billion and allowing it to surpass BNB. Meanwhile, the gap between XRP and BNB has continued to widen as XRP's price has advanced even further.XRP has now reached a new three-year high of $1.94. At this price, XRP boasts a market cap of over $110 billion, bringing it closer to Solana (SOL).Solana currently has a market cap of $117 billion, leading XRP by $7 billion. However, XRP could surpass Solana in market valuation if its price reaches $2.10, especially if SOL's price fails to move proportionally. This would put XRP just behind Ethereum (ETH), the altcoin leader.Ethereum Cannot Hide from XRPAmid the impressive movements, market commentators like Armstrong reiterate that XRP will overtake Ethereum this season. “ETH, you can run, but you can't hide [from XRP],” BitBoy remarked.Notably, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,704, giving it a market cap of $445.16 billion. With XRP's market cap at $110 billion, its price would need to increase fourfold to approach Ethereum's valuation.While this goal seems ambitious, XRP has demonstrated spectacular price increases of similar magnitude recently. Just on November 4, XRP was trading at $0.4968, but it has since surged by 291% to $1.94. During the same period, Ethereum's value has grown by only 40%.If XRP continues its remarkable price surge and Ethereum's growth remains modest, it could set the stage for the flip. XRP Price When It Attains Ethereum Market CapNotably, if XRP approaches Ethereum’s current valuation, it would correspond to a price of around $8, an estimate many analysts believe XRP could reach during this bull season.However, critics are skeptical about the possibility of XRP overtaking Ethereum in market cap. They argue that it is an overly ambitious goal for XRP this season, with some predicting that XRP’s bull run could lose steam between the $3 to $5 price range. Nevertheless, those who believe XRP could reach double-digit prices remain confident that the flip will happen.",POSITIVE,ETH | XRP | BNB,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/30/bitboy-says-ethereum-can-run-but-cannot-hide-from-xrp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitboy-says-ethereum-can-run-but-cannot-hide-from-xrp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37039905,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387440,1732957253,Spot Ethereum ETFs Beat Bitcoin with Record $332M Inflows: What’s the Better Choice?,"The post Spot Ethereum ETFs Beat Bitcoin with Record $332M Inflows: What’s the Better Choice? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto investors are certainly making some bold moves, shifting their focus to spot Ether ETFs and showing increasing confidence in Ethereum’s potential. On November 29, spot Ether ETFs saw an incredible $332.92 million in daily inflows, overtaking Bitcoin ETFs for the first time—and by a wide margin. Why now? Will Ethereum finally catch up to Bitcoin and not just be “second best”? Let’s dive into the details. BlackRock Leads the Ether ETF Surge Here’s the standout detail: only three of the nine active Ether ETFs drove this massive inflow. At the forefront was BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which alone brought in $250 million. Since launching in July, ETHA has accumulated over $2 billion, solidifying its position as a favorite among investors. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $79 million, while Grayscale added $3.4 million. Though smaller in comparison to ETHA, these contributions show a growing institutional interest in Ethereum. Ethereum Price Shows Strength Ethereum’s price is holding steady at $3,695, reflecting a 3.79% gain in the last 24 hours. Trading volume has also risen by more than 11%, suggesting strong market activity. While the price is still about 24% below its all-time high of $4,891 from 2021, analysts believe breaking the $3,730 resistance level could pave the way for further gains. Bitcoin ETFs Take a Back Seat For once, Bitcoin wasn’t the center of attention. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $320 million in inflows on the same day—a strong showing but not enough to outshine Ether’s performance. Interestingly, only six out of twelve Bitcoin ETFs posted inflows. Maybe the tide is changing? Over the past week, Ether ETFs have been quietly dominating. Between November 22 and 27, they raked in nearly $225 million, while Bitcoin ETFs only managed $35 million, mostly because of a big outflow on November 25. Ethereum All Set to Dominate The growing inflows into Ether ETFs signal that investors are increasingly optimistic about Ethereum’s prospects. Whether it’s the recent price action or excitement around its expanding use cases, Ether seems to be stepping out of Bitcoin’s shadow.

In parallel, the new AI-driven, community-powered crypto project iDEGEN has raised over $1.2 million in its ongoing presale , setting the stage for its token listing in 2025. Spot Ethereum ETFs hits record high as ETH price soars On November 29, 2024, spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States reached a remarkable milestone, recording the highest daily inflows in their history. A total of $332.9 million flowed into nine spot Ether ETFs, surpassing the previous record of $295.5 million set just a few weeks earlier. Source: Coinglass Notably, these inflows exceeded those of spot Bitcoin ETFs by approximately $2.9 million on the same day. Most of the daily inflows came from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, contributing $250.4 million to the total. This suggests that institutional investors are becoming increasingly confident in Ethereum’s long-term growth. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has accumulated over $2 billion in total inflows since its launch in July 2024. This steady influx highlights Ethereum’s growing appeal among traditional investors, with many experts suggesting that the shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum-based products is a clear sign of “alt rotation” in the market. Ethereum’s price has also seen positive movement, trading at $3,702 at the time of writing. The rally comes amid Ethereum’s recent success in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and positive news from the ongoing legal battle for its network’s classification. Analysts are predicting that the upward trend in Ethereum’s value and the growing institutional interest through ETFs will continue, especially as Ethereum’s ecosystem matures. The growing interest in spot Ethereum ETFs has been noted by crypto analysts and market commentators. Pentoshi, a pseudonymous trader, remarked on Twitter that the increase in ETH ETF inflows signals the absorption of sellers, suggesting that the market may be poised for further upward momentum. Analysts also noted that the trend of Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in terms of inflows is not an isolated event but part of a broader shift that has seen Ethereum maintain a stronger position despite Bitcoin’s market dominance. iDEGEN presale surpasses $1.2 million As the “alt rotation” kicks off, iDEGEN, a unique crypto project that merges artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, is taking center stage raising over $1.2 million in its ongoing presale. The presale, which launched on November 26, 2024, offers the project’s native token, $IDGN, through a dynamic pricing auction system that mimics the volatile nature of the crypto market. The presale has already sold over 357 million tokens, and with the presale set to end on January 1, 2025, there is growing anticipation for iDEGEN’s official token listing on major exchanges. What sets iDEGEN apart from other crypto projects is its innovative approach to integrating AI with blockchain technology. Described as a “sentient, degenerate meme lord,” iDEGEN adapts and evolves in real-time based on user interactions on X . Every mention, comment, or tag on its posts feeds into the project’s learning model, making it highly dynamic and unpredictable. This unique blend of blockchain and AI provides a fresh take on the crypto space, capturing the chaotic yet vibrant energy of the crypto community. The iDEGEN presale pricing system is designed to capture market volatility, with the token price adjusting every five minutes based on activity. If a purchase is made, the price remains stable for the next five minutes; however, consecutive purchases within the same period result in a 5% increase in price. Conversely, inactivity leads to a 5% decrease. This creates an engaging and interactive experience for investors while reflecting the real-time dynamics of the crypto market. Once the presale concludes, $IDGN will be listed on major exchanges at a price 10% higher than the final presale price, offering early investors significant returns. The ongoing presale is gaining traction, with many seeing it as a way to capitalize on iDEGEN’s unique combination of AI, blockchain, and community-driven development. For those who would like to take advantage of an emerging AI crypto project as the “alt rotation” in the crypto market start, they can visit the official iDEGEN website for more information and possibly participate in the presale.

37039829,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655702,1732957200,"Bitcoin Resets Open Interest, Targets $100,000 After Holding Key Support – Details","Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be rebounding from its recent pullback after reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $99,645 on November 22. Despite liquidations exceeding $500 million during the downturn, the event did not trigger the cascading sell-offs seen in previous market cycles. Bitcoin Open Interest Resets: Is $100,000 Next? The flagship cryptocurrency seems ready to make another attempt at the $100,000 milestone. According to crypto analyst Byzantine General, the recent BTC price pullback reset open interest to levels last observed when the asset first touched $90,000. Critically, Bitcoin held support around $90,875, signaling the potential establishment of a new consolidation phase before the next upward move. Byzantine General stated that BTC is poised to “take out the local highs and potentially take a stab at piercing 100k,” noting: A lot of the passive supply already got taken out in the previous attempt, so there’s a pretty good chance that we will see 100k soon. Byzantine General’s thoughts were echoed by prominent crypto trader Jelle, who said that $100,000 for BTC was “in sight.” The trader shared the following chart where BTC appears to be breaking through a downward-sloping trendline. At the same time, it is also forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern – typically a bullish indicator. Another crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades agreed that Bitcoin is within reaching distance of the $100,000 mark. As previously reported , some analysts believe that BTC is mirroring its price action from 2023, which could see the asset’s price reach as high as $200,000 by early 2025. Healthy Corrections Essential To Fuel Long-Term Growth Bitcoin was trading just above $69,000 on November 6 before surging past its previous ATH and reaching its current price of $97,150 – a staggering 40.8% gain in less than a month. However, such a rapid rally could signal an overextension. A slight correction to the low $90,000 level might just have been what was required for BTC to have a more sustained price momentum going forward. Further, it gives time to retail investors – who have been missing from the current market rally – to enter the market and potentially increase the demand-side pressure. The recent price pullback also cooled down the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index from extreme greed to more moderate levels, setting the stage for a more organic and sustainable rally across the cryptocurrency market. Speaking of long-term forecasts, Pantera Capital founder and managing partner Dan Morehead recently predicted an ambitious price target of $740,000 BTC by 2028.

37039825,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372835,1732957138,Taiwan to Implement Strict Crypto AML Rules on November 30,"Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will enforce new anti-money laundering (AML) regulations for cryptocurrency service providers starting November 30. The upcoming rules require crypto exchanges and other virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to register for AML compliance. AML Framework The deadline for mandatory AML registration for crypto companies was initially January 1, 2025, but the FSC has pushed it forward by a month. In a November 28 statement , the regulator said that overseas entities offering virtual asset services in Taiwan must establish a local presence and complete the AML registration process under the Company Law. Currently, 26 crypto providers are approved to operate in the country, but all of them, registered or not, must comply with the updated AML requirements. To assist with compliance, the FSC issued a checklist to help the platforms identify suspicious activities. They were instructed to monitor customer details such as names, bank account information, IP locations, and account usage patterns. Additionally, they also have to look for unusual transaction activities, including frequent changes to account information, splitting funds, and using multiple accounts from the same IP address. Non-compliance could result in severe penalties, including fines of up to NT$5 million ($153,700) and imprisonment for as long as two years. This regulatory push follows the FSC’s decision to penalize two local exchanges, MaiCoin and BitoPro, for multiple violations. On Monday, the exchanges were fined NT$1.5 million each for non-compliance with AML regulations. According to the agency, the crypto firms did not improve customer due diligence, lacked sufficient knowledge of customers’ wealth sources, failed to keep adequate transaction records, and were ineffective in identifying suspicious transaction patterns. A Balanced Approach Taiwan has been actively advancing cryptocurrency regulations as part of its strategy to position itself as a global leader in the digital asset space. In September of last year, the FSC introduced ten guiding principles for VASPs to create self-regulatory frameworks. According to local media reports , these principles are designed to enhance transparency through improved information disclosure, establish clear standards for the listing and delisting of virtual assets, and ensure the proper separation and custody of client and company funds. More recently, it revealed plans to introduce a registration system requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the Taiwanese government by September 2025. While the government has tightened its oversight, it is also introducing measures to encourage growth in the sector. Last month, the Financial watchdog granted professional investors access to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to foreign digital assets. Additionally, the regulator is preparing a pilot program for institutional cryptocurrency custody, with applications set to open in early 2025. Three private banks have already expressed interest in participating in the initiative.

US users can now trade Solana and Pepe against the US dollar and the Euro through four spot trading pairs: SOL/USD, SOL/EUR, PEPE/USD, and PEPE/EUR on Bitstamp. Spotlight on Solana and PEPE Bitstamp’s decision to list PEPE and SOL aligns with a trend of increasing adoption among major exchanges. Notably, the recent listing of PEPE on Coinbase and Robinhood has amplified interest in the meme coin, while Solana’s expanding ecosystem continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain technology. With a robust ecosystem supporting decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming, and meme coins, Solana has gained popularity among developers and investors alike. Its native token, SOL, recently hit a record-breaking $263, reflecting a staggering 305% annual growth. Pepe, on the other hand, has emerged as one of the most buzzworthy meme coins on the Ethereum blockchain. Its price has experienced sharp rises in recent months, benefiting from a favorable market environment and new exchange listings. By introducing these tokens to US customers, Bitstamp aims to tap into a broader user base while meeting the evolving demands of the crypto community. Market reactions The listing announcement has generated positive momentum for both tokens. SOL’s price surged to $247 before retracting to $241.92 at press time, while PEPE saw a 6% increase, climbing to $0.000021 shortly after the news broke. The listing of these tokens underscores Bitstamp’s commitment to offering a diverse range of assets, capitalizing on the growing demand for both established blockchain projects like Solana and niche market favorites like PEPE. The new listings not only enhance the exchange’s asset portfolio but also position Bitstamp as a key player in facilitating access to innovative blockchain projects for US traders. The listings follow Bitstamp’s earlier achievements, including securing a MiFID Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license from European regulators. The exchange also holds regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services as a money transmitter and virtual currency business and continues to strengthen its compliance credentials.

Data suggest that interest in Layer 1 blockchain solutions has soared, as these platforms provide the foundation for dApps and Smart Contracts, intensifying the race for L1 dominance. Unlikely Cryptos Take Center Stage According to the latest report by CoinGecko, Mantra (OM) has achieved a staggering 7,035.2% increase. This surge is partly driven by its partnership with Zand, a UAE-based digital bank enabling compliant tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) under Dubai’s VARA framework. Additionally, AIOZ Network (AIOZ) posted an impressive 427.6% YTD gain, fueled by the growing adoption of its decentralized content delivery network and ongoing ecosystem advancements. Sui (SUI) too secured its place among the top gainers with a 388.2% YTD rise, owing to the dApp launches that maximize its scalability, and developer-friendly tools. “Coming out of the trenches, 2024 has been a thrilling year for Layer 1 (L1) blockchains, with tokens skyrocketing by over 7,000% since January. In the fast-moving crypto space, a few unexpected tokens are redeeming the top performer spot this year.” Bitcoin, Ethereum: The OGs Remain Strong While mid- and small-cap Layer 1 tokens have experienced explosive growth, major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have proven to be resilient investments. Bitcoin demonstrated a solid 112.9% Year-to-Date (YTD) increase, while Ethereum gained 34.9%, though it lagged behind its smaller counterparts. Over the years, Ethereum’s dominance has slowly diminished with the rise of Layer 2 solutions and other competing blockchains, despite the introduction of the Ethereum Spot ETF in the US. Even so, ETH still managed to outperform the S&P 500, which saw a 24.8% increase in 2024. Meanwhile, Solana rebounded strongly from the impact of FTX’s 2022 collapse, rising 134.3% YTD. Most of its growth came in 2023, driven by memecoin excitement, as its price surged from $15 to $120. This trend was also reflected in networks like Tron (TRX), which rose 85.5% YTD. Toncoin (TON), capitalizing on its integration with Telegram to host dApps, saw an impressive 136.2% YTD increase, particularly as tap-to-earn games gained immense popularity within the app. The post Underdog Cryptos Shock the Market with Massive Gains in 2024’s Explosive Rally appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,ETH | AIOZ,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | AIOZ,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/underdog-cryptos-shock-the-market-with-massive-gains-in-2024s-explosive-rally/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37039559.jpeg

A limited-time opportunity to invest in CYBRO With just 21% of the total tokens allocated for the presale and over 100 million tokens already claimed, the opportunity to get in early is quickly disappearing. For investors ready to secure a stake in a project designed to be truly transformative, CYBRO offers a one-in-a-million chance. XRP: Transforming digital transactions with borderless efficiency XRP , powered by the XRP Ledger, is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed for fast, secure, and low-cost global transactions. It operates without central authority, enabling irreversible transfers and seamless currency exchanges without requiring a bank account. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP began with 100 billion tokens, 80 billion of which were allocated to Ripple for ecosystem development. Ripple, formerly OpenCoin Inc., leverages XRP to enhance liquidity and support its network, with 55 billion XRP held in escrow for controlled release. Named to signify “ripple credits,” XRP is engineered to facilitate smooth and efficient payment transfers worldwide. Cardano: A scalable, sustainable blockchain for smart contracts Cardano is an advanced blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling developers to create DeFi apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, functions like Ethereum’s ETH, allowing users to store value, process payments, and stake on the network. Cardano utilizes Ouroboros, an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system, in contrast to energy-intensive proof-of-work models. The platform features a dual-layer architecture: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design supports scalability, processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second, while its native tokens enable secure, low-cost interactions, driving efficiency and growth in blockchain technology. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like XRP and ADA may offer some growth, their short-term potential is limited. CYBRO , however, presents a remarkable opportunity for investors seeking to enhance their earnings. This advanced DeFi platform uses AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to maximize returns. Offering attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO ensures an exceptional user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Its commitment to transparency, compliance, and quality distinguishes it in the market. The strong interest from prominent crypto investors and influencers highlights CYBRO’s promise as a standout project. For those looking to expand their crypto portfolios, CYBRO represents a compelling option.

37039592,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620357,1732956489,ECB’s President Lagarde urges EU to negotiate with America on tariffs before striking back,"Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank President, is calling on the European Union to think strategically and engage in direct negotiations with America instead of rushing into retaliation over incoming tariffs. President-elect Donald Trump has announced massive tariffs: 60% on Chinese imports and 10-20% on imports from other countries, including Europe. Lagarde warned that these measures, if unchallenged or met with a knee-jerk reaction, could start a global trade war that would benefit no one. Trump’s tariff plans are not entirely clear. While he revealed the numbers, he left out crucial details such as how they’ll be applied, which sectors they’ll target, or whether exceptions will be made. “We need to understand the scope,” Lagarde said. She compared targeted tariffs on products like electric vehicles to broad tariffs that would hit everything crossing U.S. borders. This lack of clarity makes it tough for Europe to predict the exact fallout. Europe’s response and the danger of escalation Lagarde has urged Europe to avoid falling into the tit-for-tat pattern that often characterizes trade disputes. She highlighted Trump’s style of negotiating, pointing to the 10-20% range as evidence that the U.S. might be open to discussions. “If you announce a range, you’re inviting negotiation,” she said. The European Commission has already started preparing for potential tariffs. Lagarde acknowledged this but warned against relying on what she called a “cheque book strategy” — throwing money at the problem. Instead, she suggested that Europe could make concessions by offering to buy more American products, such as liquefied natural gas or military equipment. This would show a willingness to cooperate without escalating tensions. A trade war, Lagarde said, would hurt everyone. GDP across the board would shrink, and no country would come out a winner. The impact wouldn’t stop at the U.S. and Europe. China, already the main target of Trump’s tariff plans, would likely reroute its exports to other markets, including Europe. This “rerouting scenario” would put extra pressure on European industries, which are already vulnerable. For now, Lagarde thinks free trade with China should remain reciprocal and beneficial for both sides. But if Trump’s policies disrupt this balance, Europe might need to consider defensive measures. Inflation, GDP, and the ripple effects Lagarde also addressed how these tariffs could affect Europe’s economy, particularly inflation and growth. She admitted the effects are tough to predict because they depend on the scope, duration, and exact targets of the tariffs. In the short term, she said, the tariffs might lead to slight inflation. But a trade war would ultimately drag down GDP and destabilize global markets. Inflation isn’t the only concern. Lagarde pointed out how uncertainty around tariffs has already shaken consumer and business confidence. Investment decisions are being delayed, and consumption has taken a hit. The ECB factored these risks into its September economic forecasts and will do so again in December. But if the situation escalates, the damage could go beyond current predictions. China’s role and Europe’s challenges China’s position in this trade dispute is another headache for Europe. Lagarde highlighted the risk of Chinese goods flooding European markets as they become less competitive in the U.S. This would disrupt local industries, forcing Europe to make tough decisions about whether to impose its own protective tariffs. Europe’s strategy in dealing with Trump’s tariffs will also set the tone for its economic future. Lagarde pointed to past examples where Europe avoided retaliation and chose negotiation instead. When Trump threatened steel tariffs in the past, the European Commission opted to sit down and talk. It worked. Lagarde suggested that the same approach could be successful now. Beyond tariffs, Lagarde used this moment to push for deeper reforms within Europe, especially the completion of the long-discussed capital markets union. For years, European leaders have talked about integrating financial markets across member states, but progress has been painfully slow. Lagarde argued that a fully functional capital markets union would make Europe more resilient to external shocks like U.S. tariffs. “Money matters,” she said, stressing the need for a single supervisory authority to replace the current system of 27 national regulators. This would mirror the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S., streamlining financial oversight and boosting investor confidence. Lagarde called this a “catalyst” for broader reforms, including better securitization and increased space on banks’ balance sheets to finance innovation. But Lagarde did acknowledge the political challenges of uniting Europe’s fragmented financial system . She cited past resistance to central supervision but noted that similar efforts, like the Single Supervisory Mechanism for banks, eventually succeeded. “It’s laborious, but it’s working,” she said. Europe’s falling competitiveness The region’s competitiveness has been slipping for decades, particularly in tech and finance. While the U.S. and China dominate artificial intelligence, Europe is lagging behind. Lagarde said Europe has the talent but struggles to keep its best minds from leaving for American or Chinese companies. She urged leaders to create an environment where innovation can thrive and companies can grow without looking overseas for funding. The financial sector is another weak spot. European banks, once on par with their American counterparts, have fallen far behind. Lagarde noted that the average European bank is now one-tenth the size of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs. Cross-border mergers, like the proposed UniCredit-Commerzbank deal, could help, but they often face political resistance. Without stronger banks, Europe risks falling further behind in global finance . Lagarde also took aim at Europe’s regulatory system, which she said places an excessive burden on businesses. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, struggle with the sheer volume of paperwork required to comply with environmental and other regulations. When asked about the U.S. administration’s push for deregulation and the stock market’s optimistic response, Lagarde acknowledged the possibility of market adjustments but dismissed fears of a financial crisis. “There has been a little bit of it and there will be more,” she said, referring to potential price corrections. However, she made it clear that deregulation alone wouldn’t trigger a repeat of the global financial crisis, adding confidently, “We stand ready anyway.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ecbs-lagarde-eu-negotiate-america-tariffs/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37039592.jpeg

37041042,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51043,1732955953,These Metrics Show XRP Is Poised For Highest Price Level In 6 Years,"Cryptocurrency investors closely monitor XRP as the digital asset closes in on its 2021 peak of $1.96. The digital asset has seen a remarkable resurgence recently, and analysts are predicting a massive rally in its immediate future. Technical analysis of the asset reveals several key metrics that support this bullish outlook. Despite some bearish signs, it might pull through and smash through milestones investors have been waiting for years to see. The asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a critical momentum indicator, currently sits in the neutral zone around 53. Although it could go in either direction, recent price performance leans toward continued bullish momentum. The RSI metric offers crucial context for understanding market momentum. Typically ranging from 0 to 100, this indicator helps traders assess whether an asset is potentially overvalued or undervalued. Image Source: TradingView XRP RSI During XRP’s recent rally between November 21 and 23, the RSI exceeded 70, signaling an overbought condition that typically precedes a potential price correction. The current reading of 53.2 suggests a stabilization phase, indicating an absence of excessive buying or selling pressure, and experts believe a big pump is coming . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More Technical Indicators Point to Bullish Momentum Complementing the RSI analysis, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) provides additional insights into capital movements. XRP’s CMF has recently transitioned to a slightly negative -0.05, down from a positive 0.10 during its price peak. Though not yet indicating a significant market reversal, this subtle shift suggests a marginal increase in selling pressure. The metric reflects a nuanced change in investor sentiment, with capital flows showing signs of potential redistribution. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines present another critical perspective on XRP’s market dynamics. XRP’s long and short-term moving averages are currently bullish, but the narrowing gap between them hints at potentially diminishing upward momentum, suggesting investors should remain vigilant. However, the overall market is bullish. These positive indicators pushed the digital asset to a multi-year high of $1.7664, and sustained buying pressure could push it further. If the asset cannot sustain its momentum, it could fall toward support levels at $1.27, with an extended correction to around $1.05. However, a well-respected trader recently predicted a massive rally if the digital asset can break through its $1.96 peak from April 2021. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $1.92, with a 19% price increase over the past 24 hours. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

37038887,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372796,1732955610,We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Can Hit a New ATH Before Christmas,"TL;DR XRP tapped a three-year high, but achieving a new ATH of over $3.84 by Christmas depends on numerous factors. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, could positively impact XRP’s price if launched soon, but its approval by the NYDFS remains uncertain. A Very Special Christmas for the XRP Army? Ripple’s XRP has been making the headlines in the past few weeks, registering an impressive price increase and outperforming its rivals. On November 29, it reached a three-year high of $1.67, while some analysts believe the bull run could take it to a new all-time high before Christmas. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko We decided to poke the AI brains of ChatGPT and see if it shares that thesis. The popular chatbot claimed such a scenario is unlikely but not entirely out of the cards. However, surpassing $3.84 (the ATH registered in 2018) will depend on multiple factors. Perhaps the most important is the shift in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not long ago, the current Chairman, Gary Gensler, confirmed he will step down on January 20, 2025. This has led to speculation that the next leader will be pro-crypto and not hamper the industry’s advancement with constant legal battles. To the uninitiated, the Commission filed countless lawsuits against cryptocurrency businesses over the years. Among those is the legal tussle versus Ripple, which has been ongoing for almost four years. According to ChatGPT, though, XRP might experience a significant pump once Gensler vacate his post. It is unlikely that he will do so before Christmas this year. Another essential element is the overall market sentiment. The AI-powered chatbot assumed that Ripple’s native token could head north if the entire cryptocurrency sector thrived. Despite a recent correction, the market’s condition remains quite bullish, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading well above $95,000 and Ethereum (ETH) tapping a six-month high of almost $3,700. Last but not least, ChatGPT reminded about XRP’s historical performance, noting that the asset is capable of charting double and even triple-digit gains in a short period of time . The Potential Role of RLUSD Another factor that may boost the valuation of XRP in the near future is the eventual launch of Ripple’s stablecoin – RLUSD. Earlier this week, X user Vet said almost all tokens have been burned , sparking rumors that the product is ready to see the light of day. Nonetheless, the community will have to wait for approval from the NYDFS. Monica Long (president of Ripple) recently stated : “It’s up to them. They are reviewing our trust application. It’s going to be in their hands when they are approving it.” The post We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Can Hit a New ATH Before Christmas appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-chatgpt-if-ripple-xrp-can-hit-a-new-ath-before-christmas/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37038887.jpeg

The firm’s latest analysis highlights the importance of the $98,400 resistance level for bullish momentum, as well as potential support levels that could trigger significant market reactions. According to MarktQuant, the biggest challenge for Bitcoin is the resistance at $98,400. The price needs to break out of this level to resume the uptrend. Failure to do so could lead to a pullback and potentially test support in the $90,000-$92,000 range. BTC price is trading at $97,500 at the time of writing. Related News: Wells Fargo Predicts How Many Times the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates in 2025 MarktQuant expects fresh buying interest to emerge around $90,000-$92,000 in the event of a pullback. This range also represents a critical area for futures traders, especially those using high leverage (around 16.67x or higher), and they will likely place stop-loss orders here. According to the analytics firm, if Bitcoin were to fall into this zone, the market could experience a drop of around 6.5%, which could trigger significant liquidations and increase volatility. MarktQuant’s analysis also highlighted significant liquidation clusters. The firm noted significant movement in the $94,000-$96,000 range, where leveraged positions, particularly long liquidations, are concentrated. These areas act as magnets for market volatility as prices approach these thresholds. *This is not investment advice.

From VeChain’s transformative strides in sustainability and tokenisation to Toncoin’s symbiotic relationship with Telegram’s massive user base, blockchain’s real-world applications are becoming impossible to ignore. Yet, it’s not just about the giants; emerging players like Qubetics ($TICS) are carving a niche, offering bold new solutions to longstanding problems in the decentralised landscape. What sets $TICS apart? It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, designed to tackle privacy and transparency issues plaguing traditional platforms. Its decentralised architecture is set to revolutionise how investors engage with blockchain technology, offering a presale opportunity that’s already attracting thousands. Let’s explore why Qubetics, Toncoin, and VeChain deserve a spot on your radar as the top altcoins to watch for December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Privacy Pioneer and Presale Sensation Privacy is no longer optional in today’s interconnected world—it’s essential. Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, has privacy baked into its DNA, combining decentralised architecture with cutting-edge cryptography to protect users. Imagine this: as an investor, you log into a platform that doesn’t sell your data, doesn’t track your activity, and lets you make secure financial decisions. That’s Qubetics in action. Whether you’re navigating the volatile crypto market or making microtransactions, $TICS provides the peace of mind you’ve always needed but rarely received. Take, for example, a tech enthusiast who invests $10,000 during the ongoing presale at $0.025 per token. That investment secures 400,000 $TICS tokens. So far, Qubetics’ presale has captivated over 4,800 holders, raising $3.6 million and selling 239 million tokens. With prices set to rise 10% this weekend, time is of the essence for those eager to jump aboard this train. But it’s not just about profits. Qubetics’ decentralised design makes blockchain navigation intuitive and secure, tackling the trust issues that have plagued the space for years. If you’re searching for altcoins to watch for December 2024, $TICS stands as both a game-changer and a goldmine. Toncoin: Riding Telegram’s Wave of Innovation Toncoin’s integration with Telegram has been nothing short of revolutionary. The messaging app, used by nearly 900 million people, introduced crypto payments via Telegram Wallet earlier this year, pushing Toncoin to the forefront of decentralised finance. With features like cross-border money transfers and digital identity solutions, Toncoin has become synonymous with real-world blockchain applications. Let’s paint a scenario: imagine a freelancer working with clients globally. In the past, cross-border payments were a nightmare of fees and delays. With Toncoin’s ecosystem, payments are instant, cost-effective, and secure, making it a no-brainer for businesses and individuals alike. This synergy between Telegram and Toncoin is why it’s one of the top altcoins to watch for December 2024. Despite its price fluctuations—hovering between $5.1 and $5.5—Toncoin has displayed remarkable resilience, boasting weekly and monthly growth rates of 4.91% and 6.85%, respectively. As of late November, its value crossed the $6 mark, with analysts optimistic about its upward trajectory. The key lies in increasing buying interest. Should demand continue to grow, Toncoin could easily shatter its current range, offering investors a lucrative opportunity. Toncoin’s reliance on Telegram’s ecosystem isn’t just a partnership; it’s a masterstroke in blockchain adoption. It seamlessly bridges the gap between crypto enthusiasts and everyday users, proving that decentralisation can be practical and user-friendly. If you’ve ever wondered which altcoins to watch for December 2024, Toncoin’s Telegram-fuelled rise provides a compelling answer. VeChain: Championing $42 Trillion in Sustainability and Tokenisation When it comes to blending sustainability and tokenisation, VeChain isn’t playing small. Its mission—“With Web3 for Better”—underpins a bold vision: advancing a $26 trillion sustainability market and a $16 trillion tokenisation economy.

Bitcoin inches closer to $100k, XRP is at its 52-week, and Ethereum presents a new breakout run. As the broader market anticipates a new spike in December 2024, the first week could be filled with massive inflows. So, let’s find out the upcoming price trends of the top cryptos and figure out the chances of the next bull run. Bitcoin Targets $100k In the 1-hour chart, the BTC price trend showcases a recovered rally, giving a trendline breakout. Overcoming a long-coming bearish influence, the BTC price has surpassed the $97,600 barrier to nearly reach the $99,000 mark. Bitcoin-Price-Analysis-30th-Nov-2024 Tradingview However, the higher price rejection led to a quick retest of the broken trendline. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $96,395. The BTC found support at the 50-EMA of the 1-hour chart and is now taking a positive test reversal. The bullish recovery has led to a golden crossover and a positive alignment of the 50, 100, and 200-EMA in the 1-hour chart. As the post-retest reversal gains momentum with four consecutive bullish candles, the MACD and signal lines are on the verge of giving a positive crossover. Based on the Fibonacci levels, a post-retest reversal sustaining dominance above the 78.6% Fibonacci level could surpass the $100,000 mark in the first week of December. Furthermore, the price trend could reach the $104,584 peak by next weekend. On the flip side, consolidation at the $96,000 mark could result in a bearish outcome and reach the $95,000 support level. Will Ethereum (ETH) Price Cross $4,000? The Ethereum price trend is showcasing a rising wedge pattern in the 4-hour chart. With the higher high and higher low trend facing a massive supply from a local resistance trendline, the Ethereum price trend is approaching a bottleneck. ETH Price Analysis 30th Nov 2024 Tradingview Currently, it is analyzing the overhead trendline and trading at $3,667. In supporting the upside trends, the MACD and signal lines are merged despite the consolidation range and could regain positive alignment. A bullish breakout will put the $4,037 and $4,300 mark as the potential price targets next week. On the flip side, the crucial support remains at $3,298. Keen on stacking some Ether?

XRP Price Analysis 30th Nov 2024 Tradingview Currently, it is trading at $1.886, with a 24-hour high set at $1.90. The MACD and signal lines have given a positive crossover with a massive surge of gradually intensifying bullish histograms. Based on the pivot levels, the immediate price resistance stands at $1.95. However, based on the trend momentum and the bullish rally in the bull market, the XRP price could reach $2.586 by the end of next week. The minimum support for the next week is estimated at $1.69 or $1.37. FAQs Will Bitcoin surpass $100,000 next week?

37051837,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103422,1732955098,Market Expert Lark Davis Says Cardano is Going to $10 This Cycle,"An analyst has insisted that the 213% Cardano monthly surge is only a glimpse of his ultimate price target for the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Cardano has been one of the best-performing high-caliber assets. The asset has pulled an over twofold monthly gain , with its market cap closing down on eighth-placed USDC. Amidst Cardano’s near-perfect outing, notable crypto pundit Lark Davis has speculated further upsides for the asset. In a recent commentary, he asserted that the “Ethereum killer” would attain $10 this bull cycle. Pundit Predicts an 800% Cardano Push to $10 Davis insists it is not too late to stack Cardano despite the recent price upsurge. He made this claim on the basis that the altcoin has further unprecedented price territories to conquer in the ongoing bull cycle. The pundit emphasized that Cardano is getting a strong macroeconomic boost as the hype around the ecosystem has surged substantially. Per the commentary, the growing attention provides an avenue for Cardano to “run real hard, real fast.” Meanwhile, Davis speculated that the continuation of this bullish upsurge would push Cardano to around its all-time high of $3.16. From there, ADA would target a 332% surge to the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $4.80. The analyst expects more upsides from there, aiming for an uptick to the 2.618 Fibonacci level at $7.70. Finally, he sees a “realistic” push to the 3.618 Fibonacci level at $10. Pundit Cites Market Dominance Correlation Notably, Davis mentioned that Cardano had a 4% market dominance in the previous cycle. The analyst stated that, at the current market valuation, Cardano’s market cap would surge 10x to around $370 billion to attain this dominance level. Essentially, the tenfold market cap boost would also translate to its price, pushing Cardano to above $10. With the commentary, Davis stated that his Fibonacci price level prediction aligns with Cardano’s market cap expectations. Meanwhile, other analysts have also predicted that Cardano would trade at $10. For context, Dan Gambardello speculated that ADA would surge to a price between $5 and $10 after consolidating above the $1 price mark. Cardano On the Move? Meanwhile, on-chain activities suggest Cardano is ready for its next leg up. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Cardano has flipped Binance Coin (BNB) in 24-hour trading volume, signaling surging interest among market participants towards the asset. Cardano Flips BNB in 24-hour Volume Furthermore, analyst Jake Wujastyk speculated that Cardano is ready for another upward launch. In a tweet today, he shared a chart suggesting Cardano is up for an impressive day, citing the “volume shelf” indicator.

This stunning surge has pushed XRP to its highest levels since 2021. With its market cap now sitting at a staggering $108 billion, many are asking: Could $2 be the next stop for XRP? But what’s driving this sudden surge, and is there more to come? Keep reading to find out more about what’s in store. What’s Driving XRP’s Rally? Several factors are behind XRP’s rapid price increase. Progress in the long-running Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has boosted market confidence. Additionally, speculation about a potential XRP-based ETF and rising trading activity have further fueled the bullish trend. Adding to this momentum, it was announced that SEC Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, coinciding with Donald Trump’s expected return to office. This has raised hopes for a resolution to Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, a key factor weighing on XRP’s price for years. Ripple’s RLUSD Burn Another major development is Ripple’s decision to burn 46.67 million RLUSD tokens, as reported by Coinpedia. This move leaves only 100,000 RLUSD tokens on each blockchain, which has sparked optimism among investors. What the Technicals Tell Us Despite the recent surge, technical indicators suggest there’s still potential for further growth. XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 74.8 , signaling overbought conditions. However, XRP has historically reached RSI levels above 80 before experiencing corrections, hinting that the rally may not be over yet. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), another key metric, has turned positive at 0.08, indicating increased capital inflows. While this isn’t as high as during past bullish periods, it shows growing investor confidence and supports the case for continued upward momentum. Could $2 Be the Next Milestone? If current trends persist, XRP could soon test the $2 level—a significant psychological and technical milestone. Analysts suggest that breaking this barrier could open the door to even greater gains, potentially pushing XRP toward its all-time high of $3.38. However, traders should remain cautious. A slowdown in momentum could lead to a price correction, with support levels at $1.21 and $1.05 acting as safety nets. For now, though, the outlook remains positive, with market conditions and technical signals favoring further growth. The bulls are in control, but how long can they keep the rally alive?

According to Farside data , this figure eclipsed the previous record of $295.5 million set on November 11 by $37.4 million, marking a new high for investor interest in Ether-based ETFs. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, played a pivotal role in the surge, contributing $250.4 million to the total inflows on November 29.

Between November 22 and 27, spot Ether ETFs saw net inflows of $224.9 million, compared to Bitcoin ETFs’ $35.2 million, which was weighed down by outflows on November 25. Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem also celebrated a legal victory in a U.S. court this week, potentially boosting investor confidence in the asset. Pseudonymous crypto trader Pentoshi summed up the sentiment in a post on X, saying, “Flows are finally picking up, and sellers are being absorbed. It only takes time.” Ethereum Surpasses Tron as Top Blockchain for Tether Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether (USDT), surpassing Tron with a supply of $60.3 billion. The milestone follows a 9.3% increase in USDT on Ethereum over the past week, while Tron experienced a 1.5% decline, bringing its supply to $58.1 billion. This marks Ethereum’s return to dominance for the first time since August 2022. The total USDT supply has reached an all-time high of $132.9 billion, a bullish indicator for the broader cryptocurrency market. Stablecoins like Tether are critical for providing trading liquidity and facilitating capital flow within the ecosystem. Ethereum’s prominence stems from its adoption by financial institutions for tokenizing US dollar-backed assets. Meanwhile, Tron remains popular in high-inflation regions due to its low fees and fast transactions, enabling efficient savings in stablecoins like USDT. Ethereum solidified its lead on November 21, and the gap widened on November 23 when Tether minted $2 billion USDT on Ethereum compared to $1 billion on Tron. Other blockchains in the USDT supply rankings include BNB Chain ($4.58 billion), Arbitrum ($3.09 billion), and Avalanche ($1.31 billion).

Insider trading, misleading promotions, and pump-and-dump schemes are at the center of the controversy, with claims that MrBeast made over $23 million from crypto projects. We’re answering questions you don’t want to miss. Read on! Did MrBeast Manipulate Token Prices?

Shiba Inu remains one of the most popular meme coins in the space and looks ready for another monumental year in 2025. Find out why the newly launching GambleFi platform Rollblock (RBLK) is set to repeat the Shiba Inu playbook this year, as experts make incredible 100x price predictions for this disruptive low cap all-star. Shiba Inu burning its bullish way into the meme coin stratosphere Shiba Inu remains the second largest meme coin by market cap after Dogecoin and currently sits at 13th place in the CoinMarketCap top 20 crypto index. Shiba Inu has been making incredibly bullish moves lately with a 35% monthly candle bringing its token price to $0.0000251 and launching its market cap above $14.8 billion. During the 2021 bull market, Shiba Inu was one of the top performers, rising from complete obscurity to becoming one of the largest cap meme coins ever created. Shiba Inu did an easy 10x in just a few weeks as it pumped on its Binance exchange listing. Shiba Inu ‘s tokenomics are becoming more attractive to investors as 60 trillion share tokens were recently permanently removed from supply as part of the protocol’s regular burn mechanism. This will increase the scarcity of the token going forward and should drive the Shiba Inu price ever higher thanks to a vastly reduced selling pressure in the markets. This latest burn represents a staggering 5,154% increase in the burn rate, according to the blockchain tracker Shibburn. Shiba Inu’s layer 2 scaling solution, the Shibarium, has recently seen record volume with more and more traders returning to the highly volatile meme space.

Rollblock has over 7,000 games currently live and is generating massive revenue for the platform each day. All Rollblock bets are securely encrypted onto the Ethereum blockchain, giving gamers huge peace of mind that nothing will be manipulated behind the curtain. Each week, the game-changing Rollblock revenue-sharing mechanism will take a portion of the platform’s profits and reinvest them in the community by buying up RBLK tokens on the open market. 60% of these tokens are immediately removed from the circulating supply, and the other 40% are given to stakers who can earn some of the highest APY in all of crypto. This has led analysts to predict astonishing returns of up to 100x as Rollblock scales this year and hits mainstream adoption.

The incident, shared widely on social media, has drawn mixed reactions from the cryptocurrency community. DomTheTroll reportedly intended to conduct a routine operation during the live stream but inadvertently sent all of his holdings—valued at approximately $150,000—to a burn address, making them permanently unrecoverable. This mistake, captured live, quickly went viral. This “dev” accidentally burned $150k of tokens (everything he had) while live streaming pic.twitter.com/C6CRSzFaXE — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) November 27, 2024 As a meme coin, I HAVE NOTHING was potentially created to capitalize on the recent rise in meme coin popularity. This incident highlights the dichotomy of the crypto market, as some are turning small investments into millions while others are losing all their funds to simple mistakes. However, some speculate that the event could paradoxically boost the coin’s popularity due to the publicity it has generated. Crypto Community Reactions Community reactions to the incident varied. One user expressed empathy, noting that he felt bad for the “poor guy.” He added, “Don’t know what someone is going through, and it could have been life-changing for him and his family.” Another community member highlighted the irony of the situation with the token’s name being I HAVE NOTHING. However, not all reactions were sympathetic. Someone noted the need for caution, “Always revise the transaction before clicking.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Interestingly, some questioned DomTheTroll’s skills as a developer, as experienced developers should understand the consequences and avoid careless mistakes like these. The event has sparked discussions about the importance of careful transaction review in cryptocurrency operations. Mistakes like sending funds to the wrong address or burning tokens are irreversible. They usually lead to significant financial losses. Despite the setback, many in the community expressed hope for DomTheTroll’s recovery financially and emotionally. Some also shared details of similar events, as another developer reportedly burned $450,000 in front of his girlfriend. While the long-term impact of the I HAVE NOTHING project remains to be seen, this episode serves as a cautionary tale for anyone involved in cryptocurrencies. It also exemplifies the unpredictable and often dramatic nature of the crypto world. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Martinez tells his 91,300 followers on the social media platform X that online searches for the keyword “Bitcoin” are in the bottom 50th percentile, suggesting low interest relative to the levels usually experienced at the height of bull markets. “Investor sentiment remains subdued, far from euphoric—indicating Bitcoin may still have significant room to grow before reaching a market top.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $97,450 at time of writing.

Over the long term, the he says the top altcoin could go up by nearly 180% over the coming weeks, eclipsing its all-time high of around $4,900 reached in November of 2021.

Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once only available to a few. By using blockchain, Ondo makes financial systems better and more accessible to everyone. It has two main parts: one creates tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to make these products more functional and scalable. In a market that’s often uncertain, Ondo stands out by focusing on trust and security. It works with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase to keep crypto assets safe. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and follows legal and regulatory rules closely. One of its key products, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but offers yields. It’s backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, giving it stability. For non-US investors, this means access to top-quality, regulated, and clear financial products. With the current interest in secure and transparent crypto options, Ondo’s approach could appeal to many looking for reliable investments in the blockchain space. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is turning heads in the blockchain world. It’s a Layer-1 platform that’s eco-friendly, boasts low fees, and processes transactions at lightning speed—up to 4,500 per second. One standout feature is its ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility and scalability. Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, ensuring transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. The platform operates with three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which handle different tasks like transactions and smart contract execution. AVAX serves as the backbone of the Avalanche ecosystem. It’s used for paying transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and powering multiple Subnets. This strong utility positions AVAX well in the current market. With the growing demand for fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Avalanche stands out among competitors. Its eco-friendly approach and rapid transaction times address key challenges in the industry. While markets are always shifting, Avalanche’s technology and versatility make it a noteworthy player in today’s crypto landscape. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects these digital agreements to real-world data. This means a smart contract can access information like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink does this through a network of oracles, which are like messengers that bring data from outside sources to the blockchain. They use a reputation system to make sure the data is accurate and reliable. In the current market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a big problem: getting real-world data onto blockchains. This makes smart contracts more useful and opens up new possibilities. Unlike many other coins that focus on payments, Chainlink focuses on data and functionality. Its token, LINK, rewards those who provide data and helps secure the network. As more businesses look to use blockchain technology, the demand for Chainlink’s services could grow. This unique approach makes LINK an interesting option to watch in today’s market. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain platform that puts security first. It’s designed to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a trustworthy choice for institutions and developers. With MANTRA, you get a blockchain that’s open to everyone but can also support applications that need special permissions. This means businesses can build on MANTRA without worrying about breaking any rules. What makes MANTRA stand out is its strong technology foundation. It’s built using the Cosmos SDK, which means it’s compatible with other blockchains and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, so it’s ready for large-scale use. Plus, it offers tools to create and manage assets that comply with regulations. In today’s market, where many are looking for secure and compliant blockchain solutions, OM, the coin of MANTRA, looks promising. It could be a strong competitor to other coins that don’t focus on regulatory compliance, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion ONDO, AVAX, LINK, and OM are strong picks, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely merges memes and sports, aiming for 20,000% growth and poised to become a cultural icon.

This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pink-shiba-inu-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

As a result, the majority of the cryptos, specifically altcoins, are trying to rise above their pivotal resistance, which may further assist them in marking new highs during the upcoming bull run. Moreover, the possibility of a strong altseason has also emerged as Ethereum, which is known as the base for the other altcoins, has launched a strong bullish attack. For the first time, Ethereum ETFs have outpaced the BTC ETF. The recent rise in the ETH price seems to have caught the investor’s attention, which has reflected in the spot ETH ETFs volumes. The ETFs witnessed a massive surge in net flows, recording $333 million, surpassing BTC, which is around $320 million, between November 22 and 27. Out of this, Blackrock alone accumulated over $250 million. Source: X As ETH continues to outshine, it’s clear that the investor’s confidence is shifting, which may further lead to a major change in its value. The ETH price is ready to surge higher with the trend continuation after the breakout of the inverse head-and-shoulder pattern followed by a successful retest. This suggests the interim target of the ETH price rally is somewhere above $5500. After a successful breakout in the short term, the ETH price has become favourable for bulls in the long term. The price, which is trading along an ascending support line, is about to test the final resistance zone below the ATH between $3870 and $4016. The bulls are trying for a breakout before reaching the apex of the ascending triangle as the RSI is incremental and the Gaussian channel has turned bullish. Therefore, the ETH price is believed to surpass the resistance zone and enter the final resistance at the ATH. Meanwhile, the volume raises some concerns, which remains pretty lower than the bull run range. However, these volumes seem to be flowing into the ETFs, which keeps the bullish hopes alive. According to some reports, the institutions are investing more in technology than the ETH price. Therefore, this suggests the growing confidence in the platform, which may keep up the elevated trend, reaching a 5-digit level too.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-is-falling-weak-at-resistance-while-ethereum-eyes-a-10-upswing-to-begin-the-december-trade/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The market has recently favored XRP as it has breached a long-standing descending trendline against Bitcoin. However, it has to cross crucial levels to begin the bull run. This trendline had previously acted as a formidable resistance, with XRP struggling to overcome it during an attempt in July 2021. However, it has now gained a remarkable 111% against Bitcoin in November alone, signaling a potential resurgence in investor interest. Analyzing the #XRP price in Dollars vs Bitcoin shows us how early we are in this bullrun. We are still 1,500% behind in Bitcoin value compared to early 2017. If we meet the same Bitcoin value $XRP price will be around $20. pic.twitter.com/ofxd6Izv5g — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 26, 2024 A Lofty Target for XRP According to CryptoBull’s analysis, the significance of this breakout lies in the historical context. Before the current market conditions, XRP had been underperforming Bitcoin for an extended period, since it reached its all-time high in early 2018. The prolonged period of XRP’s relative weakness against Bitcoin has now been challenged, as the asset appears to be regaining its footing. CryptoBull believes that XRP’s current bull run is still in its early phase, suggesting it still has room for further upside. The analyst’s projection is based on the premise that if XRP can reclaim its 2017 peak against Bitcoin, it could reach a price target of around $20. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In 2017, XRP’s peak against Bitcoin was 0.0002454 BTC. The cryptocurrency achieved this in May 2017, following a remarkable gain of over 300% against the leading cryptocurrency in the preceding three months. Currently, XRP is trading at a mere 0.00001544 BTC, indicating that it is still at almost 1,500% below the historical high. Given the recent positive momentum , CryptoBull believes that a similar rally to the one witnessed in early 2017 could propel the altcoin to its aforementioned $20 price target. Based on the current Bitcoin price of around $95,000, which would translate the 0.0002454 BTC peak into a $23.3 XRP price. CryptoBull’s projection has instilled optimism among XRP enthusiasts, who closely monitor the altcoin’s performance. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.87. Other crypto experts have predicted the $20 target for XRP. If it can repeat its 300% surge against Bitcoin, it could outperform Bitcoin in December and January next year to reach this level.

37036705,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655681,1732951857,Data Shows Selling Pressure Mounts On Bitcoin: Is The Bull Run at Risk?,"Despite Bitcoin maintaining investor confidence by holding above critical psychological levels like $90,000, the asset faces notable shift in market sentiment . A CryptoQuant analyst, G a a h, recently shared insights indicating heightened selling pressure within the market, which could signal caution for traders. At the core of this analysis is the delta between buy and sell taker volumes—a key metric used to gauge the market’s behaviour . Bitcoin Faces Increased Selling Pressure According to the analyst, the buy and sell taker ratio metric has reached levels comparable to those recorded in July 2024. This marks a period of heightened selling activity, attributed to profit-taking by investors, market uncertainty, or mass liquidations. The analyst noted that these developments coincide with an uptick in volatility and aggressive actions in the futures market. Notably, $430 million in long positions were liquidated within a week, highlighting the significant reaction from sellers. G a a h also revealed that the liquidation of long positions, which reached its fourth-highest peak in 2024, has had a notable effect on Bitcoin’s price behaviour. This volume of liquidation often result in a “redistribution of capital,” leading to temporary reversals or consolidation phases, the CryptoQuant analyst noted. Historically, these liquidation-driven price movements have also acted as pivotal moments, either reinforcing support levels or triggering further sell-offs. Outlook and Precautions For BTC Traders The analyst pointed out that sustained selling pressure could negatively influence Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the short term. As such, continuous monitoring of market indicators and risk management is important for investors aiming to navigate these conditions. G a a h added: Defensive strategies [such as reducing leverage and setting stop-losses] and continuous monitoring of the market are recommended to avoid excessive exposure at this time of dominant selling pressure. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued with its positive performance. Over the past day, the asset has increased by 1.6% bringing its price above $97,000 . Although Bitcoin is still 2.7% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $99,645, there appears to still be a form of bullish sentiment in its market. According to recent analysis from renowned crypto analyst known as Javon Marks on X, Bitcoin’s 2-hour time frame on the chart has “confirmed” a notable bullish signal.

Kaal Dhairya, a top developer of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, shared the development today. According to him, the team completed security maintenance on Shibarium Bridge, and the service is now fully operational. Shibarium Bridge Undergoes Emergency Security Upgrade This announcement comes five hours after he announced a critical security upgrade for Shibarium Bridge, which put the service in temporary maintenance mode. At the time, Dhairya assured Shiba Inu community members that their funds were safe during the maintenance. Amid the maintenance, Dhairya noted that the team temporarily halted the Shibarium burn mechanism until the issue was fully resolved. Nonetheless, he specified that the number of tokens intended for incineration would continue to accumulate and would be incinerated after the upgrade was complete. https://twitter.com/kaaldhairya/status/1862605503584485399A few hours after the notice, the Shiba Inu top developer disclosed that the maintenance on the Shibarium Bridge had been successfully completed. He commended the team for the swift upgrade. While Shibarium Bridge’s maintenance is complete, Dhairya said the team is working on enhancing the network’s burn contracts. He said this upgrade would continue throughout the weekend and into the following week. Shibarium Bridge Botched Launch and Upgrade It is worth mentioning that Shibarium Bridge has witnessed significant upgrades since its relaunch on August 28, 2023. The service was initially slated for launch on August 16, 2023. However, it encountered software bugs, trapping millions of dollars on the network for nearly two weeks. After fixing the bugs, the team relaunched the bridge on the mainnet, allowing users to bridge their assets between Ethereum and Shibarium. While the withdrawal time for LEASH, SHIB, and WETH took between 45 minutes and 3 hours, BONE withdrawal took up to seven days. The team conducted a major upgrade earlier this year to resolve this issue, reducing the BONE transfer time to 45 minutes. Current Shibarium Stats In the meantime, Shibarium has witnessed a daily transaction count of over 4 million since November 1. With 4.81 million transactions recorded yesterday, the network now boasts a total count of 583,828,058 (583.82 million) transactions.Additionally, over 1.99 million blockchain addresses have interacted with Shibarium since its launch, with 8.15 million blocks processed so far.",POSITIVE,ETH | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/30/shiba-inu-team-completes-an-emergency-security-upgrade-on-shibarium-bridge/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-team-completes-an-emergency-security-upgrade-on-shibarium-bridge,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Notably, concerns emerged after some community members questioned the functionality of the burn portal, known as Shib Torch, which launched in August 2024 . In response, Kaal Dhairya, one of Shibarium’s developers, clarified the situation, confirming that the platform has already burned over 300 million SHIB tokens months after its introduction.The concerns began when Emrys, a member of the community, raised questions on X. He pointed out the lack of updates about the auto-burn feature, initially promised for January 2023. His inquiry was directed at Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, who responded tersely. This response triggered frustration, with Emrys accusing the ecosystem leadership of misleading the community about the project’s plans. Amid the heated exchange, Dhairya stepped in to address the concerns. He confirmed that the Shib Torch platform had been operational for months and had successfully burned hundreds of millions of SHIB tokens. https://twitter.com/kaaldhairya/status/1862574596437754123In fact, Dhairya mentioned burning over 80 million SHIB recently and emphasized the presence of a “cool animation” at the end of each burn. Community Questions and Developer Clarifications While Dhairya’s remarks addressed some concerns, they also led to additional questions about the burn process, especially with his disclosure of cheaper Shibarium burns.Another community member expressed curiosity about the mechanism, noting that SHIB, being native to Ethereum, must be sent to a dead wallet on the Ethereum network to effectively reduce its circulating supply. He wondered how Shibarium’s burn portal could achieve this more efficiently. Dhairya clarified that while the current burns still occur on Ethereum, the team is exploring ways to make the process more efficient. He noted that the Shib Torch platform will undergo an upcoming maintenance which would introduce an enhanced burning mechanism. Dhairya also hinted at the potential use of CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to improve the system further. Real-Time Shiba Inu Burn DataDespite the concerns , data from Shib Torch supports Dhairya’s statements. Since its launch three months ago, the platform has burned over 361.9 million SHIB tokens. Although the platform is currently under maintenance, data confirms that burns continue to occur in the background.

This sudden rally has caught the attention of investors, who are now increasingly optimistic about the token’s future. With New Partnerships, IPO launch, ETFs, and Stablecoins all lined up in the coming months XRP is surely to hit a new ATH by December. Before that let’s understand what’s market looks like. Ripple vs. SEC Case: Will it Be Over Soon? The hopes for XRP price are rising because Brad Garlinghouse hinted in a recent interview that XRP may come out from a legal mess creating room for XRP growth. Speculation is growing that the case could be dismissed by 2025, giving XRP the regulatory clarity it has long sought. This optimism gained momentum after SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his departure in January. Some legal experts, like Chris Giancarlo, believe the SEC might drop the case altogether, while others, such as lawyers Fred Rispoli and Jeremy Hogan, think the SEC might settle and reduce penalties. Additionally, interest is rising in creating XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), though the SEC has yet to approve any. If the case is dismissed, it could remove regulatory roadblocks that have hindered XRP’s adoption. This would give Ripple room to expand, potentially sending XRP’s price to new heights, with investors already factoring in this potential outcome. Brad Garlinghouse’s Upcoming 60 Minutes Appearance Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is set to appear on 60 Minutes, where he will discuss Ripple’s journey through the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. The interview, airing on December 1st, will showcase Ripple’s resilience and belief in future success, even amidst legal challenges. This comes at a time when XRP has surged to a multi-year high of $1.60, with growing optimism in the crypto market. XRP’s Strong Market Performance In the meanwhile, XRP is currently in a strong bull run, trading above $1.50, with a 6% gain in the past 24 hours and a 20% increase over the last week. It’s eyeing the $1.60 mark, though it faces resistance between $1.60 and $1.70. If it breaks through, it could quickly hit $2. Analysts predict that if the price drops, solid support levels around $1.25 to $1.30 will prevent significant losses. If it breaks above $1.50 has already shifted previous resistance levels into support, setting XRP up for further growth. Looking Ahead: Positive Outlook for December Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, forecasts that XRP could continue its positive movement into December, potentially reaching as high as $2.57. This bullish prediction is supported by recent market trends and the anticipated launch of an XRP ETF, which could further influence the token’s price.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-vs-sec-can-legal-clarity-lead-xrp-to-a-new-all-time-high-by-december/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Notably, the analyst did not state any price target following the breakout.Shiba Inu Price AnalysisMeanwhile, a TradingView SHIB 1D analysis shows that the relative strength index (RSI) stands at 61.61.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Avalanche targets Cardano, but rising star IntelMarkets shines with QuantumX wallet and AI platform launch. Avalanche (AVAX) is gearing up to overtake one of the biggest winners of the last bull cycle-Cardano (ADA). But while these crypto giants strive for comebacks, a new star of the crypto space is putting all its foot on the table, IntelMarkets (INTL). By announcing the QuantumX wallet launch and an AI-driven platform, IntelMarkets promises more upside potential than standard altcoins. IntelMarkets: Leading the next wave of crypto innovation Quickly getting all the attention is IntelMarkets . Shaping up to be a leader in transforming the $36 billion crypto trading sector with a unique AI- DeFi narrative. QuantumX wallet is a first of its kind “future-proof” wallet. With the increase in cybersecurity attacks combined with the threat of quantum computing, IntelMarkets provides the first retail solution to address this problem. IntelMarkets has already shown its credibility in the presale phase, garnering well over $2.5 million. Currently, at the sixth presale stage, early investors saw a 500% increase from the initial price of $0.009, with INTL tokens now priced at $0.054. With low entry and high growth potential, IntelMarkets is an excellent investment for those who get in early.

Providing a platform based on solid fundamentals, AVAX went on to gain a reputation for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and robust DeFi ecosystem. Facing stiff competition in the Layer 1 space has caused Avalanche to go above and beyond to remain competitive. AVAX is not only competitive, but is preparing for a historic rally. Avalanche currently sits at $43.56, far below its all time high of $146.22, which was reached back in November 2021. In the last month, AVAX has risen by a whopping 67%, and is still on the rise. But, Avalanche’s outlook remains optimistic, with predictions claiming AVAX could surge to $70 by the end of the year. Cardano: Claiming $1 price tag with a 200% increase on the monthly charts One of the larger blockchain platforms, Car dano, was one of the biggest winners this cycle. Seeing large attention, Cardano placed their main focus on scalability and sustainability. A top 10 cryptocurrency, ADA has made strides, but hasn’t made the pivot back to its all time high of $3.10 back in September 2021. Currently, Cardano is traded at above $1, experiencing a triple from its price of $0.30. ADA has stepped up to a 25% increase over the past seven days, slowing down slightly. Cardano could rally to $1.50 by the end of 2024, but more external factors would have to go ADA’s way to reach its previous highs. Conclusion While Avalanche prepares to rally over Cardano, the $2.5 million presale is leading the way. With the QuantumX wallet and AI-powered features, IntelMarkets has significant upside potential. At just $0.054, INTL tokens have yielded early investors with 500% gains already.

This dramatic climb defines broader market trends, with daily trading volume jumping over $18 billion with a rise of over 160%, signalling investor interest. A couple of key drivers have triggered the massive rally, attracting huge liquidity. Regulatory Optimism—Rumors of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s departure have fueled hopes for a more crypto-friendly approach. Ripple’s legal battle resolution could further bolster XRP. Institutional Confidance: Growing interest in XRP ETFs (like Bitwise’s rebranded Physical XRP ETP) indicates rising support from major investors. These external factors are expected to have a major impact over the XRP price rally, which could help the XRP price break new milestones. The token began to rise positively by separating from the general market. While many people claim huge price targets like $20 or $30 for XRP in the coming days, here’s why these possibilities are pretty low, as the token could reach a $2 trillion market cap, which appears to be pretty difficult considering the current market dynamics. The weekly chart of XRP shows the bulls are now poised to lift the price beyond the ATH at $3.84 in the coming days after rising above 2021 highs. The momentum of the rally remained in bullish favour since the beginning, which could intensify hereafter as the Gaussian channel just turned bullish since the second half of the month. However, the RSI raises some concerns, displaying the probability of a small pullback as it has reached the levels not attained since 2021 at around 89. Back in 2018, the RSI surged further to reach 95, which elevated the levels to a new ATH. Therefore, the price, which is trading between the pivotal range between $1.7 and $2.08 at 0.5 & 0.618 FIB resp, is expected to test the support before triggering a rise above the resistance. Once the bulls settle above the range, the price is expected to rise to 1 FIB at the highs and further maintain a strong rise to 1.2 FIB at $4.15, forming the peak of the prevailing bull run. However, an extended bull run may pave the way for higher targets at $5.2 and $6.4 as well. The growing fundamentals have also attracted major countries like India onto the platform. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s digital rupee is taking shape with Ripple’s XRP ledger. The growing confidence of the authorities, institutions, bulls, and mainly the market participants is expected to back the XRP price rally, which aims to form new highs in 2025.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-achieves-a-100b-market-cap-after-22-rise-in-just-a-few-hours-new-ath-at-5-is-loading/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

BONK and DOGE Fall","Elon MAGA could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA.

Yet, despite the challenges, the cryptocurrency has experienced an extraordinary surge in recent weeks. Since Donald Trump’s election win, XRP has rocketed by more than 273%. Is the rally here to stay, or are there warning signs ahead? Crypto analysts, including Maartunn , are urging caution. Let’s dive into the details and explore what’s driving XRP’s current momentum—and what could come next. XRP Outperforms the Market XRP, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has posted extraordinary gains. Over the past 30 days, it has surged by 262%, far exceeding the market average of 57%. In the last 24 hours, it jumped 21%—the highest among the top ten cryptocurrencies. By comparison, Bitcoin rose 0.6%, Ethereum 2.5%, and Solana 0.6%. Even Dogecoin, known for its volatility, gained only 4.1%. Caution, Investors! Maartunn, a prominent crypto analyst, warns that XRP’s rapid rise might be fueled by leveraged trading. He notes that similar scenarios in the past have led to significant market corrections, with drops of over 17%. Supporting this view, data shows that open interest in XRP futures has increased by 37%. This indicates heightened trading activity, which could amplify both gains and potential losses if investors start to close their positions. What’s Driving the XRP Price? A major factor driving XRP’s growth is Donald Trump’s recent election win . His presidency is seen as favorable for the crypto industry, boosting investor confidence. XRP has been a standout performer in this post-election rally. On November 5, XRP was trading at $0.50313. By November 16, it had surged to $1.11687, marking a significant gain in just over a week. Another major catalyst was the resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler , known for his tough stance on crypto, particularly against Ripple. Following this news on November 21, XRP jumped from $1.10064 to $1.24677. The next day, it hit a high of $1.47408. In the last four days, XRP has climbed over 35%, currently trading at $1.88521. Ripple’s Strategic Moves Ripple has also made key strategic moves, including investing in Bitwise’s XRP fund and launching its first tokenized money market fund on the XRP Ledger. These initiatives are designed to expand the XRP ecosystem and demonstrate Ripple’s confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. XRP’s recent surge is the result of favorable legal, political, and market developments. While the gains are impressive, analysts caution that the rally could face a correction if market dynamics shift. FAQs How much has XRP gained since Trump’s election win? XRP has increased by more than 273% since Trump’s election win, with notable gains in recent weeks. Why is XRP’s price surging recently? XRP’s surge is driven by Trump’s election win, SEC Chair Gensler’s resignation, and Ripple’s ecosystem-expanding initiatives.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-surges-262-in-30-days-is-a-correction-coming/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This collaboration introduces a dual-staking mechanism set to launch on December 2. The initiative allows users to stake SHIB tokens to earn SHIRO and vice versa, creating new opportunities for holders of both cryptocurrencies. The partnership has sparked interest due to its potential to enhance engagement within both communities. Shiba Inu’s Lead Developer Denies Involvement Following the announcement, concerns were raised by some community members regarding the legitimacy of the Shiro Neko project. Questions about transparency led Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, to address the issue. In response to a comment implying potential issues with the collaboration, Kusama clarified that he is not involved with Shiro Neko and requested that his name not be associated with the project. Dont @ me. I am not involved with Shiro. Tanks bunches. — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) November 28, 2024 Past Concerns About Shiro Neko Resurface Community concerns about Shiro Neko are not new. Last month, Susbarium, a community-managed scam awareness channel linked to Shiba Inu , warned the Shiba Inu community about the project. This warning came after Shiro Neko conducted a significant token burn, destroying 5.58 billion SHIB in a single transaction. Following the burn, Shiro Neko’s team sought a formal relationship with Shiba Inu, sparking skepticism about its motives. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Susbarium advised the community to be cautious, highlighting that projects using large token burns as promotional tactics should be carefully evaluated. Although the channel did not label Shiro Neko a scam, it recommended investors conduct thorough research before engaging with the token. Mixed Reactions from the Community While some community members view the dual-staking initiative as an innovative way to increase the asset’s utility, others remain wary due to the concerns raised. The timing of the partnership, given past warnings, has led to further scrutiny. Despite this, the collaboration is moving forward, with supporters hopeful it will contribute to the growth of both ecosystems. As the dual-staking launch date approaches, investors are urged to remain cautious and informed. Conducting due diligence remains crucial in ensuring safe participation in cryptocurrency investment.

Compared to Ethereum’s Uniswap (UNI) , Raydium’s volume is nearly double Uniswap’s $50 billion, making Raydium’s RAY one of the hottest new crypto tokens to hold. Thanks to the booming DeFi sector on Raydium , the price of RAY has surged over 67%, adding to its year-to-date uptick of 1365%. Uniswap’s UN I, on the other hand, is just starting to recover from a devastating drop of over 70% from its peak price of $44. Another new crypto DeFi project disrupting the market right now is Lunex Network . This DEX aggregator powered by institutional-grade liquidity is currently flying through its ICO with its LNEX utility token priced at $0.0033, Lunex has raised over $3.6 million. Lunex Network outshines legacy DEXs with its revolutionary new crypto Lunex is a new approach to DeFi, and expert analysts are already forecasting great upside potential for its token, LNEX. At its core, Lunex is a futuristic DEX and aggregator built on a speedy network that is capable of facilitating effortless cross-chain asset transfers. While most DEXs require the user to connect a DeFi wallet to swap tokens, all you need on Lunex is the receiving address of your non-custodial wallet, and you can trade across more than 50,000 currency pairs. That’s right, Lunex acts as a multi-chain bridge and swapping dApp that simplifies the process of swapping or trading tokens on a DEX. Its most revolutionary solution is its capacity to fetch deep liquidity across the Web3 landscape. Each trade is split across multiple chains to find the best price with zero slippage. Lunex also comes with a portfolio tracker that delivers accurate and up-to-date market intelligence to help with making data-driven decisions. With over $3.5 million worth of LNEX tokens sold so far, holders can enjoy additional perks such as the platform’s staking program. Raydium leads the charge as Solan’s DeFi ecosystem thrives Data from DeFi Llama shows that Solana’s DeFi ecosystem just surpassed a monthly trading volume of $100 billion, with Raydium leading the charge, given its 30-day trading volume of over $80 billion. That’s nearly double of Ethereum’s Uniswap volume of about $50 billion. Raydium thrives on the massive attention platforms such as Pump.fun has received amid a frenzy of new crypto meme coins that have taken the crypto space by storm. Can Raydium’s RAY surge past its previous ATH? Uniswap’s UNI starts to recover amid increasing bullish sentiment The price of Uniswap’s UNI has registered an uptick over the last 30 days of about 62% as bullish sentiment around Uniswap picks up speed. For the better part of 2024, UNI’ s price remained stagnant below the $15 resistance region, but a change in the tide is underway. Can Uniswap reclaim its position as a DeFi giant? Conclusion Raydium’s RAY and Uniswap’s UNI are soon going to be locked in a tight race for dominance in the DeFi space. RAY currently enjoys its position as a new crypto DEX token. However, Lunex’s LNEX could soon dethrone them both thanks to its deep liquidity and extensive range of useful features.

Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, played a central role in these transactions as a bridge currency. However, XRP has faced significant legal challenges in the US, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that it constitutes an unregistered security. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC, currently in the appeals phase, has kept XRP’s regulatory status in limbo. Despite these challenges, following Donald Trump’s recent election victory, the price of XRP rose to $1.90 on optimism that his administration will adopt crypto-friendly policies. XRP currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. *This is not investment advice.

37051833,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103416,1732946794,XRP Now Testing Huge Supply Zone as It Crosses $1.9; Analysts Identify Next Targets to Watch,"Market commentators have identified the next XRP target to look out for as the altcoin crosses pivotal levels amid a recent test of a huge supply zone. XRP is at the center of a remarkable market rally, showing strength in the ongoing uptrend. Its price has surged by 31% over the past week and an astounding 271% in November, making it one of the biggest gainers in the ongoing post-election rally.XRP Retests Key Supply ZoneMost recently, Blake, a stock market analyst, discussed XRP’s immense potential. He shared a 1-week chart which highlights XRP’s current position as it tests a seven-year supply zone.According to Blake, this supply zone ranges between $1.75 to $1.95. For context, XRP entered this territory during the latest recovery phase, which began on Nov. 27. Before this rebound, XRP witnessed a four-day collapse, dropping 13% to $1.2821 on Nov. 26.However, with the recent recovery, XRP has recouped these lost values. It is now up 36% since Nov. 27, having recently surpassed Binance Coin (BNB) to become the fifth-largest crypto asset. Amid the uptrend, XRP surpassed the $1.75 mark, and is now testing $1.90. XRP 1W Chart | Blake Interestingly, it is now within the upper end of Blake’s supply zone, and a breakout could occur if it clears the $1.95 roadblock . This zone has acted as a major resistance area, notably during the 2018 and 2021 bull runs. The current test of this zone is especially pivotal. Blake believes if XRP successfully closes this week above $1.95, this could open the doors to the next major target at $2.50. However, the market analyst advises investors to be cautious. Notably, XRP’s weekly RSI has spiked to 88, suggesting an overbought condition. He noted that for long-term holders, this level may be an opportune moment to take partial profits or adjust stop-loss positions.A Potential Breakout Beyond $2 Meanwhile, in a separate analysis, Chad Steingraber, a pro game designer, compared XRP’s current rally to its 2017 breakout. His chart shows XRP is up 271% this November, similar to the 284% rally in March 2017, which marked the start of the 2017/2018 bull run. https://twitter.com/ChadSteingraber/status/1862652372431814769Interestingly, after spiking 284% in March 2017, XRP rallied by an additional 143% the next month and saw a more substantial 374% gain in May 2017. It consolidated for six months following the May 2017 upsurge, before eventually gaining 746% in December 2017 to claim the $3.3 all-time high.The altcoin could be looking to replicate this 2017/2018 run. Steingraber emphasized the importance of the $2 level . He suggested that breaching this threshold could trigger unprecedented bullish momentum. At press time, XRP trades for $1.89, up 21% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP | BNB,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/30/xrp-now-testing-huge-supply-zone-as-it-crosses-1-9-analysts-identify-next-targets-to-watch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-now-testing-huge-supply-zone-as-it-crosses-1-9-analysts-identify-next-targets-to-watch,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37034672,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51032,1732946682,1 Billion SHIB Within An Hour. Here’s What This Means to SHIB Price,"The Shiba Inu community has set a remarkable milestone by removing over 1.2 billion SHIB tokens from circulation within a day as 1 billion of this portion were burned within an hour. This significant development was reported by Shibburn, a blockchain tracker focused on SHIB burns. During this large-scale burn, SHIB’s price has shown signs of recovery, rising to $0.00002606 after a decline at this level earlier in the week. Shibburn reports that the burn rate for SHIB has surged by 2,050% in the last 24 hours. A total of 1,282,587,181 SHIB was transferred to dead wallets, effectively removing them from circulation. The most notable contribution came from a single anonymous wallet, which burned an astounding 1,003,266,585 SHIB in a single transaction. Additional burns included transfers of 209,312,491, 33,737,678, and 29,282,316 SHIB, spread across 14 transactions. This increase in burn activity suggests a coordinated effort to reduce the circulating supply, potentially boosting the token’s scarcity and value. Shytoshi Kusama’s Ambitious Vision Shytoshi Kusama , the enigmatic lead developer of Shiba Inu, has recently reiterated his goal of elevating the asset to the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. In a recent tweet, Kusama emphasized the challenges of enhancing the utility of a meme-based cryptocurrency without a large budget, sharing an AI-generated image depicting a chaotic yet determined effort to achieve this vision. Kusama described the image as a metaphor for the journey to transform SHIB from its current rank of 14th on CoinMarketCap to a top-five position. In another tweet, he confirmed that this ambitious goal is firmly focused on Shiba Inu (SHIB). Kusama’s vision underscores the aspiration of the community to secure a prominent place among the leading digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Shiba Inu (SHIB) Market Position At the time of press, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holds the 14th position on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of approximately $15.42 billion. The recent surge in burn activity has coincided with a modest price increase, as the token trades at $0.00002616. If the current burn momentum and market interest persist, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could rise further. However, its path to becoming a top-five cryptocurrency remains challenging, requiring continued innovation and community engagement. The recent burns highlight the community’s commitment to reducing supply and adding value. Whether these efforts will propel the asset to new heights remains to be seen, but the dedication of its developers and community suggests that the journey is far from over.

37081122,https://invezz.com/?p=2321276,1732946543,Filecoin price analysis as crypto experts predict FIL to hit $30,"Filecoin price has staged some recovery this year, even as it continued to underperform the broader crypto market. FIL, the storage-focused token, was trading at $7, up by 142% from its lowest point this year. It remains significantly below the year-to-date high of $11.85 and its all-time high of $237. Crypto pros believe Filecoin price could surge to $30 One crypto expert, known as World of Charts, believes that the coin could surge to $30 in the ongoing bull run. If this was to happen, it would imply a 335% increase from the current level. The analyst cited the fact that the FIL price has formed a symmetrical and horizontal resistance on the weekly chart.

In a post, Shardi B noted that, Filecoin’s chart looked great if you zoomed out on longer-term charts. He believes that the coin has moved into an accumulation phase and that it would stage a strong comeback. Shidan Gouran, another analyst, noted that the coin would need to get to $26 to hit its all-time market cap of over $15 billion. He cited its underperformance as the result of the massive dilution in the past few years. Now, however, he expects the coin to get to between $25 and $40 because the supply cap is about to be achieved. He also expects that Filecoin’s adoption as a file storage alternative will help to boost its adoption.

The inflation rate for filecoin has been very high.The good news is that $FIL is close to its supply cap and won’t have… 5:08 AM · Dec 1, 2024 9 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter FIL price analysis: can Filecoin really surge? The weekly chart shows that the FIL price has made a bullish breakout in the past few weeks. This rebound happened after the coin formed a double-bottom chart pattern at $3.23. In most periods, this is one of the highly bullish reversal patterns. A double-bottom pattern happens when an asset fails to drop below a crucial point two times. In this case, it failed to drop below $3.25 in August 2023 and 2024. Filecoin’s neckline of this pattern was at $11.80, its highest level in March 2024. It has also moved above the 50-week moving average. Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic have all pointed upwards. Therefore, there are rising odds that the Filecoin price will continue rising in the coming months. If this happens, the next target to watch will be at $11.80. A blast above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $20. On the flip side, a drop below the support at $5 will point to more downside, with the next level to watch being at $3.20. Filecoin’s fundamentals Filecoin price rebound could be supported by its strong fundamentals. Data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi ecosystem has jumped to a record high of over $104 million. The biggest players in the Filecoin ecosystem are GLIF, Parasail, STFIL, and SFT Protocol. This growth is notable since Filecoin launched its virtual machine just a year ago. Filecoin has also expanded its business in other industries that analysts expect will continue doing well. In addition to the basic file storage, the developers launched cloud computing features similar to those offered by the likes of Amazon and AWS. These solutions include Kubernetes and containers. Therefore, this growth, coupled with the ongoing demand for artificial intelligence will likely lead to more demand for the Filecoin ecosystem. The other catalyst for the FIL price will be the ongoing cryptocurrency surge. In particular, its price will be boosted if Bitcoin rises above $100,000, leading to more demand for altcoins.

37051832,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103414,1732946469,Ripple Stablecoin Potential Launch Date Revealed,"Ripple’s stablecoin is gearing up for its highly anticipated mainnet launch, with FOX Business revealing its potential launch date. FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the New York Department of Financial Service (NYDFS) had signaled its intention to approve RLUSD for its mainnet launch. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the journalist claimed that the San Francisco-based company is targeting December 4 for the mainnet launch of the stablecoin. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1862603679284572610Recall that Ripple introduced RLUSD in April 2024 and proceeded with its beta launch in August, rolling out the stablecoin on XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum. Ever since, the stablecoin has been in beta, with no precise date for a mainnet launch. The wait for RLUSD’s mainnet launch might end soon, as sources claim Ripple is eyeing December 4 as the possible launch date following NYDFS’ approval. At press time, neither Ripple nor NYDFS has issued an official statement backing this claim. RLUSD Use Case For context, Ripple focuses on leveraging blockchain technology to offer faster and cheaper cross-border settlements for financial institutions. Interestingly, the company uses XRPL’s native token, XRP, as a bridge currency between two fiats to settle these transactions. However, the token is embroiled in an intense legal battle between the U.S. SEC and Ripple. Even though a federal court declared XRP a non-security, the continuation of the case in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit still puts the token under regulatory scrutiny. The anticipated launch of RLUSD could serve as an alternative to XRP across Ripple’s payment solutions. Financial institutions seeking to utilize Ripple’s payment solution without exposure to regulatory uncertainty and volatility can choose RLUSD instead of XRP. Furthermore, customers can also adopt the stablecoin as a store of value upon its mainnet launch. Once approved, RLUSD would strive to dominate the stablecoin market, valued at $190 billion, rivaling top players like Tether and Circle. Ripple Navigates NYDFS Strict Regulation In the absence of stablecoin regulation at the federal level, Ripple pursued regulatory approval for RLUSD through the state level. The NYDFS adopts a strict approach to regulating cryptos, including stablecoins. Companies seeking to launch stablecoins within its jurisdiction must meet certain conditions, including obtaining a limited-purpose trust charter. Ripple already met this requirement by acquiring the NYDFS-regulated entity Standard Custody & Trust Company in June. This move also helped to accelerate NYDFS’ approval of the stablecoin, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Upon approval, Standard Custody will issue RLUSD to the stablecoin’s exchange partners , including Moonpay and Uphold.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/30/ripple-stablecoin-potential-launch-date-revealed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-stablecoin-potential-launch-date-revealed,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37033583,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655607,1732946452,Shiba Inu Could Increase 75% If It Holds Current Level – Analyst Shares Price Target,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is capturing market attention as it consolidates at a critical level following an impressive 80% rally from recent lows. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience, and its current price action suggests a potential breakout at an aggressive pace if it can push above key resistance levels. Top analyst InvestingHaven recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting SHIB’s bullish potential for 2024. According to the analysis, Shiba Inu is currently holding strong at a critical Fibonacci retracement level, a signal that aligns with its positive trajectory for the year. This level is pivotal for SHIB, as breaking above it could pave the way for even higher price targets. As SHIB consolidates, investors and traders closely monitor its movements for signs of the next major move. The bullish outlook for 2024 has sparked renewed confidence in the asset, with InvestingHaven’s analysis setting ambitious targets for SHIB in the coming months. The market is now focused on whether Shiba Inu can maintain its momentum and deliver on its potential for further gains. With key support holding firm, SHIB’s next steps could determine its trajectory for the rest of the year. Shiba Inu Waking Up Shiba Inu is making waves as meme coins continue delivering massive returns in recent weeks. Following an explosive 80% rally, SHIB retraced 25% in under three weeks but has shown resilience as buyers maintain momentum. The cryptocurrency remains in focus as investors anticipate its next move amid bullish sentiment across the market. Top analyst and investor InvestingHaven shared a detailed technical analysis on X , highlighting SHIB’s strong prospects for 2024. According to the analysis, Shiba Inu is consolidating at a critical Fibonacci level, which aligns with its bullish targets for the upcoming year. The recent rebound from $0.0000158 has strengthened market sentiment, solidifying SHIB’s support zone. Key Fibonacci levels indicate potential targets of $0.0000444, with a more ambitious stretch target of $0.0000555 by 2024. The next few days will determine whether SHIB can break above the $0.000026 resistance level. A successful breakout could continue its upward trajectory, driving SHIB toward its higher targets. However, failure to hold its current levels might lead to further consolidation. SHIB Testing Crucial Supply Shiba Inu is trading at $0.0000258 after several days of volatile price action and market indecision. The price has fluctuated within a tight range, finding support near $0.000023 and facing resistance at $0.000028. This consolidation phase has kept traders on edge as they await a decisive breakout. If SHIB breaks above the critical $0.000026 resistance level, it could build the momentum needed to challenge the $0.000028 local high. A successful push above this level would likely signal the start of a more aggressive upward move, targeting the yearly highs at $0.000045. This level represents a significant milestone for SHIB, aligning with key technical and psychological factors that could further bolster its bullish trajectory. On the other hand, failure to break above these resistance levels might result in continued sideways trading or even a pullback toward the lower end of the range. The next few trading sessions will be crucial as market participants closely watch whether SHIB can sustain its bullish momentum and overcome these barriers.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

He advises accumulating 10,000 XRP tokens before 2025, warning that those who fail to do so may miss out on significant future opportunities. Ripple’s Role in Global Finance In a recent analysis, Crypto Sensei highlighted the growing trust central banks place in Ripple’s technology. He explained that Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure positions XRP as a key player in the future of digital currencies, particularly central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Doyle emphasized that the token has maintained a leading position in blockchain innovation over the past decade, stating that its continued development and central bank partnerships are critical to its future success. According to Doyle, the asset offers advantages over stablecoins when settling international transactions. He said although stablecoins could offer price stability, they lack the decentralization and global liquidity XRP provides. He states that central banks need a cryptocurrency that can settle transactions instantly, highlighting the token as the one to fill the role. He believes the token’s technology could make it a central component in the tokenization of assets and the settlement of global trade flows. XRP Potential Value The analyst believes that as global financial institutions increasingly rely on the asset for cross-border payments, its value could reach between $100 and $9,999 per token. “If XRP becomes the hub for a lot of the world’s trade, you’re talking about an XRP value in the high three to four digits,” he suggested. Currently, the token is trading at $1.74, following a recent price increase of over 17% in the last day. Based on Doyle’s projections, those holding 10,000 XRP tokens today could see their holdings grow to between $1 million and $100 million if his high-end price predictions come true.

Critics point out that his projections are speculative and not guaranteed. Other analysts have expressed doubt that the token could reach anywhere near the $100 to $9,999 range within the next few years. They caution investors to consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and to be wary of overly optimistic predictions.

Marcus’ revelations come in the wake of venture capitalist Marc Andreessen’s discussion of Libra on the Joe Rogan Experience , prompting him to shed light on what transpired behind the scenes. Launched with high ambitions in June 2019, Libra aimed to create a blockchain-based, stablecoin-powered global payments system that could tackle inefficiencies in cross-border payments. Backed by 28 companies at launch, the project faced immediate scrutiny, with Marcus testifying before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee just weeks after its announcement. Marcus said the two years following Libra’s unveiling were marked by an exhaustive effort to address regulatory concerns related to financial crime, money laundering, and consumer protection. By early 2021, Marcus claimed, Libra ( later renamed Diem ) had secured a green light from some members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors for a limited pilot rollout. How Libra Was Killed. I never shared this publicly before, but since @pmarca opened the floodgates on @joerogan ’s pod, it feels appropriate to shed more light on this. As a reminder, Libra (then Diem) was an advanced, high-performance, payments-centric blockchain paired with a… — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) November 30, 2024 Janet Yellen Allegedly Warned Fed Chair Supporting Libra Would be “Political Suicide” Marcus in an X post alleges that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen intervened at a critical juncture, warning Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that supporting Libra’s launch would amount to “political suicide.” Although not directly confirmed, Marcus cited this alleged exchange as the moment the project was effectively doomed. Shortly afterward, the Federal Reserve reportedly issued a veiled warning to banks participating in Libra, discouraging them from moving forward. Marcus characterized Libra’s demise as a politically motivated move rather than one grounded in regulatory or legal concerns, calling it “a tough pill to swallow” given his faith in America’s rule of law. Reflecting on the project’s collapse, Marcus highlighted lessons learned, emphasizing the need for future initiatives to be built on decentralized and neutral networks like Bitcoin. “If you’re trying to build an open money grid for the world,” Marcus wrote, “you have to build it on the most unassailable network and asset.” The post Janet Yellen’s Warning to Fed Chair Killed Meta’s Crypto Project, Says David Marcus appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/janet-yellens-warning-to-fed-chair-killed-metas-crypto-project/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37039845.jpeg
37032597,https://timestabloid.com/?p=50973,1732944651,Ethereum vs. Solana: Could Rollblock Be the Dark Horse in the Battle?,"The battle between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) dates back to 2020, when Solana was launched as an Ethereum killer . Today, the Ethereum vs Solana battle continues as both altcoins rank as the top performing cryptos to invest in. The Ethereum price has risen by about 37% in the past month, while the Solana price has soared by nearly 32%, causing speculation that another altcoin season is coming. However, Rollblock has surged by over 200% during its presale, causing investors to tip it as the top performing crypto to invest in right now. The new casino token has also raised over $6.2 million during its initial coin offering (ICO). But why is Rollblock causing so much FOMO among ETH and SOL investors ? Let’s find out. Ethereum crosses $3,600: Aims for new support at $4,000 Following the recent fall in the Bitcoin price, investors have shifted their attention to altcoins. As a result, the Ethereum price has experienced an upturn, increasing by approximately 37% within the last 30 days. On November 28, Ethereum crossed the $3,600 price point for the first time in 2024, causing optimistic conversations about a new altcoin season being in the offing. However, the rise in the Ethereum price in November has shown mixed feelings. Ethereum remains the second-worst performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, causing doubts about its ability to sustain the recent bullish trend. Solana remains one of the best-performing altcoins Solana has been a top performing crypto throughout 2024. The token has surged by over 330% in the past year, while Ethereum has only moved up by about 80%. SOL has overshadowed ETH in this battle of altcoins – thanks to its massively growing meme coin ecosystem, which has been attracting investors. Moreover, more developers are switching to Solana because of its faster throughput and lower fees. The Solana community has also given the blockchain and its token a massive boost as one of the best for investors, traders, and developers. The SOL price has reached about $240 at the time of writing, with optimistic Solana price predictions of $1,000 for 2025. Rollblock outperforms ETH and SOL during its presale Rollblock is in a world of its own, showing investors why its revolutionary GambleFi platform is the next big thing. The Rollblock (RBLK) token powers the Rollblock Casino ecosystem, incentivizing players and investors in various ways. One of the standout features of the casino is its reward system. The online gaming site has a unique revenue-sharing program that rewards RBLK token holders with a share of its weekly profits. These investors also get the opportunity to stake their tokens for up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY). On the player side, there are VIP bonuses for them and presale token holders to earn additional RBLK tokens based on their total holdings. They also get access to thousands of casino games that they can wager on for real money winnings. These, in addition to the daily, weekly, and monthly rakeback rewards, make Rollblock an exciting platform for their gambling needs. Conclusion The Rollblock presale is ongoing, allowing interested investors to key into the project. Investors can lock in the top performing crypto at $0.037 per unit in stage 8 before it increases to $0.041 in stage 9. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

They’ve got the kind of energy that turns internet jokes into billion-dollar sensations. From Dogecoin’s rocket-fuelled ride to Shiba Inus cult status, these coins have a way of grabbing headlines and making wallets dance. And guess what? This week, the spotlight shining on three standout contenders: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Book of Meme. Trust me, they’re not just making noise—they’re shaking things up! BTFD Coin’s presale is burning hot, roaring through its early stages like a meme-fuelled wildfire, while Moo Deng’s viral baby hippo charm is turning heads and winning hearts. And then there’s Book of Meme, the creative playground that’s giving meme lovers a platform to shine. Whether you’re here for the hype or the potential profits, these coins are proving that meme magic is alive and thriving. So, buckle up—it’s gonna be a wild ride! BTFD Coin: The Meme King in the Making BTFD Coin’s presale is already the talk of the crypto town, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now at $0.00005 in Stage 5, with the final listing price set at $0.0006. This meteoric price trajectory underscores its potential as the best meme coin to add right now. Its first day saw over $150,000 raised, and the tally has soared past $295,000, with 10 billion coins snapped up by eager investors. But it’s not just the presale numbers that are making waves. BTFD’s value proposition is packed with appeal: a play-to-earn (P2E) game that hooks gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, staking rewards that let holders earn passive income, and a vibrant, ever-growing community that’s ready to rally for the coin’s success. Imagine putting in $4,000 at Stage 5’s price of $0.00005 per coin—you’d snag 80 million BTFD coins. By the time it hits $0.0006 , your initial $4,000 investment would balloon to a whopping $48,000. That’s the kind of ROI dreams are made of. BTFD’s presale is slated to have 16 stages, which means there’s still room to hop on this rocket ship. With its robust roadmap, it’s no wonder analysts are calling it the best meme coin to add right now. Will you be part of its success story? Moo Deng: Viral Baby Hippo Meets Blockchain Moo Deng (MOODENG) is rewriting the memecoin playbook by blending internet culture with blockchain innovation. Inspired by a viral baby hippo from a Thai zoo, this Solana-based token has gained massive traction for its unique concept and widespread appeal. It’s more than just a coin—it’s a cultural movement. After reaching an all-time high of $0.69, Moo Deng’s price is expected to consolidate before potentially hitting $1.51 by 2026, according to analysts. Its charm lies in its connection to a real-world mascot, adding a layer of relatability and fun that many other meme coins lack. Let’s face it—who wouldn’t want to back a coin inspired by an adorable hippo? Moo Deng’s roadmap includes exciting community events, collaborations, and even plans to integrate with charitable initiatives that align with its mascot’s backstory. This gives it a heartwarming edge in a space often dominated by hype and speculation. While it may not have the blazing presale performance of BTFD Coin, Moo Deng is carving out its own niche, making it a standout in the meme coin space. For investors, the token’s solid community backing and innovative plans make it a promising addition to any portfolio. But if you’re looking for the best meme coin to add right now, BTFD’s presale might still edge out Moo Deng in terms of immediate ROI. Book of Meme: Creativity Meets Crypto Book of Meme is in a league of its own. This project taps into the viral nature of memes while creating a platform for users to unleash their creativity. With features that allow meme lovers to create, share, and earn rewards for their contributions, Book of Meme is turning the meme coin space into a creative playground. Its presale has been structured to incentivise early adopters with bonuses and exclusive features, making it an attractive option for investors who want to get in on the ground floor. The developers host regular events and interactive sessions to engage the community, fostering organic growth through word-of-mouth and grassroots support. Analysts predict significant appreciation for Book of Meme as it continues to gain traction among meme enthusiasts. Its focus on creativity and community makes it a compelling choice for anyone looking to combine fun with potential profits. While it’s not competing head-to-head with BTFD’s explosive presale or Moo Deng’s viral appeal, Book of Meme stands out as a project with long-term potential and a strong sense of purpose. For those wondering if it’s the best meme coin to add right now, Book of Meme offers a unique angle. But if immediate gains are your priority, BTFD Coin’s presale is still the showstopper. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Showdown Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the memecoin space is buzzing with potential. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support make it the best meme coin to add right now . Moo Deng’s unique connection to a viral mascot gives it undeniable charm and long-term appeal, while Book of Meme’s focus on creativity and community adds a fresh dimension to the space.

The growth accounts for 63%, leaving holders enthusiastic about its future. Hyperliquid held the largest airdrop in the DeFi protocol on November 29, giving out 310 million HYPE tokens to the community. The coin’s current market cap is nearly $2.2B. HYPE token supply plan is scheduled up to 2028 Hyperliquid, a layer one blockchain based on PoS consensus, can process up to 200,000 transactions per second. The token is critical to the ecosystem as it works as the staking asset and gas token for its Ethereum Virtual Machine Compatible Layer, HyperEVM. According to the protocol, Hyperliquid supplied 31% of its $1 billion tokens on its first airdrop. They reserved 38.8% for future emissions and community rewards, 6% went to the Hyper Foundation treasury, and 0.3% was directed to grants. According to the plans, core contributors will have 23.8% of the total supply during the first-year lock period, while the schedules will run beyond 2028. It didn’t reserve allocations for CEX, private investors, or market influencers. This airdrop is among the largest in De-Fi history So far, this airdrop is among the most historic on the DeFi protocol. In September 2020, another considerable airdrop was made by Uniswap. Uniswap’s airdrop distributed 400 UNI tokens each, to more than a quarter million addresses. By then, each token was about $3.40, which equaled almost $1,300 per recipient. Several users rushed to cash out their tokens after the airdrop, which worked in favor of the holders. The value of Uniswap rose to over $42 just a few months after the airdrop. The Arbitum protocol also had a memorable airdrop in 2023. It distributed its native token, Arbitrum, to 625,000 active wallets for a market value of $1.30 each, for a total of $812,500. Airdrop is not a new concept in the crypto space. In most cases, new or existing tokens are distributed for free to several users. The reasons for airdrops vary from promoting new tokens to giving incentives to early adopters. So far, data from CoinGecko indicates crypto tokens worth $26.6 billion have been distributed to users through airdrops.

37051831,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103408,1732944245,XRP Eyes Run to ATH as Historic Golden Cross Nears Amid Spike Above $1.8,"XRP is on the brink of engineering a run to a new all-time high as it looks to record a historic golden cross amid the recent rally. The market has embarked on a recovery campaign, and XRP appears to be leveraging this push better than most. For instance, XRP has gained by an impressive 16.5% over the past 24 hours, making it the biggest gainer among the top 70 assets and third biggest on the top 100 list.XRP Eyes Golden CrossThis short-term bullish momentum has triggered a rapid spike in its short moving averages (MAs), leading to an impending golden cross on the weekly timeframe. Notably, a golden cross occurs when a shorter moving average (especially the 50-period MA) rises above a longer moving average (especially the 200-period MA).This phenomenon indicates that the asset’s short-term momentum has flipped massively bullish, enveloping its longer-term momentum. Interestingly, the occurrence of a golden cross typically signals that the bullish push could linger, possibly leading to greater price heights.XRP has gained 62% over the last two weeks, solidifying its bullish short-term outlook. The asset recently flipped Binance Coin (BNB) to become the fifth-largest crypto asset globally and has also reclaimed a $100 billion market cap amid the latest run. XRP Impending Weekly Golden Cross XRP Impending Weekly Golden Cross This push has triggered a rise in the 50-week MA (orange), which now sits at $0.6020. At press time, the 50-week MA is on the verge of overcoming the 200-week MA (green) at $0.6299. If this occurs, the golden cross will have materialized, setting the stage for more explosive surge.Notably, this weekly golden cross has only occurred once since XRP launched, particularly during the 2021 rally. The phenomenon resulted in a rally that saw XRP reclaim previous highs in early 2021, but the prevalent SEC lawsuit at the time capped higher gains.A Possible Price ExplosionXRP’s regulatory clarity and the favorable political developments in the United States could allow it to set its sights on the 2018 peak around $3.31 once this golden cross occurs. Interestingly, XRP has now reclaimed the $1.8 region, changing hands at $1.81 at press time.From this level, its next resistance sits at $1.88, which, if breached, would lead to $1.96, the 2021 peak. Veteran analyst Peter Brandt argued in a previous analysis that breaking above $1.96 could set the stage for an explosive run. In this case, XRP could target highs above the $2 psychological level.Two days ago, market analyst Flowseidon shared a chart showing XRP consolidation near $1.50 after a strong rally, with higher lows and a flat resistance level forming an ascending triangle. XRP 1D Chart | Flowseidon The price and moving averages indicated a tightening structure which highlighted declining volatility. This structure typically leads to massive breakout.

37051830,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103394,1732943265,Expert Predicts Dogecoin to $14 but Says DOGE Will Test Your Patience,"Technical analyst Ali Martinez has reminded market participants that while Dogecoin (DOGE) has promising prospects, the asset will test their patience on its path to higher price levels. Martinez issued this warning in a Friday post on X, highlighting a fresh bearish signal on Dogecoin’s short-term price action. He noted that the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a sell signal for Dogecoin. This is coming at a time when the asset has only recently rebounded from a 23% dip.Today, Dogecoin traded at $0.4200 after a 4% gain. The sell signal suggests the recently reclaimed $0.40 region could be lost again due to another incoming correction.While this projected outcome could hurt those who entered the Dogecoin market at the top, Martinez reminded investors that these dips are normal and part of the journey toward unprecedented price territories. In the end, those who remain patient during downturns stand to be rewarded.Historical Instances Where Dogecoin Rewarded Investors After Testing Their PatienceMartinez cited specific instances in Dogecoin’s history where major dips preceded the asset’s periodic parabolic runs. For example, during the 2016/2017 cycle, Dogecoin experienced two major dips: a 39% and a massive 84% price drop. However, by the end of the cycle, Dogecoin’s total gains amounted to over 9,400%.Similarly, in the 2020/2021 season, Dogecoin saw 56% and 53% corrections in its journey to an all-time high. However, its cumulative rise by the end of the season was around 31,000%. Dogecoin Historical patterns Now, Martinez has highlighted the possibility of Dogecoin soaring by 3,233% from its current position. An upsurge which could allow it to hit a new peak of $14. However, this target is overly ambitious, as it would lead to a DOGE market cap above $2 trillion, exceeding Bitcoin's current valuation. Notably, this price prediction suggests Dogecoin could mirror its historical patterns within an ascending price channel. Chart showing Dogecoin $14 price forecast Other Factors Suggesting a Double-Digit Price for DOGEOther market watchers have argued for similar targets for Dogecoin using different tools to observe its historical patterns. For instance, analyst Trader Tardigrade has pointed out that DOGE is currently testing the mid-band of the Gaussian channel, suggesting a potential rally toward $11, as seen in past surges in 2017 and 2020.Meanwhile, based on Fibonacci retracement levels, Martinez has suggested Dogecoin could rally to $23 , which would be consistent with the 2.272 Fibonacci level at which Dogecoin peaked during the 2020/2021 bull run.Conservative Outlook for DogecoinWhile these are ambitious price forecasts for Dogecoin, some analysts have issued more conservative outlooks for the asset. For instance, analysts Crypto Scolfeild and Ash Crypto have argued that Dogecoin could peak at $3 during this season, with Ash noting that the meme coin might reach this price level within the next six to twelve months.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/30/expert-predicts-dogecoin-to-14-but-says-doge-will-test-your-patience/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-predicts-dogecoin-to-14-but-says-doge-will-test-your-patience,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, “community feedback and input” plays an important role in decisions related to which cryptocurrency to list. In a Cointelegraph interview at Aus Crypto Con 2024, Rachel Conlan said that the team responsible for listings thoroughly reviews information regarding the founders behind the project, its key individuals involved, and its potential plans. This becomes necessary with the rise in the popularity of memecoins. Crypto exchanges have an increased responsibility to filter out any suspicious projects for the protection of the users. Moreover, Conlan said there is nothing “guaranteed” about what sets a project apart to be selected for listing on Binance. On the other hand, she also shared that the “secret research team” considers “a few different factors,” like community feedback and input, including community trends and insights regarding the project. She added that these factors “are definitely important.” Memecoins with real use cases are the priority for Binance Binance CMO added that memecoins have a lot of negative coverage because of no utility. However, “there are up-and-coming memecoins that have that utility built-in”. It is the only functional requirement, explained Conlan: What we should be talking about more is the innovation that’s going to come out, like the innovation that’s been prepped in this bear cycle. What people are building. ~ Rachel Conlan Conlan believes that the crypto industry will grow significantly in the coming 18 to 24 months. This automatically suggests that projects with real use cases should be preferred. Building consumer trust is also a priority for Binance In another interview before the Aus Crypto Con, Conlan remarked that Binance was the “healthiest” it had ever been, adding almost 60 million users since 2024’s start. She also explained how the crypto industry had been heavily affected by low consumer trust, stating that Binance’s goal moving forward is to build “stronger trust”. She insisted that growing misconceptions and miseducation have primarily contributed to the dwindling trust in crypto products, adding that Binance will prioritize educating more users to debunk any crypto misconceptions that could lower crypto trust. However, she did argue that consumer trust in Binance was comparatively higher than others in the industry, noting that the platform had earned itself different types of users, including super-sophisticated traders, casual day traders, and even those investing as part of their diversification strategy.

Beyond entertainment, GalaChain plays a key role in NFTs and memes, with Fuzzle and $WEN as frontliners. New developments and clever Innovations with real-life use cases that provide relatable solutions are emerging more frequently, making the Gala community one of the most innovative in the ecosystem. GalaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain developed by Gala to serve as a backbone for everything entertainment, including games, music, and film. It’s powered by a network of Founder’s and designed with a clear objective to cater to the demands of Web2 gaming while adding Web3 functions and extending unique features to other industries. The design philosophy behind the GalaChain is quite simple: it’s designed to seamlessly handle the intensive requirements of gaming with the ability to accommodate virtually any allocation or industry need. This has become the distinctive factor of GalaChain, making it the go-to for the tech demands of multiple platforms. Fuzzle Innovates On GalaChain The Gala community breeds innovators with ambitions to create the next big solutions and projects. The latest is Fuzzle launching its groundbreaking Web3 platform designed to fuel creativity and problem solving. An innovative platform that equips users with powerful AI tools to tackle a wide array of work challenges. The platform will automate the creation of videos, GIFs, articles, and comprehensive content campaigns tailored to individual needs and transform ideas into large-scale results with ease. Backed by the Fuzzle Prime DAO and six founder nodes, Fuzzle ensures robust support, security, and community-driven innovation. According to Gingerbreadman, the name behind Fuzzle, “the platform will give users powerful AI tools to handle all kinds of work challenges.” GingerbreadMan also won the block explorer bounty of 1 million $GALA for building the best-voted GalaChain block explorer, now known as GalaScan. $WEN takes Memes to New Heights on GalaChain While new memes on Solana look to steal the spotlight in recent times, $WEN has already taken centre stage preceding the current trend of meme sensation. The $WEN was created by a community member known as Lukabylie, who owns the platform galacoins.zyz. GalaCoins is a community developed site that covers different tokens in the GalaChain ecosystem. Recently launched on GalaChain, the token experienced a significant surge, reaching a market cap of $1 million within just a few weeks of its introduction. Token surges of this fashion only highlight a thriving community and underscore the health of the GalaChain ecosystem. Here’s what Lukabylie has to say about it all: “I got involved with Gala in 2021, I thought the in-game item ownership was a brilliant idea. A few years later I started playing Spider Tanks and on several occasions I wanted to analyze game data, which was available on the blockchain. When Gala came out with the Token creation Tool, I leveraged all of this into $WEN, a gamified token designed to belong to the community. It involved a reward mechanism for trading & holding & live trading data available to everyone. Over time tried to add more utility to the token by creating Galacoins.xyz, a platform designed to visualize data from Galaswap and empower other token creators”. $WEN creation came at the backdrop of a popular joke about delays. Since its creation, it has evolved to offer utility features, which include exclusive access to functionalities on galacoins.xyz. Unlike traditional meme coins that lack inherent value beyond speculative trading, $WEN offers its holders a form of fractional ownership, enabling individuals to win a fraction of valuable digital assets. The unique difference of $WEN compared to other meme coins points to the level of innovative ideas within the GalaChain ecosystem. The GalaChain Community Most successful projects and tokens in the blockchain industry are usually driven by a strong community. The GalaChain Community is exemplary not just for backing community-led innovations but for creating them. The rise of $WEN can be attributed to the active engagement of the community, while the sheer brilliance behind Fuzzle pays credence to elite builders and innovators within the ecosystem. As GalaChain evolves, so does the community. Together, a future of decentralized innovation is being built.",POSITIVE,GALA,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | GALA,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meet-the-galachain-builders/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB.

This restriction targets “tokens denominated in foreign currencies” to ensure compliance with Brazilian financial regulations. The BCB gains crypto oversight under the 2022 law and sets new regulations BCB commented on the development; “The initiative reflects our commitment to adapting the financial system to the realities of digital assets while safeguarding the integrity of international capital flows.” – BCB This proposal enables the BCB to oversee the crypto industry as part of the December 2022 crypto law . Stakeholders can submit feedback on the proposal by February 28, 2025. Despite public opinions, the BCB is responsible for enforcing crypto laws. Additionally, crypto investments, whether inbound or outbound, would be subject to the same regulatory standards as traditional investments. External credit, direct foreign investment, and Brazilian capital abroad involving crypto would require adherence to existing international capital regulations.

Here’s What Robert Kiyosaki Believes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin crossing $100,000? It sounds wild, but that’s exactly what Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is saying. He believes Bitcoin’s price is about to shoot up, and once it does, it could be too expensive for the average person to get in on. But is this for real? Let’s dive into what Kiyosaki is predicting and what’s actually going on with the first crypto right now. Kiyosaki Thinks FOMO Will Drive Bitcoin’s Surge Kiyosaki thinks the next big wave of Bitcoin buying will come from a simple feeling: FOMO—Fear of Missing Out. He says as BTC moves closer to $100,000, more people are going to jump in before they miss their chance. But here’s the catch: once the largest crypto hits that $100K mark, it might be hard for regular investors to afford much of it. That’s because only the super-rich will be able to grab big chunks. THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER? A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad “Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Kiyosaki also doesn’t trust traditional currencies like the dollar or euro. He argues that inflation is slowly killing their value. For him, BTC is the way to go—protecting your wealth in a world where cash just isn’t cutting it anymore. Bitcoin Could Hit $100K Sooner Than We Think Right now, Bitcoin’s trading at about $96,662. It’s not far from that $100K mark, and some experts think it could hit it soon. The charts show a possible double bottom pattern, which could mean a price jump to $106,000 by Christmas. Trading volume is up 8.73%, so there’s definitely some action happening. It’s looking like BTC is on the move. With countries like Switzerland working towards regulating Bitcoin mining, the growth is unstoppable. Kiyosaki is also big on Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, who’s been buying huge amounts of Bitcoin. Kiyosaki calls him a “genius” for making his company’s balance sheet stronger by stacking up Bitcoin. So, What’s Next for Bitcoin? Will Bitcoin hit $100,000? It’s hard to say for sure, but all signs point to a big jump. Kiyosaki’s prediction is more than just about the price; it’s about Bitcoin changing the way we think about money. Will it really protect wealth like he says, or will it fall short? We’ll see soon enough, but it looks like we’re in for an interesting few months.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-bitcoin-cross-100000-heres-what-robert-kiyosaki-believes/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37030622,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655647,1732941042,How High Can Dogecoin Go? Legendary Trader Forecasts Next Price Target,"Dogecoin is one of the standout performers in the crypto market in the last weeks. Over the past 34 days, DOGE has rallied by 210%, climbing from $0.13 to above $0.41. The rally was fueled by excitement surrounding the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Dogecoin advocate Elon Musk under the forthcoming US President Donald Trump. However, the rally has plateaued, with DOGE experiencing a sideways movement over the last 16 days. Despite this, the daily DOGE/USD chart continues to exhibit a highly bullish outlook. Legendary trader Peter Brandt, in collaboration with the observations of a crypto analyst known by the handle @Kultigin83, has highlighted a “running continuation flag” on the DOGE/USD chart, forecasting a potential price target of $0.66. Is This The Next Dogecoin Price Target? @Kultigin83 commented on X, stating: “Mr. Peter helps us, and I want to help him (a small piece of advice from a student); this pattern is known as an upsloping flag.” In response, Peter Brandt replied , “Yes, if completed, this would indeed be considered a running continuation flag.” The running continuation flag is a classic chart pattern recognized for its bullish implications. It generally appears during a strong uptrend when the price briefly consolidates or moves slightly downward within a parallel or slightly expanding channel. This pattern is crucial because it suggests that despite the temporary pause, the predominant bullish momentum is still very much intact. In the case of Dogecoin, the pattern observed follows a significant upward movement where the price notably increased from a level below $0.19 to above $0.39 following the breakout of a head and shoulders pattern, creating the “pole” of the flag. This pole is a crucial component as it represents the initial surge before the consolidation phase. Following this surge, the DOGE price action started to consolidate, moving within the boundaries of $0.340 to $0.48, forming the body of the flag. The method to derive the price target from a flag pattern involves measuring the length of the pole — in this instance, approximately $0.20 (from around $0.19 to $0.39). This measurement is then applied to the potential breakout point, which for DOGE appears to be forming around the $0.50 mark. By adding the height of the pole to the breakout price, the forecast target is set at $0.70. The analysis provided by @Kultigin83 sets a slightly more conservative target at $0.66. If Dogecoin can maintain its momentum and break out from the upper boundary of its running continuation flag, the target of at least $0.66 seems the next logical price target. This technical pattern, endorsed by Peter Brandt’s expertise, provides a bullish outlook for DOGE, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is not yet done with its upward climb. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.41.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/how-high-can-dogecoin-go-legendary-trader/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

BONK and DOGE Lag","Elon MAGA could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elon-maga-elonmaga-solana-memecoin-to-rally-over-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37028742,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387324,1732937660,XRP News: Ripple Awaits NYDFS Approval for RLUSD Stablecoin Launch on Dec. 4,"The post XRP News: Ripple Awaits NYDFS Approval for RLUSD Stablecoin Launch on Dec. 4 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The latest XRP news is going to spread excitement across the crypto community. The company behind XRP, Ripple, is finally going to launch its stable coin RLUSD. It is awaiting approval from the NYDFS which is expected on December 4. Let’s dive deeper and find why this stablecoin means a lot for the company and for the crypto ecosystem. Ripple Stablecoin : A Game Changer Ripple’s got a plan with RLUSD, and it’s not just any stablecoin. Think of it as their answer to all the legal chaos around XRP. Stablecoins are like the calm in a crypto storm—way more predictable than XRP’s rollercoaster price moves. Ripple’s acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company earlier this year paved the way for RLUSD, aligning Ripple with stringent NYDFS standards. Ripple is now taking on established stablecoin giants like Circle’s USDC and Paxos’ USDP. Partnerships with platforms like MoonPay and Uphold will make RLUSD accessible to a global audience. The goal? Integrate RLUSD into global remittance networks, making cross-border payments cheaper and faster than ever. XRP Price Surge The XRP token has been moving in a confined zone between $0.39 and $0.75 since March 2023. It took a breakout as the crypto market started pumping with the US election. Optimism around Ripple’s regulatory clarity and the potential of its stable coin seems to be the driving force behind this momentum. The company’s blockchain-based RippleNet system already challenges traditional systems like SWIFT. With RLUSD in the play, the company could capture a larger share of the cross-border payment market. New regulatory shifts like MiCA in Europe and the Trump administration in the US gives more strength to Ripple’s position. What’s Next? With NYDFS approval likely days away, RLUSD could launch as early as December 4, adding a fresh layer of stability to Ripple’s offerings. As the stablecoin market grows and global regulations become clearer, Ripple seems poised to not just survive but thrive. Could this finally be the breakthrough Ripple’s been hoping for? Maybe—only time will tell. Why is XRP going up? Optimism around regulatory clarity and Ripple’s stablecoin news is fueling the price surge. How high can XRP go? While predictions vary, some experts believe XRP could cross $2 by year end. What is stablecoin? A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, reducing volatility. Is XRP a good investment? XRP has huge potential, but market volatility and regulatory factors should be considered.",POSITIVE,XRP | USDC,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP | USDC,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-ripple-awaits-nydfs-approval-for-rlusd-stablecoin-launch-on-dec-4/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Solana, with its much-discussed ETF potential, has captured institutional and retail attention alike, while Cronos’s projected price increase to $0.22 signals steady growth. However, stealing the spotlight is Qubetics ($TICS), the new Web3 aggregator in town, setting itself apart with innovative tools like the QubeQode IDE. Unlike many predecessors, Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s solving real-world problems. At its heart, QubeQode IDE introduces a groundbreaking Code Snippet Library that simplifies development for Web3 builders, bringing a tech-forward approach to token value. Combine this with analysts’ predictions of up to 58,213% ROI, and $TICS could very well be the crown jewel of promising cryptos this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Web3 with Innovation As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is simplifying blockchain development with its intuitive QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Developers often hit roadblocks when coding decentralised apps (dApps), but QubeQode changes the game with its Code Snippet Library—a treasure trove of pre-written code blocks. Imagine an entrepreneur building a crowdfunding platform on blockchain. Instead of scripting smart contracts from scratch, they can simply select and customise relevant snippets from QubeQode . This innovation cuts development time and costs while reducing errors—giving creators confidence and investors peace of mind. It’s no surprise that $TICS has captured the market’s imagination. The presale, currently in its tenth stage, has already raised over $3.6 million, with 239 million tokens sold and 4,800 holders joining the movement. At $0.025 per token, investors are scrambling to grab $TICS before this weekend’s expected 10% surge pushes the price higher. For those sceptical about early-stage investments, consider this: analysts predict $TICS could reach $15 post-mainnet launch. If an entrepreneur invests $10 now, they’d receive 400 tokens. Solana (SOL): The ETF That Could Reshape Crypto Solana continues to make waves as institutional interest mounts in its potential ETF. With applications filed by firms like VanEck and Bitwise, a decision from the SEC is expected by August 2025. Optimism is high, especially with the impending resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, which analysts believe could create a more crypto-friendly environment. Globally, Solana ETFs have already been approved in Brazil and Canada, creating indirect pressure on the U.S. to follow suit. Approval could be a game-changer, not just for Solana but for the entire crypto ecosystem. As Matthew Sigel from VanEck suggests, a Solana ETF would bring legitimacy and open doors to institutional capital, further solidifying Solana’s position as a leading blockchain network. On the price front, SOL’s recent performance is nothing short of spectacular. The token hit an all-time high of $264.31, up 18% this week and 160% in 2024. For investors, this means SOL remains one of the most promising cryptos this weekend. With the possibility of ETF approval and continuous ecosystem expansion, Solana’s bullish trajectory seems poised to continue. Cronos (CRO): Quietly Building Momentum While Solana grabs headlines, Cronos is making steady progress. Trading at $0.176018 as of today, the token has underperformed against BTC and ETH in the short term, but analysts project a 26.11% price increase by December 3, 2024, bringing it to $0.222803. Cronos has shown resilience, gaining 130.94% over the last month and nearly doubling its value year-over-year. These metrics make it a solid pick for investors looking for less volatility compared to meme coins. Moreover, its role in the Crypto.com ecosystem ensures consistent demand, further stabilising its growth. Looking at the big picture, Cronos’s all-time high of $0.959822 in November 2021 suggests room for growth, especially as the Fear & Greed Index signals “Extreme Greed” among investors. While it may not promise the explosive gains of $TICS, Cronos’s reliability makes it another standout in the list of promising cryptos this weekend. Which Crypto Should You Bet On? When it comes to promising cryptos this weekend, Qubetics ($TICS) takes the crown. Its utility-driven ecosystem, groundbreaking QubeQode IDE, and jaw-dropping ROI projections make it an irresistible choice for risk-tolerant investors. Solana and Cronos also offer compelling narratives, with SOL riding the ETF wave and CRO delivering steady growth. But let’s not ignore the ticking clock. With $TICS priced at just $0.025 and a 10% surge expected this weekend, there’s no time to wait. Imagine snagging 1,000 tokens now and watching them turn into $15,000 post-mainnet launch . Opportunities like this don’t come often, so why not take the leap?

37027676,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655623,1732935627,"XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says History Is Repeating Itself, Here’s How","A crypto analyst has shared a technical analysis of the XRP price in a 4-hour time frame. Currently, the XRP chart highlights distinct patterns in market behaviour, suggesting that historical price action may be repeating itself. The analyst predicts that if the cryptocurrency can successfully replicate these bullish historical patterns, it could trigger an upward surge for XRP. XRP Price Patterns Signal Bullish Potential Richard, the crypto analyst on TradingView, popularly known as ‘The Signalyst,’ has declared that history is repeating itself in the XRP price chart. The analyst shared a detailed analytical report on XRP, predicting its future target while examining critical aspects of its current price action. According to Richard, the XRP 4-hour chart reveals an intriguing pattern characterised by lower lows and a sharp bullish impulse. The two red arrows labeled “LL” on the price chart indicate areas where the XRP price made lower lows mid-November, signaling a correction or a trend reversal. This downward trend was quickly followed by a period of consolidation within a defined range seen in the green zone on the chart. After experiencing lower lows and bearish momentum , Richard pinpointed that the XRP price entered a corrective phase, stabilizing within the aforementioned green zone. Eventually, XRP broke above this green resistance range, triggering a bullish impulse that pushed the cryptocurrency to its previous price high of $1.5. Although the XRP price has corrected again and was trading at around $1.4 earlier this week, Richard has highlighted that the cryptocurrency seems to be repeating the above historical set-up. Its price has entered a new consolidation phase just below the $1.53 level, signaling the start of its next bullish movement . Should the XRP price repeat this pattern and break above the $1.53 threshold, the analyst suggests that this would validate XRP’s anticipated bullish impulse position and pave the way for a potential rally toward the $2 psychological level. Analyst Labels XRP At $1.4 A Bargain Buy Steph, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has called the XRP price a bargain buy at $1.4. Following its surge above $1.5 earlier this month, the XRP price witnessed a slight trend reversal, pushing it down to $1.4. Steph disclosed that the $1.4 XRP price was a prime buying opportunity for investors, as a breakout to the upside was about to begin. Concerning the predicted breakout, it seems the analyst was spot on, as the XRP price is currently trading at $1.6 , marking an 8.7% increase in the last 24 hours. While XRP continues to gain momentum , Steph predicts that the cryptocurrency could soon see an explosive increase to $50. With this bullish scenario in mind, Richard has urged investors to start buying XRP before further adoption drives its price into “the very expensive range,” between $22 and $120.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-history/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

After a strong bullish run in recent weeks, the recent pullback appears to be a temporary pause in an upward trend. Crucial on-chain data supports this outlook, indicating robust network activity that reinforces the bullish sentiment for ADA. Key metrics shared by IntoTheBlock reveal over 840,000 transactions recorded on the Cardano network, with total fees amounting to 279,000 ADA. This data underscores growing usage and demand for the Cardano blockchain, adding to its fundamental strength. Such network activity often correlates with price appreciation, suggesting that ADA could soon maintain its momentum. As ADA consolidates above $1 , the market will closely monitor whether it can hold this key level and push higher. Investors and analysts are optimistic, citing the network’s increasing adoption and solid transaction metrics as critical factors driving its bullish outlook. The next few weeks could be pivotal for Cardano, with a sustained move above $1 likely signaling the continuation of its upward trend. Cardano Activity Growing Cardano is trading at multi-year highs and looks poised to continue its impressive rally. After breaking through the critical $1 level at the start of this bull run, ADA has shown strong momentum, driven by increasing adoption and investor confidence. On-chain data shared by IntoTheBlock analyst C Thumbs highlights significant milestones, signaling sustained growth in the Cardano ecosystem. The latest data reveals that Cardano recently surpassed 840,000 transactions, with total fees reaching 279,000 ADA. Notably, the last time transaction volumes and fees were this high was in March 2022. This resurgence reflects the growing utility of the Cardano blockchain, transitioning from being primarily speculative to demonstrating real-world value. A closer look at holder trends further underscores this shift. From July 2022 until today, ADA has seen sustained growth in the number of holders, indicating increasing confidence in the blockchain’s long-term potential. Unlike previous cycles, where ADA’s price movements were driven primarily by speculation, the current rally appears underpinned by tangible network activity and adoption. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Above $90K – On-Chain Data Reveals Key Demand Levels As Cardano continues to gain traction, investors are focusing on the next significant supply level. With robust network activity and bullish sentiment prevailing, ADA appears ready to target new highs, reinforcing its status as a leading blockchain in the crypto space. ADA Testing Crucial Supply Cardano has experienced a remarkable 250% rally in less than a month, showcasing strong bullish momentum as it gains traction in the market. Currently trading at $1.06, ADA is approaching its yearly high of $1.15, a crucial resistance level that could define its next price trajectory. If ADA successfully breaks above the $1.15 level, it could open the door to a significant rally targeting the next supply zones at $1.25 and potentially $1.60. Such a breakout would signal renewed investor confidence and sustained demand, further solidifying Cardano’s position as one of the most dynamic assets in the crypto space during this cycle. However, there is a risk of further consolidation below the $1.15 mark. If ADA fails to hold momentum at this critical level, the price may pull back to test support at $1.00 or lower. Such a scenario could indicate a temporary pause in the uptrend, allowing investors and traders to reassess the market conditions. As Cardano trades near these pivotal levels, market participants will closely monitor its price action to determine whether the rally can extend or if consolidation will define the short-term outlook for this rapidly rising altcoin.

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, and for good reason. Robert Kiyosaki’s bold $500,000 Bitcoin prediction for 2025 has reignited investor confidence, while Fantom has surged past the $1 mark, positioning itself as a DeFi powerhouse. As these projects steal the spotlight, a rising star, Qubetics ($TICS), is quietly but confidently changing the game with its innovative solutions and impressive presale performance. For seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, these are the best cryptos to watch in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Qubetics is solving real-world problems with its revolutionary Web3 aggregator and user-friendly QubeQode IDE. Unlike its predecessors, which often alienated users with complexity, Qubetics is breaking barriers, making blockchain accessible to all. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned trader, the $TICS token offers a promising opportunity that blends innovation, usability, and potentially life-changing returns. Let’s dive deeper into what makes Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Fantom the best cryptos to watch right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Web3 with a User-Friendly Twist If you’ve been searching for a cryptocurrency project that combines cutting-edge technology with practical usability, Qubetics is your answer. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is setting new standards in the blockchain space. Its flagship feature, the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is a game-changer, designed to simplify Web3 development. Think of it as the Google Docs of blockchain—a platform so intuitive that even a novice can build and deploy smart contracts without a hitch. Imagine this: a small business owner wants to integrate blockchain for supply chain tracking but lacks the technical know-how. With QubeQode IDE, they can create a smart contract with just a few clicks, ensuring transparency and efficiency without hiring an expensive developer. This ease of use is why Qubetics is attracting thousands of token holders, with over 4,800 investors already onboard. The presale’s numbers speak for themselves. Now in its tenth stage, Qubetics has sold over 239 million tokens, raising a jaw-dropping $3.6 million. At just $0.025 per token, early adopters are seizing the opportunity before the price surges by 10% this weekend. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, projections skyrocket, with $TICS potentially reaching $5 for a staggering 19,337% ROI. A mere $1 investment today could grow into $58,213 after Qubetics’ mainnet launch. Bitcoin (BTC): Can Kiyosaki’s $500K Prediction Come True? Bitcoin is the king of cryptocurrencies, and its reign shows no signs of slowing down. Robert Kiyosaki’s recent forecast of Bitcoin hitting $500,000 by 2025 has turned heads across the financial world. According to Kiyosaki, institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and increasing demand are all aligning to create the perfect storm for Bitcoin’s next massive bull run. With Bitcoin’s recent surge nearing $100,000, it’s not hard to imagine this prediction coming true. But what does it mean for everyday investors? Let’s consider Kiyosaki’s prediction in numbers. If you invest $1 in Bitcoin today and it climbs to $500,000, your dollar could grow exponentially, especially if purchased during a dip. Of course, Bitcoin’s price movements can be wild, but for long-term believers, the upside is hard to ignore. Bitcoin’s story isn’t just about price—it’s about resilience and adoption. Major corporations like Tesla and Square are embracing Bitcoin, while countries like El Salvador are building their economies around it. For those eyeing the best cryptos to watch, Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader. And with experts like Chamath Palihapitiya and Mike Novogratz echoing Kiyosaki’s optimism, the future looks brighter than ever. Fantom (FTM): DeFi’s Rising Star While Bitcoin grabs the headlines and Qubetics dazzles with innovation, Fantom quietly proves its worth in the world of decentralised finance (DeFi). Fantom’s recent surge past $1 is a testament to its growing utility and investor confidence. Unlike the speculative rallies of 2021, this price movement is underpinned by real-world applications and a robust ecosystem. Fantom’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at an impressive $131.01 million, a clear indicator of its active DeFi participation. Its ecosystem thrives on stability, thanks to its $320.62 million stablecoin market cap. These numbers highlight a maturing blockchain that prioritises security and efficiency—qualities that DeFi enthusiasts value deeply. Price predictions for Fantom are equally promising. Analysts suggest that if the current momentum continues, FTM could easily break new resistance levels, offering substantial returns for investors.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-santa-trump-santrump-will-skyrocket-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-dogecoin-shiba-inu-and-pepe-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s jaw-dropping success, they’ve flipped the script on traditional crypto investing. And now, a new star is stealing the show: BTFD Coin . With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming platform, staking rewards, and an ever-growing community, this coin is poised to redefine what meme coins are all about. Launched on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin didn’t just tiptoe into the meme coin space—it kicked the door wide open. Within the first 24 hours of its presale, it had completed nearly 25% of its journey through 16 presale stages, raising a whopping $150,000. Analysts are already buzzing about its potential, with its presale price of $0.00005 expected to hit $0.0006 by the end of the presale. Could this be the best meme coin to invest in today? Let’s dive deeper and find out. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Raising the Bar BTFD Coin isn’t your average meme coin. Sure, it’s got the humour and community-driven vibes you’d expect, but it’s packing some serious utility under the hood. Think P2E gaming, staking rewards, and even a roadmap designed to make early investors a fortune. Since its presale launched at $0.000004 per coin , the momentum has been unstoppable. Fast forward to Stage 5, and the price now stands at $0.00005 per coin, with over 10 billion coins sold. Investors are piling in, eager to snag what could be the best meme coin to invest in today . In just a few days, the presale has raised over $295,000, proving that the hype isn’t just noise—it’s real. Let’s talk numbers. Imagine you invested $4,000 in Stage 5 at $0.00005 per coin. That would bag you 80 million BTFD Coins. Now, when the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would be worth a cool $48,000. That’s the kind of ROI dreams are made of. What sets BTFD apart is its vision for the future. While most meme coins ride on fleeting trends, BTFD is building an ecosystem that thrives on utility. With its P2E game just around the corner and staking rewards offering passive income, it’s not hard to see why investors are flocking to it. And let’s not forget the FOMO factor. With only 16 presale stages, the clock’s ticking to get in early. Apu Apustaja: The Underdog Meme Coin You Need to Know About Move over, Dogecoin—Apu Apustaja is here to claim its throne. Inspired by the iconic internet meme, Apu Apustaja taps into nostalgia while carving out its niche in the crypto world. But can it compete with heavyweights like BTFD Coin? Apu’s charm lies in its community. Built on a decentralised ethos, it’s all about inclusivity and grassroots growth. But what’s its edge? For starters, it’s rolling out an NFT marketplace where users can trade Apu-themed digital assets. It’s a bold move, but will it be enough to make Apu Apustaja the best meme coin to invest in today ? The coin’s price action has been volatile, to say the least. After launching at $0.000002, it saw a brief surge to $0.000009 before retracing to $0.000005. Some call it a buying opportunity, others a red flag. Regardless, Apu’s roadmap is ambitious. It plans to integrate with DeFi platforms and even launch a play-to-earn game by Q2 2025. Here’s the kicker: Apu Apustaja is all about the underdog narrative. It thrives on community support, making it a wildcard in the meme coin race. While it doesn’t have the immediate ROI appeal of BTFD Coin, it’s got a loyal following that could propel it to new heights. If you’re willing to take a risk, Apu might just surprise you. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Meme Coin with a Twist If the name doesn’t grab you, the concept will. Cat in a Dog’s World is a satirical take on the meme coin craze, flipping the script with its feline-first narrative. But don’t let the humour fool you; this coin means business. Launching at $0.000003, Cat in a Dog’s World has already seen a 40% increase in its market cap within its first week. Its appeal lies in its simplicity. No overcomplicated utility, no grandiose promises—just a meme coin that’s unashamedly fun. And sometimes, that’s all it takes. What’s unique about Cat in a Dog’s World is its “Clawback Program.” A portion of every transaction is redistributed to holders, creating a passive income stream. It’s a clever way to keep investors engaged while incentivising long-term holding. Analysts are cautiously optimistic, with price predictions targeting $0.00002 by mid-2025. But let’s be real—can Cat in a Dog’s World compete with the likes of BTFD Coin? Probably not. While it’s a fun addition to any crypto portfolio, it lacks the robust ecosystem and ROI potential that make BTFD the best meme coin to invest in today . Still, for those looking to diversify, it’s a quirky option that’s worth considering. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that meme coins are far from being a passing fad. They’re evolving, innovating, and offering investors opportunities that traditional cryptocurrencies simply can’t match. Among the contenders, BTFD Coin stands out as the frontrunner. Its explosive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support make it the best meme coin to invest in today. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a first-time investor, this is one opportunity you don’t want to miss. Ready to join the meme coin revolution? Don’t wait too long—the BTFD presale is heating up, and the best deals won’t last forever. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your stake in the next big thing in crypto.

37024685,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51023,1732928876,Bitcoin’s Institutional Revolution: From Wall Street to State Governments,"Bitcoin is no longer just for tech enthusiasts; it’s becoming a key player in mainstream finance. Institutional adoption is skyrocketing, with big names like BlackRock and Fidelity stepping into the game by launching Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The amount of money tied up in criticized loans, which show emerging signs of risk and weakness that could lead to defaults, just reached its highest level since 2020, reports S&P Global. JPMorgan Chase has witnessed the largest year-over-year increase, with the number of criticized loans at the firm jumping 26.3%, reaching $26.01 billion at the end of Q3. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has recorded a 17.9% year-on-year increase in criticized loans, at $37.6 billion, while Bank of America recorded a 15.2% year-on-year increase, at $26.06 billion. That brings the total amount of the criticized loans at the trio of banks to $89.67 billion since Q3 of 2023, reflecting a trend that’s playing out at banks across the board. “Criticized loans at public US banks amounted to $279.98 billion, versus $240.37 billion at the end of 2023, and such loans at the 100 largest US public banks totaled $260.48 billion, versus $219.82 billion at 2023-end.” Among tier-one banks with over $50 billion in total assets, four lenders recorded triple-digit increases in criticized loans. Flagstar Financial recorded a 338.6% year-on-year increase in criticized loans while First Horizon, Valley National Bancorp and Webster Financial Corp witnessed 112.2%, 110.1% and 102.8% year-on-year increases in criticized loans.

37023826,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655583,1732928453,Is $10 Within Reach For Cardano? Whale Moves Signal Big Rally Ahead,"Cardano (ADA) has achieved a significant milestone by breaking past the $1 barrier , a level that appeared unattainable for the majority of 2023. The cryptocurrency’s recent price surge has captivated the attention of both analysts and investors, as it has been unable to overcome this psychological level for years. Although the token has recently experienced some price consolidation, analysts anticipate that this is merely the commencement of a much more substantial rally. Cardano: Consolidation Phase ADA’s momentum weakened after it crossed the $1 threshold, and it has been hovering just below this mark. Cardano has entered a phase of consolidation around the $0.99 to $1.00 range, contrary to the expectations of many investors who anticipated that the rally would persist. While this may appear to be a temporary setback, analyst Dan Gambardello has a different perspective. He perceives this consolidation as a positive indicator of redistribution, a prerequisite for the ADA to continue its upward trajectory. For years through the bear market, many didn’t think $ADA would ever hit $1 again. Many holders have been waiting to sell at $1. Now that we’ve reached $1, it’s great to see a consolidation and redistribution. After this phase is over, Cardano can focus on $5 and $10. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) November 27, 2024 Gambardello anticipates that Cardano may pursue significantly higher price points after this segment concludes, potentially achieving a range of $5 to $10. Increase In Whale Activities The increase in whale activity during Cardano’s latest performance is among the most fascinating features. ADA whales have been rapidly rising their numbers over the last few weeks, particularly following the token’s $1 breakthrough. According to reports, over 130 million ADA tokens are owned by millionaires, and that exceeds over 3.2 billion. Such accumulation is taken as a strong vote for the token, which would keep the price going high. Despite profit-taking, the ADA adoption has kept its positive optimism. Whale Appetite Up As Bitcoin approaches $100,000, there is a transition in focus to other cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano. The market capitalization of ADA has increased by more than 30% in the past week, reaching an impressive $35 billion. Because of the rise in whale activity and the possibility of a good regulatory environment, investors are very optimistic about Cardano’s future. The level of excitement has also been raised by rumors about Cardano’s founder and possible partnerships with incoming US President Donald Trump. Although these factors are still considered speculative, they contribute to the increasing conviction that Cardano may achieve new price milestones in the near future. Cardano’s most recent performance has demonstrated that it is once again competitive. ADA may soon achieve new heights due to the expanding market sentiment and robust whale support. The $5 to $10 price range may appear to be an ambitious goal; however, it is now feasible with the appropriate catalysts.

37024684,https://timestabloid.com/?p=50913,1732928452,BTC Recaptures $96K: Record ETF Inflows Lead to XRP Pump While DTX Exchange’s 1021% Rally Steals The Spotlight,"The crypto realm is a space of tough competition and growing volatility. Each day starts with new shifts in the bull market. The current session witnesses the BTC price reclaiming its previous price of $96,000. Ripple, which had been struggling for most of the year, has gained strength with the XRP token surging amid the spot XRP ETF buzz. These changes have been quite notable in the crypto space. Yet, DTX Exchange grabs the limelight with its massive ROI. Experts reveal that the DTX token is poised to give a 1021% rally in this session benefitting the investors. BTC Price Revisits $96k On Fed Rate Cut Expectations On Wednesday, US economic indicators fueled bets on a December Fed rate cut. The Core PCE Price Index rose 0.3% month-on-month in October, mirroring September’s increase. However, year-on-year, the Core PCE Price Index increased to 2.8% in October, up from 2.7% in September. The October figures suggested a sticky inflation environment. Nevertheless, the chances of a Fed rate cut increased on Wednesday, boosting demand for US BTC-spot ETFs and BTC price surge. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a Fed rate cut rose from 59.4% on November 26 to 64.8% on November 27. On Wednesday, BTC price gained 4.32%, reversing a 1% loss from Tuesday, closing at $95,883. BTC price trends hinge on Trump’s nominations and BTC-spot ETF market flows. Pro-crypto nominations for the SEC and CFTC Chairs bolster expectations of BTC becoming a strategic reserve asset, potentially boosting BTC price and demand. XRP-Spot ETF Applications Signal Seismic Demand Shift For Ripple An XRP-spot ETF market could materially boost Ripple’s demand, potentially driving it toward the January 2018 all-time high of $3.5505. The US BTC-spot ETF market offers a precedent, with BTC surging by 113%, advancing from $46,742 (January 11, 2024) to an all-time high of $99,318 (November 22, 2024). Speculation about President-elect Donald Trump potentially appointing a pro-crypto SEC Chair has fueled expectations for an XRP-spot ETF market. Since SEC Chair Gensler’s resignation announcement, investors are also betting on the SEC withdrawing its appeal against rulings in the Ripple case. If the SEC withdraws its appeal, the Programmatic sales of the Ripple ruling would set a crucial legal precedent. This could pave the way to an XRP-spot ETF market. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP did not satisfy the third prong of the Howey Test. On Wednesday, November 27, XRP rallied 5.17% to close at $1.4711, reversing Tuesday’s 1.17% loss. Significantly, Ripple ended a four-day losing streak while tracking the broader crypto market, which gained 4.89%. An SEC Chair favoring the end to ongoing legal battles with crypt firms could drive XRP toward $2. However, Ripple must move through the November 23, 2024, high of $1.6299 to target the May 2021 high of $1.8171 and $2. DTX Exchange (DTX): Trading Revolution Raises $8.8 Million DTX Exchange (DTX) is the latest project with the potential to redefine the global trading industry by combining the best centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges into one place. DTX enables access to over 120,000 asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities, all on a unified layer for a wallet system built on the Layer-1 blockchain. This is an innovative approach that fuses TradFi and DeFi, making DTX Exchange stand out. Based on Ethereum and Solana protocols, the DTX token is currently priced at $0.10 during its fifth round, having sold nearly 80% of the tokens available. Once they’ve been sold out, the price will increase to $0.12, marking a 20% for early investors. Having already raised $8,850,000 in presale, DTX Exchange is one of the most hyped investments today. Key Takeaways The BTC price recovers its lost momentum and crosses the $96,000 level once more. On the flip side, Ripple surges in tandem with XRP-spot ETF. However, after a 1021% surge, DTX Exchange is still unstoppable in this bull run. The platform raises over $8.85 million!

37023813,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=310915,1732928449,"Crypto Analyst Says One Solana Rival Primed To Go Higher, Outlines Path Forward for Fantom and NEAR Protocol","A widely followed crypto analyst thinks one Solana ( SOL ) challenger is gearing up for more rounds of upside bursts. Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 232,200 followers on the social media platform X that Sei ( SEI ) looks bullish after breaking out of a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart. A rounding bottom formation is a bullish reversal structure suggesting that an asset is ready to witness a new uptrend. Says Altcoin Sherpa, “Fundamentals-wise, I think there needs to be a bit more built on there for people to gamble on but all in all, it looks really good for higher. Grabbing a bag a bit lower if it comes. Something like $0.60 would be a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.66. Another altcoin on the trader’s radar is the smart contract platform Fantom ( FTM ). According to the crypto strategist, FTM looks solid for long-term investors given its strong fundamentals. He also says the coin looks bullish after breaking out from a multi-month accumulation period. “FTM: there’s a lot to like with this chart and project IMO (in my opinion): -Andre [Cronje] cracked dev -high float/not as much sell pressure from VCs (venture capitalists) -Sonic rebrand coming that hits all the narratives -chart-wise, almost a two-year accumulation period followed by some big moves and clean levels. I’m in. Don’t really recommend you buy at this current level, to be frank, but I think that buying any dips is a good thing. Still believe that this is a pretty decent one to hold if you’re looking for older 2021 movers that have high float/supply out (others like AVAX might be considered).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FTM is facing one big resistance level at $1.10. At time of writing, FTM is trading at $1.00. Looking at fellow layer-1 (L1) protocol Near ( NEAR ), the trader shares a chart suggesting that the altcoin may target its resistance at $8.29 after moving above $6.50. “NEAR has pretty slow grinding price action and isn’t really a great active trade right now.

37024683,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51020,1732928230,The Rise and Fall of Pepe Coin: Lessons for Crypto Investors,"The story of Pepe Coin is an example of how unpredictable the cryptocurrency world can be. Launched in April 2023, Pepe Coin quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts. The coin, inspired by the popular internet meme, saw an incredible surge in its value shortly after its debut. If you had invested $100 in Pepe Coin at its launch, you would have seen that investment skyrocket to over $1.6 million during its peak in May 2023. When considering new coins to invest in, several factors should come into play. A coin’s online presence is one of the most important aspects to examine. How a project markets itself online can make a significant difference in its success. SEO cryptocurrency tactics are essential for boosting visibility and reaching the right audience. Projects with optimized websites, strong community engagement on social media, and high-quality content tend to attract more attention. Other factors include the team behind the project, its roadmap, and the utility of the coin itself. Pepe Coin’s success was largely driven by its community. Meme coins often rely heavily on online culture and viral trends, and Pepe Coin was no different. The coin’s developers leveraged the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme, creating a narrative that resonated with a niche audience. Community-driven campaigns on platforms like Twitter and Reddit helped the coin gain momentum. The sense of camaraderie and humor in these online spaces attracted more investors, fueling the coin’s rapid rise. However, the coin’s success was short-lived. By mid-2023, Pepe Coin’s value began to decline, and the hype surrounding it faded. By November 2024, the coin’s price had dropped significantly, leaving many late investors with losses. This cycle is common with meme coins, where the initial buzz often leads to unsustainable valuations. Investors who entered early and exited during the peak benefited the most, while others faced the downside of market volatility. The rise and fall of Pepe Coin underlines the importance of timing in cryptocurrency investments. Early adopters often see the greatest returns, but this comes with high risks. The speculative nature of meme coins means they can lose value as quickly as they gain it. Pepe Coin serves as a reminder for investors to approach such opportunities cautiously and be prepared for the risks involved. While the case of Pepe Coin is fascinating, it also highlights the speculative nature of meme coins. Unlike projects with strong utility or innovative blockchain solutions, meme coins often lack long-term sustainability. Their value is typically tied to social trends and online buzz, which can fade quickly. Looking at the broader crypto market, projects with robust foundations tend to perform better over time. Utility, team credibility, and a well-defined roadmap are critical for long-term success. While meme coins like Pepe can offer massive short-term gains, they are not a substitute for projects with solid use cases. Ethereum , for instance, has grown consistently because of its role in enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Pepe Coin’s story is a cautionary tale for both seasoned investors and newcomers. It shows the potential for high rewards in crypto but also the risks of chasing hype-driven assets. For those considering new investments, focusing on projects with a strong online presence, community engagement, and clear objectives is essential.

Data from CoinGecko shows that XRP beat Binance Coin (BNB) in terms of market capitalization, with XRP having a market capitalization of $100 billion above BNB’s $94 billion. This surge puts XRP in the elite $100 billion club. Currently valued at $1.74, XRP has risen by 17% in the last 24 hours and a stunning 200% in the past month, its best showing since December 2017. The cryptocurrency has continued to surge, reaching $1.7, a price it last touched in April of 2021. Currently, XRP is trailing behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Solana (SOL). On the daily chart, the XRP shows a steep upward trend from $0.50 to $1.72 in a parabolic trend this month. The RSI stands at 88.09, indicating that the asset is overbought, while the MACD at 0.25022 points towards the buying pressure. Support levels are at $1.40 and $1.50 while major resistance levels are at $1.80. A pullback to the $1.50 area, accompanied by a bullish breakout, could be a decent entry opportunity, with the price rallying above $1.80 if volume remains on the rise. Speculations surrounding changes within the US Security and Exchange Commission have boosted investor confidence. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch in December Ripple Labs is making headlines again with its RLUSD stablecoin, a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that is overcollaterized. According to sources , the New York Department of Financial Services is expected to provide its green light to the stablecoin as early as December, which may lead to the trading of the token. Ripple first unveiled its plans to launch the RLUSD in April 2024 as a way of challenging other stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. The company has forecast that the stablecoin market will be $2 trillion by 2028. The pilot of RLUSD was launched in August on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet, with the intention of adding more blockchains. Ripple has also ensured it partners with exchanges such as Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, and other exchanges that support RLUSD. CEO of Ripple Brad Garlinghouse reiterated the company’s commitment to using assets such as XRP to enhance the use cases of the stablecoin.

37024682,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51017,1732926626,6 tips to make your crypto gambling more comfortable,"Crypto gambling can be an exciting way to combine entertainment with the advantages of blockchain technology, such as transparency, speed, and privacy. However, to make your experience as comfortable as possible, it’s essential to approach it with thoughtful preparation and strategic choices. One of the most important steps is choosing the right platform. While there are countless crypto-gambling sites available, not all offer the same level of security, fairness, or user experience. Look for platforms with verified licenses, strong reputations, and provably fair gaming systems. Additionally, ensure the platform supports the cryptocurrencies you intend to use and provides responsive customer support for any potential issues. For those seeking fair gaming, diverse gaming options, access to multiple cryptocurrencies, and enticing extras like bonuses and other freebies, this list of crypto casinos is an excellent place to start. These platforms have been curated to offer a secure and enjoyable gambling experience, catering to both newcomers and seasoned players. Although being web-based platforms, they’re fully compliant with international security and payment standards, and licensed accordingly. But starting with these activities without a clear expenditure plan can be a slippery slope. Hence, managing your budget effectively is another key to a comfortable experience. Set a clear gambling budget in advance and stick to it. This not only prevents financial stress but also ensures that the activity remains enjoyable. Many crypto platforms offer tools like deposit limits or self-exclusion options to help you stay in control. Take advantage of these features if they can enhance your comfort. Familiarizing yourself with the games is equally important. Before diving in, spend some time understanding the rules and strategies of your chosen games. Many platforms offer demo versions that allow you to practice without risking your funds. Whether it’s poker, slots, or sports betting, having a solid grasp of the gameplay can enhance your confidence and reduce frustration. Another essential tip is to ensure privacy and security. Use a reliable crypto wallet to manage your funds, preferably one with robust security features like two-factor authentication. Avoid sharing sensitive information and be cautious of phishing attempts . Some users prefer gambling anonymously; if that’s a priority for you, choose platforms that don’t require extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. Staying updated on cryptocurrency trends can also make your experience smoother. Crypto values can fluctuate significantly, so being aware of market conditions helps you plan deposits and withdrawals strategically. Keeping an eye on transaction fees is similarly important, as these can vary depending on network congestion. Finally, prioritize platforms with a user-friendly interface. A cluttered or confusing design can make the experience frustrating, while intuitive navigation and helpful tutorials can enhance your enjoyment. By carefully selecting your platform, managing your funds, and staying informed, you can make crypto gambling a comfortable and rewarding experience.

XRP is currently trading above the crucial $1.50 level and is up by more than six percent in the last 24 hours. The altcoin has gained 20 percent in the past week and is now eyeing to break the $1.60 level. As for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is trading above the $97k level and has slipped into the red zone. XRP Continues Bull Run Although many cryptocurrencies move in waves, XRP tends to follow a straight upward trajectory, especially during bull markets. At the moment, XRP is facing some resistance between $1.60 and $1.70. If XRP breaks above $1.70, it could easily hit $2 soon. Watch for the breakout above $1.70 to confirm this possibility. Support Levels According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, in case of a pullback, XRP has solid support around $1.25 to $1.30. This range has acted as major support in recent times, so if the price drops, it is likely to bounce back from there. Short-Term Outlook: Breakout and Resistance XRP has successfully broken out from a triangle pattern. Although the breakout was slightly delayed, it is now heading towards the target price of $1.77. Short-term resistance may appear around $1.70, but once that level is cleared, XRP is expected to continue its upward movement. Previous Resistance Becomes Support The breakout above $1.50-$1.51 marks a significant shift. Once this resistance level was cleared, XRP’s price surged higher. Now, those previous resistance levels should act as new support. Watch for support around $1.62 to $1.63, and further support around $1.56 or $1.50 if the price pulls back.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-november-30/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pink-shiba-inu-pinkshib-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-while-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Morocco becoming the first African country to support a pro-crypto regulatory framework is big news for the global market and will drive the prices further up. Widespread adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and other front runners could potentially be beneficial to blockchain platforms like Near Protocol (NEAR). However, a new player could see the most out of this surge, IntelMarkets (INTL). Bitcoin Price: $5K Down Since Its ATH Bitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first cryptocurrency, introduced in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Being the largest crypto ever, Bitcoin’s massive price swings are nothing new. Its finite supply of 21 million coins and secure network has made it a popular store of value and an investment asset often referred to as “digital gold.” As per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $95,100, a 40% increase since last month. BTC seems to hold onto this upward trajectory due to favorable crypto policies being implemented around the world, together with rising institutional interest. Morocco’s progressive legislation is one example that will aid in BTC adoption in that part of the world. Bitcoin is the go-to long-term investment for many traders because it offers stability like none others. However, its massive market cap of $1.88T means that BTC has a limit on its upside. Many investors are looking to invest in shorter-term, higher-return projects. One of those projects that they’ve turned their heads to is IntelMarkets (INTL), which is becoming the game changer for those who seek higher returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Struggling To Reach Its Former Glory, Down 3% Near Protocol (NEAR) has made its name in the blockchain world with its focus on scalability, developer accessibility and user friendly applications. It uses a unique sharding technology called “Nightshade” to achieve high throughput and efficiency. NEAR, which is trading at $6.53, has repeatedly failed to recapture its former glory — its ATH of $20.42 in January of 2022. NEAR’s price instability shouldn’t diminish the fact that the token is still a solid choice for long-term investors as its ecosystem expands. With increased decentralized applications and partnership adoption, experts target a conservative $7 by the end of 2024. But since NEAR’s market cap is over $8 billion, explosive growth is far less likely than that of low-cap gems. NEAR is a safe entry for steady gains, but IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a unique opportunity for investors wanting to maximize returns utilizing a brand-new AI-driven approach. IntelMarkets (INTL): Revolutionizing Crypto Trading The project you should be looking out for during the following months is IntelMarkets (INTL). IntelMarkets combines AI, blockchain, and DeFi in one platform, offering traders a hassle free experience. The self learning AI trading bots analyze data at incredible speeds and enable a user to make profits on compelling opportunities across asset classes. The market has been excited by IntelMarkets ’ forward thinking approach, and so it was no surprise that investors have poured over $2.4 million into its presale. Some of INTL’s Key Features: AI Integration: Real-time self-learning bots that learn by optimizing their trading strategies. Dual-Chain Architecture: Scalable and efficient because it supports both Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Low Entry Price: With tokens sold at $0.055, there is plenty of room for early investors to get in. Massive Upside Potential: A top pick for life-changing gains, analysts predict a 75x rally post-launch. Exponential Growth Potential: As a low cap token, IntelMarkets (INTL) is predicted to outperform Bitcoin and NEAR on an upside basis, due to their limitations. Key Takeaways While Bitcoin (BTC) and Near Protocol (NEAR) remain attractive options for long-term investors looking for moderate gains, IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a rare opportunity to achieve life-changing returns. Its cutting-edge AI technology, low entry price, and immense growth potential make it the best investment choice in 2024. With Morocco’s crypto-friendly policy adding fuel to the market, INTL is poised to lead the next wave of innovation and surge.

37021961,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655622,1732924825,"Bitcoin Price Forms Bullish Pennant On 3-Day Chart, $145,000 Target Swims Into View","Although currently undergoing a brief correction after almost touching the $100,000 price level, technical analysis has shown the emergence of a bullish pattern on the Bitcoin price chart. Notably, the correction has given rise to the formation of a bullish pennant on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. This development might be the bullish momentum needed to eventually break past the $100,000 price threshold. However, the anticipated breakout is not just above $100,000, but a run that would send the cryptocurrency to $145,000. Bullish Pennant Emerges On Bitcoin Price Chart Recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen the Bitcoin price returning to the $96,000 price level after spending the majority of the week on a correction path . Particularly, this correction saw the Bitcoin price hitting a low of $91,000 as many traders took profit. Notably, this back-and-forth movement of the BTC price has given rise to the formation of a small bull pennant. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, known for his technical analyses, pointed out this formation on social media platform X. In his post, he stated , “Small Pennant Big Target,” while pointing to the formation on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. A bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that often emerges during strong uptrends. It begins with a sharp price movement (the flagpole), followed by a consolidation phase (the pennant), before potentially breaking out in the same direction as the initial trend. The emergence of this bullish pennant on Bitcoin’s 3-day chart suggests that the cryptocurrency may be gearing up for another leg higher. However, the formation suggests that the Bitcoin price could still continue to consolidate for a while as the liquidity in the pennant is yet to be filled. Nonetheless, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis highlights the longer-term implications of this formation. According to his projections, once Bitcoin completes its consolidation and breaks out of the pennant, it could surge toward an ambitious price target of $145,000. The $145,000 price target has become somewhat recurring among crypto analysts. For instance, this price target also made its way into an analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino, whose analysis pointed to the Bitcoin price top for this cycle at around $145,000. $100,000 Price Target Still In Play At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at $96,070 and is up by 0.5% in the past 24 hours but down by 3.3% in the past seven days. The possibility of the Bitcoin price reaching the $100,000 price mark is not a matter of if at this point but of when. Speaking of when, the BTC price is about to witness another catalyst that could finally send it above $100,000. Bitcoin is about to undergo its largest monthly options expiry of 2024 on Friday, involving a total exposure of $13.6 billion. This expiry event could provide the momentum needed for bullish traders to drive Bitcoin’s price past the $100,000 milestone in the coming week.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-forms-bullish/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
