The organization aims to spur blockchain development in the transport industry by creating applications for supply chain and logistics processes, asset tracking, and transaction ledgers, according to a press release. Penske became a corporate member of the alliance on Jan. 15.  The company specifically may work on creating applications for its food and beverage transports, as well as for its manufacturing division.  Senior vice president of global products Andy Moses said the company planned to study blockchain technology as part of their joining the alliance.  He said:  ""We've joined BiTA to take part in better understanding the benefits of blockchain for our customers and to be a part of crafting the standard framework in the development and implementation of blockchain technology.”  Penske joins companies such as United Parcel Service in the consortium. Last year, UPS announced it was joining to help develop standards for blockchain platforms, including on how to use the tech to facilitate payments.  At the time, the consortium was called the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, and focused its energies specifically on that industry.

According to cybersecurity reearcher Kevin Beaumont, the attacker hijacked BlackWallet’s domain name system (DNS) server over the weekend, adding a piece of code which transferred any deposits of 20 or more lumens into another wallet.  Bleeping Computer reported that the attacker secured nearly 670,000 lumens, worth about $444,000 at press time.  Shortly after stealing the lumens, the hackers began moving the funds out of the wallet they were being stored in. Just under 100 lumens remained in the wallet as of 7:30 p.m. UTC Monday.  A reddit user claiming to be Blackwallet’s creator said in a statement that his hosting provider account had been compromised, which led to the hack. He went on to say he had contacted his provider and asked for the site to be taken down.  As of press time, BlackWallet was inaccessible.  The site’s creator said a large amount of the stolen funds were sent to an account at the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex. While he tried to contact the exchange, it is unclear whether Bittrex has frozen the stolen funds.  In the statement, the creator said:  ""I am sincerely sorry about this and hope that we will get the funds back.

Speaking at an event in Frankfurt, the banker said cryptocurrencies instead be overseen on a global scale, with regulators harmonizing their rules together.  To that end, Wuermeling said that such a state of affairs could only be reached in the event of heightened cooperation.  He was quoted as saying:  “Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited.”  His remarks follow developments out of China and South Korea on the regulatory front. Notably, South Korea was reportedly planning to shut down exchanges, though those rumors were later walked back by the president’s office.  However, South Korea is acting on new regulations to slow down speculative investing in cryptocurrencies by forcing banks to comply with new know-your-customer rules and imposing fines on investors who refuse to cease using anonymous virtual for cryptocurrencies.

It's a notable spin on the sandbox model, which sees institutions enabling firms to test financial products in a limited setting and under the auspices of regulators.  Marius Jurgilas, a member of the central bank's board, said in a statement:  ""Blockchain technology has a tremendous adaptation potential for innovations conducive to consumers in both the financial and public sectors. Giving room to regulated development of this technology would provide our country with particularly favorable opportunities for investment and attraction of talents as well as acceleration of advanced innovations.""

Gox have brought a lawsuit against the company for the loss of 9,500 bitcoins – an amount worth around $133 million at today's prices.  The case, first filed by Dr. Donald and his son Dr. Chris Raggio on March 5, 2014, was brought against a series of entities and individuals including Jed McCaleb and Mark Karpeles, the former owners of Mt. Gox. The defendants had filed a motion for summary judgment, but it was denied on Nov. 16, 2017. The two subsequently appealed the decision last month.  According to the court document, Donald Raggio first registered on the Mt. Gox exchange around December 2010, at a time when bitcoin was trading at below $1, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index shows.  Yet email correspondence between Donald Raggio and McCaleb indicated that soon after, in January 2011, both became aware that someone moved the 9,500 bitcoins out of Donald's account.  While it was not clear how the account was accessed, McCaleb appears to have been involved in helping Raggio investigate the issue after he reported the loss. The court documents show that an investigation led to a potential suspect named ""Baron,"" who denied the accusation after his account was frozen.  Then, in February 2011, McCaleb sold the Mt. Gox exchange to Karpeles, who later claimed that he inherited Mt. Gox's assets, not its liabilities, from his predecessor.  It wasn't until after Mr. Gox declared its notable bankruptcy in 2014 that Donald and Chris Raggio brought the lawsuit against the firm.  The defendants in the case have since argued that the case should be time-barred due to the statute of limitations in the Mississippi State, since it was filed three years and 54 days after the reported loss.

Data source OnChainFX say the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 4 percent in the last 24 hours, while week-on-week, bitcoin cash has yielded -2 percent returns. As of writing, BCH is trading at $2,372 – that's down 45 percent from its all-time high of $4,330 set on Dec. 20.  BCH witnessed an upside break of the congestion last Wednesday, but the follow-through has been anything but encouraging. Contrary to expectations, the cryptocurrency failed to see a sustained move above $2,800 on Thursday.  Prices then briefly jumped to $2,884 on Saturday, but again closed (as per UTC) well below the $2,800 mark, marking another failure at key resistance.  The price action is referred to as ""fakeout"" – that is, when prices fail to rally following a bullish breakout and actually drop. A fakeout usually ends up turning the tide in favor of the bears.  Still, while a cause of concern for the bulls, the bitcoin cash chart shows no reason to panic.  Bitcoin cash chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Fakeout (failed bullish breakout) as discussed above.  Prices have re-entered the sideways channel, neutralizing the immediate outlook.  The 50-day moving average is still bullish (sloping upwards).  The rising trend line is intact and could offer support at $1,880 levels.  View  A downside break of the sideways channel (i.e. a close (as per UTC) below $2,300) would indicate the sell-off from the record high of $4,104 has resumed. Prices could then test rising trendline support of $1,880. The trendline support is seen sloping upwards to $2,000 over the next week.  On the higher side, a close (as per UTC) above $2,950.70 (Jan. 11 high) could yield a rally to $3,319 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement).

42380242,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaND,1516022426,End of Inflation? The Radical Vision of Futures-Backed Cryptocurrency,"Veteran user experience designer James Zdralek is on a mission to reimagine the way central banks run, using cryptocurrencies.  Part psychologist, part accountant, part industrial designer, the innovator working with user experience at enterprise software firm SAP has devised a way to merge cryptocurrency with modern financial instruments that could make national currencies appreciate in value.  But in exchange for this brave new world of banking, central banks could risk losing the monetary control they exercise when large-scale problems threaten an economy. More than that, they could undermine their own existence.  Simply put, this new breed of national currencies would be backed by cryptocurrencies that are in turn backed by the actual output of a nation's industries. This network of cryptocurrencies could theoretically result not only in a natural interest rate – reflecting actual market conditions rather than policymakers' wishes – but also built-in stability, Zdralek told CoinDesk.  ""Those two things combined, would be much better than bitcoin, much better than fiat currency,"" he said.  Since completing an early version of his research last year, Zdralek has shopped the idea to central banks at SAP's Executive Central Banking Summit in May and at Sibos in October, and he's now turning his attention to members of academia to further explore the concept.  If successful, Zdralek believes the campaign within SAP's experimental Ideation Center in Canada could eventually result in the end of inflation and the movement of the resulting lost value into the hands of the people who actually spend that money.  ""This is a beyond-the-edge concept which is uncomfortable for some people,"" Zdralek told CoinDesk, adding:  ""In my opinion, this is a good warm-up before the big race.""  'Simple complexity'  The biggest obstacle Zdralek said he's faced since taking his ideas on the road has been people's difficulty understanding the proposal.  Originally released to the publichttps://www.sap.com/canada/documents/2017/10/f62ebcc7-d97c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html in October by the SAP Ideation Center, the 44-page paper lays out how users could interact with the seemingly complex system as easily as they swipe a debit card.  ""It ends up being the same simple kind of monetary system on the surface,"" said Zdralek. ""But behind the scenes, it's more complex to create a very stable value and natural interest rate.""  Such stability relies on underlying ""representative currencies"" that function similarly to how government currencies like the U.S. dollar used to be redeemable for gold. But instead, the new currency would be backed by assets traded on a blockchain.  By mitigating the role of a central issuer, these currencies would compete for users in an economy driven by blockchain-enabled smart contracts that automatically trade maturing futures forward.  Specifically, Zdralek's work would require three asset types to be embedded into crypto-tokens.  The first type of currency is backed by shares representing the ownership of a factory. The second is backed by the inventory of a company, and would give users a stake in what the report calls the ""stored output of that factory.""  In Zdralek's concept, central bankers or other currency issuers would then create a third currency backed by a specific kind of future called a prepaid forward contract that aggregates the futures-backed cryptocurrencies.  Zdralek argued that, like with a mutual fund, this third currency could produce an extremely stable value and natural interest rate, growing the economy without the creation of bubbles. In other words, instead of value being degraded by an inflation rate imposed by the central bank, citizens who hold the currency might actually receive a return on its value – or at least would not lose it.  From the original report:  ""Adding only the first two types of currency to a blockchain infrastructure would still require a traditional banking industry to facilitate debt, adjust the size of the money supply and to finance new ventures. The third type, futures-back currency, can replace these functions.""  Existing interest  While the idea of a central bank willingly adopting a technology that might make some of its services unnecessary might seem far-fetched, already a considerable number of central banks have explored its use.  Among the earliest central banks interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain have been those whose legacy systems have been of concern for fraud and corruption.  The central banks of Ukraine and Venezuela, which have both experienced recent corruption concerns, are among the first such institutions to take steps towards issuing their own cryptocurrencies. And Barbados has already issued a cryptocurrency pegged to its dollar as part of a larger effort to fight concerns the nation is a risk for money laundering.  While larger central banks such as the Bank of England and the Central Bank of Canada have also expressed interest in so-called central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, they each have recently backed off those efforts to focus on other blockchain use cases.  But Zdralek hopes his concept could have an impact, bringing them back around to the idea.  ""Central banks are very measured and slow, but they're not blind,"" Zdralek told CoinDesk. ""So, they are doing their research, they're looking at how things are going to change, and they're going to take a measured pace at it.""  He added:  ""But it's definitely a thing where change is coming.""  Ending inflation  While such an evolution would certainly affect the way central banks do business, the potential benefits extend all the way down to the way normal people invest.  At the highest level, potential benefits of a Central Bank cryptocurrency include a central bank including saving money on the cost of issuing a currency and a smaller targeted inflation rate, according to Dong He, the deputy director of the International Monetary Fund.  Speaking at the Central Bank Summit on Blockchain, hosted by blockchain startup Ripple in November, he described the potential risks and benefits to a crowd that included central bankers from as far away as Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong.  ""The balance of benefits and costs surely needs further study,"" he said.  But to Zdralek, there's a much simpler reason for central banks to adopt: the costs of inflation, even among the stablest economies in the world. While the problem of money losing value over time is not new, Zdralek believes he's finally discovered a way to end it with blockchain technology.  In interview, Zdralek posited that the return rate resulting from his idea for a futures-backed cryptocurrency could not only help stabilize inflation, but actually increase the value of the retirement savings for those who can't afford an investment advisor.  While people in their 60s now may be able to retire comfortably with a million dollars in savings, Zdralek said that won't always be the case. And instead of waiting for someone else to fix the problem, he believes a smarter currency could do it.  ""A million dollars is going to be poverty level in the long term of things,"" he said, concluding:  ""That's where a stable currency with a natural interest rate and a natural type of inflation can help.""

42380253,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mab3,1516017614,$15K in Sight? Bitcoin Prices Gather Upside Traction,"Bitcoin looks set to explore a move towards $15,000 levels in the next 24 hours.  Having defended $13,000 on Friday, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index rose to a high of $14,536 on Saturday before once more retreating to $13,051.59 yesterday. As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $13,727 levels – up 0.80 percent in the last 24 hours.  Meanwhile, data source OnChainFX says the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 11 percent on a weekly basis. The decline is being largely attributed to fears of cryptocurrency trading ban at South Korean exchanges – a possibility that is looking less certain after new statements from the government.  Despite those concerns, bitcoin (BTC) still managed to defend the ascending trendline (drawn from Nov. 13 low and Dec. 22 low).  Further, it appears that money is being rotated out of the alternative currencies and back into bitcoin. For instance, the TRON token has depreciated by 31 percent in the last 24 hours. A look at the individual markets shows sharp losses in the TRX/BTChttps://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=TRX_BTC (TRON-bitcoin) pair. The decline across such cross-cryptocurrency pairs could limit the downside in bitcoin.  The price action analysis indicates scope for a move higher to the upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA) level of $14,690.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC continues to defend the rising trendline (drawn from Nov. 13 low and Dec. 22 low).  The 5-day and 10-day MAs slope downwards, while the 50-day MA favors the bulls.  Triangle pattern (narrowing price range due to lower tops and higher bottoms).  View  Repeated failure on the part of the bears to cut through trendline support adds credence to the bullish (upward sloping) 50-day and 10-week MAs, and could yield a rally to $14,690 (50-day MA) or even $15,000.  Further gains will face resistance, courtesy of the bearish short-term moving averages (5-day and 10-day MAs).  A close (as per UTC) above $16,000 (triangle resistance) would indicate the rally from Nov. 12 low of $5511.11 has resumed. Prices could then have potential to revisit record highs of $20,000.  On the other hand, if prices close (as per UTC) below $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) bitcoin may be looking down towards $10,000–$8,000.

The unnamed authorities said that cryptocurrency investors and traders will be allowed to convert their virtual accounts to real-name accounts before the end of January, but if this is not done, they will be fined, according to a Yonhap News report.  The amount of the penalty has not yet been finalized, the report indicates.  The news was announced as Korean banks move to phase out anonymous virtual currency accounts in line with the government's stated plan to calm what it perceives as an overheated cryptocurrency market.  According to The Korea Times, however, Shinhan Bank said Jan. 12 it does not intend to introduce an identity verification service for deposits and withdrawals from virtual bank accounts – effectively ruling out the opening of new virtual accounts, even with identification.  An official from Shinhan Bank reportedly said:  ""We've developed a system to introduce identifying virtual account customers in accordance with the government's efforts to curb the cryptocurrency craze.

42380255,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaW1,1516010418,Indonesia Central Bank: Cryptocurrency Payments 'Not Legitimate',"Bank Indonesia has warned that cryptocurrencies may not be used for payments in the country.  The central bank published a press release on Saturday, stating that cryptocurrencies are not a ""legitimate instrument of payment"" in the country, as they do not comply with the 2011 currency act and are not issued by the Republic of Indonesia.  ""Financial transactions conducted within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, has to be fulfilled with Rupiah,"" the currency act states.  As a result, the central bank said that payment firms are not allowed to make virtual currency transactions.  The central bank states:  ""Bank Indonesia affirms that it forbids all payment system operator (principal, switching operator, clearing operator, final settlement operator, issuer, acquirer, payment gateway operator, electronic wallet operator, money transfer operator) and financial technology operators in Indonesia, both bank and non-bank institution, to process transactions using virtual currency, as stated in Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 18/40/PBI/2016 on Implementation of Payment Transaction Processing and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 19/12/PBI/2017 on Implementation of Financial Technology.""  The warning makes no mention of cryptocurrency exchanges.  The news comes after the central bank revealed in early December 2017 that it was considering new regulations that would outlaw bitcoin transactions from 2018.  On the 20th of the same month, the bank issued a new regulation – No. 19/12/PBI/2017 on Implementation of Financial Technology – due to concerns over bitcoin's potential use in terrorism financing, money laundering and drug trafficking.  In its latest warning, Bank Indonesia also warned ""all parties"" that buying, selling or trading cryptocurrencies come with ""high risks,"" as they are ""highly volatile"" and do not have backing from an authority, or underlying assets to support prices.  The note reads: ""This means that virtual currencies are vulnerable to bubble risks, and susceptible to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing, therefore can potentially impact financial system stability and cause financial harm to society.""  With the new notice, Bank Indonesia joins a number of global central banks in issuing warnings as the prices of cryptocurrencies have soared amid what many in traditional finance have labelled a bubble. Countries including the U.K., India, Russia and more have recently cautioned investors and traders over the perceived risks involved in cryptocurrencies.

42380248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaXH,1516006839,Blockchain in the Boardroom: Toward Enterprise Deployment,"Iliana Oris Valiente (CPA, CA, CBP) is a managing director and global blockchain innovation lead for Accenture's emerging tech division. She is also the founder and chair of the board at ColliderX Blockchain R&D Hub.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      While the price of cryptocurrencies and the ICO market tend to steal the spotlight, behind the scenes a growing number of enterprise businesses are evaluating blockchain technology.  These companies seek to enhance the business processes that impact our everyday lives.  Examples are processes that enable us to:  Deliver products from a supplier to our homes in time for the holidays  Make sure that financial payments are processed on time  Provide music and media content for entertainment while making sure the royalties reach the artists  Trace the quality and provenance of food from farm to table.  Large enterprise adoption of blockchain technology may not initially make as many waves as electronic peer-to-peer cash, but in many ways it's just as important.  For anyone who attended CoinDesk's Consensus conference in May, the growth in the number of attendees in business attire (relative to the number of technologists in the proverbial hoodies and jeans) did not go unnoticed. From the introduction of this nascent technology a few years ago, it's taken some time for the enterprise community to take a closer look and to recognize that many of the principles of blockchain technology, originally utilized in the bitcoin protocol, could be leveraged in the enterprise world.  For those unfamiliar, the enterprise blockchain adoption timeline looks something like this:  2013-2014 was characterized as a period of learning, understanding the distinction between bitcoin, the currency, and the underlying protocol.  2015 introduced the concept of permissioned or consortium blockchains, as well as the term DLT (distributed ledger technology).  2016 was the year of the prototype or POC (proof of concept), where success was measured based on how many use cases for an industry or company could be identified.  2017 was braver, focusing on how companies could move beyond a POC and into a pilot, in preparation for production-level deployment.  The state of play  Additionally, it was a year of technical advances that will enable those pilots to go further. Enterprise-grade version 1.0 implementations were released by Hyperledger Fabric and R3's Corda.  It could also be argued that periphery and supporting institutions such as law firms, regulators, insurers and other necessary (yet ancillary) organizations began to realize the benefits of blockchain. For example, today, many lawyers are studying the technology as a way to enhance the time it takes to finalize patents or resolve contract disputes (via smart contracts.)  Working at Accenture, we have the good fortune collaborating with some of the world’s largest organizations (our clients span the full range of industries including more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500).  Accenture’s blockchain practice incorporates alliances, partnerships and leadership positions in every aspect of the blockchain ecosystem including the Hyperledger project, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI), the Hashed Health Consortium, plus a variety of start-ups, and open-source communities.  We have a neutral, big-picture view of the blockchain ecosystem.  As a result, that enables our team to make educated observations about a wide range of technology trends. For example, whereas the interest in blockchain tech started with financial institutions, this year we’ve seen growth in adoption across industries. Some of the most impactful use cases were found in the supply chain, identity management and the public sector – especially around registries (with Delaware, Estonia, and the Province of Ontario for instance).  The one sentence summary that best describes the journey of enterprise adoption of blockchain tech and where this is all headed in 2018:  ""Clients have moved beyond learning about blockchain and the disrupters are creating strategies to achieve real business transformation.""  2017's FAQs  Put another way, enterprise clients have become more educated about blockchain.  In my practice at Accenture, this evolution is clear from the increasingly more sophisticated questions they ask us — a telling marker of the progress made and an indicator of what we can expect to see in 2018.  Beyond the technical specifications of what blockchain technology can do and how certain configurations are more advantageous, some of the most interesting questions that arise are not actually technology driven.  Rather, they mostly relate to the strategic shifts needed and corresponding change management.  Yet, our forward-thinking clients are wrestling with key questions based on how they, and their ecosystems, could transform business processes using blockchain technology.  These include:  If this is not just a technology, but rather a paradigm shift, what will our business look like in 10 years?  Given that this is a network technology, how do we find and participate in the relevant consortiums?  On a use case specific basis, how do we identify and align interests with other stakeholders?  Will these new blockchain-powered networks be run as a separate business venture of sorts?  How do we find and develop talent in a decentralized world? (We’re seeing investments made in academic partnerships, research initiatives, and training)  Why reinvent the wheel?  Arguably, in addition to everything listed above, one of the most powerful questions I encourage our enterprise clients to ask is, ""What are we NOT thinking about?""  My response to the question above is simple; look at the new frontier of blockchain startups and initiatives that are related to your industry, but that are being incubated, tested and deployed outside of the enterprise community. These are oftentimes the open source, public blockchain projects that are re-imagining the way the world operates.  As a technology agnostic partner to our clients – we see the startups pitching their products to clients, or to us as potential systems integration partners.  In my view, as a result of our involvement across the blockchain spectrum, it’s becoming harder to ignore the parallels between the products being built by generation 2.0 blockchain companies and the systems we have in place today. Many blockchain startups initially started to compete with incumbents, only to realize that partnerships are the way to go to rapidly implement the solutions they offer. Others never set out to compete, and rather design new-world products targeting a different demographic of users.  The most obvious examples relate to the new crop of wealth management firms and products specifically designed for crypto assets, carrying out many of the functions of what existing financial institutions provide for traditional assets. Other examples include the ConsenSys hub-and-spoke method and their roster of decentralized projects.  Many blockchain ventures are, in fact, attempting to tackle the very problems our clients are trying to address.  Take Balanc3 – a next generation ERP system that seeks to tackle the construction of a triple-entry accounting system. Or Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), which run on the Brave platform, designed by Brendan Eich and the team that brought you JavaScript and Mozilla Firefox.  BAT seeks to modernize the publisher-advertiser-consumer relationship through the use of tokens between advertisers, publishers and users. Another example is DataWallet, the Draper-backed consumer-to-business data exchange that connects consumers directly with businesses.  When companies like these are mentioned in the boardroom, I am often met with blank stares. The blank stares are completely understandable. Established business with established business processes operate in a separate and distinct world from many of the new blockchain technology startups. In their defense, many blockchain startups are doomed to failure.  Anecdotally, they are often run by entrepreneurs with big ideas who lack the industry knowledge to understand the dynamics of the markets they are disrupting, the network effects or the regulatory complexity that takes a seemingly simple process and buries it in compliance. And that’s fine, 99% of startups fail – that shouldn’t be different in cryptocurrency world.  However, these initiatives could be wildly successful in 2018 because they are starting from scratch, funded through the increased gains of the crypto market or ICO funding – rather than by VCs or enterprise partnerships. Indeed, some of these business models are intentionally (or accidentally) defying the odds of what we would predict to be successful.  At a minimum, enterprises have an opportunity to learn from the unorthodox new ventures emerging in the blockchain world – either via a post-mortem review of the successes or missteps of a blockchain startup, or (preferably) by observing what’s going on during the life cycle of the startup.  And we’re certainly seeing this starting to play out – the Spotify acquisition of Mediachain in the spring of 2017 made headlines, and is likely to be a harbinger of what’s to come.  In Spotify’s case, we had the already established disruptor to the incumbents that saw the gap and possible challenge to its own business model (and hence opportunity) from further afield, and made a strategic bet to embrace the power of blockchain technology – sooner, rather than being surprised and caught off guard later.  What now? The 2018 agenda  In all, the progress being made on the enterprise front is tremendous.  We’re seeing fewer and fewer ""blockchain for the sake of blockchain"" undertakings and more impactful projects completed, such as Accenture’s recent work with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Project Ubin.  The work on Project Ubin illustrates how blockchain technology could significantly improve the kinds of payment systems that currently enable banks around the world to transfer trillions of dollars per day to each other and help them manage their financial liquidity. Recent announcements from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) about its forthcoming use of blockchain and the continuation of Project Jasper in Canada are other concrete examples that blockchain technology is being treated as a serious contender in the ""most impactful tech"" category.  For many enterprises, the journey starts with blockchain education and strategic thinking, and will certainly also result in new business models and collaborations. When it comes to blockchain, we will not know with certainty how the future state of the technology will look.  The best recommendation is to keep moving, learning, and testing out business models. In the midst of this technology paradigm shift, it’s ok to think really big – in fact, it's imperative.

42380249,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaUl,1515999802,Bitmain Reportedly Eyeing Canada for Bitcoin Mining Expansion,"A few days after announcing a new branch in Switzerland, China’s mining giant Bitmain Technologies is considering another expansion - this time in Canada’s Quebec province.  According to a report by Reuters, Bitmain is looking at potential mining sites in Quebec and has already begun discussions with power authorities.  The new plan appears to be an addiction to Bitmain's current mining facilities overseas. The company also recently announced it was expanding to Switzerland, having already registered a new branch near the European nation’s “Crypto Valley.” At the time, Bitmain announced Switzerland would “play a key role” in its global expansion plans.  In a response to CoinDesk, Bitmain also said its mining operation in the North America region has been on since 2015 but did not reveal exact locations.  While there's no clear indication that the two events are related, Bitmain's new plan came at a time when China, the current hub of bitcoin mining with more than 70% of the network’s computing power calling it home, has recently indicated it might curb tax and power benefits miners currently enjoy.  As reported by CoinDesk previously, Quebec has become an attractive location for new bitcoin mining facilities. The region has excessive cheap hydropower to offer tech companies, including bitcoin miners. In addition, the country’s colder environment is conducive to longer lives for the ASIC machines which companies use to mine bitcoin.

42380247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaTV,1515992408,"No, You Don't Have to Buy a Whole Bitcoin","""How much is bitcoin?""  ""Around $14,000.""  ""Well, that's too expensive. I can't afford that.""  It's a conversation that has surely happened thousands of times over the past several months as a new swarm of people find themselves enchanted by the cryptocurrency space and its tremendous gains.  And it reveals not only a misunderstanding, but also a psychological barrier that many face stepping into the scene for their first time.  Since so much emphasis is placed on how much ""one"" bitcoin is worth across the industry, new users often come in thinking that if they want to participate, they'll have to fork over tens of thousands of dollars to buy a whole bitcoin.  But actually, that isn't the case – it's possible to buy a half of a bitcoin, a quarter of a bitcoin or even a fraction of a percent of a bitcoin.  Yet, that's not always clear to new people entering the market, and many believe that's why a handful of altcoins – including dogecoin and dentacoin, both of which recently reached market caps of more than $1 billion – are seeing a pump in their price, as they offer an affordable way to get into the cryptocurrency markets in whole units.  And this confusion is (partly) why developer Jimmy Song argues some standardization should occur in what the industry calls smaller units of bitcoin.  Toward this goal, Song released a standards proposal that seeks to express one one-millionth of a bitcoin (about one cent at today's prices) as a ""bit."" And he's nudging wallet providers, exchanges and other bitcoin businesses to support the proposal.  If widely adopted, he hopes it will put an end to this confusion, and make new crypto users more apt to purchase bitcoin, if even in tiny amounts, instead of cryptocurrencies that he thinks might come back to bite them, since many of the cheap altcoins don't have much technical merit to back them up.  Rise of the 'bits'  The problem now is that more traditional dollar units, such as $5, when converted to bitcoin look daunting and messy – at 0.000345 bitcoin.  But with Song's proposal – which he's released in the form of a bitcoin improvement proposal, or BIP – that dollar value would instead be 345 bits, still a mental juggle, but arguably less confusing, since it's in whole numbers and not decimals.  ""For whatever psychological reason, normal people have trouble understanding decimals and fractions. $0.002 is weirder than $200.00,"" said Erik Voorhees, co-founder and CEO of ShapeShift, which supports Song's proposal, adding:  ""For bitcoin to be a global, commonly used currency, it would certainly be helpful to have a denomination that allows people to express prices in integers (2,000 bits for a coffee) rather than a decimal.""  Adding to the mental benefits, Song also said the standardizing ""bit"" would remove what he calls ""unit bias.""  According to Song, people don't like having what looks like such a small amount of bitcoin, or money in general for that matter. Bitcoin's price rise at the end of 2017, only exacerbated that problem, adding even more zeros in between the positive numbers and the decimal.  Poking fun at all the recent bitcoin forks, Song said, a group of people could have success enticing a new wave of crypto buyers by splitting off bitcoin with the goal of moving bitcoin's decimal system six positions.  While others have proposed similar unit changes in the past, Song's proposal seems to be gaining transaction with exchanges and other companies, which is all the proposal needs to succeed – getting businesses to use the unit to display not only how much bitcoin is in an individual's wallet but also, within merchants stores, how much things cost.  And even though, Song's proposal is targeted at bitcoin, it could serve as an outline for how other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, could update their units to be more user-friendly.  Still confused?  Although the idea of the proposal is to limit confusion, it's garnered its fair share of criticism, with those against claiming it could add to the confusion instead.  The critics say, for instance, that if not all companies roll out the standard at the same time – and ShapeShift uses ""bits,"" while Coinbase sticks with ""bitcoin"" – when sending bitcoin from one wallet to another, they could either think they somehow earned money or lost money.  Voorhees, for one, even agreed this was a concern, but argued that it shouldn't stop bitcoin companies from eventually adopting the standard.  ""There will undoubtedly be some mistakes and friction as the new term gains usage, but for the purpose of language and mathematical simplification, the net result should be beneficial to bitcoin’s adoption,"" he said.  Meanwhile, Song stressed that even though he thinks it would be a move in the right direction, like most things in the cryptocurrency world, it's up to the community to decide if they want to adopt the system or not.  Still, many more exchanges and businesses would need to adopt the change to get the ball rolling. Song has been tweeting at various exchanges and companies – including CoinMarketCap, one of the most popular sites for checking cryptocurrency prices – suggesting they move to ""bits.""  Song concluded:  ""This is meant to be a community-driven initiative and the benefits will hopefully be obvious to businesses.""
