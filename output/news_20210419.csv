42434217,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA7hh,1618868860,Bitfarms Plans 210 MW Bitcoin Mining Facility in Argentina,"Publicly traded bitcoin mining company Bitfarms (TSXV:BITF, OTC:BFARF) has signed an agreement under which it can draw up to 210 megawatts of electricity for its planned mining facility in Argentina.      The initial term of the contract with a private Argentinian power producer is eight years, the company said in an announcement Monday, with an effective cost of $0.022 per kilowatt-hour for the electricity for the first four years.      In October, Bitfarms had agreed to develop a 60 MW bitcoin mining operation in Argentina, noting a “favorable year-round climate” for the facility, which the company said will be a “significant contributor” to its target of 8.0 exahash/second by the end of 2022 and “provide geographic production diversification to reduce risk.”      “Our planned expansion in Argentina is a continuation of our experience and our desire to deliver value to shareholders,” said Bitfarms President Geoffrey Morphy. “The strategic expansion provides the scale and efficiency that we were seeking.”      “With considerable low-cost power available to us over many years, we can enhance our margin performance in the short term and ensure we have a viable operation on which we can count through and after the next halving event in 2024,” Morphy said.    Read more: DMG Purchases 3,600 ASICs in North American Bitcoin Mining Expansion    According to Bitfarms’ announcement, the “210 MW is sufficient to support approximately 55,000 new-generation miners, which could generate approximately $650 million of revenues or 11,774 BTC, based on current difficulty levels and a bitcoin price of $55,000.”      Bitfarms now has five industrial-scale hydroelectric facilities in Québec, Canada, with a combined capacity of 69 MW. The company is also preparing for a Nasdaq listing in a U.S. push.    Bitcoin mining expansion in the Americas    In recent months, Bitfarms has purchased tens of thousands of bitcoin mining machines as part of its wider expansion efforts. In early March, it disclosed plans to buy 48,000 MicroBT mining machines. A “substantial portion” of those miners are destined for the Argentinian facility, Bitfarms said Monday.      Bitfarms also announced Friday that it had purchased an additional 1,996 new MicroBT mining machines, which will be installed through August and will provide an extra 160 petahash per second.      According to Ben Gagnon, director of mining operations at Bitfarms, there has never been as much capital ready to be used in North American markets as there is right now as a result of coronavirus lockdowns.      “How do you invest capital in a market like this? Bitcoin mining is the perfect candidate,"" he told CoinDesk ""It has quick ROIs (return on investments), is capitally intense, can utilize turn-key infrastructure and produce an asset that requires no customers and is appreciating in value faster than anything else they can produce.""      The company isn’t alone in its moves toward increasing the mining footprint of North American firms. Other industrial-scale miners such as Marathon, Riot and Blockcap have purchased tens of thousands of machines in recent weeks. On Monday, DMG Blockchain Solutions, another publicly traded Canadian bitcoin mining company, purchased 3,600 application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Cameron Hood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/19/bitfarms-plans-210-mw-bitcoin-mining-facility-in-argentina,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f21dbf47e9e3bdb6330a0c9f3d7c2a57c611169-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether declined, while the meme-y alternative cryptocurrency dogecoin saw double-digit percentage price appreciation.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $56,026 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.30% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,680-$57,456 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC near the 10-hour but below the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin suffered a price drop on Monday, dipping to as low as $54,680 before recovering somewhat, to $56,026 as of press time      “The crypto markets witnessed a sudden dip over the weekend, when BTC dropped before recovering about half of that by day end,” noted David Lifchitz, CIO and partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha.      Bitcoin volumes on major exchanges that encompass the CoinDesk 20 had a banner day Sunday when viewed through the prism of the past three months. Volumes on the CoinDesk 20 eight spot BTC venues was over $8 billion for the first time since Feb. 23, when volumes surpassed $12 billion. Volumes were much lower Monday, at below $4 billion as of press time.      The majority of volume Sunday was related to derivatives, noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin.      Liquidations, the crypto equivalent of a margin call, approached the $10 billion mark Sunday across all digital assets according to data aggregator Bybt. The leveraged wipeouts are a record level that surpasses a previous record set in February.      “As usual, the primary reason was a combination of over-leveraged derivative traders,” Lau told CoinDesk.      Traders are obviously trying to peer into the future to see where BTC will head this week after the dump. It may take a recovery to over $60,000 for the market to expand due to increased retail interest again while whales will scoop up more of the asset if it heads back towards $50,000, according to ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz.      “Bitcoin is stuck in the $50,000-$60,000 twilight zone,” said Lifchitz. “Above $60,000 it's the retail FOMO, or Fear Of Missing Out, frenzy. Below $50,000 lay the institutional dip buyers.”      According to CoinDesk 20 data, bitcoin has closed at over $60,000 only seven days, all of them in March and April. It has not closed below $50,000 since March 6.      The Coinbase direct listing last week might add some padding to the market as newer investors find increased interest in crypto, said Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of crypto market maker Velvetformula.      “Retail investors are finally in the game with all the buzz around the Coinbase listing,” Alefirenko said.      Read More: Coinbase Going Public Isn’t Selling Out – It’s the Start of a Long Game      However, there is still some potential for downside risk. “The bull definitely wants to take a breather,” ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz concluded. “Should the $50,000 level break, dip buyers would be submerged by sellers, then $30,000 looks like the obvious next stop, but we are not there yet.”      OKCoin’s Lau sees long-term bullish fundamentals, however, given continued positive statements from central banks regarding crypto. He pointed to China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as an example.      “Longer term, the prospects for bitcoin remain bright, buoyed by encouraging statements by the PBOC that bitcoin is emerging as an investable asset class,” Lau said. “This potentially marks a shift in tone towards bitcoin from the world's second largest economy's central bank.”    Ether dips as investors await relief from fee quagmire    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Monday trading around $2,182 and falling 0.53% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Since the start of 2021, ether’s price has appreciated over 208% as of CoinDesk daily closing price information from Jan. 1 to April 18.      Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of investment firm Ether Capital, says despite some red on the trading screens in the past few days, investors are bullish, anticipating a solution to Ethereum’s fee problems. Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which is expected to help solve constraints in the network’s decentralized application functionality due to high fees, should be arriving in the next few months.      Read More: Ethereum’s ‘EIP 1559’ Fee Market Overhaul Greenlit for July      “I think EIP 1559 in the summer and the ETH2 merge getting prioritized is very bullish on the ETH value proposition, but this is more of a longer-term six- to 12-month play,” Coolican told CoinDesk.    Other markets    The perennial meme-maker token dogecoin experienced big-time gains Monday. It rose more than 19% the past day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The rise comes ahead of what some fans of the token have been referring to as “Dogeday,” on Tuesday seen as an occasion for celebrating the token, and perhaps pumping its price. (The date also happens to be April 20, an occasion for celebration by marijuana enthusiasts.)      Ether Capital’s Coolican also noted solana (SOL) was a surprise gainer over the past 24 hours, with data aggregator CoinGecko tallying a 13% gain for the blockchain development project over the past 24 hours. “SOL seemed to be one of the only tokens that was actually bid this weekend as everything else was getting crushed,” he said. “Not sure why.”      Read More: Dogecoin Eclipses XRP as 4th-Largest Cryptocurrency Ahead of ‘Dogeday’      Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the red Monday.

42434192,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA11h,1618859917,Consolidations Are Coming to Crypto,"If I were going to guess on an acquisition in the cryptocurrency business, I'd pick the newly listed Coinbase picking up Dharma, the user-friendly on-ramp to decentralized finance (DeFi).      This is entirely a guess. It hit me while writing about a post-Nasdaq Coinbase, in a world where crypto has gone mainstream. My thinking went like this: Coinbase may not actually see DeFi as a threat, but it must see it as a business opportunity. What company seems to be directionally aligned with Coinbase? Dharma came immediately to mind. Both firms are devoted to easy access and good user experience.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    I could be wrong; I'm probably wrong! But here's what I'm not wrong about: Consolidations are coming fast and hard to the blockchain industry. Consolidation and centralization aren't quite the same, but they have been known to sing in the same band and their harmony is pretty good.      When companies get big it becomes easier to acquire new business lines than start them. It's become such a big part of Silicon Valley that the research firm CB Insights closely tracks acquisitions by the tech giants, such as Google, Apple and Amazon. The whole insight of the ""startup"" concept is that little companies are better than big ones at initiating ideas and then iterating on them until they work.      Once they do, it's easier for the big guns to write a check than copy (usually). We have already seen a certain amount of consolidation in crypto and more money and people will only accelerate it.    It’s happening    Whether or not it's going to pick up Dharma, Coinbase has bought Bison Trails, Routefire and Tagomi. It's printing money at a rate that it could clearly pick up more and has easy access to capital now that it’s on the public markets.      In other news, Lightyear, the for-profit company building on the Stellar protocol, picked up Chain.      Tendermint purchased B-Harvest.      PayPal bought Curv.      FTX brought in Blockfolio.      Kraken bought an exchange in Australia, Bit Trade, and Binance bought one in Indonesia, WazirX.      The issuer of stablecoin TrueUSD has been purchased by ... someone.      And, oh yes, CoinDesk bought TradeBlock and our corporate parent, Digital Currency Group, bought the Luno Wallet.      Everybody is hooking up. In fact, the abacuses at PriceWaterhouseCoopers totted up $1.1 billion in mergers and acquisitions across crypto in 2020. Look for 2021 to be much larger.      Right now, two different tokens are in the process of merging on Ethereum. Project Keanu is a proposed protocol merger between Keep and Nucypher, though, uniquely, the companies will remain distinct, building separate ways to interface with the same underlying network.      Similarly, DeFi projects keep glomming onto Yearn Finance like some sort of strange rat king for yield: No one really knows what it quite means to merge into that particular ecosystem but no one can doubt that it's formidable.      An era of consolidation is coming, where companies will start coming together like Voltron into giant machines of borderless liquidity, tossing about energy swords of value and smashing lion-faced fists into traditional intermediaries and financial markets.      Which all sounds very exciting, but then you're still left with Voltron (he's nice on the show, of course, but this is blockchain).    The downside    That is, you're left with a big, powerful thing. Something so powerful that it doesn't need to care much about individuals. It might not even care about groups.      Look, this is the part of the essay where I should make some bold and specific prediction that will sound prescient now or at least feel truthy, but that's why I started with a bold prediction, because I'm not going to make one here.      If Coinbase does not, in fact, buy Dharma, it doesn't really matter. Coinbase is going to buy things, for sure. And with the success of its public market debut, other crypto companies are sure to follow and they will also do what public companies do: They will buy things.      I can't tell you exactly what shape things will take when the money washing into this space inevitably congeals into the inevitable crypto mega-platforms. All I can say is that will happen.

42434202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA1Lh,1618855934,Tether's Report Card Offers Less Detail Than Rivals',"Stablecoin issuer Tether recently surprised critics. Accounting company Moore Cayman, part of the Moore Global accountancy network, attested that Tether had enough assets to back its liabilities.      Tether fans were quick to celebrate the attestation report on social media while critics cast doubt on it.      As well versed as the cryptocurrency community is in abstruse matters of confirmation times and chain forks, it is not as well acquainted with the obscurities of the accounting profession. To understand how an attestation brings value to a stablecoin, we need to delve a bit into the accounting.    The problem of trusting stablecoins    People drawn to cryptocurrency tend to be skeptical of centralization. Stay in crypto long enough and odds are you’ll have been hacked or scammed. All of this makes for a fairly suspicious lot.      No wonder that stablecoin issuers, which keep reserves at traditional banks, have become magnets for doubt. Cryptocurrency users, long habituated to verifying everything on a blockchain, can't get any insight into the nature of the assets backing stablecoins.      To allay these suspicions, stablecoin issuers including Gemini, Circle, and Paxos have adopted the practice of issuing periodic attestation reports. Each month the issuer asks its auditor to form an opinion on the value of the reserves used to back the stablecoin. The auditor's opinion is published on the issuer's website for everyone to see.    Read more: JP Koning: Regulation Could Actually Help Tether    But not Tether.      Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin, USDT, has never bothered with the practice of securing regular attestations from accounting companies.      This omission has only fueled percolating speculation that Tether's assets were lacking. For years Tether has been dogged by rumors it doesn’t have enough investments to back the stablecoins it has put into circulation. In statements to the New York Attorney General's office in 2019, the company admitted that only 74% of its assets were held in the form of cash and cash equivalents, the other 26% being a loan to help out its ailing affiliate, Bitfinex.      Even though Tether has provided very little transparency, that didn’t stop the cryptocurrency community from building up a big dependency on the stablecoin (with almost USDT worth $50 billion now issued). Binance and other centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in Asia rely on tether stablecoins in place of actual dollar accounts. Meanwhile, decentralized finance tools have gobbled up large amounts of tether as a stable form of collateral.      This has created a strange situation in which the very same community that champions the moniker ""don't trust, verify"" is actually doing a lot of trusting, not verifying.      Tether's attestation report and its promise to provide more reports going forward is a move in a new, and much better, direction. By providing more transparency to end users concerning the value of its assets, Tether is making an effort to bring itself up to industry standard.    'It's just an attestation, not an audit'    But many in the cryptocurrency community remain skeptical. How solid is an attestation?      The accounting industry's role is to provide the public with a degree of assurance about the quality of a corporation or organization's information. The most intensive level of assurance is provided by an audit.      In an audit, the auditor's customer begins by asserting something like ""here are my quarterly financial statements"" or ""here is the value of my stablecoin reserves."" And then the auditor examines the assertion by carefully gathering evidence. Once it has completed its audit, the auditor publishes a letter with its opinion on the accuracy of management's claim.      When Tether hired Moore Cayman to verify its reserves, Tether asserted that it had total assets of ""at least US$35,276,327,156."" And then Moore Cayman examined this claim using the same standards that it would have if it were tasked with auditing Tether's annual financial statements.      Auditors aren’t supposed to blindly rely on management's representations. They corroborate information by not only verifying that the actual numbers are correct but also testing the client's internal systems and procedures to ensure they are working properly.    Read more: What a Transparent Tether Means for Bitcoin    In the case of a stablecoin attestation engagement, a prudent auditor would go beyond checking with the stablecoin’s banker that account balances are sufficient. Testing the stablecoin's smart contracts and observing its minting and burning functionality would also be key to forming an audit opinion.      Accounting firms are not perfect. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) is the U.S. public agency responsible for auditing the auditors. In the PCAOB's most recent round of inspections, 25% of public company audits had some sort of deficiency.      Deficiencies do not necessarily mean the auditor’s final opinion was wrong. Only 3% of the audits the PCAOB inspected had deficiencies leading to an incorrect opinion. Also, the PCAOB chooses the riskiest audits to inspect, so its findings are not indicative of average audit quality.      In Canada, the Canadian Public Accountability Board (CPAB) has many of the same responsibilities as the PCAOB. During 2020, the CPAB found that 29% of the audits it inspected were deficient in the application of generally accepted auditing standards. Out of the four largest firms, only 8% of inspected audits were deficient, attaining the CPAB’s 10% target.      So examinations are not 100% trustworthy. Auditor EY’s failure to spot fraud at Wirecard for a full decade is a reminder of this. Even so, audits remain the best source of non-blockchain assurance that we have. A stablecoin that publishes an attestation report from an auditor is safer than one that doesn’t.    Still the laggard on transparency    Unfortunately, the degree of information that Tether revealed in its attestation engagement is disappointing and falls short of what competing stablecoin issuers have chosen to reveal.      According to CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De, Tether will provide quarterly attestation reports. That means for the intervening 89 days, a cryptocurrency user can only guess the status of Tether's reserves.      Compare this to competing stablecoins like TrueUSD and TrueGBP, which provide 24/7 real-time reserve attestations courtesy of auditor Armanino. Can’t sleep on a Saturday night and want to see if your stablecoin is still well backed? Armanino will provide an attestation. (TrueUSD's attestation functionality is temporarily disconnected as it goes through a change in ownership.) The brainchild of Armanino's Noah Buxton and Jeremey Nau, 24/7 attestations rely on application programming interfaces, or APIs, that pull information every 30 seconds about the stablecoin’s reserves from its bank account.      Tether's attestation report is also disappointing because it only provides information about the quantity of its reserves, not the quality.      In competitor stablecoin Gemini's attestation report, Gemini asserts that its reserves are held in accounts at State Street Bank within a ""money market fund managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, invested only in U.S. Treasury Obligations.""      That's an impressive amount of transparency.      In the case of Paxos Standard, it attests that its reserves are held in the form of deposits at U.S. depository institutions or in the form of U.S. Treasurys.      But Tether only makes an assertion about the total size of its assets. Unlike Gemini and Paxos, it tells us nothing about their composition. Is it holding safe Treasury bills? Dogecoin?      So while it is certainly good news that Tether is catching up to its competitors by providing attestation reports, it remains the laggard when it comes to transparency. Not all attestation reports are equal, and Tether's remains the least informative of the bunch.

Cipolaro published the comments after bitcoin (BTC) tumbled from a record high above $64,000 last week to as low as $51,541 early Sunday. The largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $55,400 as of 4:37 UTC (12:37 p.m. ET).      Bitcoin's price is still up 89% this year amid speculation that big investors are using the largest cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation following trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related economic stimulus over the past year by governments and central banks around the world.      “Institutional investors have had a buy-the-dip mentality during these risk-off events, suggesting increasing ease with handling bitcoin’s volatility,” wrote Cipolaro.    “We believe the root cause of the sell-off had to do with investor positioning rather than fundamental news. Simply put, traders were overleveraged and positioned long, resulting in forced liquidations.""  Cipolaro also noted significant BTC spot price discounts on Binance compared to Coinbase. “The difference in spot, which is usually very tight, reached nearly 3% at one point.

The stablecoin project could provide an infrastructure layer on top of that provided by the public sector via CBDCs, the report suggested.  The Diem white paperhttps://www.diem.com/en-us/white-paper/ made it clear that it is ""open to having a discussion with any central bank [that] would be interested in adding [its] currency as a stablecoin on [Diem's] network,” according to Citi.  This could provide greater functionality and features in the payments sphere, thus driving greater adoption of CBDCs by individuals and companies.  Diem would not be alone in seeking adoption as part of a CBDC ecosystem. Ripple published a new white paper in March pitching XRP as a “neutral bridge” between different currencies in order to improve cross-border payments.  The much-maligned Diem project has experienced intense scrutiny since it was announced by Facebook under the name Libra in 2019. Its name was changed to Diem last year in an attempt to distance itself from this association.  The backlash saw a number of the project's founding partners pull out, including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and Vodafone.  It has been argued that interest among central banks to launching digital currencies was at least partly triggered by their consternation over the threat to the financial system posed by a stablecoin operated by Facebook.

Although not mentioned in the report, the deflationary outlook could be a blow to some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.    “The fact that the world’s most significant commodity, crude oil, is the same price it was 16 years ago, despite unprecedented levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus, indicates entrenched deflationary forces,” according to the report, which was co-authored by Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone and Carl Riccadonna, Bloomberg's chief U.S. economist.  Since the financial crisis, commodity prices have declined by about 60% versus U.S. M2 money supply growth while the S&P 500 has beaten M2 by about 40%, according to the report.  “The stock market tide needs to keep rising or deflation will prevail,"" the analysts wrote.  “Unless WTI (West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil) can sustain above $70 a barrel, there’s little to stop more of the same deflationary forces from commodities that marked a top in the U.S. Treasury 10-year yield of about 3% in 2014.""  Bloomberg also noted similar bearish conditions for Brent crude oil to the 2018 price peak around $85 per barrel, which preceded bull markets in Treasury bonds and gold.

42434204,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA1Rh,1618843295,Web 3.0 Is Coming for the Sharing Economy,"Financial services have tended to soak up all the attention in the world of blockchain, but a new era is coming. In the first wave of initial coin offerings, companies proposed decentralized alternatives to everything from consumer products to ride- and home-sharing services. Most of those proposed alternatives disappeared because the early concepts lacked an execution model, but the concept of decentralized products and services are sure to come back as the blockchain industry matures.      In my experience, participants in centralized digital markets, both buyers and sellers, are often unhappy with what is on offer. The most vocal dissidents tend to be the sellers in these markets who find their access to consumers is now mediated by immensely powerful marketplace operators. Not only do these commanding operators have far more analytics and insight into the market than they share, they have the power to change rules of the market whenever they want. This is on top of the sizable share of revenue they take for their services.    Paul Brody is EY's Global Blockchain leader.    I have noticed consumers are not always thrilled either. The low prices offered in the early days of ride-sharing and couch-surfing are gone. Like the sellers in the marketplace, many are not happy to find the rules are changing and the increasing fees are coming on both ends of the transaction.      As blockchain technology matures, it is increasingly possible to build competitive decentralized ecosystems that offer similar services. Companies are getting better at structuring decentralized markets, leveraging designs that reward consistency and quality, and infrastructure that can handle some level of decentralized dispute resolution.    Read more: This a16z Alum Is Launching a VC Fund Focused on Platforms You Can ‘Own’    In other areas like decentralized computing infrastructure or financial services, a fairly typical business model is starting to emerge, where an open-source protocol is developed and a decentralized community takes over the long-term governance. A foundation or company is charged with doing the heavy work of maintaining and maturing the protocol in exchange for a sizable (but not dominant) chunk of the network governance and reward tokens.      This more mature decentralized approach balances the openness and transparency required to get buyers and sellers to join while putting enough incentive in the hands of a single entity to assure that someone takes a leadership position in maturing and shepherding the protocol forward. Companies like Aave, Compound Labs and SKALE Network are all deploying some variation of this model in finance. In my view, there is no reason why the same model could not be deployed for ride sharing or other services. These services have also put together all the infrastructure needed to support key activities like liquidity pooling and price discovery.    It will be the battle of Web 3.0 vs. Web 2.0.    When this new model comes to these sharing services, real-world, non-financial consumer services may face a much tougher fight than the decentralized finance (DeFi) community for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they are not going to market against a municipal taxi monopoly or regulated, century-old financial marketplace. They face relatively new digital natives. It will be the battle of Web 3.0 vs. Web 2.0.      Secondly, it would be useful for these emerging decentralized protocols to remember that, notwithstanding all the carping about these new “monopolies,” very few of them are actually profitable. Entrepreneur Jeff Bezos is famous for saying that “your margin is my opportunity” – but without margin there is no opportunity. From ride-sharing to meal delivery to couch surfing, profitability has been elusive for many of these companies. How do you unseat a “monopolist” who is still engaged in such brutal warfare with its own legacy competitors that they are not yet making money?    Read more: Stacks Launches $4M Accelerator to Fund Tech Teams Building Apps on Bitcoin    Finally, the real world is exceptionally complicated. One of the things that has made DeFi such an elegant and compelling solution space is how little it depends on real-time connectivity to the physical world. Ride sharing and meal delivery, on the other hand, require nearly constant connectivity and updates to work well and they depend on data inputs from a variety of sources, some of which are very error prone. Very simply, these businesses are much harder than they look and they require a lot more active management than is evident from the outside.      To get a sense of how big the challenge is, compare precision-controlled environments subject to intense scrutiny, like regulated financial services or manufacturing, with crowd-sourced business networks. Manufacturing companies strive for Six Sigma quality, which amounts to 3.4 errors per million products or outputs. I can’t remember the last time my credit card company failed to correctly credit a payment, but my recent experience in burrito ordering has an error rate of one in three.      I may be unusually unlucky in the burrito department, but even so that’s a very high error rate to be putting into an immutable transaction infrastructure.      None of these challenges are insurmountable. It’s entirely possible I will look back with pity upon the investors who poured billions into building Web 2.0 marketplaces with subsidies and price wars only to find their payday disappear into a decentralized marketplace. In the meantime, I can’t wait to see how a new generation of real-world decentralized services protocols take shape.

The cryptocurrency created as a joke in 2013 rose to a new record high around $0.43 early Monday, extending the previous week's 340% rally, according to data source Messari.      The meme cryptocurrency briefly replaced the payments-focused XRP as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization when prices hit the new high. At that time, its market capitalization stood at over $54 billion, according to data source Messari.      At press time, dogecoin was changing hands at $0.3920, with a market value around $50 billion. XRP's market value stands at $53.4 billion, at the current price of $1.41. Bitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $1.05 trillion.      DOGE's recent rally has raised price expectations for the rest of the year. According to the betting website us-bookies.com, oddsmakers now see a 17% probability of dogecoin rallying to $1 by the year-end, versus 2.9% at the start of the month.      Some posters on Twitter are referring to Tuesday, April 20, as ""Dogeday."" The date, which is celebrated annually as an unofficial holiday by many cannabis smokers, is also associated with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has tweeted favorably about dogecoin. Just last week, the billionaire entrepreneur tweeted an image, ""Doge Barking at the Moon.""      ""Many dogecoiners are predicting the coin to hit 69 cents on 4/20, you know, because the whole currency is a giant meme,"" as Gizmodo Australia put it.

Announced Monday, API3 (a “data oracle” service, in crypto-network parlance) has entered into a 10-year development partnership with the Open Bank Project, to merge over 400 banking APIs with blockchain smart contracts, Web 3.0 applications and decentralized finance (DeFi).      The move could one day give bank customers easy access to the online smart contracts that provide bank-like services (with more risk but often better yield).      Stepping back, the fintech revolution has relied on frameworks like the Open Bank Project so that banks can comfortably share their precious data to third-party innovators (the Revoluts and LendInvests of this world) -- a data trove that includes everything from account information, to payment transaction requests, to know-your-customer (KYC) onboarding.    Read more: ‘Chainlink Killer’ API3 Closes $3M Funding Round With Placeholder and Pantera    API3’s “Airnode” infrastructure (roughly analogous to the job Chainlink performs in the DeFi space) adds blockchains and decentralized apps into fintech’s mix of Web 2.0 and mobile applications that use Open Bank, said Heikki Vänttinen, co-founder of API3.      “It’s not necessarily about bringing private banking customer data onto the public Ethereum blockchain,” said Vänttinen. “A variety of blockchains can be connected to these APIs using Airnode. So it can be a very permissioned environment, something like JPMorgan and ConsenSys’ Quorum. Or it can be mainnet Ethereum, if you want to interact with common DeFi, for example.”      API3 is focused on Ethereum-based blockchains for the most part, including scaling solutions like Polygon and enterprise versions of the public chain, but the startup also works with things like Polkadot, Vänttinen said.      Open Bank Project CEO Simon Redfern, who has worked closely with the likes of HSBC, Santander and BNP Paribas as well as various regulators, said banks can sometimes be slow and bureaucratic, but they do carry an important trust credential. The API3 partnership will create a bridge between those banks and the worlds of DeFi, self-sovereign identities and data marketplaces, he said.      “This is about more than just customer data,” said Redfern, a 32-year veteran of programming database-driven web applications. “Banks are these sources of truth. Of course, that might include account-specific things, but I think it's very broad, and banks have a huge amount of data.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | LINK,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/19/oracle-provider-api3-signs-10-year-deal-with-open-bank-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a937758edc394b9eb4bf196d3443c0d76cf313fc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPA1Fh,1618837200,City Comptroller Candidate Says Blockchain Is in New York’s Future,"New York City needs to think creatively about its post-pandemic recovery, says a candidate for city comptroller. This includes investments in the city’s blockchain industry.      Reshma Patel, a Democratic candidate for the city’s chief financial officer position, unveiled a “future proof” plan for New York on Monday centered around investments in blockchain businesses and cryptocurrencies. There are 12 candidates for the office, including 10 other Democrats, according to Ballotpedia.      “My reason for running for comptroller is I’m concerned about the long-term financial health of New York City, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic,” Patel told CoinDesk.      She hopes that her proposal, if enacted, would increase the city’s efficiency in approving contracts, spur new businesses to operate within the city and diversify local pension funds.      Under Patel’s plan, New York’s five retirement systems would invest up to 3% of their funds into cryptocurrencies, the city itself would invest in funds with blockchain exposure to help support fintech startups and New York would utilize a blockchain-based system for its procurement contracts. Patel also wants to work with the New York Department of Financial Services to streamline the BitLicense.      She sees tangible benefits in adopting a blockchain system to track and update procurement contracts. The comptroller’s office typically has 30 days to approve a contract, but depending on the project, different entities within the city government may have to weigh in.      Patel said tracking changes and budget issues on a decentralized ledger would make it easier for different parties to be involved while maintaining transparency around the process.      A lack of transparency currently makes it difficult to budget, take out loans or work with community efforts, she said, citing personal experience from her work in the city.    Headwinds    Much of Patel’s proposals would require dialogue and buy-in from different parts of the city or state apparatus, she said.      Patel acknowledged that the comptroller would have to work with the pension funds’ trustees to invest in crypto at all, and that this may be a difficult proposition.      “As the custodian of the city’s five pension funds, the comptroller has the fiduciary responsibility to manage these funds,” she said.      In her view, this means ensuring proper risk management is in place, but she sees investing in crypto as an appropriate hedge against possible inflation or the S&P 500 dropping.      “With inflation expected to rise in the next few years, and bitcoin expected to continue its checkered but consistent upswing to ‘the moon,’ a minimal allocation to the most dominant of all cryptocurrencies can help diversify and protect the City’s pension fund investments,” the proposal reads.      Other issues include cryptocurrencies’ environmental impact. The current city comptroller, Scott Stringer, announced a plan to divest from fossil fuels earlier this year, citing damage from climate change.      The climate impact of cryptocurrencies have been under scrutiny amid the recent bull run and growth of products like non-fungible tokens.      Patel believes that a move toward renewable energy sources, particularly in New York, is feasible.      “The city has already made a commitment to divest from fossil fuels, and that is a commitment I would uphold,” Patel said. “This is a financial innovation and it’ll get more stable and reliable and sustainable over time, and the only way to make it more sustainable is to engage with it.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/19/city-comptroller-candidate-says-blockchain-is-in-new-yorks-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c302d7506fb76ef9e7e99cf4bd5caea5219bc69-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, the firm will launch its Taurus Digital eXchange (TDX) on May 10. The platform seeks to provide investors and banks with the ability to trade a number of assets including tokenized securities, private assets, real estate, art, non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies.      ""We are convinced that the tokenization of real assets is the future of investment,"" said Lamine Brahimi, co-founder at Taurus Group. Brahimi added TDX is targeted toward small and medium companies, non-listed large corporations and real estate firms. In that sense, these institutions will gain access to ""greater liquidity and capital"" currently only on offer for large publicly listed companies.      The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority granted Taurus its securities firm paving the way for the launch. Various banks in the country have already begun onboarding including Arab Bank Switzerland, Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, Flow Bank and SEBA.      Switzerland's first wave pool, dubbed Alaia Bay; private investment firm Audacia; and real estate firms Investis Group and Stoneweg are also onboarding, according to the release.      Taurus says both primary issuance and direct listings are possible on TDX with the platform being able to manage central limit order books, auction-based or request for quotes systems depending on the underlying asset and regulatory framework. The platform is also able to process smart contracts issued on Ethereum or Tezos.

Exchanges offering crypto futures liquidated $10 billion worth of positions on Sunday, toppling the previous market-wide record of $5.77 billion registered on Feb. 23, according to data provider Bybt.      Forced closure of long positions or bullish trades accounted for $9.26 billion, or over 90% of total liquidations, which shows the leverage was excessively skewed bullish across the board.      Bitcoin futures accounted for more than 50% of total market-wide liquidations on Sunday. Liquidations happen when trades cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding long/short positions and often exacerbate bullish/bearish moves.      Bitcoin dropped sharply, from $60,000 to $52,148 early Sunday, dragging alternative cryptocurrencies lower. As prices started falling, margin requirements increased and exchanges liquidated longs (squared off with offsetting shorts), adding to downward pressure in the market.      ""This [downward] move was definitely driven by the vast amount of futures being liquidated,"" Viktor Franken, options trader at Orca Traders, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Additionally, it was a weekend, and liquidity was thin during the early Asian hours.""      The massive forced closure of longs pushed bitcoin futures into backwardation – a market condition where futures trade at a discount to the spot price.      As seen above, bitcoin futures listed on Binance and Kraken traded at a bigger discount than the ones listed on other exchanges, showing the dump mainly happened on Binance and Kraken.      ""On Binance, the drop was so bad that you were able to pick up long-term futures at prices well below the spot market,"" Adam Cochran, a partner with Cinneamhain Venture, wrote in a tweet. ""While spot [markets] dipped to $51,000, futures were trading in the low $40,000.""      The situation has normalized, with futures drawing higher prices than the spot price. Bitcoin is currently trading near $56,700 – up 8% from Sunday's low, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""The fact that we've seen strong buying interest near the psychological $50,000 mark should be a relief for bitcoin bulls following the weekend plunge,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.      The cryptocurrency may have received a boost from signs of China is softening its stance on cryptocurrencies. On Sunday, Li Bo, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, called bitcoin and stablecoins ""investment alternatives.""      ""Lingering regulatory risks could end up clearing the way for further upside in bitcoin if lawmakers sound favorable for the cryptocurrencies' inclusion in the traditional financial system,"" Ozkardeskaya said.

Regulators are “creating danger” for retail investors, as exemplified by the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple over its alleged issuance of native currency XRP as an unregistered security, according to the WSJ.      The findings in this case “have highlighted the inconsistency of the SEC’s approach,” in not treating bitcoin and ether as securities, for example.      Something of a watershed in the case emerged April 7 when Ripple was granted access to the SEC’s internal communications on how it determined whether a crypto is a security.      Exemptions had been announced previously for bitcoin and ether by the SEC through statements from former Chairman Jay Clayton, “with no formal rule-making,” according to the editorial.      This suggests that the SEC has not set clear rules about which currencies it feels it should regulate and which it does not.

The U.K. central bank and government have not yet decided whether to launch a CBDC, so will use the taskforce to explore the practicalities of doing so, according to an announcement Monday.  The Bank of England stated that a CBDC would not replace cash and bank deposits but exist alongside them.  As part of the task force, two forums will be established, one focusing on engaging senior stakeholders and the other to gather input from the technology sector.  Thus far, the Bank of England’s work on a CBDC has been limited to a discussion paper published in March 2020, so this is the first sign of any practical exploration taking place.  The Treasury also announced it would explore how blockchain can improve financial market infrastructure in a new sandbox (a testing environment used to explore the application of certain technology in a safe and secure way).

Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia on Sunday, Li Bo said while he and his central bank believe digital assets are viable investment vehicles, there was a clear distinction to that of the digital yuan, according to a report by journalist Colin Wu.      ""[An] encrypted asset is an investment option, it is not currency itself,"" said Li. ""It is an alternative investment.""      ""We believe that encrypted assets [bitcoin and stablecoins] should play a major role in the future either as an investment tool or as an alternative investment.""      The price of bitcoin was at $57,031.04, up 2.49% in the past 24 hours, recouping some of the losses incurred over the weekend.      The digital yuan will also not replace the U.S. dollar and that its internationalization was to be a ""natural process"" dependant on market demand, Li said at the same event, according to a report by Bloomberg on Sunday.      Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was reportedly troubled by the potential long-term effects a digital yuan could have on the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency.      The deputy governor also underscored what he sees as the need for strong regulatory framework by ensuring ""speculative assets"" do not cause substantial financial risk.      ""If we want such encrypted assets [stablecoins] to become a widely used payment solution we need a stronger regulatory rule, which is more stringent than bitcoin's current regulation,"" said Li.      China’s former central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, also attending the forum, agreed with Li, stating that ""everyone has to distinguish between digital assets and digital currencies.""
