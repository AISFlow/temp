42425504,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcPh,1393366609,"Bitcoin Price Resilient as Antonopoulos, Andreessen Weigh in on Mt. Gox Debacle","Andreas Antonopoulos, a bitcoin thought leader and current chief security officer at hosted wallet Blockchain.info has released a statement regarding the ongoing issues at once-leading bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  The announcement comes less than a day after Mt. Gox halted transactions, and amid growing reports that the once high-profile company may soon close for good.  Wrote Antonopoulos in his official response:    “I fear the worst. Everything I see makes me believe that Gox will never recover and that the funds are most likely lost.      I am devastated by the impact this will have on customers of Gox and I am angry at the irresponsible behavior of Mt. Gox and especially [CEO] Mark Karpeles that will damage the lives of many people.”    The remarks echo the increasing frustration of bitcoin supporters, who have been highly critical of Karpeles and his handling of problems at the exchange for much of the last month, and are notable as Antonopoulos, despite his critical stance to the company, had moved to ease concerns in recent weeks.  Gox’s incompetence  Antonopoulos offered a blow-by-blow account of the issues that have affected Mt. Gox in the past two weeks on his personal blog. He points out the transaction malleability issue Mt. Gox was supposedly experiencing has been a known issue since 2011:  “I publicly excoriated Gox’s incompetent and clownish management and disputed their claim that their problems were due to a ‘bug in bitcoin’.”  During this time, many exchanges were attacked via DDoS, according to Antonopoulos. The goal, he says, was to uncover other bitcoin exchanges that might be vulnerable:  “In response, some exchanges temporarily suspended withdrawals to investigate their implementations and confirm they were robust.”  Gox did develop a fix for the problem on its platform, and Antonopoulos later expressed optimism that the Japan-based exchange might be able to resume normal operations:  “As we started seeing Gox transactions posted on the public blockchain ledger, as reported on reddit and other sites, it appeared to me as if Gox might recover from their latest mess.”  The outage  The statement from Antonopoulos makes clear that he did not know in advance Mt. Gox was headed for massive failure:  “Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3pm PST, Monday February 24th, I heard unconfirmed reports that Gox was in crisis mode and their funds were mostly, if not entirely, gone. This was the first hint I had of any solvency issues.”  It appears that the writing was on the wall for Mt. Gox for some time. But Antonopoulos stated he did not believe that there was any intent of fraud by Mt. Gox CEO, Mark Karpeles.  “I stated that while I had serious misgivings about the competence of Mt.Gox executives and especially Karpeles, I had not seen any indication of bad faith or fraud in the past two years.”  Coinbase Security  As the head of Blockchain.info’s security, Antonopoulos volunteered to examine the measures put in place at Coinbase, and recounted his experience visiting the San Francisco-based hosted wallet the same night of Mt. Gox’s shutdown.  “While Coinbase publicly states that up to 97% of customer funds are in cold storage, at the time of my visit, their internal reporting tool showed that the cold storage system contained 98.8% of customer funds.”  Working into the night, Antonopoulos found that Coinbase had solid processes in place to secure bitcoin for its customers.  “Based on what I observed during my visit and my experience in security, it appears that the Coinbase system contains the expected funds and their cold storage system and process appear to be operating according to security best practices.”  Comparison to MF Global, not the end  While companies like Coinbase have procedures in place to protect bitcoin wallets, the ultimate fate of Mt. Gox is still murky.    Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has invested heavily in bitcoin startups.

When asked for comment, the Bitcoin Foundation offered the following statement:  ""This is certainly not the end of Bitcoin. Perhaps the end of one chapter, but certainly not the end. As our industry matures, we are seeing a second wave of capable, responsible entrepreneurs and investors who are building reliable services for this ecosystem.""

42425500,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcBh,1393364523,"Former US Treasury Secretary Calls Bitcoin an ""Innovative"" Solution","Former US Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton and past President Emeritus of Harvard University Lawrence Summers has indicated that he believes bitcoin to be a ""very, very important development"".      As treasury secretary, Summers is said to have played an integral role in the US handling of several world financial crises, and his prior positions include serving as chief economist at World Bank from 1991 to 1993.    The remarks came after Summers' speech at the National Association for Business Economics policy conference on 24 February, in which he addressed a wide range of financing topics from the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing strategy to virtual currencies such as bitcoin.  Reports indicate  that there, Summers stated that he sees bitcoin as part of a broader transition in which information technology is affecting more aspects of American life.  Speaking of the pain points inherent in the current financial system, Summers said:  ""It seems bizarre that at this late date, one has to pay as much as one does to use a debit card or to get cash from an ATM or to transfer money to one’s child living abroad.""  The former secretary went on to call bitcoin ""an innovative approach"" to reducing financial friction, and suggested that it would be only part of a larger concerted effort by the industry to attack these longstanding consumers difficulties.  'An enormous deal'  Summers also notably compared bitcoin to other innovations that have emerged from California's famed Silicon Valley, ones that were first written off only to turn out to be ""an enormous deal"". Further, he reminded economists that they don't necessarily have a track record for correctly predicting the outcome of technological advancements.  Said Summers:  ""Very serious economists thought that the Internet was going to be no more important than the fax machine, so I’m not willing to dismiss Bitcoin.""  Rare optimism  The news is a rare bright spot in the day's developments, as following the abrupt shutdown of services at Mt. Gox media outlets and pundits around the globe have begun to criticize bitcoin for its alleged shortcomings as a payments technology.  Supposed financial experts seem to be coming out of the woodwork to capitalize on the news.  For example, Dennis Gartman of the Gartman Letter took to CNBC to decry bitcoin as ""nothing more than a scam of the first order"", though an increasing amount of industry experts are leaping to the digital currency's defense.

42425495,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFc1h,1393359774,VC Firm Makes Bid for FBI’s Seized Silk Road Bitcoins,"Investment firm Falcon Global Capital has contacted the US government expressing an interest in buying all of the bitcoins it seized from Silk Road – the online black market that was shut down by the FBI in October of last year.  The US has previously said that the coins will be liquidated, but did not say when or how the process would occur, or to whom they would be sold. The FBI holds 27,000 BTC from the seizure, which are worth around $14m at today’s exchange rates.  Whether the Falcon team is prepared to go the distance on the potentially huge transaction remains to be seen.  Huge stockpile  Falcon Global Capital  ’s co-founder Brett Stapper told Business Insider that he has not received an official reply from the FBI, so it is still unclear whether the government is willing to make a deal.  Stapper said:  “We have secured backing from a group of private investors to purchase all 27,000 bitcoins for 15% below the daily value.”  It should be noted that the FBI has a lot of bitcoins to sell. In addition to drug-tainted Silk Road coins, the FBI has a much bigger stash: an estimate from Casey Research puts the figure between 5% and 10% of all bitcoins in circulation.  Filling the gap  While it might not be the best time to make such a deal, with troubles at Mt. Gox slashing confidence in bitcoin, Stapper points out that Falcon Global Capital is “not your average investment fund”. He added:  “We are young, hungry, and, eager to fill the gap between Wall Street and bitcoin.”  Falcon Global Capital describes itself as an SEC Regulation D Private Investment Fund that invests “solely in bitcoin markets”. Its mission is simple – the fund wants to allow accredited investors to acquire large amounts of bitcoins, anywhere from $25,000 up to $10m, and to store them safely.  The fund points out that purchasing and storing large amounts of bitcoins is notoriously challenging, so it aims to provide a simple service that can be used by the average investor.  Silk Road gambit  Stapper’s letter to the FBI made it clear that Falcon Global Capital is prepared to offer 15% below market value for the Silk Road forfeiture.  He also offered another option: if the US Government is not interested in selling the bitcoins to the company directly, Stapper is willing to act as consultant to the government, free of charge, to find the best and most profitable way of liquidating the seized bitcoins.  Either way, it would be an ironic end to the Silk Road saga – the government selling the dirty assets below cost to legitimate corporate investors.  If the US Government gives the green light on the deal, Stapper says Falcon Global Capital plans to store the bitcoins in “an insured bitcoin vault”, courtesy of UK-based Elliptic.

42425508,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcVh,1393357475,Bitcoin Derivatives Market BTC.sx Suspends Trading Amid Turmoil at Partner Mt. Gox,"UK and Singapore-based bitcoin-only margin trading platform BTC.sx has suspended its services “until further notice”, an email sent to the company’s customers on 25th February and obtained by CoinDesk reveals.  Launched in private beta last May, BTC.sx cited the “closure” of its main exchange partner as the reason for the decision in the official correspondence, but did not name Mt. Gox specifically.  Founder and CEO Joseph Lee later confirmed to CoinDesk that the business partner in question is embattled bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which abruptly shut down its website on 24th February.  Even as a business partner, Lee was not given prior word about Mt. Gox's shutdown and potential rebranding.    ""We did not receive any advanced notification of their shutdown,"" Lee stated.      The result was that the company was forced to stop services temporarily and inform its community of the decision.    The search for new partners  BTC.sx  had traded price movements against only Mt. Gox prior to the halt in services, as Lee said just ""a small handful"" of exchanges could handle its volume. Lee said customers had been prompting the company to find new partners, but that Mt. Gox's sudden service halt has escalated this process.  In terms of a business relationship, Lee indicated his company did not work closely with Mt. Gox. He said he only met with a company representative at their office two years ago, before BTC.sx was set up.  Lee went on to state that the company is in the process of trying to diversify its future risk and restart services, and further that it could have operations up and running within the next few months.  Said Lee:    ""We are in the process of integrating with other exchange partners. This was scheduled for completion in April, but that timescale will now be bought forward in light of recent events.            Spreading our counterparty risk by integrating other exchanges has been on our radar for a while.""            In its email, BTC.sx moved to calm any fears bitcoins would be lost in the suspension, confirming that “all customer balances are secure”, and that it plans to “honor any withdrawal requests”.  Furthermore, customers with open positions will have their deposits refunded in full. The company said:  “We apologise for any inconvenience caused, we are working hard to integrate new exchanges and offer our service again as soon as possible. We will keep you informed of any update, all refunds will be processed in due course, thank you for your patience during this time.”  Ongoing issues  The announcement follows the company’s announced maintenance on 21st February, when it closed to complete “technical operations”, which it claimed were successful.    And we’re trading! Maintenance complete. Thank you for your patience.      — BTC.sx (@BTCsx) February 21, 2014    At the time, BTC.sx indicated it was “one of only a few liquid ways to trade the price movement at Mt. Gox”, although trade size was limited. However, the halt of trading on Mt. Gox stopped trading entirely.    ""Every position we place must have a corresponding order placed out to market. Despite the issues in recent weeks we were still able to place orders to market at MtGox up until today,"" Lee said.    Notably, BTC.sx was not affected by the DDoS attacks that hampered trading on Mt. Gox, according to its official blog.  Next steps  BTC.sx was originally backed by $150,000 in private capital, and was seeking additional investment. Past statements indicated that it saw its derivatives platform as a key part of building the bitcoin ecosystem.  The company used leveraged positions, meaning users effectively bet BTC against bitcoin fluctuations, which were gauged against the US dollar. The site then lent customers money to bolster their positions.  On 21st January, BTC.sx revealed that it had brokered $35m in trades, and that it had more than 3,000 active users. It had passed the $13m mark in December, suggesting trading increased markedly over the last few months.  Still, while he is disappointed in the setback the service halt inflicts on his business, Lee suggested that if Mt. Gox were to successfully rebrand, he would consider establishing new business ties with the exchange.    ""I would love to work with them closer as a partner if they can resolve their outstanding issues,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/25/bitcoin-derivatives-market-btcsx-suspends-trading-amid-turmoil-at-partner-mt-gox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70c726d95c2bc58fb3d1a5c2b74b90bdf3df7012-1139x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFc7h,1393351584,SecondMarket CEO to Launch Regulated US Bitcoin Exchange this Summer,"Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of New York-based alternative investment marketplace SecondMarket, has confirmed he will be spinning off the entity's bitcoin businesses into a separate organization dedicated to the exchange of digital currencies, and that this new business aims to be operational by this summer.  Silbert told CoinDesk that he will serve as CEO of the as-yet-unnamed entity, and that the new business will include Bitcoin Investment Trust, its private investment fund for high-wealth investors, and an 11-person trading desk that will support this offering.  The CEO suggests that SecondMarket will be contributing $20m in cash and bitcoin assets to the new endeavor, and that injections from other founding members could potentially increase this total by the time of its 2014 launch. He added:  ""The company on day one will be well-capitalized, it will have two fast growing businesses.""  In addition to this big picture vision, Silbert also revealed detailed plans that suggest the process is in motion, and that the exchange has already cleared a number of potential hurdles on its path to market.  A new kind of exchange  The extensive plans represent a drastic shift in how bitcoins have been traditionally bought and sold through exchanges, with the company adopting a ""hub-and-spoke"" model that will find the exchange only interacting with formal members.  Non-members will not be allowed to facilitate transactions on the exchange, however. Silbert said he doesn't see this as exclusionary, as such restrictions would inspire the creation of new businesses for the exchange.  Initial members are expected to include Wall Street banks, as well as bitcoin startups such as Circle and Coinbase. Silbert explained:  ""If you want to buy and sell bitcoin you have to go through one of the members, and the members are all going to be regulated businesses. They'll be banks, they'll be MSBs, they'll be bitcoin companies, they'll be broker dealers. The idea is the other exchanges of the world could actually become members of the exchange.""  The result, Silbert said, would be an environment similar to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where individual customers go through brokers such as Fidelity or TD Ameritrade in order to complete transactions. The idea for the market itself is based on the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) Group.  Founded in 1997  , ICE is a 24-hour, Internet-based high capacity trading platforms focused on the global commodity and financial products marketplaces.  By providing a similar environment to existing structures, Silbert hopes money services business (MSBs) and banks will be more open to dealing with bitcoin and bitcoin-related investment services.  How the exchange will work  According to Silbert, the exchange will have three main functions.  Firstly, it will focus on price discovery. Using the gold market as a model, the exchange will attempt to fix the value of bitcoin once or twice a day to allow trading to be pegged at certain values and create a true indicator for the derivatives and mining markets.  ""We're going to attempt to slow things down a bit and create a true indication of bitcoin value, once or twice a day, and each of the members though they can trade all day long, or they can tie price to the spot price,"" Silbert said.  The new business will also provide clearing services and have a self regulatory organization (SRO), which will ensure that all transactions properly clear with member firms and that exchange activities are governed according to input from regulators and major banks.  A shift in strategy  The news, while not entirely new to observers in the bitcoin industry, does indicate that Silbert has advanced his plans significantly since they were first released. Silbert had not previously suggested that the exchange would be a separate business entity from SecondMarket.  Silbert noted, though, that this change in strategy is not due to regulatory concerns, but is rather a ""structural, branding initiative"", one that he saw as intrinsic given that SecondMarket's core business, which extends beyond bitcoin, has its own customers and brand identity.  Silbert first revealed plans to move SecondMarket toward becoming a licensed, regulated bitcoin exchange on 7th February, when he announced it would begin allowing bitcoin users to sell bitcoins to Bitcoin Investment Trust, though no timeline was given for the proposed launch.  Stemming the Mt. Gox fallout  Silbert suggested that though he has been working on the plans for some time and has even collaborating with unnamed state regulators on the efforts, the apparent failure of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox inspired him to come forward with the news more urgently.  ""We did accelerate the announcement with the intention to provide a counterbalance to the news so we could demonstrate to the press at least that there is an effort to fill the void of Gox,"" Silbert said.  As for next step, Silbert suggested that with capital secure, the focus would be on finding founding members and formalizing the structure of the new entity's SRO and clearing business.

42425492,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFbzh,1393348610,Mt. Gox Statement Claims it Made Conscious Decision to Halt Transactions,"The recent revelations regarding Mt. Gox have been attracting a lot of commentary from everyone other than the exchange itself.  However, the troubled exchange has finally issued a brief statement, albeit one which is unlikely to reassure investors.  It is now becoming apparent that Mt. Gox is about to make an announcement, and that it might be rebranded. However, a new brand identity is probably the least of its worries: for all intents and purposes, the exchange appears to be insolvent and defunct. Its latest statement reads:    Dear MtGox Customers,      In the event of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.    Best regards, MtGox Team    The statement does not explain why Mt. Gox decided to pull the plug suddenly at 01:59:06 UTC on Tuesday. In addition, customers hoping to find answers from Mt. Gox support will be disappointed, too – the support page simply states: ""No help desk at support.mtgox.com.""  It is important to bear in mind that the exchange didn't simply halt trading and issue the statement shortly after its decision – it went completely offline and has not issued any statements until today.  If the aim of the latest statement was to reassure customers, investors and the bitcoin community in general, it falls short of explaining what is happening behind closed doors and does not address concerns raised by many publications and bitcoin insiders. In an email, CEO Mark Karpeles made an unofficial statement to Reuters claiming that bitcoin exchange is ""at a turning point"".  He added that the Japan-based company “should have an official announcement ready soon-ish. We are currently at a turning point for the business. I can't tell much more for now as this also involves other parties."" However, these new plans are yet to emerge.  Regulators starting to take notice  The industry reaction to the virtual disappearance of Mt. Gox has been swift. Other exchanges and bitcoin businesses including Blockchain.info and Coinbase did their best to distance themselves from the exchange, issuing a joint statement yesterday (February 24th).  Regulators are taking notice, too. Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Carper has issued a statement on the matter, claiming that US policymakers and regulators can and should learn from the Mt. Gox incident to protect consumers:  “For months, our Committee has been calling on law enforcement, industry, and relevant regulators to come to the table and engage in meaningful dialogue to provide clear rules of the roads for entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers. Without these rules, businesses can’t be successful and consumers can’t be protected. If today’s news is true, it is a sad violation of consumer trust, whether through malicious action or simple incompetence. Regardless, it’s unacceptable.”  The chairman stressed that his staff is working closely with federal agencies to determine what lessons can be learned from the failure and to make sure that it does not happen in the US. “Our Committee will continue to work closely with relevant U.S. government entities to steer the boat away from nefarious actors - and it’s up to legitimate, law abiding industry partners to row the boat into law abiding waters,” he added.  Fellow US regulator Ben Lawsky, New York's Superintendent of Financial Services, also waded into the debate.  In a statement via email he maintained that while all the facts are not yet clear “these developments underscore that smart, tailored regulation could play an important role in protecting consumers and the security of the money that they entrust to virtual currency firms.”  Both Carper and Lawsky are clearly throwing the ball to bitcoin industry leaders, if not indirectly passing blame.  It seems the lesson learned from the Mt. Gox demise will be a painful one, but will all regulators will reach the same conclusions?",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/25/mt-gox-statement-claims-it-made-conscious-decision-to-halt-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bae5cab34945a33d93ea1c142476e88caca9eabf-1000x629.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374541,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlH6f,1393336820,Why Regulating Bitcoin Won’t Work,"In recent months, bitcoin has skyrocketed in usage and popular attention. With all this increased exposure and rapidly growing business activity, the public sector was bound to get involved sooner or later.  Governments everywhere are increasingly taking steps to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but these responses have been anything but uniform. And, while some countries are taking a ‘hands-off’ approach, these are the exceptions to the general trend.  Canada and New York are both poised to enact new regulatory measures, Russia has been the first developed country to ban bitcoin outright, and China came pretty close to doing so back in December. While countries may be far apart in the way they tackle the issues raised by bitcoin, their fears are the same.  When Russian authorities announced that bitcoin was illegal, they outlined “laundering of money obtained through crime, as well as financing terrorism” as chief concerns, and that sentiment is echoed across many regulatory agencies.  This uniting aspiration to prevent money laundering highlights the inability of various governments to grasp how bitcoin really works, and how far out of their control it is.  Perhaps this ignorance was inevitable, due to the currency’s sudden and meteoric rise, which pressured governments to do something without giving them time to fully understand what was happening.  More harm than good  Indeed, even now it still seems impossible to predict how bitcoin and its surrounding services will continue to develop.  Nonetheless, this widespread failure to understand the fundamental principles behind the Bitcoin protocol and its implications can lead governments to make decisions that will ultimately harm economic development, while impacting criminal activity very little, if at all. One of the glaringly obvious flaws in the patriotic actions of countries like Russia to protect their citizens from terrorists and money laundering is the simple fact they cannot enforce it.  Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are completely decentralized peer-to-peer systems. There is no central server to shut down, no one to catch and, crucially, no one prosecute – no one that will cause the currencies to crumble, at least.  Put simply, no government on the planet can stop me from downloading a wallet or mining client and connecting to the bitcoin network. Just ask the United States and other developed countries, who have been trying rather unsuccessfully to crack down on illegal P2P torrents over the last decade.  Hence, anyone who is intent on using bitcoin to launder funds overseas, for which it is most apt, can still purchase them from individual dealers, trusted miners, or even purchase their own mining hardware to turn that dirty money into crypto-coins.  Indeed, it’s easy enough to imagine how the bitcoin industry would develop in a permanently illegal context to serve the needs of already illegal organizations, potentially allowing them much more flexibility in both storing and moving funds around the world.  This is what scares governments, but the point they seem to miss, is that for better or worse, they can’t do anything about it.  Bitcoin and the Deep Web  Take Silk Road, the infamous anonymous online marketplace that allowed individuals to purchase just about anything with bitcoin.  Many other such markets exist in the Deep Web, and while there will occasionally be a highly publicised bust, criminal activity still continues on a massive basis. Outlawing bitcoin will not affect these already illegal operations in the slightest.  Increasingly, we are seeing the development of ever more organized Deep Web markets, exchanges, and even private currency systems, as criminals move away from bitcoin to other, more anonymous digital currencies. Guess where most of this development seems to be occurring?  If you guessed the only developed country to fully outlaw all cryptocurrencies, Russia, you would be correct.  Another proposed regulatory measure is a ban on ‘tumblers’ – tools that allow users to confuse the source of their bitcoins. This idea, discussed in New York’s regulatory hearings, further highlights the unwillingness for traditional regulatory institutions to admit that they have no authority over the matter.  Tumblers, like illegal markets and exchanges, can be hosted anonymously from any server in the world. New York’s Department of Financial Services may as well ban the sun from setting, as they’d probably have more leverage there.  Legal trailblazers  The individuals most affected by government regulation are the ones already engaged in legal business activities and ventures – that is, those paving the way for an innovative and competitive financial future, and one with a global reach.  Outlawing bitcoin simply restricts legitimate business and drives the criminals underground, depriving the private sector at large of benefits of the cryptocurrency. Without government approval, legal businesses and users can’t take advantage of bitcoin’s speed, low costs, flexibility, and anonymity.  So, regulation would simply be driving the creation of another black market, while denying the substantial benefits of cryptocurrency to law-abiding citizens everywhere. We can already see in Canada that even naive talk of cracking down on bitcoin has dealt a crushing blow to developing startups.  Even in areas where bitcoin isn’t considered illegal, any regulatory hurdles will inevitably hamper innovation.  Countries with a more laid back approach are the ones likely to benefit most from a bitcoin-fuelled financial revolution – even if it’s still too early to tell what exactly that is going to look like.  Punishing the wrong people  This extrapolates to seemingly conventional regulations, such as requiring exchanges and other services to collect the personal information of customers.  Yes, anonymous exchanges might make it easier for those looking to launder money, but eliminating that avenue by requiring and tracking the personal information of everyone on an exchange does nothing to hinder it, either.  In a world without anonymous exchanges, bitcoin can still be traded privately from person to person, and nothing is stopping fully anonymous Deep Web exchanges and similar services from appearing. The only thing mandatory data collection would ensure is that honest individuals must go through more hurdles and lose even more privacy in the world of Big Data and growing government surveillance.  Level-headed approach    But is all potential regulation bad? Of course not, there are many steps that can be taken to create more confidence within the mainstream population without severely hampering innovation or the privacy of users.  Somewhere to watch if you are looking for sensible rules in the bitcoin industry seems to be New York, where Ben Lawsky has been noticed for his level-headed approach in bitcoin talks.  One sensible requirement would be to set a standard for security in public businesses that wish to store or facilitate bitcoin conversions or escrow. Another will be to make it illegal for such a business to move, invest, or otherwise use customer funds (essentially fractional reserve banking) without explicitly stating this to customers, who have the right to take their own risks with their investments.  Requiring bitcoin companies to have a good reserve of bitcoin and publicly publish their balance sheets would offer customers some peace of mind.  Naturally all companies operating would be liable for their customers funds, if lost, which would be paid to either them personally, if personal information is recorded, or to an existing offline wallet linked to their account. All of this would help increase legitimacy, confidence, and consumer protection in the industry without negatively affecting innovation, and would also end the “Wild West” era of cryptocurrencies.  Antiquated thinking  While some will argue that all of these standards and services would probably evolve organically from a free market anyway, it at the very least gives regulatory agencies something to do that isn’t just a knee-jerk reaction, with no positive benefits for legitimate businesses and customers.  Currently, most legislators continue to think of bitcoin in antiquated terms, and that’s the problem.  Bitcoin promises to create a whole new paradigm in the game of finance – the biggest technological innovation in the field in many years.  The entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, both legal and otherwise, is evolving so quickly that government regulations can’t even keep up, let alone plan. Legislators are now preparing to make rules for circumstances that have no precedent, that can be hard to understand in their current form, and that will likely not exist tomorrow.  Bitcoin requires a whole new way of thinking, and a much more flexible approach from governments, to allow it to develop legally within the free market and to bestow its benefits on the world’s citizens.

42425498,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcFh,1393332644,Launch of Indian Digital Currency Laxmicoin Postponed Following Raids,"The launch of an India-focused digital currency, Laxmicoin, has been suspended by its co-founders, following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) raids on bitcoin exchanges in December last year.  While some bitcoin exchanges are once again operating and digital currencies are gaining traction in major Indian cities, Laxmicoin founders Mitts Daki and Raj Dangi say they are adamant about not moving forward with the launch of their new currency until the RBI gives them the green light.  Daki, who is based in Silicon Valley, revealed that one of the reasons for the suspension is that some of the venture capitalists who had expressed an interest in funding Laxmicoin are now reluctant to do so.  While Daki did not disclose the names of the venture capitalists, he said:  “We were about to get almost $2m in funding from a couple of US-based venture capitalists with a presence in India. Before the raid, we were almost finalizing numbers with one of them and about to sign a contract. After the bitcoin raid, they wanted to delay this. We talked to them and they said that we needed RBI clearance before further discussions.”  Daki has been chasing after clarification from India’s regulatory body since he registered the company in April last year. As soon as he announced Laxmicoin, he logged an inquiry on the RBI website. He also sent two other formal letters in 2013, but did not hear anything back. Two weeks ago, he and Dangi sent a further letter.  The RBI is likely to take its time in making the situation black and white. In a statement to CoinDesk, an RBI spokesperson gave no indication of when the bank will announce a decision regarding digital currencies in India:  “The RBI is currently internally examining the issues relating to virtual currencies including bitcoins,” the spokesperson said. “A final stand or update on RBI’s stand will be decided thereafter. Meanwhile you can refer to the press release available on our website.”  From goddess to currency  Laxmicoin is named after Laxmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. It was poised to be an India-focused digital currency, easily accessible for less-technically savvy people within the developing country, and even to be donated to worthy causes.  The founders had planned to mine half of Laxmicoins before the launch, out of which they would hold on to 20% of the coins and give out the remaining 30% to people in different walks of life, who do not have the means to mine themselves.  “We wanted to distribute to colleges, to NGOs, and other social causes. Basically, to those walks of life where people work hard and government pays them minimum wages,” says Daki.  Deepak Mantwal, a senior founding member of the Laxmicoin team, explains the reason for pre-mining some of the coins:  “India is a developing country. If you will leave all the mining for the people, it won’t be practically possible. You need special machines for that, you need good power, and you need good Internet connections to mine them. That’s why we have decided some percentage will be pre-mined and some will be mined after a certain period of time.”  However, the founders did not explain a concrete procedure for fair distribution of the pre-mined coins.  They also did not have a plan in place for open accountability of the 20% of Laxmicoin that was intended to remain with the founders. They stressed that all further developments had been suspended until the RBI clearance.  More trouble ahead  While the Laxmicoin founders are waiting to hear from the RBI, many people in the Indian digital currency ecosystem do not believe that they will get a positive response in the near future.  Venture capitalist Maninder Gulati is an active member of the Indian bitcoin community. He is also currently looking to invest in cryptocurrency projects. He says that the regulators in India will not warm up to the idea of digital currencies anytime soon.  Moreover, he says it is problematic that Laxmicoin is targeting to becoming the country’s representative digital currency:  “You cannot go to a government and say, ‘here’s my digital currency; please accept it’. That cannot happen.”  “In the future,” he says, “the government may create a digital currency version of the fiat. But, it’s very difficult for an outside party to do so; because then the amount of that digital coin – whether that’s Laxmi or anybody else – is actually controlled by that body.”  “If you own it, you cannot say to the regulators, ‘you be the central bank of the fiat and I’ll be the central bank of digital currency’. That cannot happen.”  Laxmicoin has more than just the RBI to convince. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are also not on board with the technical side of Laxmicoin.  Organiser of the Delhi bitcoin meetup, Sylvester Liang says, “I feel that because they are a closed sourced, centralised system, I don’t think they come under a cryptocurrency umbrella. They may come under the virtual currency umbrella, but not within the ecosystem of cryptocurrency.”  Indian goddess Laxmi image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/25/launch-of-indian-digital-currency-laxmicoin-postponed-following-raids,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e72d61390b3043b20309b6e52d41afa7a0b9e32-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The event will be held at the Passenger Terminal venue in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, from 15th-17th May. Registration is now open at bitcoin2014.com.  Bitcoin 2014 follows last year’s inaugural event in San Jose, California, which drew more than 1,000 attendees over the course of its three-day run, and covered the future of payments as its overarching topic.  Speakers for this year’s event have not yet been announced, however, attendees in 2013 included principals of Winklevoss Capital Management Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen; and BitPay co-founder and CEO Tony Gallippi, among others.  Jon Matonis  , executive director at the Bitcoin Foundation, said this year’s event will be a “must attend” for not only bitcoin industry professionals, but those from the broader financial technology industry as well:  “It’s where we facilitate the cross-pollination of traditional executives with industry experts and where we collectively envision and practically develop a roadmap to the future.”  The venue  If the choice of venue is any indication, the Bitcoin Foundation anticipates a higher turnout for this year’s proceedings, as Passenger Terminal can accommodate up to 3,000 event visitors.  The official city port for cruise ships, Passenger Terminal is located just outside of the centre of Amsterdam and boasts impressive views of the nearby canals.  The venue is located just 19 minutes from Schiphol Amsterdam Airport by car, and is also accessible by public transportation.  For more information on accessing Passenger Terminal by car and public transport, visit Amsterdam Cruise Port's guide here.  The itinerary  The official release disclosed only a rough outline of the event’s content, noting that feature presenters will “cast vision for the long-term potential of bitcoin”, while panel discussions will address “immediate challenges”.  Notably, day one will be partly devoted to helping the Bitcoin Foundation further its international partnerships, with related proceedings taking place in the morning and ending at lunch time.  The organisation added its first two international affiliate chapters in December.  Last year’s event  Though the release provides a broad outline for the event, what remains to be seen is how sharply Bitcoin 2014 will differ from its predecessor, which gave representation to recently labeled “fringe elements” of the community, such as libertarians and medical marijuana activists.  This could be a sensitive subject, since January’s bitcoin hearings in New York saw major investors distance themselves from such groups.  Less controversial will likely be the inclusion of corporate booths meant to inform attendees about more basic elements of bitcoin.  While not confirmed, the presence of vendors – such as last year's lineup of Coinbase, OpenCoin (now Ripple) and CoinLab – as well as other major corporate names in bitcoin, can likely be expected.

Gox has released a statement on its website concerning its decision to halt trading.  UPDATE (25th February, 13:47 GMT): Domain investor Andy Booth has confirmed the sale of www.gox.com to Mark Karpeles.  UPDATE (25th February, 09:28 GMT): The source code on Mt. Gox's website now reads ""put announce for mtgox acq here"" leading some to speculate on the motives behind the document leak:    http://t.co/4QPPUvALYi now reads ""put announce for mtgox acq here"" Zero-evidence speculation: leak was by insider wanting cheap #bitcoin      — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) February 25, 2014    ___________________________________________________________  A document has surfaced suggesting that troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will close for one month as part of a four-step rebranding plan, and that CEO and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Mark Karpeles will step down from his executive position as part of the process.  The bitcoin price has been tumbling all morning amid the news, hitting a low of $419 so far.  Entitled “Crisis Strategy Draft,” the document suggests the company’s increasingly dire financials are greatly impacting the decision. By Mt. Gox’s own estimates, it has only 2,000 BTC and approximately $22.4m in fiat currencies in its possession.  The document was first reported by Ryan Galt, aka the Two-Bit Idiot, who later confirmed to CoinDesk:  ""Several sources familiar with the situation confirmed the legitimacy of the loss claims and the authenticity of the 'Crisis Strategy' document.""  The document is branded with the current Mt. Gox logo and a redesigned version, and claims to have detailed inside knowledge of Mt. Gox and its financial affairs, but appears to be written by a team external to Mt. Gox’s current management.  The document is publicly available for viewing here and embedded below this article.  According to the leak, Mt. Gox has lost close to 744,408 BTC or $350m at current prices, and faces an unconfirmed additional $55m in fiat liabilities. The company suggests that theft related to transaction malleability has been ongoing for several years, but was not reported by the company.  We can assume now that withdrawals will not recommence, at least not in the foreseeable future. Customers with Mt. Gox accounts will not be receiving their bitcoins or possibly even other currencies in what is effectively an insolvency, though no-one in an official position is using that word.  At Japan time on the eve of the statements, Japan’s finance and banking regulator the Financial Services Agency (FSA) said it would not be intervening in the issue as it did not view supervision of digital currency exchanges as part of its obligations.  Seeking capital injection  Rumors of the proposal first began circulating on 24th February, when the document was posted on the popular digital currency blog The Two-Bit Idiot. Sources close to the company suggest the document is real, and that it is part of a plan by Mt. Gox to raise investor capital.  The document paints a vivid picture of potential investors who are seeking to raise the necessary capital to continue operations, or at least use whatever remains of Mt. Gox’s brand value to begin a new venture.  While admitting Mt. Gox’s image is “broken”, it notes that throughout the recent bad press customers have continued to deposit funds and trade on the exchange.  The document also evokes sweeping rhetoric aimed to tie Mt. Gox’s fate to that of the broader bitcoin community: “The likely consequences will be larger than this localized financial damage, and we believe that the benefits of keeping MtGox stable and running outweigh the risks. This isn’t about saving MtGox anymore.”  It suggested the demise of its brand could set bitcoin back “five to 10 years”, and that governments should and would react “swiftly and harshly”. “At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin, at least for most of the public,” the document reads.  Mt. Gox, through intermediary sources, declined to comment on the validity of the reports at press time.  High-profile responses  Coinapult founder and bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees posted a lengthy and emotional commiseration on Reddit, claiming he had 550 BTC stored with Mt. Gox himself and “will never get any of that back”. He wrote:  “I should have known better, of course. I take responsibility for leaving those funds with an entity that had proven incompetence repeatedly. I chose to ignore even my own warnings, for nothing more than the sake of convenience.”  While laying the blame firmly at the feet of Mt. Gox, he affirmed that bitcoin itself was not at fault and security was not impossible, and implored others to continue “building a new financial order.”  “It won’t be the last calamity endured before the win,” he continued.  Several high-profile bitcoin companies, including Coinbase and Blockchain.info, moved swiftly to distance themselves from Mt. Gox and launch into a strident defense of bitcoin itself in a joint statement:    Joint Statement Regarding the Insolvency of @MtGox -> http://t.co/227aUr2yEB #bitcoin @Coinbase @Kraken @circlebits @Bitstamp @btcchina      — Blockchain.info (@blockchain) February 25, 2014    Rebranding process  The leaked proposal recommends a full rebranding of the company and even a possible relocation to another jurisdiction, like Singapore.  Firstly, it calls for the immediate reduction of liabilities through the injection of new bitcoins and the purchase of coins at depressed prices on its own exchange, in what sources told CoinDesk amounted to a bailout of the embattled exchange.  It paints a wishful picture of brand continuity without promising much to customers, maybe to neutralize any anger bound to arise from a hard shutdown and keep stakeholders’ hopes somewhat alive.  “Customer support will stay operational to deal with people who want to have access to their account/history”, it says, while maintaining that few, if any, staff employed at the current company would remain, particularly CEO Karpeles.  “New branding, means that there are future-forward plans already in the works, and customers will see that MtGox actually has a plan in motion.”  It continues: “The MtGox price is low, making it possible to erase a significant portion of the debt, but it needs to be done quickly.”  Reducing liabilities  The document notes that protecting the image of bitcoin itself is a primary concern, since a failure on Mt. Gox’s scale will be a disaster for digital currency in mainstream eyes.  To reduce this damage, it appears to put out a plea to high profile members of the bitcoin community to inject funds in the order of 200,000 BTC into the exchange, saying “the costs of not doing so are incalculable at this stage.”  “Support from Bitcoin big players and core community - long term, high leverage: Coins for equity, coin donations, and cash injections to buy coins at the cheap MtGox price are some options among many.”  “Bet on future profit to refill the lost coins - Long term, low leverage: Regardless of malleability and regulatory issues, MtGox's main problems are massive robbery and poor bitcoin accounting. However, the business as an exchange is highly profitable and healthy when run properly.”  Mt. Gox becomes Gox  The document suggests stakeholders would eventually see some kind of return, without saying when or indeed what the return might be. Should the company re-open with a new image, the strategy would be to limit withdrawals both in bitcoin and cash to prevent a bank run.  Note the timeframe (italics are for emphasis):  “With the profit, a meticulous analysis will be made over the coming years to clean the bitcoin balance sheet while running the exchange and generating revenue to pay back stakeholders. New offerings such as additional currencies, low trading fees, etc will give customers a reason to stay with MtGox.”  Management reshuffle  Removing Mt. Gox’s management team seems to be a priority and, ironically, this is an area the Japanese authorities seem willing to regulate: “In Japan, a CEO cannot resign until a new CEO is nominated. In that case customers knows that MtGox is still around and working, but under new management.”  It continues: “Try to reduce the impact and raise stakeholder confidence, and eventually get Mark out.”  One strategy the document puts forward is a “Letter from the CEO”, essentially a mea culpa from Mark Karpeles that admits Mt. Gox’s technology was inadequate to deal with the task of maintaining a bitcoin exchange, both in transaction volumes and response to the the malleability issue.  Mounting evidence  Though doubts remain among certain high-profile sources, at least two of the company’s four listed strategy points seem to have already been confirmed.  For example, Part Three of the four-part plan called for the company to rebrand as Gox.com, a process that it said would require it to “reset all SNS channels for communication”, which is consistent with Mt. Gox deleting its entire history of Twitter posts just yesterday.  Furthermore, an article by domaininvesting.com has claimed that domain investor Andy Booth has sold 'www.gox.com' ( listed herehttp://www.booth.com/gox.php) to Mark Karpeles within the last few days. Booth stated:  “Basically I got gox.com like any other LLL – didn’t directly target Mt Gox. My brother met domain broker Joe Politzer in Singapore who got excited about gox.com and then I said he could try to sell it if he wanted. He called Karpeles and Gox to find out if they wanted it and immediately they expressed pretty strong interest.""  Joe Politzer, the broker in question, added:  ""I reached out to Mt Gox and the deal took a few weeks to come together but we made a deal for the domain that included both a fair amount of cash and some bitcoins. It was definitely interesting as our deal was going down the same time as all this news about him and his company is going down. [...] The domain transferred, Escrow Closed, bitcoins delivered, done deal!”  A search of the Internet domain registration database WHOIS seems to confirm Mt. Gox’s intention to rebrand as Gox.com. The resource shows that the domain Gox.com has been purchased by Mt. Gox parent company Tibanne Co Ltd, and is currently owned by Karpeles.

42425506,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIFcRh,1393308939,Bitcoin Prices Down As Mt. Gox Concerns Escalate,"Uncertainty about the future of major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is growing in light of its recent decision to take down its website amid escalating, as-yet-unconfirmed rumors that it has been the victim of widespread theft and could be nearing a lengthy or even permanent shutdown of its services.  Mt. Gox, through intermediary sources, told CoinDesk that it has no comment on the news at this time.  Now, the market is reacting to the lack of information about the developments.  At press time, prices at major bitcoin exchanges have recorded steep declines in just the last few hours, fueled by consumer uncertainty about the impact of a worst-case scenario at the once-leading bitcoin exchange.  Prices fall  After holding steady at roughly $550 throughout most of the day, the price of bitcoin on BTC-e declined sharply to a low of $480. From 9:00 pm to 12:00 pm EST, the exchange saw prices fall rapidly from $546.  The price of namecoin, novacoin, peercoin and primecoin also declined on the news.  Mt. Gox was likewise a hot discussion point on the exchange's community chat room, with users debating the future of the exchange and what it will mean for bitcoin prices in the short and long term. Others debated the fate of coins still held in the exchange, though for now, we know only that Japanese regulators are unlikely to step in to mitigate any damage.  Bitstamp followed a similar trajectory, declining from $505 at 9:00 pm to lows of $452 at 12:00 pm.  Further, data from Bitcoincharts suggests the price of bitcoin was $135 on Mt. Gox at the time it halted services.  Bitcoin businesses brace for worst  Prices were no doubt also affected by a joint announcement from bitcoin business leaders suggesting indirectly that Mt. Gox is no longer trustworthy. Comments on the official releases suggest, however, that wording changes have been made to original statements.  For example, user comments on the posts suggested the original postings contained the word ""insolvent"", though current versions do not.  Together, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, BTC China, Blockchain and Circle discussed how they plan to ensure faith in the bitcoin ecosystem:  ""In order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds.""  Though the major businesses moved swiftly to distance themselves from Mt. Gox, such actions seem to have done little to stem the damage – at least as far as prices are concerned,.

Gox suddenly halted trading activity, the company's website is now completely offline. Notably, the news follows other troubling signs that all is not right with the exchange, such as its sudden removal of its entire Twitter feed.

When users logged into the bitcoin exchange's website they were experiencing the following error message when trying to buy or sell bitcoins:  Not long after the suspension in trading activity and subsequent outage, leaders within the digital currency space joined together in a bid to restore confidence in bitcoin and distance themselves from the embattled exchange.  The US-based hosted wallet Coinbase published the statement first, which later appeared on other websites connected with the messaging. The post, titled ""Joint Statement Regarding MtGox”, reads:    ""The purpose of this document is to summarize a joint statement to the Bitcoin community regarding Mt.Gox.

There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin.    We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the Internet age.    In order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. As part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following services will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: Coinbase, Kraken, BitStamp, Circle, and BTC China.    We strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. We pledge to lead the way.    Bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. Acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading. It does not appear to any of us that MtGox followed any these essential requirements as a financial services provider.""
