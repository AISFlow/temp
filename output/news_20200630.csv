42383998,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zzm3,1593552093,The Man Who Tokenized Himself Gives Holders Power Over His Life,"Frenchman Alex Masmej, 23 years old, recently raised $20,000 on Ethereum by tokenizing himself. Now he wants his investors to vote on his life choices.      His ""control my life"" experiment challenges token holders to tell him whether to take a run or eat only veggies. That may sound a little self-indulgent, but there is a bigger agenda here. It may even be a startup, according to Masmej. He's not sure.      Based in Paris during the coronavirus pandemic, Masmej is excited about his plan to move to San Francisco next year to work on several projects, including NFT-DeFi startup Rocket. Our conversation – about self-tokenization and more – has been edited and condensed for clarity.      What motivates you to sell yourself?      I want to change the world by building a growing, profitable company that has a significant impact. I can provide a great service to the world if I can provide people with the ability to make money. I think the best way to do that is to build a tech startup.      The reason why I chose crypto is that it has a very low barrier to entry, unlike AI or 3D printing startups. I tokenized myself and asked people to vote for my habits to get some attention as I wanted to do something in a light, funny, and innovative way to raise funds. It’s a great way to know your audience, engage them and trigger the discussion. I know this can’t become a $1 billion company, but it was a fun experience, and my token went up.      How do you build an image for selling personal tokens?      The investors of $ALEX token are founders in the crypto industry who already have companies and want to help me out. I have thousands of followers on Twitter, and they like my energy and say I am young and funny. There are almost 30 people who want to invest and think about how I might grow up. My market cap is around $150,000 now. Yes, trust is not in cryptocurrency, but in the personalized token, people have to believe me.      But there is no legal framework here, no guidelines from the Securities and Exchange Commission?      Yes, but I have always made it clear that it’s not a security, it's risky and I might not succeed. I don’t think personalized tokens should be related to the SEC as [they are] more like crowdfunding. The amount is small of (sic) $20,000, so I don’t think there is a requirement [to involve] the SEC.      See also: ‘Social Money’ Startup Inks Deal With Rapper Ja Rule, Releases Song With Lil B      However, if I make a company around [the token], I would be curious to know about the litigation. Maybe in the future I could think of a platform where there is some enforceability of the token mechanics.      Some people say, 'Oh, this involves a lot of trust, and this is like a scam.' But I would say that my reputation is at stake. Some say I control too much, and some say I can’t control at all. It’s not good either way, so I think I need to find a middle ground.    I don’t think I would ever ask investors – should I marry my girlfriend or not. However, they can introduce me to the girls. Haha.    Most people in crypto want more privacy, but you're opening your personal life to the world. Are you going to ask, “Should I marry my girlfriend?” the way Mike Merrill did?      I am single right now, and even in the future I don’t think I would ever ask investors whether should I marry my girlfriend or not. However, they can introduce me to the girls. Haha.      See Also:The Queens Politician Who Wants to Give New Yorkers Their Own Crypto      I am in touch with Mike and he is an interesting character, and even when he asked about his girlfriend, everybody said yes. Let’s assume that if I ask personal questions like this and people disagree, still, I would marry my girlfriend as that’s my decision.      Do we see social media influencers selling themselves in the coming years?      I think personalized tokens will be vast in the coming years, and it will be common for video streams, music artists and social media influencers to raise funds. Mike Merrill was the first one who publicly traded personalized tokens in 2008, and two years later, in 2010, another token was personalized. There was a token Whale, a collateral of collectibles.      These tokens are either for networking or for income sharing agreement (sic). I am going to build a platform that would give exposure to the fundraiser. The investors would think that since this entrepreneur is on this platform, I can trust him. Coinbase does the same as it selects the tokens, and the investors trust it. I believe there should be safety and rules involved and a way to reimburse the investors.      See Also: Meet the US Senate Candidate Who’s Invested in Bitcoin Since 2013      How did COVID-19 influence your innovative fundraising method?      COVID-19 is the reason I am raising money like this. I like to explore things and want to do something innovative. On June 15, I decided to personalize tokens again and ask people to vote for my lifestyle, which included questions like, should I jog, should I eat only vegetables, etc. I am saving money so that I can invest it for my new project in San Francisco.    The recent ban on some work visas is counterproductive for the U.S. as new talents arriving made the success of this country.    Since you will be moving to the U.S., what are your thoughts on the presidential election and on the current protests?      I think the recent ban on some work visas is counterproductive for the U.S. as new talents arriving made the country successful and contributes to creating net new jobs, including for locals. I hope the next president will welcome talented immigrants again to contribute to the economy. It does not affect my business, as resourceful entrepreneurs always find a way, but it will undoubtedly harm the country on a global scale if these restrictions were to stay long term.      I am proud to see the protests after George Floyd's death becoming mainstream, which shows progress has been made. I did not participate in any protest in Paris. I donated cryptocurrencies to organizations, including Black Lives Matter. I weighed in on my social media as much as I could to make people realize the enduring racism that has been holding the world back for way too long on all fronts.      People say that you dream of being a Silicon Valley demi-god. Will you be using Oracle, or are you the oracle?      I always say that I want to build the most significant company ever, but I won't say I want to become a demi-god. Yes, I will set the price, not Oracle or any third party will check it.

42384001,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zzoZ,1593548818,Market Wrap: Crypto Market Eerily Quiet as Bitcoin Stuck Near $9K,"Quiet is the best word to describe the bitcoin market. Tuesday’s trading stayed within the same price range maintained over the past several weeks, with bitcoin remaining inside a tight $200 range for much of the day.    Bitcoin stays in a tight range above $9,000  Ether up less than 1%  Bitcoin volatility continues to drop  Market in “wait and see” phase    The leading cryptocurrency only briefly dipped below $9,050 Tuesday afternoon and did not break above $9,250, according to Bitstamp. Bitcoin was trading hands around $9,140 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).      Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped 1.2% from its Tuesday open, trading around $225 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), according to Bitstamp.      Some traders are growing tired of this range as expectations for a breakout in either direction are crushed. “Every breakout in the last six weeks has revealed to be a false one, taking many traders to the woodshed in just a few hours,” said David Lifchitz, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      See also: Bitcoin Still Up 27% This Year Despite Dismal June Performance      Even liquidated contracts on BitMEX, the largest bitcoin derivatives exchange by open interest, show how stagnant bitcoin’s price action has become. Total daily liquidations on the exchange have not passed even $4 million for three consecutive days, according to Skew.      Traders are getting “mixed messages” from the bitcoin markets, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at prime broker Bequant, told CoinDesk. “On the one hand, the futures curve is in contango (upward sloping), which is indicative of leverage interest. But, yet at the same time, the options market continues to point to downside price protection demand, with front-end (shorter-dated one-month [expirations]) skew much higher relative to the rest of the curve and also when compared to Ethereum,” said Vinokourov.      As its price stands still, bitcoin’s volatility plummets. Its 30-day volatility, for example, is reaching its lowest level since late February, according to Coin Metrics.      When bitcoin will finally pick a direction – up or down – for a new trend is anyone’s guess. “We're still in a ‘wait-and-see’ phase,” Lifchitz told CoinDesk. The market, he added is “definitely in need of a catalyst to break above $10,000 on heavy volume or below $8,000.”      If the price drops, however, some traders expect bulls to capitalize on the opportunity and buy more. “Dip buyers,” a name for investors who increase their position sizes when an asset price declines, will “aggressively” buy any substantial drops in the bitcoin price, said Alistair Milne, chief investment officer at Altana Digital Currency Fund.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: What Trends in Volatility Could Mean for Bitcoin      Taking to Twitter, Milne said traders are “still underestimating” the amount of bitcoin that has been accumulated and removed from the market by long-term, often ideological investors. The exact amount of bitcoins held off the market is roughly 73%, according to Glassnode. Also taking to Twitter, CTO Rafael Schultze-Kraft noted that approximately 13.5 million bitcoins have not moved since the start of 2020, signally bitcoin investors’ commitment to hold through an uncertain market.    Other markets    Tuesday cryptocurrency gains included a variety of decentralized finance assets, according to Messari. Nexo (NEXO) gained 4.2%. Also up was kyber network (KNC) by 2.8%. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      In commodities, Tuesday was a good day for gold bulls as the yellow metal gained 1.25% from its daily low at $1,764.

42383994,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zzh1,1593544964,Compound Changes COMP Distribution Rules Following 'Yield Farming' Frenzy,"The daily distribution of the Compound protocol's COMP token will soon change dramatically.      Compound governance proposal #11 passed today at 18:37 UTC. It will go into effect in two days, after the cooling-off period passes. When that happens, it's very likely yield farmers will exit the riskiest markets of basic attention token (BAT) and 0x (ZRX) and move their activity into safer assets, stablecoins such as USDC and DAI.      A week ago, the Compound team put forward a proposal to shift how COMP gets distributed to liquidity providers and borrowers on Compound, the premiere collateralized lending application in decentralized finance (DeFi).      ""When the Compound token distribution began, no one really knew what to expect,"" Robert Leshner, Compound's founder, told CoinDesk. ""Our team was surprised by how powerful the impact of the distribution was on incentives, and so was the community."" Compound staff wrote the proposal but Leshner said they abstained from voting.      The vote closed Tuesday with 771,804 COMP staked in favor and less than one COMP staked against; that is the equivalent of 26% of all liquid COMP voting in favor of the change, based on CoinGecko statistics. A total of 115 wallet addresses participated with only four voting against the motion.      Compound started distributing COMP tokens on June 15 following the announcement of the distribution mechanism on CoinDesk.      COMP changes      Under the original rules, users are given COMP based on the amount of interest they earn or the amount of interest they pay (or both, in most cases).      The theory in designing it that way, Leshner said, was that ""if you are paying a lot in interest or earning a lot of interest you have skin in the game [for governing the protocol].""      Read more: Compound’s Approach to DeFi Governance Starts With Giving Away COMP Tokens      The hope had been the system would favor the most fervent users with an actual need for Compound's services, but no one expected the gap between the cost of yield farming COMP and the price of COMP on the market to diverge so dramatically.      This became very attractive for investors looking to find ways to game the system, and they did.      There was a dramatic shift in the usage patterns on Compound and markets that had not been very popular before saw a spike in activity. BAT offers the starkest example.      On June 15, total supply of BAT on Compound was just under $2 million. As of this writing, it is $333 million.      What will happen?      Every day, 2,880 COMP are distributed to users. That's not changing. But under the new rules, which go into effect Thursday, users will simply earn COMP on the dollar value of assets they have put in or borrowed from the system.      By simply allocating COMP based on dollars in the system, stakeholders say the overall interest in COMP yield is unlikely to drop, but the assets will almost certainly shift to different markets.      ""By distributing on the basis of total borrow, the incentive to self-deal in niche asset pools largely dries up, and we're likely to see much of this capital (particularly the BAT market) flow out of the protocol,"" Brendan Forster of Dharma, which uses the Compound protocol to offer stablecoin ""savings"" accounts, told CoinDesk in an email.      Read more: Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive      ""The goal of the COMP distribution is to allocate COMP to users who are generating value for the protocol, whether by supplying capital or by paying interest on borrow,"" Forster continued. ""The change to the distribution mechanism, in my opinion, better achieves this goal.""      Sowmay Jain, a co-founder of Instadapp, which has tools to help investors maximize their COMP yields, expressed support for the newly passed proposal to CoinDesk in an email. He wrote, ""This will incentivize the genuine user of the protocol and make it harder to game the system.""    MakerDAO’s concern    One group that's nervous about the change is MakerDAO. Cyrus Younessi from MakerDAO's risk team wrote a post on the project's forum that the change could cause a spike in demand for dai. (MakerDAO has not responded to a request for comment.)      ""My expectation is that the two most popular farming assets will be USDC and Dai due to the shapes of their (attractive) interest rate curves,"" he wrote. ""There is a chance (likelihood, even) that we see an unprecedented demand for Dai. Much of the natural supply for Dai could also be locked up in COMP farming, thinning out sell-side order books.""      That said, there's an additional advantage for an investor to extend their yield farming to dai: By focusing on stablecoins, they are much less exposed to underlying volatility in their investments (far less than what might be expected yield farming with ZRX or BAT).      On that note, Forster wrote, ""This change de-risks the protocol, and so should increase demand for COMP.""      Read more: Compound Tops MakerDAO, Now Has the Most Value Staked in DeFi      Dai aside, if the change works out as planned, longtime Compound users should start earning more COMP each day, which has the potential to put upward pressure on COMP's price as proportionately less gets sold on exchanges, as Forster explained.      ""The current 'yield-harvesters' or 'yield-farmers' aren't really interested in COMP as a governance asset, only the economic gains they get from the distribution. They are likely selling off COMP on a regular basis,"" Forster wrote. ""This change will likely result in COMP being distributed to users who are more likely to be long-term believers, and therefore more likely to be COMP hodlers.""      There is currently $977 million in assets supplied to Compound as of this writing and $361 million borrowed, making it the largest DeFi protocol in terms of total value locked. The price of COMP is $215, down from an all-time high of $373 on June 21.",NEUTRAL,BAT | COMP | ZRX,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | MARKET | ZRX,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/30/compound-changes-comp-distribution-rules-following-yield-farming-frenzy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71c5e44113c66326744208debc461aad111600a0-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The chief benefit of DEXs compared to the Coinbases of the world? They allow users to hold their crypto until they make a trade, without trusting anyone besides the counterparty of each sale.      ""Most people don't want self-custody,"" pseudonymous DeFi gadfly Defione said this week in the DeFi Telegram channel. ""For sure not in dollars, and even in crypto people don't want self-custody. Isn't that obvious?""      In this context, DEX protocol maker 0x is launching Matcha today, a DEX aggregator that helps people find the best price for whatever Ethereum-based token they want.      Read more: First Mover: 0x’s ZRX Token Surged 67% in May to Become Month’s Top Performer      This isn't a new use case in crypto, but 0x believes it can stand out on user experience, which is not always the industry's strength.      ""DEXs are traditionally very unintuitive from a UX perspective and don't include necessary info to make informed trades,"" 0x marketing lead Matt Taylor told CoinDesk in an email. ""We redesigned the DEX trading experience from the ground up with the goal of reaching feature-parity of centralized exchanges.""    New DEX, old player    0x was one of the early initial coin offerings (ICOs). It raised $24 million in August 2017, selling the ZRX token in order to build a protocol that would enable DEXs on Ethereum. Earlier this month 0x co-founder Will Warren announced 0x Labs on Medium, a new business to enter into the DEX industry.      There's already proof of demand for the DEX aggregator use case. 1inch.exchange has seen steady growth over the last year and sharp growth in June, according to data collated using Dune Analytics. In May, 1inch had about $75 million in trading volume. As June ends, it's showing slightly over $300 million.      The 1inch stats page also reports numbers for new versus old users, and this month has seen far more new users than old ones. Last month was roughly equal at about 1,400 returning and new users, whereas this month has seen 2,500 new ones as opposed to 1,900 returning ones.    DeFi farm rush    As the ""yield farming"" surge has taken hold of the crypto space, it has been easy to see its impact on automated market makers (AMMs), one particular kind of DEX, in which users provide the smart contract with liquidity in order to earn fees and traders make trades with those pools.      Two of the leaders in this area, Curve and Uniswap, have had a dramatic uptick in volume.      Read more: COMP’s Sudden Growth Has Swamped a DEX Dealing Only in Stablecoins      Compound Labs started distributing the COMP token to the credit protocol's users on June 15. Every single day on Curve, an AMM specializing in stablecoins, since June 15 has had more volume than any other day prior.      Its best day was June 21, when volume broke $54 million. Only as of June 28 has volume started to level off.      Meanwhile, on the premier AMM, Uniswap, volume has been ticking up as well since the COMP debut. It has yet to top its best day ever, which was $40 million on March 13, but the general trading volumes are up.      Uniswap is really two AMMs right now, version 1 (which routes all trades through ETH) and version 2 (which supports direct trades between any two ERC-20 tokens that someone is willing to bootstrap liquidity for).      Read more: Uniswap V2 Launches With More Token-Swap Pairs, Oracle Service, Flash Loans      So far, the best day since the launch of version 2 has been June 19, which saw $25 million in volume across the two versions. Still, overall volume made a step change on June 15. Prior to the launch of COMP, version 2's best day had been June 11, with $6 million in volume. Every day since June 15 has been better than that. In fact, from June 19 to June 28, every single day has seen more than twice as much volume.    Balancer's debut    The most dramatic spike has occurred on Balancer, an app that lets users make self-rebalancing token portfolios that also happens to work as an AMM when needed.      Balancer allowed users to yield farm its governance token last week and volume immediately went up.      Read more: Following COMP’s Surge, DeFi Platform Balancer Begins Distribution of BAL Tokens      Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million, though this aberrant growth likely relates to an unexpected attack on Balancer using non-standard ERC-20 tokens on Sunday.      Nevertheless, usage on the new app is up sharply.    The DeFi-DEX connection    It is easier to maximize interest spurred by Compound and Balancer by remaining in the DeFi ecosystem, rather than toggling back to centralized (or ""CeFi"") options like custodial exchanges.      Ben Forman of Parafi Capital, an alternative investment firm, argues DeFi products are just outperforming the centralized options in more ways all the time.      ""Compound sparked the beginning of a new agricultural revolution where so-called yield farmers are siphoning volume through AMMs instead of centralized exchanges. This isn't ideological behavior – it's the same CeFi users now shifting to DeFi because it's more efficient and profit-maximizing,” Forman said via email.

42432195,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgVh,1593534516,Ethereum Developers Delay Berlin Hard Fork to Stem Client Centralization Concerns,"So many users are dependent on Ethereum client Geth that a bug could temporarily freeze the network – something blockchains aren’t supposed to do, ever. In light of this, Ethereum Core developers decided Friday to postpone work on the Berlin hard fork until at least August in an effort to give other clients a chance to increase their share of the network.      Geth makes up only one of 11 client specifications, but 79% of Ethereum nodes run on it, according to Ether Nodes. That percentage is also up 5% since December. Developers worry that a serious bug could break Ethereum – particularly as rolling updates to Eth 1.x continue before the network transitions to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm under Eth 2.0.      “Geth is the majority of the network,” Geth team leader Péter Szilágyi said in last Friday’s All Core Developers group call. “It’s super important that we are correct because we cannot afford to not be correct.”    Ethereum languages    Having a diversity of clients is good for the network. It allows different projects to join Ethereum’s developer community – from the tiniest startup to JPMorgan. Ethereum had eight languages in various levels of completeness one year after its 2015 launch. The Ethereum Foundation currently lists clients in five languages including Go, Solidity, Java, JavaScript and Python.      Read more: The Zcash Privacy Tech Underlying Ethereum’s Transition to Eth 2.0      Yet, like the human tongue, every programming language has its nuances and therefore implementation drawbacks. When Ethereum developers conduct updates those nuances can turn into nasty bugs.      “The main reason [to postpone Berlin] would be to reduce dependency on Geth and allow it to fail without bringing down the whole network,” said independent developer Alexey Akhunov in a private chat. “Currently the burden is too high since Geth correctness is so critical, and they end up doing most of the work on ensuring everything works correctly.”      This has been accelerated by the deprecation of the Parity Ethereum client as announced by Parity Technologies in December 2019. “Parity is increasingly unable to dedicate the level of resources required for even simple maintenance of this project,” the Parity team wrote in a blog post at the time.      That project’s codebase was handed off to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) of developers funded by ConsenSys spinout Gnosis. It now operates under the name “Open Ethereum.” Since December, the client has lost nearly 60% of its nodes, according to the Web Archive. (Note: Geth has lost some 14% of its nodes since December as well.)    Client diversification    “In an ideal world we would have multiple clients with no client having a higher market share than 33%,” Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann said in a private message. “While it is true that Open Ethereum has not reached the number of nodes running [that] the Parity client had, we don’t see that as a decline. Quite the opposite. When Gnosis effectively took over the responsibility for Open Ethereum we started at a market share of 0.”      Szilágyi’s concerns remain valid regardless of Köppelmann’s enthusiasm, however. Getting individuals, exchanges or clients to run anything but Geth has been difficult and that dependency would be fatally exposed if Geth ever encounters technical issues.      This dependency is the very reason Eth 2.0 is so slow to launch. Eth 2.0 researchers have agreed to wait until a diversity of clients can launch in concert to prevent any hiccups if one or more goes down.      Comparatively, bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies don’t hard fork as often or have as many applications running on them. Ethereum faces something of a bind: loads of projects depending on it for 100% uptime but rolling hard forks every six to 12 months.    Geth burnout?    Moreover, how to get other clients to catch Geth’s lead remains an open question.      Ethereum developer Greg Colvin said in the developer call that it has become a business question and one unlikely to be resolved by developer initiatives. Projects will choose to work with a minority client because they have acute needs that Geth cannot address, such as code not being open sourced. That being said, Colvin said Geth should hire more staff, if possible.      Suspension of testing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) slated for Berlin was one option the developers settled on. Still, Szilágyi concluded the 24/7 responsibility of keeping the “world computer” turning is burning out his team.      “If we are wrong, and for example, [Ethereum client] Nethermind is correct, then it doesn't matter that Nethermind’s code was correct and ours was wrong, because the network went off on the wrong chain,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/30/ethereum-developers-delay-berlin-hard-fork-to-stem-client-centralization-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec3bb47d8d40df01e1fa65b3fb273f7ad7bdd8d3-1500x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Digital Dollars The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will hold a hearing on “The Digitization of Money and Payments.” The witnesses include former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo and Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla, suggesting a focus around central bank digital currencies and stablecoins. Elsewhere, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) will establish four additional “Innovation Hub” branches – in Toronto, Stockholm, London and a joint location for Paris and Frankfurt – to further study the adoption of digital monies and distributed ledger technologies. Finally, the Bank of Canada has published a note saying blockchain privacy solutions, like zero-knowledge proofs, aren’t ready yet for use in a CBDC. (The Block)      Tech Solutions? The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has come under pressure to postpone the launch of a blockchain replacement for its decades-old settlement and clearing system. One of the main share registry companies in Australia, Computershare, told the Financial Times on June 25 it was seeking a two-year delay to the implementation of the ASX’s new blockchain-based system because the new project “lacked clarity.” Meanwhile, a new technical proposal is addressing Ethereum’s growing gas fees by implementing a dynamic pricing system. Called EIP 1559, Ethereum users would now pay a set “base fee” to the network plus a tip to miners.      Crime and Punishments? Alexey Andryunin fakes volumes to get coins listed on exchanges. He didn’t think his services were needed after the collapse of the ICO market, but has found business growing again during the COVID-19 pandemic as token promoters pay him to pump their projects so they’ll be accepted on crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, Sergey Medvedev, a Russian national who operated a digital currency escrow service for the $568 million payment card fraud forum he founded in 2010, pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in what the U.S. government called its largest-ever cyber fraud case. Elsewhere, a hacker has attempted to disrupt a blockchain voting system currently being used in the Russian Federation while hackers have extorted $1.14 million in bitcoin from the University of California. (The Block)      ​​​New Metrics Coin Metrics announced a free float supply methodology for digital assets Tuesday to improve and standardize the industry’s liquidity and market capitalization data. The metric excludes issued cryptos that don’t provide liquidity to get a better sense of a token’s supply. Independently, blockchain analysis company Elliptic has added two privacy coins – zcash (ZEC) and horizen (ZEN) – to its monitoring platform, which provides exchanges and institutional investors insight into when a transaction trail ends so they can take additional due diligence measures.      Fresh Capital Blockchain data startup The Graph has raised $5 million in a token sale with Framework Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent) and others. The funding round follows a $2.5 million VC round early last year and used the “simple agreement for future tokens” (SAFT) format for accredited investors. That is as miner Hut 8 raised a total of $8.3 million from selling a 6% equity stake, it said, approximately $800,000 more than the original $7.5 million target. Finally, The Block’s Michael McSweeney reports crypto exchange giant Binance will acquire a majority stake in Swipe.io, a crypto card startup. “The move paves the way for the crypto exchange giant to move ahead with its plan for a branded payments card,” McSweeney reports.

Meanwhile, gold and the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, are reporting 16% and 5.4% gains for 2020, respectively.      COMP Returns?

Opinion    Humility Before a Fall: Your Crypto Startup Hasn’t Done Anything Yet Dave Balter, CEO of Flipside Crypto, has a message for crypto startups: “Dig a hole, throw your ego into it and pour concrete on top. Find humility instead.” Failure precedes success, he said, a notion often absent from the crypto conversation. “Many leaders think just being in the blockchain space makes them untouchable. They count an easy ICO raise as validation of success. They’re proud of developing something so technically complex their team barely understands it.”      Why Bitcoin Will Take a Long Time to Dethrone the Dollar Byrne Hobart, a CoinDesk columnist and New York-based investor, consultant and writer, takes a look at the concept of hyperbitcoinization, the theory that bitcoin will become a global reserve currency, and thinks it’s a ways off. The same forces that one might assume lead to a crypto future are those that are keeping the U.S. dollar in its throne. “Ironically, the same factors bitcoin advocates point to as evidence the fiat system is broken – high leverage and a financialized economy – make it durable, too.

The firm said in a press release Tuesday it's already operating on a ""network of independent data centers"" across the U.S. and Europe, enabling developers and businesses to build and launch their own apps and projects onto the platform.      Projects already being built atop of Dfinity's Internet Computer include a decentralized payment app as well as a platform for luxury goods. Apps on the platform can also benefit from a native ecosystem fund known as Beacon Fund that is being delivered in conjunction with Polychain Capital.      Dfinity describes its product as ""cloud 3.0,"" which it claims is a scalable decentralized network that is more efficient than proof-of-work consensus, aka mining.      Dfinity's ""Tungsten"" release is aimed at developers, with the firm touting it as a way to disrupt the near-monopolies of big tech companies.      “One of the biggest problems emerging in technology is the monopolization of the internet by big tech companies that have consolidated near-total control over our technologies,"" said Dominic Williams, founder and chief scientist at Dfinity. ""They collect vast amounts of information about us that they sell for profit and leverage to amass greater market share and acquire or bulldoze rivals at an alarming rate.""      The Internet Computer and its open services, Williams continued, create a way to ""reboot the internet creating a public alternative to proprietary cloud infrastructure.""    TikTok rival    As part of that process, Dfinity also announced Tuesday it has built a new service called CanCan. The press release said CanCan highlights the ""simplicity"" of the Internet Computer because it was built with less than 1,000 lines of code, in contrast to Facebook, which took 62 million lines.

42432201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgnh,1593524169,Why the Stock-to-Flow Bitcoin Valuation Model Is Wrong,"Nico Cordeiro is the chief investment officer and fund manager at Strix Leviathan. He oversees quantitative research, strategy development, risk management and portfolio allocation. A longer version of this post can be found here.      The stock-to-flow model (SF), popularized by a pseudonymous Dutch institutional investor who operates under the Twitter account “PlanB,” has been widely praised and is the leading valuation model for bitcoin proponents. SF has achieved viral popularity and inspired rags-to-riches dreams for those gambling it all on the future of bitcoin. However, we believe the model’s accuracy will likely be about as successful at forecasting bitcoin’s future price as the astrological models of the past were at predicting financial outcomes.      Stanford Professor Paul Pleifderer coined the term “chameleons” to describe models that are built upon dubious assumptions and are given more credence than they deserve. An initial evaluation of any model should begin with a critical look at the model’s theoretical assumptions, he says. As an example, Pleifderer provides the following scenario:    Imagine an asset pricing model based on the assumption that there is no uncertainty about any asset's returns. … No serious person would suggest that the predictions of the model should be subjected to rigorous empirical testing before rejecting it. The model can be rejected simply on the basis that a critical assumption is contradicted by what we already know to be true.    Chameleons are particularly difficult to spot and dispute because they appear to be meaningful. It’s only under further scrutiny that you realize they are built upon assumptions that do not map to what we know about the real world.    Introducing stock-to-flow    PlanB’s paper “Modeling Bitcoin Value with Scarcity” states that certain precious metals have maintained a monetary role throughout history because of their unforgeable costliness and low rate of supply. For example, gold is valuable both because new supply (mined gold) is insignificant to the current supply and because it is impossible to replicate the vast stores of gold around the globe. PlanB then argues this same logic applies to bitcoin, which becomes more valuable as new supply is reduced every four years, ultimately culminating in a supply of 21 million bitcoin.      Low rate of supply, which PlanB defines as “scarcity,” can be quantified using a metric called Stock-to-Flow (SF), which is the ratio between current supply and new supply.      This premise is then translated into the hypothesis, “…that scarcity, as measured by SF, directly drives value.” PlanB then plots bitcoin’s SF against USD market capitalization as well as two arbitrarily chosen SF data points for gold and silver.      PlanB then runs a linear regression using the natural logarithm of bitcoin’s SF metric as the independent variable and the USD market capitalization as the dependent variable. The paper ends with the conclusion that there is a statistically significant relationship between USD market capitalization and SF values, as evidenced by the linear regression resulting in an R2 (a statistical measure of how close the data fits to a regression line) of ~0.95. The two randomly chosen data points for gold and silver are in line with bitcoin’s trajectory and presented as further evidence of the hypothesis.      PlanB suggests that investors can forecast the future USD market capitalization of bitcoin using the above formula. This has helped give credence to those $100,000 bitcoin projections.    Problems abound    There are several deficiencies within the paper, both in its theoretical proposition and its empirical foundation.      From a theoretical point of view, the model is based on the rather strong assertion that the USD market capitalization of a monetary good (e.g. gold and silver) is derived directly from their rate of new supply. No evidence or research is provided to support this idea, other than the singular data points selected to chart gold and silver’s market capitalization against bitcoin’s trajectory.    This becomes quite obvious when one extends the model into the near future. By 2045, the model estimates each Bitcoin will be worth $235,000,000,000.    The second is the naïve application of a linear regression that results in a high probability of a researcher finding spurious results. “Good” statistical results, such as a high R-square, do not constitute a meaningful finding. It is common for researchers to underestimate how often such techniques lead to false results. And particularly in this situation, where there is a large degree of freedom for random data to fit a specific outcome.    Gold and the dollar    From a theoretical perspective, what PlanB defines as “scarcity” is not scarcity by definition. PlanB uses “scarcity” to describe an asset’s supply growth rate or new production as measured by the SF metric. This assumes that increasing new supply depresses price through increased selling pressure from producers and vice versa.      This seems reasonable at first glance until one considers that a high SF represents a dynamic where new supply is insignificant to the current supply. PlanB quotes ""Bitcoin Standard” author Saifedean Ammous saying as much: ""For gold, a price spike that causes a doubling of annual production will be insignificant, increasing stockpiles by 3% rather than 1.5%.""      Perhaps unsurprisingly then, SF has no direct relationship with gold’s value over the last 115 years, as can be seen in the scatter plot below. Gold’s market capitalization held valuations between ~$60 billion to ~$9 trillion, all at the same SF value of 60. A range of $8 trillion is not very indicative of explanatory power and lends itself to the obvious conclusion that other factors drive gold’s USD valuation.      Recall that the value of gold/USD is the ratio of purchasing power between gold and the USD. When the purchasing power of the dollar decreases, the value of gold/USD increases and vice versa. With relative stability in the purchasing power of gold, we find that roughly 88% of the variability in gold's value over the last 115 years can be explained by the substantial decrease in the purchasing power of the USD, with $1 in 1915 now worth just $0.04. Most market participants understand this dynamic intuitively, buying and selling gold based on USD inflationary expectations.      While a higher SF value may be a necessary feature for a commodity to serve as “hard money,” the metric itself says nothing about how market participants value said commodity. Many cryptocurrencies which utilize Bitcoin’s code have the exact same supply schedule as Bitcoin and everyone understands their SF values have nothing to do with their future (or current) valuation.      We are left with a hypothesis that applies to no economic assets except bitcoin and whose only evidence is a linear regression with questionable application and clear selection bias.    $235 billion bitcoin to infinity    An entire overview of linear regression and its mathematical basis is beyond the scope of this analysis. However, there are several implementation errors well-established in the research community that demonstrate why the SF model is likely to be spurious. Obscure math has allowed SF proponents to dismiss all criticism so it may be more intuitive to understand conceptually why the SF model is irrelevant for future price predictions.      The model supplied in the SF paper is the same slope-intercept equation everyone learns in 7th grade: y = mx + b. An ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression is not a predictive model but rather an estimation of the m and b values that minimize the difference between the actual y values and the estimated y values given by the equation mx+b. In other words, every change in x equates to a corresponding change in y.      Recall that OLS is estimating how much y (Market Cap) changes for a given change in x (SF). On a month-to-month basis in which the model is derived, the change in x is effectively 0. As a result, the OLS model is doing nothing more than estimating Bitcoin’s historical growth rate. This becomes quite obvious when one extends the model into the near future. By 2045, the model estimates each Bitcoin will be worth $235,000,000,000 before eventually converging to infinity as bitcoin’s flow approaches 0.      Using the estimated slope-intercept formula is making the most naive prediction possible, because bitcoin grew by X in the past, it will grow by X in the future. One should remember that past results are not representative of future returns.    Marketing piece    Darrell Huff wrote in ""How to Lie with Statistics"": “Many a statistic is false on its face. It gets by only because the magic of numbers brings about a suspension of common sense.” Upon reflection, few would take seriously the idea that gold’s USD price is a function of its own supply rate and therefore so is bitcoin’s. Yet, the supposed mathematical precision presented in the paper has resulted in the SF model continuing to be heavily promoted in both retail and professional investment channels.      Investors should be highly skeptical of this model even if they believe bitcoin is digital gold. The SF paper is not proper empirical analysis, but more akin to a marketing piece in which the author is trying to convince readers that bitcoin is going to be worth a lot more tomorrow. This may or may not turn out true, but it has little to do with bitcoin’s supply schedule.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Nico Cordeiro,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/30/why-the-stock-to-flow-bitcoin-valuation-model-is-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c01625806d60e17f6df88ac6b3fceb8faf898b9e-1300x731.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Tuesday, the addition of zcash (ZEC) and horizen (ZEN) will provide exchanges and institutional investors insight into when a transaction trail ends so they can take additional due-diligence measures.      Privacy is a core tenet of crypto, and firms looking to shine a light on shielded transactions must walk a fine line.      “We are helping regulated businesses look at transactions on the blockchain and completely support people’s rights to financial privacy,” said Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s chief scientist. “If funds are seen to come from a shielded address, that might then trigger some additional compliance processes.”      Elliptic’s announcement follows close on the heels of arch-rival Chainalysis, which trumpeted its support for zcash and dash earlier this month.      Read more: Crypto Forensics Firm Chainalysis Adds Tracing Support for Zcash, Dash      Robinson said his company was not seeking to defeat any of the privacy-enhancing functionality of these coins, adding a philosophical jab at his competitor.      “One of the core differences between us and Chainalysis is that they are really focused on law enforcement and so they will have customers who are asking them to de-anonymize the likes of Monero,” said Robinson. “We provide transaction screening tools for exchanges and don’t plan to offer our functionality on something like Monero where everything is private by default.”      Regarding the philosophical issue of shining a light on private transactions, Chainalysis communications director Madeleine Kennedy said:    ""We believe there needs to be a balance between privacy and transparency and specifically blockchains like bitcoin achieve this balance. They provide pseudonymity so that personally identifiable information is not publicly available on the blockchain, but provide enough transparency to ensure safety and security.""  How private?    Privacy coins have a range of clever techniques built into them to avoid leaving a transaction trail on the blockchain. In the case of ZEC and ZEN, there’s a kind of opt-in privacy measure whereby users can choose to make their transactions visible on the blockchain or not.      Similar to how exchanges want to know if a bitcoin transaction has come their way via a mixer (a technique of combining many addresses to hide the originator of the transaction), Elliptic is offering a comparable service for privacy coins, said Robinson, showing when a transaction has come from a shielded address.      Read more: Coinbase UK Dropping Support for Cryptocurrency Zcash      “Regulated businesses want to know whether funds are coming from shielded addresses, just as they want to know whether bitcoin is coming from a mixer,” Robinson added. “That doesn't necessarily mean those funds are bad or illicit in some way; firms just need to know in order that they can take the appropriate next steps.”      Being able to tell when a transaction comes from a shielded zcash or horizen address will help increase adoption of these coins, Robinson said, since in some cases exchanges have been forced to delist privacy coins in order to maintain banking relationships.      “I think this capability remedies that,” said Robinson. “Something like zcash is now lower risk than bitcoin because you have the same visibility. Our analysis also shows zcash isn’t really used for illicit trade; there are very few dark marketplaces that accept zcash as a means of payment,” he said.      Kennedy of Chainalysis said the vast majority of zcash transactions are supported in the company’s analytics products.      “Roughly 14% of Zcash transactions involve one of Zcash’s two shielded pools in some way,"" she said. ""But of the transactions that interact with a shielded pool, only 6% are completely shielded, i.e. sender, receiver and transaction amount are all encrypted. That’s only 0.9% of all Zcash transactions.""

Genesis does not conduct transactions with shielded addresses and does not conduct transactions with coins with any shielded address history, said Martin Garcia, the firm’s managing director.      “If coins come from an unshielded address, and have an unshielded address history, we perform additional due diligence based on the risk rating of the counterparty and the dollar value of the transaction,” said Garcia.",NEUTRAL,ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZEC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/30/elliptic-follows-chainalysis-in-adding-zcash-to-monitoring-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6359a9ff83ee7ba7465c0ff2289cb8ae23e7ac43-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432193,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgXh,1593522001,Coinbase Ventures Invests in $5M Token Sale for Ethereum Data Firm 'The Graph',"Blockchain data startup The Graph has raised $5 million in a token sale with Framework Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group, Multicoin Capital, DTC Capital and others.      The funding round follows a $2.5 million venture capital round early last year. The new token sale used the “simple agreement for future tokens” (SAFT) format for accredited investors.      The Graph CEO Yaniv Tal said “thousands” of developers already use the startup’s tools, including the teams behind the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap and the token-fueled Aragon project.      His startup created an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data so people can access it. People use The Graph’s open-source software to search for specific Ethereum data, the same way we search Google for a recipe, sometimes instead of running their own Ethereum node.      Read more: Multicoin Capital Leads $2.5 Million Seed Round for Blockchain Data Index      Uniswap co-founder Hayden Adams said a considerable portion of the DEX ecosystem is reliant on nodes operated by Infura, the ConsenSys-owned API provider. Likewise, The Graph offers another tool for companies that want to offer Ethereum-related services regardless of direct participation in the blockchain network.      “We use [The Graph] for Uniswap.info, our analytics site,” Adams said. “As a company we don’t manage or run our own databases. … Right now it’s pretty difficult to get historic data from the Ethereum blockchain in an efficient way.”      Since The Graph freely provides open-source software, and isn’t promising prompt revenue, any investment in its tokens may be a signal the investor is bullish on Ethereum applications.      “We haven’t shared the token distribution yet,” Tal said when asked about the token sale and strategy.      Instead, he said his startup’s staff of 17 is “taking a similar path as Compound,” the decentralized finance (DeFi) startup that also attracted investment from Coinbase and recently inspired the “yield farming” craze with the issuance of its COMP governance tokens.      Read more: A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand      Tal said Compound’s model looks like “a really good route, in general” for a crypto startup.    Early plans    “We’ll expand to other blockchains soon,” Tal said.      In a press release, investor Michael Anderson of Framework Ventures said the firm “couldn’t be happier to back Yaniv and the team, and we look forward to helping grow the decentralized network when it launches.”      Anderson’s firm is also invested in the price feed provider Chainlink, indicating the firm may be betting on the growth of Ethereum-based services. DTC Capital investor Spencer Noon said he doesn’t expect most users to interact with The Graph token.      “They’ll pay for this service with dai or ether, a more liquid token,” Noon said, explaining how The Graph could follow the 0x model where many service providers offer paid access to the open-source software. Such index providers would use the token on the backend.      Read more: Uniswap V2 Launches With More Token-Swap Pairs, Oracle Service, Flash Loans      A spokesperson for The Graph said the startup uses an “external node provider,” declining to specify which, and that in the future other indexers will choose whether to rely on such providers or run Ethereum nodes themselves.      “Their plan is to decentralize their protocol and make it community-owned and -operated,” Noon said of Tal’s team. “I look at [The Graph] as the first of many middleware options in the space. … They are now processing 45 million queries per day. That’s product-market-fit.”      As for Tal, he said although token sales “got a bad name in 2017,” he thinks 2020 will be a fruitful year for the Ethereum ecosystem.      “It’s encouraging to see this next wave of projects are finally solving real problems and finding product-market fit,” Tal said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/30/coinbase-ventures-invests-in-5m-token-sale-for-ethereum-data-firm-the-graph,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8084cb78f3ca249b38325133f7d9fc063b2f2678-1500x1077.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgjh,1593519046,Coin Metrics Offers More Rigorous Measure of Crypto Market Supply,"Cryptocurrency investors have long sought a standardized way of measuring the size and depth of digital asset markets. A new data product from Coin Metrics seeks a way to approximate it.      The cryptocurrency data firm announced its free float supply methodology for digital assets Tuesday to improve and standardize the industry’s liquidity and market capitalization data.      Cryptocurrency markets have historically lacked consistent, standardized supply data for digital assets, according to the Boston, Mass. company. Borrowing from traditional markets, Coin Metrics’ methodology excludes issued coins and tokens that don’t provide liquidity because they are burned or probably lost, owned by foundations or founding teams, and inactive for over five years.      See also: Bitcoin Facing Greater Price Volatility Than Ether in Q3, Options Market Data Suggests      With this data, investors can “consistently” apply a more precise definition of an asset’s supply to multi-asset indices, market capitalizations and valuation methods, according to Coin Metrics. “The current state of supply data can vary significantly depending on what data source is used, making it very difficult for participants and investors to make informed decisions,” said Ben Celermajer, index manager at Coin Metrics.      Bitcoin’s supply demonstrates the significant difference between free float and issued supply data. According to Coin Metrics, bitcoin’s free float is nearly 25% smaller than the commonly cited 18.4 million bitcoins issued to date.      Forked assets, created by copying the Bitcoin blockchain, demonstrate an even starker difference between free float and issued supply. The Bitcoin Cash market is 36% smaller than its current supply indicates, according to Coin Metrics data. Free float supply of Bitcoin SV, another forked cryptocurrency, is 45% lower than its current supply.      See also: Why Bitcoin Will Take a Long Time to Dethrone the Dollar      Coin Metrics' free float supply data can improve the reliability of a variety of cryptocurrency valuation metrics, according to Yan Liberman, former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-founder of Delphi Digital, a digital asset research group. The popular Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio, dubbed a “crypto PE ratio,” and Delphi Digital's UTXO-adjusted Network Value Transactions Signal (NVTS) are two such relative valuation metrics that could benefit.      Free float data improves the quality of these metrics, Liberman told CoinDesk, by ""adjusting supply to a more appropriate level for the calculation.""",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/30/coin-metrics-offers-more-rigorous-measure-of-crypto-market-supply,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dc81f69943628282eb44e1a4154a912ba38bb48-1500x1049.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432191,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgRh,1593518880,"BIS Plans New Central Banking Fintech Research Hubs in Europe, North America","The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) will establish four additional “Innovation Hub” branches – in Toronto, Stockholm, London and a joint location for Paris and Frankfurt – over the next two years in a major expansion of its year-old effort to ponder the future of money.      These new locations, announced Tuesday, “will be well placed to advance work” on digital currency and distributed ledger technology (DLT) alongside other central banking issues including cyber security, artificial intelligence and digital payments, said Innovation Hub chief Benoît Cœuré in a press statement.      BIS, often referred to as the central bank for central banks, also announced its Innovation Hub will form a strategic partnership with the U.S. Federal Reserve System.      Coming exactly a year after the BIS unveiled its vision to build an international tech collaborative for its 62 member central banks, the expansion solidifies the Swiss-based institution’s multifaceted drive to incubate fintech at the highest levels of monetary policymaking.      Read more: CBDC Issuance Is ‘Not a Reaction’ to Libra, Says Central Bank Body      It also signals that the BIS remains serious about including at least part of the lessons of cryptocurrency in those discussions. BIS had previously tasked its existing Innovation Hubs with investigating stablecoins, DLT and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), among other trends.      The latest batch of Hub cities may not surprise those who closely follow the rather obscure realm of central banking innovation. The Bank of Canada and Sveriges Riksbank are both considering projects that could fundamentally reshape how their citizenry interacts with money, and the European Central Bank (ECB), represented by Paris and Frankfurt joined the BIS and four other central banks in January, including those of Sweden and Britain, to study CBDC.      Perhaps more surprising is the staggering breadth of central banks the year-old Innovation Hub initiative is now set to unite.      As per Tuesday’s announcement, the Innovation Hub will have inroads with the entire euro system, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, Canada, England, the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland, who already host Innovation Hubs.      “The BIS Innovation Hub is an investment in the future of central banking and the financial system,” BIS chief Agustín Carstens said in the statement. “These new centers will expand our reach significantly and help create a global force for fintech innovation.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/30/bis-plans-new-central-banking-fintech-research-hubs-in-europe-north-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d41d322556a42d754fbd504f3177bcde8717bf6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432203,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgrh,1593516937,First Mover: Bitwise Calls $50K Bitcoin Price When Market Calm Finally Breaks,"Bitcoin has traded in an ever-tightening range for two months, and digital-market analysts say a new wave of coronavirus cases and emergency measures could provoke the largest cryptocurrency by market cap out of the doldrums.      The backdrop is an anemic economy, with the International Monetary Fund projecting last week that global output will shrink 4.9% this year: worse than its April forecast for 3% contraction. Confirmed deaths from the coronavirus passed half a million on Sunday, and authorities from China to the U.S. states of Florida and Texas enacted new restrictions to curb rising caseloads. The World Health Organization has also warned the worst is yet to come.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Volatility is rising in the U.S. stock market, with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index still just 10% off the record high reached in February. Yet, bitcoin has been stuck between $8,500 and $10,200 since late April, a remarkably placid stretch given the ongoing tribulations.      For bitcoin traders, it might not be the best time to sneak away for vacation.      ""With more uncertainty in the stock market again and a monthly close coming up, we may face increased volatility going into July,"" analysts with the cryptocurrency-analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Friday in a report.      Bitcoin's stretch of calm is evident in price charts focused on a statistical pattern known as Bollinger Bands, which narrow when volatility shrinks. The bandwidth as of Monday had narrowed to 0.09, close to its lowest level in 2020.      CoinDesk Research Director Noelle Acheson noted on Sunday that bitcoin's shrinking volatility contrasts with the persistent level of price swings in the S&P 500.      Stock traders are struggling to reconcile U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's predictions of a ""spectacular rebound"" later this year with Federal Reserve officials' warnings that the timing and strength of the recovery are uncertain.      Big cryptocurrency investors including Pantera Capital and Bitwise Asset Management say bitcoin prices could benefit from the next wave of government and central bank stimulus packages, which might be needed to prevent deeper economic fallout.      Due to its capped supply of 21 million, bitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold.      U.S. President Donald Trump, who is fading in the polls as the November elections approach, has reportedly told aides that he favors sending Americans another round of stimulus checks.      And the Federal Reserve saidMonday it would start buying bonds directly from the companies that issue them, effectively becoming the lender of last resort to big corporations; historically, such emergency lending was restricted to financial institutions.      ""The Fed is buying everything that isn’t nailed down,"" the cryptocurrency investment firm Arca wrote Monday in a weekly newsletter. ""Naturally, even the most bullish investors remain somewhat cautious with regard to when all of this unwinds.""      Based on one popular investment model, known as the ""stock-to-flow ratio,"" bitcoin could rise to $115,000 by August 2021, according to Pantera. On Monday, the cryptocurrency changed hands at $9,151.      The ""tsunami of money will have a large impact,"" Pantera wrote last week in a monthly newsletter. ""If there are trillions more paper dollars, the law of supply and demand implies much more paper money to buy the same amount of cryptocurrency.""      Matthew Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise, wrote in a monthly investor letter on June 15 that bitcoin could reach $50,000 if its market capitalization reached just 10% of gold's roughly $9 trillion.      ""It's a matter of when, not if,"" Hougan told First Mover in a follow-up email.      Analysts with the digital-asset research firm Delphi Digital wrote Friday that ""we're rapidly approaching a key inflection point as policymakers debate if and when to deploy their next wave of relief measures.""      ""One could argue the broader macro backdrop has never been more favorable for bitcoin,"" according to Delphi.      Anything to break up the monotony.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,156 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,224 | 24-Hr Low: $9,032      Trend: Bitcoin’s price bounce from the weekend low of $8,830 could well be short-lived, price-volume analysis indicates.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,150, representing a 3% decline on a month-to-date basis. Prices clocked a high of $9,233 early Tuesday.      The recovery from sub-$9,000 saved the day for the bulls. After all, acceptance under that level would have marked a downside break of the multi-week long trading range of $9,000 to $10,000 and could have fuelled steeper price declines.      However, the relief could be temporary as the uptick from $8,830 to $9,233 is accompanied by a drop in trading volumes, as seen on the hourly chart. A low-volume bounce is often short-lived.      Also, the price rise seen over the past two days has taken the shape of a bear flag, a bearish continuation pattern. A break below the lower end of the flag, currently at $9,100, if confirmed, would create room for a sell-off to $8,150 (target as per the measured move method).      The bearish pattern would be invalidated if prices rise above the hourly chart resistance at $9,344.

42432202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgph,1593513674,Bitcoin Still Up 27% This Year Despite Dismal June Performance,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still outperforming the top traditional financial assets so far in 2020 – even after a dour performance this month.      At time of writing (10:00 UTC), bitcoin is trading around $9,170, representing a 27.8% gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, gold and the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, are reporting 16% and 5.4% gains for 2020, respectively. The S&P 500 index and oil prices are in the red YTD at -5.5% and -34.22%, respectively, as per data source Skew.      While bitcoin’s YTD performance looks impressive, on a monthly basis the cryptocurrency is being outshone by most of the other assets included in the chart.      At press time, bitcoin is down over 3% from the opening price of $9,444 observed on June 1, having rallied by 34% and 9.5% in April and May, respectively.      “We are in a post-halving price action lull, but investor and on-chain activity has been strong,” said Kyle Davies, co-founder and chairman at Three Arrows Capital.      Bitcoin underwent its third mining reward halving on May 11. The event was expected by some to accelerate price gains; however, strong buying pressure has remained elusive so far, with the cryptocurrency restricted largely to the narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000 since mid May.      Also read: Third Halving Turns Out to Be Non-Event for Bitcoin’s Price      Investors, however, continue to pour money into bitcoin-based exchange-traded instruments like Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest by assets under management (AUM).      “Grayscale saw record subscriptions of 19,000 bitcoin in the latest 2 week period ending 24-Jun,” said Davies, whose firm is the biggest public shareholder in GBTC. In May, the trust accumulated 1.5 times the total of coins mined since the May 11 halving.      Grayscale is a fully owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent firm.    HODLing growth    Onchain metrics are also painting a long-term bullish picture. For instance, the percent of bitcoin’s circulating supply that has not moved in at least 12 months reached a record high of 61.59% on Monday. The figure surpasses the previous lifetime high of 61.13% seen in January 2016, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      “The data shows that we are in a period of sustained HODLing. The last time the number of coins last active 1+ years ago exceeded 60% was in early 2016, just before the price started increasing ever-more-rapidly leading up to the bull run to $20K,” analysts at Glassnode said in a weekly analysis.      Other on-chain activity is also picking up pace due to the recent explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). “Bitcoin tokenized on Ethereum has passed 11,000 (more than $100 million) and fees on Ethereum’s network have reached record highs due to increased tether and Defi transactions,"" said Davies. ""This will eventually impact market prices.”      While investor flows and on-chain metrics are supportive of stronger gains in bitcoin, seasonal patterns favor a minor correction.      As can be seen, bitcoin has posted losses in the third quarter in four out of the last six years. On most occasions, the negative third-quarter performance is preceded by stellar gains in the April to June period.

One of the main share registry companies in Australia, Computershare, told the Financial Times (FT) on June 25 it was seeking a two-year delay to the implementation of the ASX's new blockchain-based system because the new project ""lacked clarity.""      The Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS, is the existing infrastructure responsible for clearing and settlements of trades and transactions on the ASX's network. The stock exchange is planning to overhaul the current system with distributed ledger technology to enable same-day settlements.      Concerns raised by Computershare relate to a claimed lack of clear information on the technical and operational aspects of CHESS, the fee structure for new services and how regulation would be implemented and governed on the new system.      See also: ASX Accused of Trying to ‘Crush’ Rival Blockchain Trading System      Several ASX clients have also expressed their concerns over the ASX's ability to increase its dominant market position for clearing and settlement into other markets including share registry services, per the report.      “This [new platform] is owned by ASX and the ASX is a monopoly, it’s not ideal. I don’t believe they should own it,” Tony Cunningham, founder of Perth-based stockbroker CPS Capital, told the FT. “If ASX [has] a distributed ledger, then why do you have a share registry?”      After a series of studies were conducted in August 2017 relating to the viability of DLT systems for the purpose of settlement and clearing, the ASX finally said yes to settling trades using DLT with a planned launch date previously expected in April 2021.      The DLT CHESS replacement has faced several road bumps including in 2018 when the ASX decided to postpone the proposed date over concerns raised by respondents detailing whether the implementation window of Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 was achievable. This March, it further delayed the launch due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.      See also: ASX’s Long-in-the-Works DLT Plan on Ice Amid Coronavirus Concerns      The rollout looks likely to face further setbacks, with the stock exchange having just agreed to another ""short delay,"" as reported in the FT.      “We know there are stakeholders who want a small change to the go-live date as well as those who are seeking for more time,” the ASX said as per FT reporting. “We will listen carefully to the consultation feedback prior to finalizing the revised implementation timeline.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/30/asx-under-pressure-to-further-delay-rollout-of-dlt-settlement-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5f1e7dc958d245aaaccd98332f35968e6fb16a9-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAgFh,1593504008,"To His Own Surprise, Crypto Volume Pumper's Business Is Still Thriving","Eleven months ago, Alexey Andryunin was sure his business was not long for this world.      A 22-year-old math student from Moscow, Andryunin built a business inflating trade volumes in little-known crypto tokens issued during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) craze. In a head-turning interview CoinDesk published last July, Andryunin candidly described the underworld of micro-cap tokens and exchanges surviving on artificial volumes ginned up by paid “market makers” (a traditional finance term used loosely in this context.)      At the time, Andryunin thought his business was heading to a decline: ICOs were moribund, the token market was shrinking and a new wave of regulatory attention was about to scour the shadier corners of the crypto space.      He now says he was mistaken. Business is growing again as token promoters pay him to pump their projects so they'll be accepted on crypto exchanges. It doesn't hurt that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in investors looking for the next crypto opportunity.      “We were about to switch to big data analysis, but we didn’t have a moment to start there [because] the crypto market suddenly turned around to us,” he told CoinDesk recently.      In addition to inflating volumes, his firm is providing all kinds of services to token projects. It will code apps when the founders of the projects have nothing but an idea, Andryunin said – for a price.      Flashback: For $15K, He’ll Fake Your Exchange Volume – You’ll Get on CoinMarketCap      Previously a two-man shop, Andryunin’s firm, Gotbit, now has a team of seven and a seemingly endless pool of readily available freelancers from the body of math students at Moscow State University, where Andryunin himself is a junior.      He found the CEO life incompatible with his college schedule, though, so he’s thinking of dropping school after this semester. ""[Studying] fundamental mathematics and leading a business do not come together well.”      Andryunin’s newfound career shows that long after the ICO craze ended, there are dozens of outfits still raising funds via token sales – and the pandemic has made business lucrative once again for issuers and middlemen.      While the dollar amounts are far smaller than during the go-go days, the token market is active. In just the last 30 days, over 60 new tokens have been listed on CoinMarketCap, the popular website recently acquired by Binance.      The world of penny tokens and obscure exchanges is still appealing, Andryunin says. In his estimate, each month the market for promoting new tokens generates about 1,000 BTC (roughly $9 million at recent prices) in fees for companies like his.    Indoor activities    Sergey Khitrov, founder of Listing.Help, which serves as an intermediary between token projects trying to get listed and exchanges, said demand for such services soared this spring.      “In the times of pandemic, many businesses took a hit, and the companies shifted to making crypto projects, which increased the demand for listings,” Khitrov said. In addition, during the spring many exchanges lowered their listing fees, which also stimulated demand.      About 95% of the tokens created through ICOs are now dead, he estimated, with their value up to 70 times smaller than at their peak in 2017. Nevertheless, some people still want to play the token game.      See also: Coinbase Open Sources Technical Standard to Streamline Token Listings      At Binance, the world’s largest crypto trading venue, the flow of new listings for the initial exchange offering (IEO) platform, Binance Launchpad, “has slowed down considerably since 2019 due to the market trend,” said a spokesperson, Leah Li.      However, the platform, which is now offering new tokens in two formats, a traditional IEO and a lottery, “remains very popular among Binance users,” with up to 22,000 users taking part in a single IEO, Li said.      One reason: As the COVID-19 crisis hit traditional, offline businesses hard, investors turned their attention to the online sphere.      “People with money who used to invest in offline businesses, they are now investing in digital ones,” said Nikita Brudnov, CEO of B&R Group, which is also in the token-listing business and subcontracts some services from Andryunin’s firm – including, Brudnov said, the trading volume bots.      It’s mostly a path that gaming, entertainment and financial firms take, Brudnov added. The online realm saw a surge in demand, too: When people are stuck at home during a pandemic, they try their hand at day trading more often.      “A lot of people have been flocking to crypto recently, and when bitcoin crashed many bought in,” Brudnov said, referring to the steep price decline in mid-March.      However, the point of using tokens for fundraising by established businesses is not entirely clear to Brudnov or Andryunin, even though both cater to such clients.    'Why do you need crypto?'    “I’m asking them: Why do you need crypto here? And they don’t even know it themselves. They got into that in 2017 and still keep doing the same,” Andryunin said. “Some of those projects are made by people who have already [done] something successful in crypto and that’s the only way they know.”      It's also an easier (although not completely welcomed by regulators) way of fundraising, he added.      Initial public offerings are ""a difficult thing to do. You need to have a strong project, notable market cap, long-time growth. And to issue a token, you need one bitcoin, five lines of code and a token on Ethereum,” Andryunin said.      However, Gotbit has become more selective when it comes to new clients, trying to choose those with sound business models, not just “grab a quick buck and run,” Andryunin said. “For example, one of our clients is a sports game startup with a token. For such clients, we agree to make discounts and even take their tokens as a payment.”    A lot of people have been flocking to crypto recently, and when bitcoin crashed many bought in.    The firm now boasts over 80 customers, including 34 token issuers, and five exchanges in the pipeline.      They come from Asia, traditionally active on the crypto scene, the Middle East and European countries including Switzerland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, Andryunin said.    The path to listing    Andryunin’s clients have evolved with time, he said: Startups selling tokens switched from public sales to private investments by funds, friends and family. Brudnov said after ICOs died out their later incarnation, IEOs, turned out to be of little use unless the tokens could be listed on top exchanges.      “We have some clients who did IEOs and they raised nothing. Like, $1,000,” Brudnov said.      However, that’s not true for IEOs at leading exchanges by volume like Binance, KuCoin or Huobi, Brudnov said.      According to Andryunin, Gotbit has a strategy that allows a token to be listed on these exchanges within six months.      The strategy works by first listing the tokens on a few small exchanges, some marketing and community development work and then pumping up the volume.      For IEOs conducted on auxiliary platforms of large exchanges, such as Binance’s Launchpad, it’s common to let the community vote and select new tokens for listings.      See also: Crypto Exchanges Must Stop Acting Like Casinos in Wake of Robinhood Suicide: bitFlyer Exec      If the voting goes well and the tokens get listed, the project’s bad times are over, Andryunin said. “The client gets endless liquidity, many users, the funds start coming to them willing to invest.” (He stresses that his bot-driven volume inflation is limited to smaller exchanges, not the big-name venues.)      Further, after a listing on a major exchange like Binance, a number of other smaller exchanges list these tokens immediately, to piggyback on the fresh wave of traders’ interest.      Sixteen Gotbit token projects were accepted by community voting and four were listed on one of those exchanges’ IEO platforms, Andryunin said.    Priming the pump    To get the token on its way to CoinMarketCap and bigger exchanges, the manipulation is done in short “sprints” at the very beginning “so that the project doesn’t hang there with no market,"" Andryunin said. ""It’s a very negative thing.”      But Gotbit “really pumps the volume into the market” in the last few months before a big exchange’s IEO community voting takes place, so traders don’t lose interest right before the final battle, Andryunin said.      Such tokens are not volatile enough to attract traders on their own, he said, and there are no sophisticated speculation tools that would allow profiting from even small price moves, as there are for bitcoin.      Six months of work can cost a GotBit client $60,000 to $100,000, depending on how much effort a token requires to get listed. Some require artificial volume support even after the listing, he adds. Some exchanges require that a token have a minimum trading volume, or it gets delisted – and the natural interest in such tokens on the traders’ side is often far from the required level.      Binance is always in contact with new projects’ founders and “extensively check[s] the information/metrics provided to ensure accuracy and authenticity,” spokesperson Leah Li told CoinDesk. To select projects for community vote, Binance looks for things like “a proven team, useful product, and large user base.”      “The team’s commitment to its project is a key indicator, as well as the level and quality of development activity. We review each project diligently to ensure that it meets the high level of standard we expect,” she added.      As for existing trading volume, it’s only ”one of the many factors” to consider, Li said, adding: “It’s usually quite obvious to determine how real the volume is by just looking at which exchange it is.""    Going legit    An even bigger market now is not tokens, but exchanges, Andryunin says, especially the ones trading futures contracts.      See also: Number of Institutions Buying Crypto Futures Doubled in 2020: Fidelity Report      In March, Gotbit started providing liquidity to such exchanges, mostly by copying the order books at bigger exchanges, like Binance.      For example, to close a sell order on a smaller exchange, Gotbit opens a buy order on a larger one.      “On the futures exchanges, you can really make a lot of money; many people come there thinking they are great traders and buy bitcoin with 100 times leverage. They are creating this inefficiency in the market and inevitably hit our orders, so we’re making money,” Andryunin says.

The Toronto-listed mining company says the funding will keep it competitive as smaller entities with older equipment feel the pinch from last month's halving.      “We’re proud to close the first prospectus offering by a cryptocurrency mining company in Canada and further improve Hut 8’s lead as one of the largest public bitcoin miners,"" said Jimmy Vaiopoulos, Hut 8's interim CEO, in a statement.      Overall, investors purchased a total of 5.7 million ""units"" in Hut 8, at C$1.45 apiece. Each unit contains one common share in Alberta-based Hut 8, as well as the option to purchase another share in the next 18 months at $1.85.      The funding will be invested in new equipment. Ryleigh Ebron, an external spokesperson for Hut 8, said the company be able to increase mining capacity by more than a fifth to 1,150 petahash (PH/s). Once installed, the company could comprise just under 1% of the total hash rate for the bitcoin blockchain, currently around 115,200 PH/s according to Blockchain.com.      ""This financing is expected to strengthen Hut 8’s cash flows and balance sheet,"" Ebron added.      See also: Chinese Bitcoin Miner Producer Ebang Is Launching an Offshore Exchange      Hut 8's finances have been the subject of much discussion. It saw a $116.6 million loss just in Q4 2019. As a report from CoinDesk Research highlighted earlier this year, the company made a wafer-thin gain of just over $2 million in 2019.      The stock price says it all: In April 2018, Hut 8 traded at C$4.50 (~$3.28) but has since spiraled downwards, hitting a low of C$0.59 ($0.43) by mid-March this year. At the time of writing, shares were at C$0.98 (~$0.72).      Hut 8 has previously attributed this poor performance to a deleterious agreement that obliged them to only buy mining equipment from manufacturer Bitfury, its single biggest investor. That prevented it from accessing the faster miners coming from Bitfury's rivals, leaving it with rapidly aging equipment.      Over time, that meant it made up less of the total hashrate and won far fewer blocks, which hit revenue. In January, Hut 8 amended the agreement so it could buy mining equipment elsewhere.      Interestingly, Hut 8 said it will use all the new funding to buy mining equipment from Bitfury's rival, MicroBT. Most of the new rigs will arrive between July and November.      See also: Argo Buys $500K Worth of Zcash Miners as Bitcoin Revenue Shrivels      Hut8 anticipates the halving will make it harder for miners operating with older equipment to stay in the game, said Ebron      ""The halving is arguably better for miners who can get access to the latest generation of bitcoin mining equipment as they are far more profitable and will benefit from the drop in network difficulty as older equipment continues to be turned offline,"" Ebron said.      Ebron also pointed out the miner is in a particularly advantageous position because lower electricity rates in Alberta mean Hut 8 can better weather fluctuations in the volatile bitcoin price.      Hut 8 listed on the Toronto Securities Exchange in October 2019. The exchange has already approved the listing of newly sold shares, subject to the mining company meeting listing conditions, which include having more than C$7.5 million (~$5.5 million) in net tangible assets, such as new mining equipment.

The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will hold a hearing on ""The Digitization of Money and Payments."" While few details have been released, the witnesses – former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo, Paxos co-founder and CEO Charles Cascarilla and Duke University Visiting Professor of Law Nakita Cuttino – suggest the focus may center in part around central bank digital currencies and stablecoins.      The hearing may tread similar ground to a recent one hosted by a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee, which addressed questions of financial inclusion and how best to send relief funds to U.S. residents quickly and efficiently. Witnesses at the time called for tried-and-proven alternatives to building a novel tokenized system.      Cuttino, in prepared opening remarks, said while some U.S. residents might turn to digital banking and payment systems, ""low-income Americans disproportionately prefer to transact with bank tellers.""      Digital systems come with their own drawbacks: nearly one in five Americans don't have smartphones, limiting their access to digital banking services, while nearly 10 percent don't have alternative internet access in their homes. Cuttino also raised questions about the business models for central bank digital currencies and stablecoins.      ""If services are 'free,' what alternative trade-offs are consumers making (e.g., consumer data)? Is consumer data being used to exploit behavioral weaknesses to their detriment? Additionally, are consumer conditions improved by a shift to the novel solution? Ultimately, fintech solutions should not merely move the most Americans from the fringe financial marketplace to a fringe digital economy,"" Cuttino says.      Read more: How the COVID-19 Crisis Revived the Digital Dollar Debate      Cascarilla addresses concerns around the accessibility of financial services in his opening testimony, noting that banks today have limited hours and accessibility.      ""Consumers and institutions alike are held back by the inability to have timely access to their own funds because of settlement delays in bank transfers, international wires and other activities that can take over five days to settle,"" he says. ""This makes it difficult to manage other payments with any kind of predictability. On an economy-wide scale, this creates a complex daisy chain of loan obligations and unnecessary intermediaries.""      This architecture must be updated for the 21st century, he says, echoing a common refrain from former CFTC Chair Giancarlo, who has similarly advocated for future-proofing the dollar.      For his part, Giancarlo – appearing in his capacity as a director of the Digital Dollar Project – will explain and advocate for a tokenized version of the greenback.      ""The Digital Dollar Project believes the opportunity is at hand not just to imagine such an ecosystem, but to actually build it with such services for low-income and underbanked communities as priorities from the start,"" he says in his prepared testimony.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/30/witnesses-will-vouch-for-stablecoins-digital-dollars-in-us-senate-hearing-tuesday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dfc29363bec781a992a036c690a74b32f733227-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
