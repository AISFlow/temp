42384989,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmT2x,1603485916,IBM-R3 Pact Shows Tech Trumps Tribe in Enterprise Blockchain,"News this week that R3 and IBM are working together raised eyebrows, because each entity has been on different and competing sides since the early days of enterprise blockchain.      From next month, the commercial version of Corda (the version big banks and the like are paying R3 for) will be made available via IBM’s LinuxOne servers, delivering a hybrid of on-premise and cloud offerings. R3 announced the news at its annual developer conference, CordaCon.      Blockchain tribalism – R3’s Corda competes with Hyperledger Fabric, the enterprise blockchain heavily backed by IBM – has been put aside in favor of commercial sense, it seems. IBM’s LinuxOne business is far bigger than its nascent blockchain concern, while many large banks that have vendor relationships with IBM use Corda.      “This started an interesting conversation in IBM, where LinuxOne came to us and said they wanted to work with us,” Charley Cooper, managing director at R3, said in an interview. “If you’re a highly complex, heavily regulated industry, and you want the best technology but you want the name brands to take to your risk manager to say, ‘Trust us, we’re picking the best vendors,’ now they’ve got the best of both worlds.”    Scrappy contender    The enterprise blockchain space, which attempts to retrofit Bitcoin’s distributed ledger technology within the private settings of big companies, has evolved into three broadly separate camps: R3 Corda, Hyperledger and enterprise variants of Ethereum such as Quorum.      There has been some crossover between these tribes. IBM, for instance, has also experimented with other DLTs such as Hedera Hashgraph, and also with the Stellar blockchain, but the vast majority of Big Blue’s blockchain efforts are focused on Hyperledger Fabric, which is the basis of the IBM Blockchain Platform.      “While there’s some sort of tribalism within the blockchain community, it’s not so in the broader technology community,” said Cooper. “They’re not tribal, they want to see if they can deliver for clients. And if they can, the flavor of blockchain is not a concern for them.”      R3, while also being a member of Hyperledger, is known to be a scrappy contender when it comes to closing commercial transactions.    New era    Times have changed, said HACERA CEO Jonathan Levi, one of the original engineers working on Hyperledger. The market is moving very fast, and these business networks are becoming specialized, he said.      “R3’s decision to leave the table and to build their own ecosystem on one framework, helped them move a lot faster,” said Levi, referring to the early days with IBM, Intel, Cisco, R3, Digital Asset and others around the engineering whiteboard back in 2016.      “This is a great moment for our friends R3 and the Corda ecosystem, and for some of IBM’s customers who rely on mainframes,” he added. “I believe that we will see more multi-party systems that rely on open standards and provide more optionality and security by having multiple vendors involved.”      Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf said that IBM’s services unit offering support for R3’s product is not unlike its support for Oracle databases or Microsoft operating systems.      “This is yet one more example of what we’ve been saying since our inception, which is that the enterprise blockchain space is really big and will continue to be served by more than one protocol,” Behlendorf told CoinDesk via email.      There is support for Corda in four different Hyperledger projects, said Behlendorf, pointing specifically to Hyperledger’s interoperability layer, Cactus, which offers an integration toolkit between Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, Quorum and Hyperledger Besu-based networks.      “Congrats to R3 for their continued commercial success, it helps all of us in the enterprise blockchain space,” Behlendorf said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/23/ibm-r3-pact-shows-tech-trumps-tribe-in-enterprise-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c2027ab56258d1df7e9cd0e0d2e9611ccd70d74-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384991,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmT5T,1603485849,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Pulls Back From $13K While Ether Falls on DeFi Cooling,"Bitcoin has pulled back from 2020’s highs while ether slips as DeFi cools off.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $12,919.97 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.36% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $12,731.06-$13,192.25.    Bitcoin’s price had a minor pullback Friday after hitting fresh new 2020 highs that put it above $13,000 in the past week. However, analysts and traders said they were not surprised at all by the recent moves.      Read More: Active Bitcoin Addresses at Highest Since 2017’s $20K Price Record      An immediate sell-off by long-time bitcoin holders when prices hovered around $13,000 could be why bitcoin struggled to maintain its rally, according to on-chain data site Santiment.      Bitcoin’s dormant circulation, which tracks the activity of bitcoin that were previously unmoved for at least one year, has recorded the biggest spike since Feb. 7, 2020, Santiment’s data shows.      “A renewed activity of long-term BTC investors often means increased price volatility up ahead,” Dino Ibisbegovic, market analyst at Santiment, told CoinDesk. “Similar spikes – particularly during price rallies – have typically earmarked periods of price consolidation or short-term corrections in the past.”      Darius Sit, founder of Singapore-based QCP Capital, told CoinDesk the market may expect further pullback over the weekend, noting that the TD Sequential indicator has been able to signal a reversal for bitcoin prices.      On the other hand, growing open options interest may support a pricing floor for bitcoin above $12,500, said Guy Hirsch, managing director of U.S. for eToro, in an email to CoinDesk.      “That price point has long been seen as the glass ceiling that needed to break for BTC to make any significant moves upward,” Hirsch said. “Given the positive sentiment off the back of yesterday's PayPal news, I would not be surprised to see bitcoin challenged and move back past $13,000 in the near future.”      Additionally, significant institutional interest in cryptocurrency has continued to grow. That is evidenced by the fact that this week the tCME, an exchange predominantly led by institutional participation, has surpassed both Binance and BitMEX to be the second-largest bitcoin futures platform by number of open contracts.      Read More: CME’s Rise in Bitcoin Futures Rankings Signals Growing Institutional Interest      “The PayPal news is the bright and shiny object this week, but it is just the tip of the iceberg,” Matt Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, told CoinDesk. “Behind the scenes there has been a sea change in the attitudes of institutional investors, broker-dealers and financial advisers toward crypto in the past few months.”      “We’re in a legitimate bull market right now,” he added.    Ether slips as DeFi cools off    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Friday trading around $409.05 and slipping 1.78% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Priced in bitcoin, the token started to reverse some of the gains made mid-Thursday when ETH/BTC spiked 4% in two hours, down 2% from the daily high and trading at 0.0317 BTC per ether and continuing the downward trend since the week’s open for bitcoin-based trading pair.      Ether’s decline against bitcoin may signal a continued cooling of alternate cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Taking to Twitter, leading markets data provider Skew noted ether’s downward trend, asking rhetorically, “Altseason on pause?”      Decentralized finance (DeFi) led the summer’s surge in altcoin returns, and plummeting decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes corroborate a potentially significant waning of speculative interest in altcoins, especially DeFi-focused assets. The 30-day trailing volume for leading DEXs is down 41%, according to data from Dune Analytics.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all red Friday. The bigger losers as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    Zcash (ZEC) - 6.16%  Dash (DASH) - 5.46%  XRP (XRP) - 4.09%    Read More: Five On-Chain Indicators Investors Should Follow: Chainalysis      Equities:    The Nikkei 225 in Asia closed up 0.18% after the final U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden ended up much less chaotic compared with the first debate.

Documents obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information Act request show an unidentified individual emailed Ripple on Oct. 19, 2017, demanding 5 million XRP – then worth $1.1 million – in exchange for withholding videos it claimed portrayed the company in a negative light.      The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) San Francisco and Canberra, Australia, offices investigated the extortion attempt from Oct. 23, 2017, to April 20, 2018, according to the documents, which do not describe the content in the videos or whether Ripple paid the 5 million XRP.      The case was closed after there was trouble tracking the extortionist down with just an email address, Internet service provider information and an IP address, a computer or a smartphone’s online fingerprint, the documents say.      Asked about the videos and payment request by CoinDesk, Ripple did not respond by press time and the FBI declined to comment.

According to the rule change proposal, the Fed and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network propose modifying the thresholds at which banks must collect and store fund transfer information, reducing it from $3,000 to $250 for any transfers that go outside the U.S. The proposal would also widen the agencies' definition of ""money"" to explicitly include cryptocurrencies.      The Fed is seeking public comment, due within 30 days of the proposal being published in the Federal Register, the formal logbook for the U.S. government. Individuals can provide feedback online or via email.      According to the proposal, since the recordkeeping and travel rules were first introduced by the agencies, convertible virtual currencies (or CVC, an umbrella term that includes cryptocurrencies) have been introduced to the world. While they lack legal tender status, they can still be used to conduct value transfers.      ""Generally, CVCs can be exchanged instantaneously anywhere in the world through peer-to-peer payment systems (a distributed ledger) that allow any two parties to transact directly with each other without the need for an intermediary financial institution,"" the document said. ""However, in practice, many persons hold and transmit CVC using a third-party financial institution such as a 'hosted wallet' or an exchange.""      The document pointed to illicit transactions conducted using cryptocurrencies, such as North Korean hacking team Lazarus Group's efforts to steal crypto, as examples of poor behavior using these new tools.      Recently, a large number of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), which banks file to report potentially illegal or suspicious financial transactions, were leaked, revealing that while the federal agency might store this data for years or decades, it doesn't always take action against banks or entities that might be violating U.S. law.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/23/us-moves-to-cast-a-wider-net-for-catching-money-launderers-crypto-or-otherwise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/513c6c9f5eea7165254e3c4524ae833addeb9b1c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384980,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmSqN,1603474935,What It Means if Companies Like Twitter Are 'Systemically Important' to Financial Regulators,"When I first suggested Systemically Important Social Media Institutions (SISMIs) were the social media parallel to Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs), I did not expect the theory to be picked up by financial regulators.      As it turns out, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) essentially agrees with the argument, as seen by its investigation into the recent Twitter hacks. In the “Twitter Investigation Report,” the department recommended creating a “systemically important” designation for large social media companies, like the designation for critically important bank and non-bank financial institutions.    Jenny Leung is a blockchain and fintech attorney at Blakemore Fallon PLLC dba Ketsal.    If you’re wondering why the New York’s financial services regulator was directed to conduct an investigation into the hack of a California-based social media platform, recall that NYDFS licenses Coinbase, Gemini and Square – all companies affected by the Twitter hack that resulted in losses of approximately $22,000 worth of bitcoin by their customers.      Considering the complex web that binds social media companies with financial companies, the economy, markets and politics, it ultimately wasn’t all that surprising to see a state regulator thrown into the mix. Even Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo noted, “This type of hack by con artists for financial gain can also be a tool of foreign actors and others to spread disinformation and – as we've witnessed – disrupt our elections.”      See also: What Happens if Big Tech Only Gets Bigger?    As the Twitter report highlights, more Americans are getting their news from social media. I originally argued that if certain social media institutions were to fail today, their failure would pose a significant threat to society due to their outsized influence, size, reach, society’s co-dependence on them and “their power to shape the interpretation of public events.”https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/ In other words, any changes to the way SISMIs operate could lead to rippling effects across the globe. After all, they are centralized companies with highly distributed users and employees.    NYDFS points out that because no regulators have the authority to uniformly regulate internet-based social media platforms or to oversee their cybersecurity concerns, they recommended:    Creating a ""systemically important"" designation for these companies; i.e., labeling social media companies that cross a certain threshold so as to subject them to further regulatory oversight  Establishing an expert agency to oversee designated SISMIs  A new regulatory framework for SISMIs    Some complications arise from the imposition of a new regulatory framework. In the U.S. alone, any novel framework would need to factor in President Trump's executive order on online censorship, the upcoming Federal Communications Commission rulemaking regarding Section 230 of the Communications Act, considerations around ever-changing state privacy laws and a proposed federal data privacy bill, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations for public companies, antitrust and related laws and regulations enforced by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission – the list goes on.      Outside of the U.S., setting standards that work well across borders or even harmonizing the laws of various nations is not easy, nor can it be done in a reasonable amount of time. Just look at the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) – a series of global standards that apply to systemically important financial market infrastructures that took over a decade to implement.    The Twitter hack and NYDFS Twitter report highlighted an obvious need for a tailored approach to cybersecurity and social media.    Governments around the world have proven they can respond aggressively to social media: Thailand signed an order last week allowing authorities to ban media deemed threatening to national security in response to pro-democracy protests, and Iran implemented a five-day nation-wide shutdown of the internet last year. New global standards may be both necessary and appropriate for SISMIs, yet the changes were needed yesterday and will not magically coalesce tomorrow.      If a new regulatory framework for SISMIs is introduced, we may see an exodus of companies and businesses from certain regions as they engage in regulatory arbitrage. We saw this occur in 2015 when the introduction of the BitLicense resulted in numerous cryptocurrency platforms leaving New York. Similarly, many businesses chose to block European visitors from their websites, shut down completely or restructured operations in response to the introduction of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR) in 2018.      A novel framework risks fragmenting the social media ecosystem where: (1) users are granted different access, rights and protections depending on their location; and (2) users start turning to censorship-resistant alternatives.      We experienced the latter phenomenon this year in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space as significant volumes of liquidity started to move from centralized exchanges onto DeFi protocols and decentralized exchanges. For many, the attraction was the unstoppable, non-custodial and decentralized nature of the platforms, but for the regulators and enforcement agencies they present “new and unique challenges”.      See also: Richard Myers – To Beat Online Censorship, We Need Anonymous Payments      The Twitter hack and NYDFS Twitter report highlighted an obvious need for a tailored approach to cybersecurity and SISMIs, but also unearthed a larger issue – SISMIs are not only too big to fail, they may also be too big to effectively regulate on both a domestic level and international level.      Also hidden in the report is the idea that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may no longer exist solely within the realm of payments, finance, and trade. It may not be long before we realize that cryptocurrencies have also become embedded into society and economy.      The NYDFS proposals are an important starting point for regulators, policymakers and governments around the world to consider. It is also a warning for the rest of us who continue to use and rely on these centrally controlled, soon-to-be-designated platforms, that Big Brother may be coming to town. In the interim, we may have few options except to trust SISMIs to, among other things, act neutrally and protect our data and the security of their platform. As we take a collective leap of faith, I only hope the gap is shorter than it looks.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jenny Leung,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/23/what-it-means-if-companies-like-twitter-are-systemically-important-to-financial-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06f8b8e9a1098304b0150c56bdc10e2e0fc43973-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CME bitcoin futures exchange is heating up, signalling institutional interest. And Kik’s kin token will continue development following a $5 million SEC settlement.    Top shelf    Ripple, across the pond Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has given more insight on the company’s possible move away from the U.S., saying the legal status of the XRP cryptocurrency is key. Talking to CNBC Friday, Garlinghouse said his blockchain payments infrastructure company could potentially relocate to London, where the nation’s regulator ""clarified"" that XRP is not a security and is used like currency. Ripple is currently engaged in a U.S. legal dispute with investors who claim XRP is an illegally issued security. The Securities and Exchange Commission has not been clear on the issue. Switzerland, Singapore, Japan and the United Arab Emirates are also on the table for potential headquarters.      Tether crackdown Chinese authorities, including the nation’s central bank, have arrested 77 suspects and shuttered three gambling sites said to have “whitewashed” illicit funds using the tether (USDT) stablecoin. Announced over WeChat, the PBoC’s Huizhou office said the suspects had laundered 120 million yuan ($17.95 million) obtained through illegal online gambling activity, in part through USDT. In July, several crypto over-the-counter (OTC) traders were detained in order to assist with state investigation efforts involving illegal economic activity. It is ""illegal to open casinos and participate in gambling online,"" the PBoC said. ""Don't be curious and lucky. Any 'disguise' can't escape high-pressure supervision.""

As of Thursday, bitcoin futures contracts worth $790 million were open on the CME, according to data source Skew, topping 15% of the total global open interest. ""The CME's rise is predominantly led by institutional participation, as most entrants from that segment are prohibited from dealing in unregulated derivatives listed on retail platforms such as BitMEX and Binance,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack Funds. This happens as rival options exchange BitMEX targets DeFi-focused futures listings, including yearn.finance (YFI).

In the buzz around PayPal’s announcement to extend crypto trading and transaction services to a third of a billion users, the fintech giant’s negative role in bringing bitcoin to national attention may have been elided.      Last night, Bitcoin OG Jameson Lopp, tweeted, “9 years ago PayPal paved the way for proving Bitcoin's value to the world when they shut down WikiLeaks' account.”      In what was called “potentially the most significant attack on WikiLeaks” at the time, PayPal, then one of the principle means of moving money online, froze the German foundation’s account. This action was a wake up call for some about the dangers of web censorship.      Satoshi Nakamoto, when creating Bitcoin, had been thinking about financial freedom and the power that banks and payment processors have to revoke it, based on their own contingent, ever-changing and unequally-applied “terms of service.”      Of course, some of Nakamoto’s last words to early Bitcoin advocates were to resist using bitcoin to fund Wikileaks. He thought the network was too young and fragile to incur the government and public scrutiny that would result from supporting a bank-blocked organization.      It’s with some irony that PayPal has reentered the picture. As reported, the firm’s crypto services will be fully-custodial, fully-KYC’d and will fall under its terms of use.      So why enter? CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported yesterday that Morgan Stanley analysts believe the cryptocurrency community will likely benefit more than PayPal’s bottom line from the services.      The move ""should expand crypto acceptance online, which to date has stalled at 1% of the top 500 internet retailers,"" wrote the Morgan Stanley analysts. While the services will ""likely [be] immaterial to earnings.""

42384995,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmT9F,1603467071,Money Reimagined: 'They Starve': The Ugly Side of the US' KYC-AML Obsession,"At a 2015 blockchain event, Nairobi-based bitcoin pioneer Elizabeth Rossiello answered an audience question about the impact on Somalians of a recent shutdown in remittance inflows after the U.S. government had labeled the country a “high-risk jurisdiction.” The AZA Group CEO’s answer was blunt: “They starve.”      Ever since then I’ve come to see governments’ demands that banks use know-your-customer (KYC) identification models to meet anti-money laundering (AML) goals as mostly counterproductive.      Western governments thought they were starving East African terrorist groups like Al-Shabaab of funds, but the terrorists still mobilized money. Instead, the measures starved the local population of food, creating a ripe recruiting environment for the terrorists.      This story is relevant because Sunday marks the 50th anniversary of the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, the landmark U.S. law that required banks to identify their customers and monitor their transactions.      Over time, spurred by events such as the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the 2008 financial crisis, the BSA rules have become stricter and wider. They’ve also spawned other rules for non-bank payment providers, and given rise to powerful agencies such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). And they’ve provided the model for an international monitoring system that incorporates pretty much every financial institution in the world.      Sadly, there’s very little discussion of all this financial surveillance’s impact on people’s lives. Courtesy of Edward Snowden’s revelations about the National Security Agency monitoring our online activity, people know about the NSA. They know little of the BSA.    Exclusion    Perhaps people accept the trade-off between losing privacy and protecting society from evil-doers. Still, this system carries enormous costs.      It contributes to financial exclusion. According to a 2017 World Bank report, 1.7 billion adults are “unbanked” worldwide. For people in underdeveloped countries with untrusted state-run identity systems, the system makes them ineligible for bank accounts.      It also contributes, more broadly, to “derisking.” This trend emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, when new compliance rules imposed heavy new costs on banks, leading them to reduce exposure to countries where profitability was judged too small to be worth the risk. (Many saw the $1.9 billion fine imposed on HSBC in 2012 for facilitating Mexican drug cartels’ money laundering as a cautionary tale.)      As a result, local banks in many smaller economies – including relatively advanced ones in the Caribbean – now pay more for their critical correspondent banking relationships in the U.S., costs they pass onto their customers.      In these ways, AML-KYC models impose massive costs and foster inequity in the global economy.      In this pandemic-interrupted year, those costs will be felt even more, as remittances from rich countries to poorer ones are expected to drop by a record 19.7 percent to $445 billion, according to the World Bank. Those flows have long been seen as a major factor in poverty reduction, making AML-KYC compliance a direct barrier to prosperity.    Regulators counter that financial crime is a big, urgent problem – the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has estimated, for example, that between $800 billion and $2 trillion is laundered by criminals every yearhttps://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/globalization.html. But a trove of leaked FinCEN documents last month showed that large banks flagged trillions of dollars of suspicious transactions to authorities but continued to do business with those customers.    What’s more, the high cost of compliance means those bigger banks, along with well-established money transmitters such as Western Union, enjoy a barrier to entry against digital startups, for whom upfront compliance costs can be virtually insurmountable.      In sum, a AML-KYC dragnet with huge holes in it serves the interests of incumbents. It does little to stop sophisticated big criminals from moving money around but prevents honest little guys from participating in transactions, all while protecting outdated financial dinosaurs from competition.    Enter Bitcoin    Bitcoin was, in part, inspired by a desire to challenge this model. By resolving the trust problem and creating the digital equivalent of cash, it enabled peer-to-peer online payments between strangers. No longer did you need to identify yourself, no longer did you need an intermediary.      This terrified law enforcement, which relies on financial intermediaries to do its police work. So, amid ongoing accounts of criminals using bitcoin, regulators went after the centralized, custodial exchanges that people use to move crypto funds in and out of the fiat banking system, and developed rules that roped that industry into the surveillance system. The multilateral Financial Action Task Force’s new “travel rule” has now internationalized this approach.      Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have demonstrated they will apply the BSA to crypto software providers, most notably with the giant fine imposed this week on coin mixer Helix, whose privacy-protecting features were allegedly used by AlphaBay, the defunct “darknet” market.      That case underscores the far-reaching power this international system affords the U.S. government. The dollar’s reserve status means foreign banks need to maintain correspondent banking relationships with U.S. banks, which then become the gatekeepers of the world – and, effectively, agents of Washington’s interests.      Now, crypto-inspired technology is providing more tools for people, and even governments, to avoid the U.S. gatekeepers. This week, Russia’s central bank said it could use a digital ruble as a tool to avoid U.S. sanctions.    Sustainable system?    This system is broken. It has become a leviathan – too big, too comprehensive. Giant fines have skewed the risk-versus-payoffs for banks, which impose compliance on everyone regardless of size. (This is despite AML guidelines typically allowing ID exemptions for transfers of up to $1000, and in the U.S. up to $3,000.)      It’s time to scale down, not up.      “There is a principle in design that in order to optimize the system, to maintain the most positive outcome, we have to sub-optimize the sub-systems,” crypto compliance expert Juan Llanos said during this week’s episode of the Money Reimagined podcast. “That means we may have to learn to live with a little money laundering. We might have to live with the risk that someone in Somalia might be a criminal trying to get through the cracks.”      A more open mind from regulators toward cryptographic technologies that help regulators manage system-wide risks without imposing strict identity requirements on everyone would also be welcome. Research by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab into how to identify system risks within otherwise anonymous bitcoin transaction flows offers one potential way forward.      The test is whether policymakers can respond to the human cost of the existing approach.      “Is this the system that really promotes prosperity in our world?” C-Labs General Counsel Brynly Llyr asked during the same podcast episode. “I mean, yes, money laundering is very serious, tax evasion is very serious, but when we look at the remittance markets and the folks who are relying on … transfers of $50 and $100 ... is this really what we want our system to be cracking down on? Is this the best use of our resources?”    Battling global currencies    Bitcoin surged over $13,000 this week and, for once, the move was fueled not by the “risk-on” inflow that follows a rise in equity prices, but by some real news: PayPal’s announcement it would allow people to use cryptocurrencies inside its payment app. Still, the bigger meta-narrative around digital currencies remains tied to the fate of the world’s dominant fiat currencies. As Money Reimagined has explored previously, much will depend on the titanic monetary battle between China and the U.S.      So, I decided to check in on two charts of each country’s currency, using the best non-correlated measures available. That meant avoiding the circular relationship in which the Chinese yuan is quoted in U.S. dollar terms and vice versa and, instead, using a standardized measure of each currency’s performance against a trade-weighted basket of multiple currencies. What that gave me was a lesson in how powerful central banks are.      The first chart, courtesy of Shuai Hao, CoinDesk’s data visualizer, concerns the dollar:      The image above is of the Federal Reserve’s trade-weighted dollar index. It offers an unsurprising but telling story: After the initial COVID-19 panic of mid-March, when a global scramble for dollars sent the greenback soaring against all currencies, the Fed’s unprecedented monetary expansion efforts sent it back down again.      What’s remarkable is that, with the world still in a deeply troubled pandemic-choked state, the dollar has continued to fall. Does this reflect waning international confidence in the U.S. or merely a belief that the Fed will keep the money printer in overdrive but save the world in the process? Too soon to say.      Now, the yuan:      This one is based on the trade-weighted yuan index produced by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS), the trading and foreign exchange division of China's central bank. The index’s spike in March might seem odd to the uninformed observer because that’s when the world wanted dollars. Those panicked investors weren’t scrambling to stockpile the illiquid currency of the country then worst-affected by the pandemic; they only wanted greenbacks.      But the explanation is quite simple: the People’s Bank of China’s interventionist management of its currency has for decades been dictated by a tightly managed “dirty peg” to the dollar. So when the dollar spikes against everyone else, the yuan does as well.      Why, then, did the yuan index rise after the mid-summer, even as the dollar continued to fall? Because the PBOC deliberately intervened to boost the local currency versus the dollar. Sure enough, the USD-CNY exchange rate has dropped from CNY 7.17 in late-May to CNY 6.66 now.      Is this to discourage capital outflows? Maybe it’s to offset the need for softer domestic interest rates to boost local lending, which by extension equates with a Chinese bet on the domestic economy rather than on the nation’s exporters, which favor a weaker currency. Or is China trying to take advantage of waning trust in American global leadership to assert the strength and appeal of the yuan and boost its own international standing? Or, all of the above? What’s notable is that the yuan’s rising value coincides with the rollout of China’s digital yuan, which, although only in its experimental phase, is making waves worldwide. Stay tuned.    Global town hall    ASIA’S AMAZON. A prediction from a cryptocurrency entrepreneur stood out this week. Not another bitcoin $100,000 forecast but this two-part one, which CoinFlip Chief Operating Officer Ben Weiss shared with Business Insider: The next biggest company in the world will be blockchain-powered and it will be based in Asia. While there are strong arguments why both parts of that of that bet could prove wrong, the logic behind it is interesting to unpack.      Will the next Microsoft/Google/Amazon be built on blockchain technology? One of the problems with that is a proper public blockchain cannot be owned by a single company, and if one were to exist it would defeat the core purpose of multiparty governance. But, of course, applications that are built on top of a blockchain or which tap into users of one or more blockchains can be for-profit, which is essentially the model behind successful crypto companies such as Coinbase.      Notwithstanding those successes, and despite the billions that venture capitalists have invested in blockchain startups, it’s fair to say the high-profit “killer app” hasn’t yet been uncovered. And a good reason for that is the open-source, public foundations of blockchain technology make it hard for entrepreneurs to develop businesses with defensible market positions.      Yet, it took the internet’s original entrepreneurs some time to figure out how to make money on the web. If we believe that, in one form or another, blockchain technology will provide the scaffolding for the financial system of the future, then it’s reasonable to assume that someone will figure how to make a lot of money with it.      If so, where will this happen? Weiss argues the regulatory clarity in places like Singapore, as opposed to the ambiguity and sometimes hostility from regulators in the U.S., make for an environment that’s much more conducive to future blockchain businesses. Certainly, China is betting that by supporting a nationwide Blockchain Services Network, which includes links to public blockchains, it will create the landscape for the next big company – perhaps more of an Alibaba than an Amazon.      Here, too, there are parallels with internet history. One reason why the internet took off in Silicon Valley is the U.S. government took proactive steps to open up innovation in the internet industry. First there was the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which forced telecommunications providers to open their networks to competitors, which meant startups could now use that infrastructure to offer broadband services upon which e-commerce could thrive. A similar effect was felt by the U.S. government’s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. There seems to be little such vision employed in the U.S. right now to pave the way for the financial transformation that cryptocurrencies and blockchain portend.      It’s too early to say whether the big, new Department of Justice lawsuit against Google this week (see Relevant Reads) signals a pro-innovation U.S. strategy to force a more decentralized internet or more of an ad hoc action. Either way, on balance, Asian governments like Singapore’s or China’s are proving to be far more assertive in laying out a path for a more decentralized future. This is not to say there won’t be another Gates, Jobs, Bezos and Zuckerberg emerging out of the U.S. But it would also be naive to assume the next wave of business innovation will be in the U.S. and not in some other region.      ASIA’S EURO. Still with Asia, the uncertainty around the future of global finance and the rise of digital currency prototypes is reviving a two-decade idea: that the region should create a common currency akin to the euro. That’s the case made by Japanese economists Taiji Inui, Wataru Takahashi, Mamoru Ishida in the wonky economist blog Vox EU. The trio argue that although Asian countries have learned how to better weather currency volatility than they did in the late-1990s, they remain vulnerable to capital flow shocks because of the asymmetric power of the dollar in the global financial system. So, they’re calling for an “Asian digital common currency as a multilateral synthetic currency comparable to the euro.”      If that sounds familiar, it should because former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, in a provocative speech last year, called for a similar solution to the problem of dollar dominance, but for the entire world. I’m not sure why, following the well documented problems the eurozone faced earlier this decade with the incompatibility between monetary union and political disunity, another region would want to replicate it. Perhaps regional governments would be motivated by geopolitical interests to keep China in check much as France supported the euro as a way to forestall German aggression. Either way, if it were to arise it would put a new spin on the idea that the post-dollar age will be marked by one of competing digital currencies: The battle might not play out between nations but between regions.    Relevant reads    Three Trends Killing Web Privacy and Decentralization      In a CoinDesk OpEd, Brave’s CEO and founder Brendan Eich and its senior privacy researcher Peter Snyder lay out barriers hindering efforts to protect privacy and foster the kind of open, decentralized economy that the internet was intended to be. They focus on areas of centralization and privacy-threatening surveillance that may not be on everyone’s radars: content distribution models, centralized consent systems and business models focused on building profiles of users.      Nigeria Protests Show Bitcoin Adoption Is Not Coming: It’s Here      When people wonder why bitcoin might be useful or valuable to people, I often ask them to put themselves in the shoes of people living in developing countries with abusive regimes for whom the movement of money through a politically controlled banking system is a challenge. Right now one of the best examples of that is Nigeria, where protesters against police brutality are turning to bitcoin for that reason. In this piece, CoinDesk’s Sandali Handagama tells the human story of “why bitcoin?”      ‘Google Is One of the Most Important Antitrust Cases of All Time,’ With Matt Stoller      A bombshell antitrust lawsuit against Google marked a big shift in the U.S. approach to Big Tech. Years of dominance by the giant internet platforms are finally being questioned as monopoly phenomena. In this well-timed CoinDesk podcast episode of The Breakdown, Nathaniel Whittemore interviews “Goliath”author Matt Stoller to put this in historical perspective. What does this have to do with crypto? As Whittemore points out at the outset, this industry’s obsession with centralization is all about how we manage power, something that Google and other big, centralized platforms have amassed like perhaps no other companies in history.      First Users Not Impressed by China’s Digital Yuan: Report      The “airdrop” of China’s new digital yuan to 2 million people in Shenzhen was seen as a huge development in the country’s march toward implementing its Digital Currency Electronic Payments system. But according to a Reuters report, picked up by CoinDesk’s Daniel Palmer, those first users’ response was “meh.” Why were they underwhelmed? There was no great convenience advantage of DCEP over other electronic payment systems such as Alipay. It’s a telling response for China’s central planners as well for crypto developers. You may have political clout or your cryptocurrency might be aligned with privacy and other objectives. But convenience is likely to be the biggest reason why one payment system wins out over another.",NEGATIVE,ASIA,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Michael J.

42384982,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmSst,1603465200,A New Company Claims It’s Opening the Biggest Mining Farm in Russia,"MineSpot, a company previously unknown in the crypto mining industry, said it is opening a 160-megawatt mining venue in the middle of Siberia that would be the largest mining farm in Russia.      The venue is located near the Boguchany Dam in East Siberia, in the town of Kodinsk. It will occupy the building and land of a boiler house that used to serve the dam construction site by providing heat to workers building the dam. The construction of the dam, initiated during the late Soviet era, was completed in 2015; the Boguchany Dam is now one of the major hydropower plants in Russia.      Potential clients of the farm would include both bitcoin and ether miners, said Adam Aushev, co-founder of MineSpot, so the venue will host both SHA-256 application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).      Like many other farms in Russia, MineSpot is working as a “mining hotel,” meaning it hosts its clients’ mining machines and charges them for electricity and tech support. It can also purchase ASICs on behalf of its clients, ordering them directly from a manufacturer in China such as Bitmain, Innosilicin or others, and organizing delivery so clients don’t have to manage the logistics themselves.    The mining valley    With 160-megawatt power capacity, MineSpot is going to become a new competitor to the mining farms already working in the neighboring Siberian cities of Irkutsk and Bratsk, which also rely on hydropower, but from another dam. MineSpot, however, will be the largest one, exceeding the size of the current leader, BitRiver, which has already put ASICs in more than half of its 130-megawatt farm in Bratsk.      Local logistics might make it more challenging for MineSpot than for its older peers. Aushev admits that it’s not easy to transport ASICs to the site. The road leading from Krasnoyarsk, the nearest large city and transportation hub, to Kodinsk is partly paved with stones, which makes miners worry about their mining machines getting there in one piece.      “A couple of contracts have already fallen through because of the logistics issues,” Aushev said.      He is nonetheless optimistic about the firm’s future. Aushev said he plans to get 10 megawatts of MineSpot’s power capacity booked by the end of the year.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/23/a-new-company-claims-its-opening-the-biggest-mining-farm-in-russia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5c20a511fcd2d9f5381b950550d31bb2c027ae8-1227x920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Beyond the monetary fine, Kik’s assets are still Kik’s property, including its remaining treasury, its Kin reserves and all of its intellectual capital, according to the post.  Kik is further able to carry on with ""active development"" of the open-source Kin SDK and the new Code wallet.  The foundation also said that as the SEC isn't considering Kin a security and the judge didn't find the token in violation of securities laws, Kin ""should be free to trade on exchanges.""  Going forward, with its reserves still ""deep,"" the foundation said it plans to continue to grow the Kin ecosystem, bringing on board a new executive director next month.  Additionally, a planned token migration to the Solana blockchain will go ahead and is ""on schedule,"" it said.  Aside from stumping up the $5 million penalty, Canada-based Kik must give the SEC 45 days' notice before any transactions of the token for the next three years.

42384975,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmPGx,1603457171,"First Mover: As Bitcoin Tops $13K, Analyst Explains How Blockchain Gives Clues on Next Move","Bitcoin was higher, just above $13,000 and rising for a seventh straight day – the longest winning streak in six months.      “A continuation would probably require more positive news,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the publicly traded cryptocurrency firm Diginex, wrote Thursday in a note to clients.      In traditional markets, European indexes rose on positive corporate earnings and strong German manufacturing data, and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. Gold strengthened to $1,911 an ounce.    Market moves    A hallmark of the blockchain analysis is that there's all sorts of data on the distributed computing networks available publicly to anyone with a browser.      So for crypto traders, why not use the data to get an edge?      CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole talked to Philip Gradwell, chief economist at blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, about the data points he thinks are most important for crypto traders.      Below is a condensed list, though Godbole's full article includes a link to a video of the original interview.      1) Exchange inflows. A surge in a rising market might indicate looming selling pressure, a sign of feeble investor confidence.      2) Trade intensity. The metric, which measures the number of times an inflowing coin is traded, ""tells us how many people are willing to buy bitcoins sent to exchanges,"" according to Gradwell. So an uptick is a sign of trend strength.      3) Interexchange flows. Net flow from crypto-to-fiat exchanges to crypto-to-crypto exchanges suggests the market is dominated by stablecoin traders. In this scenario, a rise in the stablecoin's issuance could be considered a leading indicator of an impending price rally.      4) Liquidity. A sustained rise in the number of illiquid entities – defined as those that send less than 25% of the assets it receives – is a sign of a strong long-term holding sentiment, and thus a bullish indicator.      5) Value transfers across blockchains. The metric represents usage of the blockchain and is typically accompanied by a rise in the transaction count. ""When there's greater usage of a cryptocurrency there's more demand, and that drives the price up,"" Gradwell said.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Five On-Chain Indicators Investors Should Follow    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin is eyeing its biggest weekly gain in six months.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $13,000, representing a 13% appreciation on a week-to-date basis, the most since April.      The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s share of bitcoin’s futures market has increased alongside the price rally.      As of Thursday, bitcoin futures contracts worth $790 million were open on the CME, according to data source Skew. That's 15.8% of the global open interest tally of $5 billion – the second highest contribution among major exchanges.      The exchange's contribution to global open positions has jumped from 10% to 15.8% this month alone, indicating increased institutional participation.      From a technical analysis perspective, the focus is on the weekly close (Sunday, 23:59 UTC). If the cryptocurrency finishes above $12,476 (August high), a bullish breakout would be confirmed on the weekly chart.      That looks likely, as demand for the cryptocurrency is strong. A breakout would strengthen the case for a rally to $14,000 before the year-end.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: CME’s Rise in Bitcoin Futures Rankings Signals Growing Institutional Interest    Token watch    Bitcoin (BTC): Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones II tells CNBC that bitcoin rally is only in ""first inning.""

Talking to CNBC Friday, Garlinghouse said his blockchain payments infrastructure company could potentially move to London, where XRP is not considered a security by the regulating Financial Conduct Authority.  The firm may also consider other nations that take a similar stance.  Ripple is closely tied to XRP, using the token to move value within some of its institution-focused payments products, as well as helping its development.  In the U.S., though, Ripple is fighting a legal battle with investors who claim XRP is an illegally issued security, while the Securities and Exchange Commission has not been clear on the issue and has been taking actions against some token-based projects.  “What you see in the U.K. is a clear taxonomy, and the U.K.’s FCA took a leadership role in characterizing how we should think about these different assets and their use cases,"" Garlinghouse told CNBC.  With the FCA ""clarifying"" that XRP is not a security and is used like currency, it would be ""advantageous for Ripple to operate in the U.K.,” he said.  Ripple is also considering Switzerland, Singapore, Japan and the United Arab Emirates as potential bases, he added.

The CME was ranking fifth on the list of biggest futures exchanges by open interest on Oct. 1.  The exchange's contribution to global open positions has jumped from 10% to 15.8% this month alone.  At the start of the year, the exchange accounted for a meagre 4% of the global open interest.  ""The CME's rise is predominantly led by institutional participation, as most entrants from that segment are prohibited from dealing in unregulated derivatives listed on retail platforms such as BitMEX and Binance,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk.  The CME's regulated product also offers high standards of compliance that institutions must adhere to.  While the CME ranked second on Thursday, Malta-based OKEx retained the first place, accounting for nearly 20% of total open interest.  In the third position was Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency spot exchange by trading volumes, which accounted for 14.3% of the total open interest. The controversial perpetuals giant BitMEX ranked fourth.  Notably, BitMEX's share of global open interest has declined from 18% to 12% this month in the wake of charges that recently hit the firm in the U.S.  On Oct. 1, U.S. authorities charged BitMEX with illegally operating an unregistered derivatives-trading platform that accepted U.S. customers, triggering a major outflow of funds from the exchange.  View  The CME's share of global futures open interest has risen alongside bitcoin's three-week rally from $10,500 to $13,300.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $13,000, representing a 20% gain on a month-to-date basis.  Bitcoin's 14-day relative strength index is now reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print.  However, in a strong trending market, the indicator tends to stay overbought for a prolonged period and traps sellers on the wrong side of the market.

42384976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmPID,1603447200,Five On-Chain Indicators Investors Should Follow: Chainalysis,"Analyzing cryptocurrency markets may seem easier than traditional markets because blockchain technology has more built-in transparency, enabling anyone to analyze and audit on-chain data.      Simultaneously, however, there are challenges to zeroing in on forward-looking numbers that give insights into current and future price trends. Philip Gradwell, chief economist at the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, joined CoinDesk earlier this week to discuss the five must-track on-chain indicators for all traders.    Exchange inflows    ""The first indicator that I look at every day is exchange inflows,"" Gradwell said.      Investors typically transfer coins from their wallets to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings and take direct custody of their holdings when they have a bullish view on the cryptocurrency.      A surge in inflows in a rising market could be considered a sign investors lack confidence in the uptrend. ""When you see large inflows, it's time to be cautious,"" Gradwell added.      Also read: Bitcoin Risks Deeper Price Pullback as Exchange Inflows Spike      Nonetheless, inflows do not imply immediate liquidation. Investors can hold their coins on exchanges for as much time as they want.      ""Historically coins have been liquidated with a lag of 12 to 36 hours,"" Gradwell said, adding that during the March crash there was panic selling.      Thus, this indicator is just one piece of the puzzle because we don’t know when the transferred coins will be sold. What’s more an uptick in inflows or selling pressure is often matched by an equal or more substantial buying pressure.    Trade intensity    To determine the impact of exchange inflows on the supply side, investors should keep an eye on the demand side with the help of the ""trade intensity"" metric, which measures the number of times an inflowing coin is traded.      ""It tells us how many people are willing to buy bitcoins sent to exchanges,"" Gradwell said. An uptick in trade intensity shows that buyers are outweighing sellers and it is a sign of trend strength.      Bitcoin jumped over 7% to 15-month highs above $12,300 on Wednesday. Amid the price rally, cryptocurrency exchanges tracked by blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis received a total of 106,519 BTC on Wednesday, the highest daily inflow since Oct. 2.      However, the rise in inflows failed to apply the brakes to the price rally because demand was strong. Bitcoin's trade intensity jumped to a two-month high of 5.8, more than double the 90-day average.      Also read: Back at $13K: Bitcoin Unfazed by Profit Takers After Rise to 2020 High      While exchange inflows and trade intensity help gauge short-term market conditions, the remaining three indicators are more about long-term trends.    Interexchange flows    Investors can buy cryptocurrencies with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or use dollar-backed stablecoins like tether to fund purchases.      Crypto-to-fiat exchanges facilitate the exchange of dollars for cryptocurrencies, while at crypto-to-crypto exchanges stablecoins are used as a gateway to crypto trading.      Investors can determine whether the market is driven by fiat buyers (such as institutions) or tether traders by keeping track of net flows between these two types of exchanges.      Net flow from crypto-to-fiat exchanges to crypto-to-crypto exchanges suggests the market is dominated by stablecoin traders. In this scenario, a rise in the stablecoin's issuance could be considered a leading indicator of an impending price rally.      However, that, too, isn’t set in stone. Since March, crypto-to-fiat exchanges have received 206,000 BTC from crypto-to-crypto exchanges, according to Chainalysis. ""It indicates that fiat buyers have mainly driven the market,"" Gradwell noted, adding that the data confirms the bullish narrative of rising institutional participation in the top cryptocurrency.    Liquidity    Investors can gauge the hodling sentiment in the market by keeping track of the number of liquid and illiquid entities – clusters of addresses controlled by the same participants in a network. Chainalysis identifies entities by analyzing blockchain transaction patterns to identify which addresses are controlled by a single person or business. This gives a more accurate picture of what is going on as the data better reflects actual holdings and transfers between people and business, reducing the noise of internal movements of cryptocurrency.      Liquidity is the average ratio of net to gross flows of an entity’s assets over the entity's lifetime, across all addresses controlled by the entity. Chainalysis defines a liquid entity as the one that sends on average at least 25% of the assets it receives, while an illiquid entity is the one that sends on less than 25% of its received assets.      Essentially, an illiquid entity is the one that appears to believe in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects and hoards coins. That has a weakening effect on selling pressure in the market. For that reason, a sustained rise in the number of illiquid entities is a sign of strong hodling sentiment and a bullish indicator.      The above chart shows the liquidity of bitcoin has declined to the lowest level since mid-2017. Bitcoin's meteoric rise from $5,000 to $20,000 that happened in the final quarter of that year.      Also, the amount of illiquid bitcoin has risen sharply. ""It's been increasing at a greater rate this year than it did before. So you've got more investors than ever before. But there's also fewer bitcoin that are liquid and available to buy than ever before,"" Gradwell said.      That possibly the reason why bitcoin recently held steady above $10,000 despite the BitMEX indictments, KuCoin hack, OKEx private key drama, U.S. President Donald Trump's health scare and a global stock market sell-off.    Value transfers across blockchains    Value transfer refers to the U.S. dollar value of total units on a blockchain that are transferred on a given day. It essentially represents the usage of the blockchain and is accompanied by a rise in the transaction count.      ""When there's greater usage of a cryptocurrency there's more demand, and that drives the price up,"" Gradwell said.      Ether's value transfer began rising sharply in mid-July. A week later, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid around $250 and ended up rallying to $470 by mid-August. Ether led the broader market higher in July and August and outshined bitcoin by rallying 53% and 26%, respectively.      Up until last year, bitcoin pretty much led the broader market in both bull and bear runs. Most investors would buy ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies during bitcoin's bull run and sell those other cryptocurrencies when bitcoin was on the downturn.      However, the dynamics have changed this year with the explosive growth of the Ethereum-based decentralized finance protocols, making it imperative for investors to track on-chain activity of ether and other coins.      As crypto markets continue to grow and mature, demand for deeper on-chain analytics is likely to increase. “With on-chain data, there is an amount of work that needs to be done first, to go from raw blockchain concepts like an address to a more meaningful economic concept like the flow into an exchange. But once it's done, the user has a meaningful data set to act on and make decisions,” Gradwell said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/23/five-on-chain-indicators-investors-should-follow-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/074120ae592559390ddcb0ab8071048153de3aef-1197x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a company blog post Friday, the Seychelles-based exchange said it was adding DeFi token yearn.finance (YFI) to its quanto futures contracts.  Polkadot (DOT) and Binance coin (BNB) contracts are also on the way.  All three contracts will be paired against the dollar-linked tether (USDT) stablecoin.  Currently live on BitMEX's testnet, the products are slated to start trading on Oct. 30 at 04:00 UTC.  Yearn.finance is currently the ninth largest DeFi protocol, with $458 million locked up in liquidity, according to DeFi Pulse.  It sets out to be the gateway to a range of yield-generating products.
