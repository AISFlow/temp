In a statement, Bitfinex said it hired Steptoe to respond to such claims with ""appropriate action,"" including ""possible litigation"" against ""various parties."" Jason Weinstein, who leads the blockchain practice at Steptoe, confirmed its hiring by Bitfinex in an email.  Stuart Hoegner, the in-house counsel for Bitfinex, said in the statement:  ""To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a result, Bitfinex has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and his associates.""  The move aligns the world's largest bitcoin exchange – a company mired in controversy and shrouded in secrecy – with one of the most prominent law firms in the digital currency space.  Based in Washington, D.C., Steptoe is the counsel for the Blockchain Alliance, a public-private forum created two years ago to exchange information between the industry and law enforcement in the service of fighting crime.  Reached by email Monday, the blogger, who uses the handle Bitfinex'ed, said the exchange has ""knowingly filed frivolous lawsuits in the past which they had no intent on completing,"" and cited as an example Bitfinex's lawsuit against Wells Fargo, which was withdrawn in April.  Litany of claims  Stepping back, Bitfinex, incorporated in the British Virgin Isles, has close ties to Tether, the Hong Kong-based issuer of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. While Tether says it fully backs its eponymous tokens, Bitfinex'ed has accused the company of issuing more tethers than it can redeem and using them to fund margin trading on Bitfinex, thereby artificially pumping up the price of bitcoin.  He or she has also claimed that Bitfinex allowed and benefited from wash trading (an illegal activity in which an investor simultaneously buys and sells an asset to create a misleading impression of market demand) on the exchange, and that it misled customers and investors on other matters.  Bitfinex'ed has made these and other claims in a series of often lengthy and highly detailed posts on Medium, Twitter and YouTube, which have been widely shared on cryptocurrency social-media circles.  In its statement, Bitfinex did not specify who exactly it might sue, on what grounds, or in which jurisdiction.  ""I think you can infer who,"" said Ronn Torossian, the public relations specialist recently hired to represent Bitfinex and Tether.  Further, the Bitfinex statement goes on to suggest that those making the assertions might be engaging in ""market manipulation"" – broadly, the same thing Bitfinex'ed accused the company of.  ""In recent months, certain parties and their associates have made false and unsubstantiated claims against Bitfinex, engaging in potential market manipulation activity that is dishonest and unlawful,"" Bitfinex said.  Correction: This report has been updated to reflect that Bitfinex withdrew its lawsuit against Wells Fargo in April, not August.

42428159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6WZh,1512423933,Alleged ICO Fraudster Pleads Not Guilty in New York Court,"A New York businessman charged with defrauding investors in two initial coin offerings (ICOs) plead not guilty in court last week.  As previously reported, Maksim Zaslavskiy was charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud just over a month ago. Filings dated Dec. 1 indicate that Zaslavskiy pled not guilty to the charges. And according to a report from Crain's, Zaslavskiy secured a $250,000 bail requirement with a Brooklyn-based property as collateral.  The case against Zaslavskiy is connected to two ICOs – one claimed to have been tied to real estate and the other connected to precious stones – that prosecutors have alleged were fictitious in nature.  ""As alleged, Zaslavskiy and his associates enticed investors by promising returns using novel ICOs even though Zaslavskiy knew that no real estate or diamonds were actually backing the investments,"" acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde said last month.  News that the U.S. government was looking to charge the ICO organizer first broke in September when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges in a separate suit that cited registration and anti-fraud law violations in particular. At the time, the agency secured an asset freeze for two companies tied to the ICOs as well as Zaslavskiy himself.  Additional court filings from Dec. 1 indicate that the U.S. government and Zaslavskiy are discussing a possible plea deal.

Last year, officials from Moscow's government told local media that they were looking into the technology in a bid to reduce the risk of fraud when people are voting on city management issues. The possible use would come as part of its ""Active Citizen"" e-government project, constituting one of several areas in which blockchain is being explored (including as a basis for a new land registry system).  Now, according to a Dec. 4 statement, officials have developed a pilot system for tracking votes via blockchain, declaring that the tech would make its ongoing Active Citizen program ""more open"" according to a translated statement.  The government explained:  ""The introduction of this technology will make the voting in the [Active Citizen initiative] even more open: it will be difficult to say that the administration incorrectly interprets the answers, changes the results of the voting when the citizens themselves can verify this information.""  In addition to the public announcement, the government made the code behind the pilot solution open-source on GitHub.  The statement itself doesn't offer any clear indication that the use of blockchain-based voting will extend beyond the pilot phase. Yet the area is one that has attracted interest from Russia's private sector as well, including its central securities depository which began testing blockchain proxy voting – allowing shareholders to issue votes on corporate decisions – last year.

42428169,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6Wrh,1512414032,Loveable Digital Kittens Are Clogging Ethereum's Blockchain,"Can a crypto app be too easy and fun?  That might be the case on ethereum, where one project is proving so popular it's putting pressure on the network's technology. Best thought of as a decentralized Tamagotchi, CryptoKitties appears to be striking a nerve with new users, making ethereum fun and accessible to those who aren't in the tech nerd domain.  Already, the app, which uses ethereum's blockchain to create a public, shared history of cryptographically unique (not to mention cute and cuddly) fluffballs, is ethereum's most popularhttps://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php, with users having spent at least $3 million total on breeding, buying and selling the in-game items, up from $1 million just yesterday. And currently, the average cat is trading for $100 in ether.  But the application is clogging the ethereum network, putting transactions in a long-time limbo.  ""Due to network congestion, we are increasing the birthing fee from 0.001 ETH to 0.002 ETH. This will ensure your kittens are born on time!"" the CryptoKitties team stated in a tweet surrounded by siren emojis to express the direness of the situation.  In its short lifespan, CryptoKitties has grown to make up 20 percent of all ethereum computations, a number that seems to still be growing.  While it's certainly not the sole culprit behind ethereum's lagging transactions, as ethereum developer Nick Johnson pointed out, it is one, and at the very least, it's where people are placing the blame for exposing ethereum's limits.  Johnson continued, telling CoinDesk:  ""CryptoKitties is definitely a significant contributor to network congestion, and it may have been what pushed us over the edge from mostly-full blocks to full blocks in the last day or so.""  Messy underbelly  The issue is a bit ironic, seeing how ethereum is touted as a world ""world computer"" that hosts unstoppable decentralized applications, replacing the internet.  With aspirations like that, it might seem strange that one app for trading otherworldly kittens could clog the network, but because of the way blockchains work – with every transaction needing all network nodes to process it – there are limits on the number of computations that can be done all at one time.  Not only does that mean that an insane amount of kitty trading can slow down the network, but it can also add to the expense of using ethereum as well.  And whether people are right to point fingers at the CryptoKitties app or not, it is laughable that kittens are bringing new awareness to the messy underbelly of public blockchains, including ethereum, bitcoin and many others – scalability.  As a tweet from coder Boris Kozak displays, the issue is well-established and there are many proposed fixes, including state channels, Raiden, sharding and Casper – ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's and other developer's interest in moving ethereum to proof-of-stake – but all these solutions require major engineering work and are still unfinished.  ""It may also hasten the ethereum scaling crisis,"" tweeted BlockTower chief information officer Ari Paul.  Others made parallels to bitcoin's fierce scaling debates – which this year saw several groups split from the main bitcoin blockchain to create new versions of the protocol, in bitcoin cash's case raising the block size limit to allow for more transactions.  Johnson Lau, Bitcoin Core contributor, quipped on Twitter:  ""We need Ethereum Cash or many kittens would be killed.""  Blessing in disguise?  In short, ethereum has its work cut out for it.  And as usual, whether or not you think CryptoKitties is a positive movement for the ethereum community is colored by whether you support the protocol in the first place.  Ethereum supporters have a reason to be excited that an app is finally showing what the platform is capable of, as outlined in a reddit thread, which lauds the game as a successful proof-of-concept.  ""I'm glad smart contracts are productizing a variety of use cases beyond speculation,"" said The Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3) researcher Phil Daian, pointing to the bout of speculation generated by the thousands of initial coin offerings (ICOs) that have launched on the blockchain.  And Buterin even chimed in, tweeting: ""I actually like the digital cat games. They illustrate very well that the value of a blockchain extends far beyond applications that would literally get shut down by banks or governments if they did not use one.""  And, as far as scaling ethereum goes, many are glad it's bringing awareness to the issue – one ethereum user even called it a ""blessing in disguise.""  Martin Köppelmann, founder of ethereum app Gnosis, echoed that sentiment, telling CoinDesk:  ""If it is that successful – and even if it increases fees, even better – it will reveal weaknesses of the current tech but ultimately make it better. I'm all for experiments.""

42428166,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6Wjh,1512409863,Blockchains Are Forever? Diamond Giant De Beers Unveils DLT Strategy,"One of the world's most well-known diamond companies is getting into blockchain by investing in an asset tracking platform.  De Beers, its chief executive announced today, is planning to use the tech in a bid to boost transparency across the diamond supply chain.  The firm, the world's largest miner of diamonds, says it wants to use the tracking platform in order to rebuild trust in the diamond distribution process – as well as alleviate concerns over money laundering and the broader trafficking of conflict diamonds.  CEO Bruce Cleaver unveiled the initiative in a blog post published earlier today, writing:  ""This diamond traceability platform is underpinned by blockchain technology, which allows for a highly secure digital register that creates a tamper-proof and permanent record of interactions – in this instance, a diamond’s path through the value chain.""  Cleaver outlined a number of characteristics that the platform will possess, including privacy controls for participants and wide access to potential users.  As it stands, the system doesn't have a firm launch date, though Cleaver indicated that the development process would play out over the coming months and involve input from stakeholders.  ""In the months ahead, we will continue to work with leaders from across the industry and share our progress with you,"" Cleaver wrote. ""In the process we will no doubt make some mistakes, but we will continue to collaborate, learn and persevere.""  That De Beers is moving in this direction is perhaps unsurprising, given work in this area by industry startups as well as international bodies like the United Nations. In September 2016, the group behind the Kimberly Process, an initiative which seeks to keep conflict diamonds out of global markets, said that it was looking to apply blockchain as part of a way to track diamond trade statistics.

However, price analysis suggests that both bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin gold (BTG) might soon break out of the doldrums. As of writing, bitcoin cash is trading at $1,522.60, a range in which its traded for most of the past week. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has depreciated by 5.9 percent in the last 24 hours.  That said, BCH peeped above $1,600 levels yesterday, possibly due to comments from CBOE president Chris Concannon that bitcoin cash could get its own derivatives market soon.  However, a general pullback across the cryptocurrency market seems to have pushed BCH back below $1,500 levels.  Bitcoin cash  The above chart shows:  Rising channel (marked by blue lines)  Over the last few days, the bears have consistently failed to keep BCH below the rising trendline (red).  The pullback from the recent highs above $1,750 lacks substance (i.e. volumes are well below the 30-day average).  View  A close above $1,545 (161 percent Fib extension) would validate the bullish picture put forward by the rising trend line and could yield a rally to $2,000 (rising channel hurdle).  On the downside, a close below the rising channel support of $1,200 would open the doors for a sell-off to $8,50 levels.  Bitcoin gold  Like bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold is witnessing a struggle between the bulls and the bears. The cryptocurrency was last seen trading at $320 levels – down 5.3 percent in the last 24 hours, also going by CoinMarketCap data.  BTG fell below $300 last week as expected, but since then has been restricted to a narrow range of $280–$310.  The above chart shows:  Weak follow-through to last bullish doji reversal.  BTG is stuck largely in the range of $280 to $310.  Last Thursday's doji candle and Friday's positive candle indicate a bullish doji reversal. However, the bulls are struggling to keep the cryptocurrency above $310.  View  The odds of a downside break of the range are high. A close below $280 could revive the sell-off from the recent highs above $400, possibly taking prices to below $160 (Nov. low).  On the other hand, a close above $430 would validate the bullish doji reversal and push prices back above $400 levels.

Quebec-based Dominic Lacroix and Sabrina Paradis-Royer, along with a firm called PlexCorp, have been charged with violating U.S. securities laws and defrauding investors, according to a new filing dated Dec. 1. The agency also obtained an emergency asset order, citing the movements of the ICO funds – estimated to constitute $15 million ""from thousands of investors"" – into different accounts.  The charges were filed by the SEC's Cyber Unit, an enforcement arm created in September in part to more closely police ICOs, among other areas. In statements, the SEC said that last week's complaint was the first to be filed by the unit.  ""This first Cyber Unit case hits all of the characteristics of a full-fledged cyber scam and is exactly the kind of misconduct the unit will be pursuing. We acted quickly to protect retail investors from this initial coin offering's false promises,"" Robert Cohen, who heads up the unit, said of the charges.  The agency alleged that Lacroix and Paradis-Royer made false statements to prospective investors, as well as purposefully hiding the involvement of Lacroix, who the SEC branded a ""recidivist securities law violator in Canada.""  Last week's charges also represent the latest regulatory action against PlexCoin.  In September, Lacroix was held in contempt of court by the Quebec Supreme Court in relation to PlexcCoin, as previously reported. At the time, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), Quebec's finance regulator, said that Lacroix was ignoring previous court orders and soliciting investors for the PlexCoin ICO.  And in mid-November, the AMF reportedly asked the court to hand Lacroix a six-month prison sentence, as well as thousands of dollars in fines.  PlexCoin, according to its official website, was pitched as ""the next decentralized worldwide cryptocurrency.""

Launched in November, the sale saw investors – including Union Square Ventures (USV), Foundation Capital, Lux Capital, Winklevoss Capital, Blockchain Capital, Digital Currency Group, Y Combinator partner Qasar Younis, Techcrunch founder Michael Arrington and Digg founder Kevin Rose – fund Blockstack's particular vision for a decentralized web built on blockchain technology.  Still, in statements, the Blockstack team was keen to stress that those involved are best thought of as long-term partners, all of whom agreed to take long positions in its new cryptocurrency.  For example, Blockstack said the largest investment came from an undisclosed endowment, which secured a $6 million allocation after agreeing to a four-year lock-up for half of its allocation (other investors had a two-year lockup, with a $3 million maximum).  Co-founder Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk:  ""I think it's more like a funding round, with high-quality sophisticated investors, rather than random people just throwing money at something,""  Elsewhere, Blockstack provided a host of metrics on the offering. More than 800 people and entities were said to have participated in the public token sale (a pre-sale was not offered), where the minimum investment was $3,000. The median investment was $6,140.  Further, Blockstack was keen to note its own guarantees.  Of the funds acquired, only $10 million will be immediately available to the company, as the firm has agreed to a lock-up until milestones are hit. The next $20 million will be released when its board of advisors verifies it has delivered the next version of its product, a network that integrates the token.  The final $20 million will be secured when it achieves its final milestone, one million verified users.  Founded in 2013, Blockstack has been building a decentralized architecture for publishing on the internet, one designed around user control. To realize that goal, the ""stacks"" token will run on Blockstack's virtualchain technology, according to the white paper.  Co-founder Ryan Shea told CoinDesk:  ""We have always emphasized that the token sale is a very important thing for the ecosystem, for us to be able to contribute resources, but at the end of the day the more important aspect of what we're doing is introducing the token itself and what it does for the ecosystem.""

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value clocked a high of $11,831 at 20:30 UTC Sunday, but closed below the previous record high of $11,377, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. At press time, BTC was trading at $11,238 – up 0.5 percent for the session.  As per CoinMarketCap, week-on-week, bitcoin (BTC) is up 18 percent, while on a monthly basis, it has gained more than 50 percent.  But while the bull market is still intact, bitcoin's failure to close above the previous record high indicates bull market exhaustion. Further, a look at the price chart indicates the cryptocurrency could be in for a short-term pullback.  The above chart shows:  Bitcoin did clock a fresh record high yesterday, but could not close above the previous record highs near $11,500. Similar price action is seen today, as the cryptocurrency clocked a high in the $11,600 region, before falling back below the previous record high.  Yesterday's candle has a big upper shadow (gap between intraday high and daily close), which indicates bullish exhaustion.  A break above the last Wednesday's big doji candle high (previous record high) lacked volume support (i.e. trading volumes remained well below the level seen on last Wednesday).  The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions.  View  Bitcoin could re-test the psychological support level of $10,000. The ascending trendline (drawn from Nov. 12 low and Nov. 24 low) could offer support (today) around $9,900 levels.  However, the 5- and 10-day moving averages are sloping upwards, indicating a drop below $10,000 could be short-lived.  Only an end-of-day close below the rising trendline could be considered a sign of short-term trend reversal.  In the larger scheme of things, the chart remains in favor of the bulls. As history shows, majors tops have been formed on the back of bearish price RSI divergence.

Revealed in an email to CoinDesk, the number of people added and who they are is being kept private for now, but the expansion shows a level of intent that hasn't been seen at many other central banks.  ""Today, we've reinforced our team with world-class professionals and are optimistic that the project will get a boost in upcoming months,"" wrote Yakiv Smolii, acting governor of the central bank.  While the details of the team were not made public, CoinDesk last week reported that Ukraine-based Distributed Lab is helping with the build.  Distributed Lab's founder, Pavel Kravchenko, confirmed that the startup is at least partly ""responsible for [the] architecture, blockchain research and development and security analysis"" of the institution's initiative.  Central banks across the globe have been discussing and exploring blockchain technology for its ability to more efficiently track funds and reduce the expenses of commercial banks. For instance, the People's Bank of China has deemed the creation of a fiat-based cryptocurrency a ""crucial"" financial development.  But still, the National Bank of Ukraine gave a more detailed vision of its undertaking to create a ""national digital currency,"" that makes its work less theoretical than others.  According to Smolii:  ""National bank of Ukraine is looking forward to implementation of e-hryvnia based on blockchain technology. We consider blockchain as the next step in evolution of transactions technologies, which will become more popular and widespread during the next decades.""  'Convenient' money  The central bank formally began working on a blockchain-based system in November 2016 to develop a ""cashless economy.""  While the results of the earlier research were not disclosed, Smolli told CoinDesk, the project is now ""focused on studying the ability of the central bank to establish [an] operational e-hryvnia solution which would be available 24/7 and easy-to-use for all stakeholders.""  In this way, the central bank is now working to build a more ""convenient instrument"" for Ukrainian citizens and businesses to conduct any number of transactions.  Displaying how determined the central bank is to move forward with the project, the National Bank of Ukraine has begun surveying commercial banks in the country, in an effort to understand their ""readiness"" to ""support the circulation"" of a national fiat currency riding on a blockchain.  The central bank is also looking at best practices employed by other blockchain users around the world.  ""We have spent some time in additional study of international best practices and existing technologies,"" Smolli wrote, adding:  ""We remain confident of the need to introduce national digital money.""

42400755,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKWlE,1512378003,The Father of the ICO Is All About Identity Now,"The developer who created core technology that has helped launch thousands of initial coin offerings (ICOs) isn't all that impressed with the fruits of his creation.  Looking ahead to 2018, Fabian Vogelsteller is interested in taking the model he pioneered with ethereum's ERC-20 token standard, effectively a drop-dead simple way of creating your own cryptocurrency, and recreating its effects for one of blockchain tech's most-often touted use cases: digital identity.  And there's reason to think replicating the success here could be big. In many ways, traditional online identity has become a disaster, especially in recent years where many of the large gatekeepers of consumer data have been hacked and millions of consumer data points exposed.  Blockchains, by contrast, have been touted as a way of giving consumers control of their own information, to not only decrease fraud, but also cut off large enterprises from using consumer data for their own gain.  The identity mess is a hard one to untangle, though, and while there are blockchain startups focused on this area, Vogelsteller believes something like the ICO token standard could kick the industry into gear.  According to Vogelsteller, who has gone as far as to call token sales the ""least interesting"" application of ethereum, there's too much attention on ""making money"" in the space right now. But by contrast, identity is a ""very important"" application that ethereum could facilitate.  ""It's what the future needs, absolutely. There's no way around it,"" he said.  And so, Vogelsteller has been asking himself: if standards are what sparked today's ICO craze, can the same idea be applied elsewhere? Recently putting forward a new standard ERC-725 for identity, Vogelsteller plans to find out.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The reason is it's so simple. This is one reason why [ERC-20] took off compared to other systems, compared to colored coins and others. When we have agreement on the interfaces used, suddenly there’s an explosion of experimentation.""  Beyond ICOs  Like other requests for comment, ERC-725 is modeled after the process of upgrading the internet, in which computer scientists come together to debate on the topic before anything is officially adopted.  And also like the infrastructure underneath the internet, Vogelsteller and others believe blockchains will also function more efficiently with the use of standards.  ERC-725 specifically defines and standardizes the actions all identity implementations need to take, such as adding claims to the smart contract and the mechanism for obtaining those claims later. By using a standardized system, entrepreneurs and companies know their application will be able to interface with all other applications using the standard.  As an example, Vogelsteller said governments could create claims using the ERC-725 standard that ride on top of the ethereum blockchain, which would then, not only have an immutable provenance of the identity, but be easily transferable to others using the same system.  But Vogelsteller also describes ERC-725 as ""very flexible,"" and could be used to identify just about anything, hinting that it could be adapted to work for supply chain management as well.  ""It's basically a shell,"" he said, adding:  ""This identity works not only for humans, but it works for objects and robots.""  Work remains  The standard is far from complete, though.  Currently, the proposal is on GitHub, accumulating feedback.  ""It's just a draft proposal. In the end, we'll all discuss it. There will be opinions and changes,"" Vogelsteller acknowledged. ""Ultimately, we'll come up with whatever makes the most sense for everybody.""  Indeed, the GitHub issue has already led to plenty of technical sparring, and a broader discussion about whether an identity standard is necessary at all.  Yet, much of the feedback has been positive, with ethereum developer Alex Van de Sande calling ERC-725 ""very useful"" and developer Julien Bouteloup contending ""this is so needed.""  Vogelsteller, of course, agrees, suspecting it will have a big impact on the ecosystem, one that's been a long time coming.  He concluded:  ""Frankly speaking ... I was thinking about it two years ago, and the idea stayed in my head. It’s so simple. I expected other projects ... to come up with a standard. They didn’t, so I did.""

42400749,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKWiH,1512372612,Sony Details Blockchain Use for Education Data,"A new patent filing from Sony highlights how the Japanese tech conglomerate may be using blockchain as part of an education platform.  In August, Sony announced that it was working with IBM to build a suite of educational services, which would use the tech in part to secure student records and form part of a system for sharing that data between agreed-upon parties.  The application  from Sony, published last week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), points to how that might work in practice.  For example, ""nodes"" on the education network could be run by teachers, students or other parties that might need access to those records. It refers to how ""educational experiences"" would be cemented on the chain after being signed by the relevant users.  As the application explains:  ""In this example, the [blockchain], which is a trust chain, may be used to store information such as education experiences, certificates and so on of a user. The information contains, for example, studying which courses and possessing which certificates. In addition, based on concepts of a smart contract and a smart property, knowledge may also be exchanged, transacted and transferred via the block chain as a property.""  The filing, entitled ""Electronic Apparatus, Method for Electronic Apparatus and Information Processing System,"" hints at other possible uses for the tech as well, including for connecting vehicles across a common network.  That ""Internet of Vehicle"" network would, as envisioned, enable cars to report road conditions to one another, according to the application's authors.  ""By applying the electronic apparatus of the present disclosure to a vehicle (i.e., a node), trust can be transferred between uncorrelated entities using the [blockchain] technology, and real and valid real-time road conditions information is obtained in real-time according to the consensus,"" they wrote.

42400762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKWpA,1512367214,4 Blockchain Bills Introduced in New York Legislature,"A lawmaker in New York has introduced four bills in an effort to spur research into possible uses for blockchain by the state's government.  The proposed laws from Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D-33) would establish legal language for the technology (similar to an effort undertaken in Arizona) under state law while also creating studies around its application for local and state elections, including the verification of voter tallies.  The first bill would to add sections to New York's technology law which define “blockchain technology” and “smart contract,” as well as provide a legal understanding for digital signatures stored on a blockchain.  The second bill ""directs the state board of elections to study and evaluate the use of blockchain technology to protect voter records and election results,"" according to the text.  It gives this study a year to produce a report explaining whether a blockchain platform can help limit or prevent voter fraud, improve cybersecurity around digital voting platforms, maintain better voter records and more efficiently share election results.  The third bill also calls for a study and the creation of a task force to determine whether a blockchain platform can be used by the state government to store records and share information quickly and efficiently. This particular measure echoes one pursued in Vermont in 2016, though in that case officials ultimately passed on greenlighting such a platform.  The New York bill would require the task force to hold at least one public hearing during its study, with a final report due later than Jan. 1, 2019.  The fourth and final bill would, if passed, create a digital currency task force to determine the impact of cryptocurrencies on New York financial markets.  Public records don't offer any clear picture on the future trajectory of the bills, with three of them being referred to a committee related to government options.

42400759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKWoB,1512360904,Venezuelan President Announces 'Petro' Oil-Backed Cryptocurrency,"Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has announced a new cryptocurrency amid an economic crisis and a plunge in the value of the bolivar, the country's national currency.  According to Reuters, Maduro made the announcement during a Christmas television special, stating that the as-yet-to-be-launched cryptocurrency would be backed by commodity reserves, including oil.  Maduro – who took office in 2013 and has presided over a worsening socio-economic crisis – said that the cryptocurrency would help the country overcome a financial ""blockade,"" according to a statement published on the government's official website.  The statement reads (according to a rough translation):  ""Venezuela will create a...cryptocurrency to advance monetary sovereignty, as it will help to overcome the financial blockade and thus move towards new forms of international financing for the economic and social development of the country.""  Opposition leaders in Venezuela have reportedly dismissed the idea. Reuters quoted lawmaker Angel Alvarado, who said the idea has ""no credibility.""  ""It's Maduro being a clown,"" Alvarado told the news service.  The move comes amid a plunge in the value of the bolivar against the U.S. dollar and weeks after the government issued a new 100,000-bolivar note, according to Business Insider. As the New York Times reported yesterday, rapid inflation of the bolivar has led to a surge in consumer prices that has exacerbated the crisis there.  The ""petro"" announcement is also notable development given that some residents of Venezuela have turned to bitcoin mining in an effort to make money amid the crisis.  The Atlantic  noted in September that low electricity costs have made mining – an energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, minting new coins in the process – an attractive option there.  Per the statement, the government also intends to create a ""blockchain observatory"" that will be affiliated with the Ministry of Popular Power for University Education, Science and Technology.
