42401019,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLbtz,1517960384,Crypto Industry Reacts to US Senate Hearing Remarks,"""Bullish."" ""A sigh of relief.""  These were just some of the comments that came from industry observers in the wake of a hearing held Tuesday by the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, one that addressed the question of how lawmakers should consider cryptocurrency regulation.  Widely anticipated due to its positioning amidst what has been one of the biggest industry bubbles, the event saw the heads of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) testify on a range of topics including market oversight, price volatility and the regulatory concerns around initial coin offerings (ICOs).  However, it was perhaps the measured and sophisticated nature of the dialogue that most stood out to observers queried.  Stephen Palley, an attorney for Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, said he was impressed at the level of knowledge displayed by both the committee members as well as the regulators themselves about such a seemingly esoteric topic as cryptocurrency.  Palley told CoinDesk:  ""It's amazing that nine years after the Satoshi white paper, you've got senators talking about this [stuff] and not pooh-poohing it.""  Attorney Zoe Dolan struck an optimistic tone in the wake of the hearing as well, taking to Twitter to write that ""this hearing has made me so bullish I can hardly stand it.""  ""As a lawyer – and a criminal defense lawyer in particular – I was heartened to hear acknowledgment that existing laws suffice to address age-old human conduct,"" she later told CoinDesk, adding: ""Fraud is fraud.""  Berger Singerman LLP partner Andrew Hinkes also highlighted the admission from both agencies that there is a need for more resources to keep an eye on a rapidly-expanding industry.  ""Although this may stoke fear in the community, more resources may lead to better, more thoughtful and more facilitative regulation. Regulation is helpful when it provides useful guidance,"" he said.  More clarity needed?  Optimism aside, some market observers said they believe the hearing revealed the need for more clarity on the regulatory front – something that both agency chairs indicated may be necessary in statements that broached possible action from the U.S. Congress.  Reading between the lines of Clayton's remarks, Carol van Cleef, a veteran Washington banking lawyer, said a key takeaway was the ""need for clearer jurisdictional lines.""  And though he made a point of the fact that the SEC is coordinating with the CFTC and Federal Reserve, Clayton ""kept talking about the patchwork system,"" van Cleef said.  ""If he didn’t say it specifically,"" she continued, ""he [implied] that it isn't enough for this space.""  The subtext, she said, is that ""somebody’s got to take control of this at the federal level.”  This could be problematic for businesses, such as bitcoin exchanges, that have spent the last few years building compliance programs under the framework of money services businesses registered with FinCEN and money transmitters licensed by the states.  ""I did not hear enough today recognizing those kinds of efforts,"" van Cleef said.  Bigger picture understanding  Others who took in Tuesday's hearing highlighted another cause for celebration: that both lawmakers and regulators seemed to agree that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, risks aside.  Indeed, both Giancarlo and Clayton remarked on the possible uses of the tech, with the CFTC head scoring points among the crypto-community for his comment, ""If there were no bitcoin, there would be no distributed ledger technology.""  This sentiment was expressed by several senators in attendance as well.  Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito said of the hearing:  ""Senators and regulators are certainly concerned about fraud and volatile markets in cryptocurrency, but it was clear from today's hearing that they also understand, as Senator Warner suggested, that it may be as transformational as mobile telephony.""  According to Palley, the takeaway may ultimately be that U.S. policymakers ""understand the technology"" and are willing to engage in ""responsible enforcement and regulation.""  What comes next  One of the obvious questions remaining in the wake of the hearing, however, is what actions – both from Congress and the regulators – is to come.  Indeed, while Clayton himself remarked that the agencies may approach lawmakers asking for wider powers or more sophisticated oversight tools, Congress could, in theory, take the first step on its own. Van Cleef said she was struck by the way Clayton ""made it clear that the gatekeepers, lawyers and accountants are subject to SEC jurisdiction.""  That made her think that ""there must be something in the offing"" in terms of regulatory actions against such professionals, she said.  Testimony about coordination between federal and state-based regulators, aimed at addressing what Clayton characterized as a ""patchwork"" of rules, signals that additional steps could be taken on that front in the coming months.  Perianne Boring of the D.C.-based trade organization, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, pointed to this as a positive sign.  ""We're encouraged that the SEC and CFTC are working with others to address the patchwork of regulation that suppresses growth and consumer choice, and provide a runway for the U.S. to retain its leadership in technological innovation,"" she told CoinDesk in an email.  Likely to come, as suggested by Palley, is a push from both agencies to step up their enforcement efforts against bad actors in the space.  He remarked:  ""If you're somebody who's an innovator and not afraid of the law, this was quite positive. If you're running a $200 million ICO and didn't follow the law you might be a little worried now.""

42401029,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLbzt,1517953124,$8K Again? Bitcoin Is Up Nearly $2K from Today's Low,"Bitcoin jumped almost $2,000 from its intraday low Tuesday, making up some of the losses it sustained from 2018's January correction.  As of press time, bitcoin was trading around $7,900, after hitting a low of $5,947 a little over 12 hours ago. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap opened at just under $7,000 on the day but hit a daily high of $7,763, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The coin first fell past that level Monday on its way to $6,000.  Overall, bitcoin has yet to make up a significant portion of the more than $10,000 it lost since reaching its all-time high of more than $19,000 in December, or even the $17,000 it fell from in mid-January. However, Bitcoin's increase reflects the overall cryptocurrency market cap, which jumped nearly $100 billion in 10 hours. In addition, each of the top 100 coins on CoinMarketCap was in the green Tuesday, after seeing declines for nearly a month.  The top three cryptocurrencies continued following each other, with ethereum's ether token rising to $781 and Ripple's XRP rising to $0.76. Ether first dropped below the $1,000 mark on Feb. 1.  Similarly, Bitcoin is now trading at roughly the same levels it was at in mid-November, when it first shot past $7,000.  Earlier Tuesday, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair J. Christopher Giancarlo and Securities Enforcement Commission chair Jay Clayton testified that their agencies were keeping close eyes on the cryptosphere.  Both officials explained the efforts their agencies had made toward enforcing regulations to protect investors while watching the technology grow during testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.

That was the response from Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo when asked by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton about the value of the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  In his remarks, Giancarlo described them as invariably linked, striking a bullish tone on the ""enormous prospects"" of the technology in a range of uses.  The comments came during a two-hour hearing of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee before a packed audience, touching on topics like potential new regulation, initial coin offerings and volatility in cryptocurrency markets.  To be sure, Giancarlo hedged his remarks somewhat by stating that he was ""no pie-in-the-sky dreamer."" But nonetheless he pointed to applications in areas like financial markets infrastructure and charity funds management as promising ones.  Giancarlo's written testimony also reinforced the point on the possible uses for blockchain – a topic that the CFTC chair has detailed at length in the past.  In his committee testimony, Giancarlo wrote that the tech has ""the potential to enhance economic efficiency, mitigate centralized systemic risk, defend against fraudulent activity and improve data quality and governance."" He added:  ""When tied to virtual currencies, this technology aims to serve as a new store of value, facilitate secure payments, enable asset transfers, and power new applications.""  SEC chairman Jay Clayton, in response to Cotton's question, pointed to applications in the areas of data verification and record-keeping – i.e., using the technology to create distributed records of information – as particularly notable use cases.

42401023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLbww,1517948119,CFTC Chair: 'We're Used To' Volatile Assets Like Bitcoin,"As might be expected, Tuesday's Senate hearing on cryptocurrency regulation touched on an oft-discussed facet of digital assets: their price volatility.  Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair J. Christopher Giancarlo were asked about their views on the zigzagging prices, as well as the factors driving those price changes.  Ultimately, both demurred on offering a definitive point, though Giancarlo, whose agency regulates derivatives, pointed out that volatility in bitcoin isn't quite up to par with the VIX Index, known more commonly as the ""fear index.""  ""Bitcoin's volatility was not as large as other asset classes like [the] VIX. We have seen extreme volatility in bitcoin but in our world [commodities], we are used to volatility in asset classes,"" he remarked.  Clayton was blunt in his answer to the question of why prices are volatile: ""I don’t really know what’s driving volatility in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,"" he said, going on to remark:  ""[Cryptocurrencies are] not correlated with sovereign currencies, so it must be something different than what would move the dollar. But that's one of the issues before us – there does appear to be a lot of volatility compared to the medium they are supposed to be replacing.”  Asked whether derivatives products like exchange-traded funds could help stabilize bitcoin’s wild price fluctuations, Clayton said it would depend on the investors.  Clayton went so far as to suggest that the agency might one day green-light such a financial product, a notable comment given that the SEC shot down the ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (that effort remains subject to an appeal).

42401022,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLbr2,1517945434,SEC Chief Clayton: 'Every ICO I've Seen Is a Security',"Concerns about initial coin offerings among U.S. regulators and lawmakers were on full display during a U.S. Senate hearing on Tuesday.  ""I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security,"" Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton declared early on, perhaps setting the tone on a topic that would be raised numerous times during the roughly two-hour hearing. He largely echoed his past remarks on the subject, criticizing the “gatekeepers” of such offerings in the market today.  At one point, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren asked Clayton whether any ICO, past or future, had been subject to SEC registration.  ""Not one,"" he answered to both.  Warren herself took a critical stance on the blockchain funding model (notable in part because her home state’s government has filed suit against ICO organizers in the past), returning again to the topic of unregistered ICOs just before the close of the hearing.  ""I understand you to say it is a violation of the law"" to do so, she remarked.  ""Yes,"" Clayton replied.  Earlier in the hearing, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown raised the point that, last year, ICOs raised billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies from investors. But of that amount, he asked Clayton, ""how much of that...was raised in the U.S.?""  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the SEC chairman couldn’t offer a direct answer.  ""It’s not clear,"" he told the senator. ""It’s hard to get a number on that because this has been conducted on largely an unregulated basis. But I imagine, Senator, a significant enough portion that we should be paying attention.”  Ultimately, according to Clayton, some of those acting in the space are doing so even with the knowledge that they aren’t adhering as close as they ought to SEC regulations.  ""I'm very not happy that people are conducting ICOs when they should know they should follow the private placement rules,"" he remarked during a back-and-forth with Senator John Kennedy.  That said, the SEC chair also made the point he wants, from a regulatory perspective, to separate cryptocurrencies from those digital assets that are clearly securities under U.S. law.  He remarked:  ""I want to go back to separating ICOs and cryptocurrencies. ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings. End of story.""

Roubini further claimed that he had received death threats as a result of his views. Roubini said in the tweet that he anticipated another attack, and had received recent threats..  These alleged threats did not force the economist to back down from his stance on bitcoin, however. In another tweet, the New York University professor praised Agustin Carstens, the head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), for labeling bitcoin as a ""Ponzi scheme"" in a speech Tuesday.  In other tweets, Roubini posted links to several articles claiming a connection between bitcoin and criminal activity. At the same time, he noted bitcoin's recent price decline and the overall cryptocurrency market correction, saying that bitcoin is starting ""to look like a dinosaur on the way to extinction,"" and suggested that its value will remain volatile.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Roubini has been a consistent and vocal critic of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally.

42401017,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLbs1,1517937302,Venezuela's Cryptocurrency Plans Draw Ire at US Senate Hearing,"Venezuela's controversial plan to create an oil-backed cryptocurrency ignited debate and discussion at a U.S. Senate hearing Tuesday.  Held by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which kicked off at 10 a.m. EST, the event notably saw CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and SEC chair Jay Clayton discuss and respond to a range of questions, including the possibility their role as market regulators could be bolstered by new laws.  However, it was the issue of actions by other nations that saw notable discussion later in the session, when talk turned to Venezuela and public boasts by its President Nicolas Maduro that the country could use an ethereum-based cryptocurrency to avoid sanctions.  The issue was prominently raised by New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, who asked whether both agencies would play any role in preventing the use of the cryptocurrency to avoid U.S. financial sanctions.  He also highlighted reports that Russia's government is considering a similar initiative.  Clayton and Giancarlo largely demurred on their answers, but the latter stated that the CFTC ""wouldn’t hesitate"" to act if the cryptocurrency were used specifically in an attempt to defraud U.S. consumers.  ""We would certainly look at it,"" he went on to say.  Menendez blasted Venezuela's plan in a January letter sent to the U.S. Treasury Department, which he co-authored with Florida Senator Marco Rubio.  ""We have serious doubts about whether Venezuela has the capacity to launch a cryptocurrency,” the two wrote at the time. ""But regardless, it is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.""  Overall, the comments come amid what has been a period of heavy commentary by the legal community over the role cryptocurrencies could play in sanctions evasion.

42401034,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLc3p,1517935203,New Regulation for Crypto? Senate Hearing Sees Debate,"""We may be back with our friends from the U.S. Treasury and the Fed to ask for additional legislation.""  So said Jay Clayton, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, at a U.S. Senate hearing on cryptocurrencies today, responding to one of several questions about whether his agency has enough authority over the cryptocurrency market.  The meeting of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which kicked off on 10 a.m. Tuesday, however, saw participation from another notable regulator as well, U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair J. Christopher Giancarlo, who also addressed the topic in remarks.  That said, both Clayton and Giancarlo indicated that such a move may not be immediately required, even despite growing concerns about the state of the technology and the potential harm that may come to under-educated U.S. consumers who participate.  ""I can't give a definitive answer,"" Clayton said when pressed directly.  Such comments were colored by the questions of senators assembled, which mentioned a flurry of negative news that has brought down the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including the recent hack on the Japan-based CoinCheck exchange, and the volatility that has seen the asset class decline by nearly $500 billion in January alone.  ""Sometimes it seems that scam artists and hackers know more about the technology than most market participants,"" said Senator Sherrod Brown, a democrat from Ohio in attendance. ""That should concern all of us.""  It was perhaps Giancarlo, though, who struck the most positive tone, highlighting the work his agency has already done within the context of existing law to safeguard U.S. citizens.  This, he said, has included the creation of an innovation lab focused in part on blockchain, and the newly launched U.S. futures markets, which operate under its oversight.  Despite the moves, however, Giancarlo acknowledged the CFTC is naturally limited due to the fact that the cryptocurrency markets operate globally.  Clayton, too, commented on this aspect of the market. In response to a question about the nature of the market's structure, he remarked:  ""The international nature of this market is why the patchwork is not sufficient.”  Mainstreet evolves  Still, there was another notable fault line in the dialogue, one that addressed the age gap that naturally forms with new technology.  For instance, Giancarlo painted the markets as not only ""new, evolving and international,"" but generational. In a remark that saw widespread Twitter support, Giancarlo said it was paramount the innovation wasn't quashed for younger Americans, who he portrayed as having a natural interest in cryptocurrencies.  Notably, it was a comment on which Giancarlo seemed to draw support, with Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo acknowledging the evolving nature of the market.  Clayton, however, framed ""mainstreet"" investors as the likely beneficiaries of market regulation, stating that while there are ""smart people"" who believe the technology will one day provide value, he isn't ""seeing those benefits manifest.""  The latter observation brought up the question of systemic risk, or the idea a cryptocurrency market crash could have a far-reaching market impact on national economies, a matter that Giancarlo dismissed due to the ""relatively small"" nature of the market.  Still, he said that older Americans should perhaps be educated and protected, though in a manner consistent with financial products broadly.  ""Seniors seem to be the prey of choice for fraudsters and manipulators. Whether it's precious metals, whether its foreign exchange,"" he said.  Clayton also weighed in, though appeared more open to considering the downside, as well as the possibility an unchecked market could have a broad impact.  ""If people are getting ripped off, that represents reputational risks, which can have systemic effects,"" Clayton said.

Forbes further cites Carstens as saying that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed to undermine trust in central banks. He argued that the consequences of debasing this trust have historically been detrimental, referencing the 19th century production of currencies by private banks as a cause of financial turmoil that subsequently brought about the creation of the Federal Reserve System.  ""The tried, trusted and resilient modern way to provide confidence in public money is the independent central bank,"" Carstens stated, while lauding the protections banks afford consumers and investors.  He also claimed that cryptocurrencies are ""not sustainable as money,"" adding that they fail to meet the ""basic textbook definition"" of a currency. The volatility of cryptocurrencies, the BIS chief went on, is tolerated mostly by those ""who massively evade taxes or launder money.""  Carstens' remarks put him in the company of a growing list of heads of state and influential finance figures condemning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have recently suffered substantial losses in value.  Billionaire George Soros made similar assertions last month, saying that the term ""cryptocurrency"" is a misnomer, because a lack of stable value precludes it from being a currency at all.

Speaking at a seminar, hosted on Feb. 2 by Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance, Shih Jun-ji, vice president of Taiwan's executive branch of government, addressed issues around the financial impact of cryptocurrencies and the relevant regulatory responses.  According to a government report, Shih said that amid the rapid development of cryptocurrencies in recent years, Taiwan should be proactively engaging in exploring policies to tackle the technology's increasing influence on finance. Further, the country should be well-positioned to maintain its financial stability in the event of a market collapse, he said.  The official explained that bitcoin's market capitalization – around $170 billion when it was trading at $10,000 – would equal one third of Taiwan's foreign exchange reserve, twice of the government's financial budget or about the total assets of all the banks in Taiwan.  While bitcoin's surging price has led to the belief in may quarters that the cryptocurrency is in a major bubble, Shih said, the price surge itself does not necessarily mean that is the case.  Nevertheless, he concluded that the government should start exploring measures to ensure it is well-prepared to handle the impact in the case of a severe drop in prices.  Shih was previously chairman of Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission from 2016 to 2017.

On Nov. 1  , bitcoin (BTC) prices received a shot in the arm on news that derivatives marketplace operators CME Group, Cboe and Cantor Fitzgerald were considering launching futures for the market in December. It was widely believed that BTC would zoom to dizzying heights as a move to the mainstream would open doors for a bigger kind of whale.  The speculation drove prices higher to $10,000 in November, and the sharp rise and resulting fear of missing out established a positive feedback loop, one that sent prices to $20,000 by mid-December.  However, since then, the BTC has been steadily losing altitude.  A stream of negative news concerning regulatory crackdowns in some of the world's largest markets – China and South Korea – pushed BTC below the $10,000 mark in mid-January. That said, the drop witnessed in the last five days could be associated with the decision of major banks to bar customers from buying bitcoin with credit cards. China's decision to block access to foreign cryptocurrency platforms has only worsened the sentiment.  As of now, bitcoin is trading around $6,500 – a level last seen on November 1.  Indeed, market forces have not worked as anticipated by many. The Dow index fell more than 1,000 points yesterday, triggering a wave of risk aversion in the equity markets across the globe. However, it has not had any positive impact on bitcoin, despite its status as a ""digital gold.""  That said, the oversold BTC could see a relief rally if the Senate adopts a softer approach to regulating cryptocurrencies than China.

Bears are struggling to keep bitcoin below the 10-month moving average (MA). Currently, the MA is seen at $6,372 and is biased bullish.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart, 1-hour chart, and 4-hour chart shows oversold conditions.

42401027,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLc0s,1517922015,Sanctions Showdown Looms for US and Cryptocurrency,"Brian Fleming is a member of the law firm of Miller & Chevalier in Washington, D.C.      With governments around the globe cracking down on all aspects of the cryptocurrency market, it seems like new regulatory risks arise every day. Add U.S. sanctions to that list.  On Jan. 19, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the primary sanctions enforcer in the U.S., announced that any U.S. person dealing in Venezuela’s soon-to-be-introduced cryptocurrency, the petro, could run afoul of U.S. sanctions against the Venezuelan government.  Couple that with recent comments from U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, warning that the U.S. is determined not to let bitcoin wallets become a new version of the Swiss bank account, and it appears that the Treasury Department is poised to wade into cryptocurrency regulation in a major way.  Although the potential sanctions risks associated with cryptocurrencies are similar in some respects to money laundering and terrorist financing risks that have garnered attention recently, they present some unique challenges.  OFAC maintains a blacklist of persons and entities that are essentially prohibited from dealing with U.S. persons, U.S. goods and services or the U.S. financial system. Direct violations of U.S. sanctions, or assisting others in efforts to evade U.S. sanctions, can result in significant financial or, in egregious cases, criminal penalties. Companies inside and outside of the U.S. have ample incentives to guard against such violations, but the anonymity afforded by cryptocurrency transactions makes compliance with such restrictions difficult.  If OFAC turns its eye toward cryptocurrencies, however, it could be only a matter of time before it makes an example out of one or more entities in an effort to send a message to the market and create a deterrent effect.  Moreover, the public ledgers underlying cryptocurrencies may allow the U.S. government, quite readily, to investigate potential sanctions violations by identifying the details of specific transactions and parties.  What follows below is a brief overview of some cryptocurrency players that could be affected and how that impact may be felt.  Exchanges  Just as exchanges have been a focal point of increased government scrutiny regarding fraud and other criminal activities involving cryptocurrencies, they also could be the natural starting point with respect to sanctions.  A greater focus on disrupting potential sanctions violators could mean that lawmakers and regulators demand greater transparency from exchanges, as well as parties that use them.  Because this tension between transparency and security (or anonymity) is growing more heated, exchanges themselves are going to need to wrestle with how they reconcile those competing interests and retain their identity in the marketplace. Exchanges that choose to ignore sanctions risks could find themselves subject to major penalties in the future.  Investors  Any sanctions risks affecting exchanges will necessarily flow to cryptocurrency investors, as well.  Although investors themselves may not be directly in the crosshairs of OFAC—unless they have knowledge that an exchange is violating U.S. sanctions—significant penalties imposed upon exchanges could result in assets being frozen or even exchanges being put out of business.  Savvy cryptocurrency investors should certainly consider sanctions and other compliance-related concerns when conducting due diligence to identify the most reliable and trustworthy exchanges.  Financial institutions  Banks are among the most risk-averse actors when it comes to sanctions.  They come by that aversion honestly, as major global financial institutions have been subject to massive penalties imposed by OFAC and other U.S. enforcers in recent years.  While sanctions risks associated with cryptocurrencies could be too much for more traditional banks to accept, even more forward-leaning financial institutions that have been receptive to the sector may be forced to reassess those risks.  Late last month, Nordea Bank AB, which operates in Northern Europe, confirmed that it was banning all of its employees from trading in cryptocurrencies due to the perceived risks. Despite the ban, Nordea’s self-service customers are still allowed to purchase cryptocurrency products through the company’s platform, although the bank does not recommend it.  It also has been reported recently that a number of Australian banks have frozen the accounts of cryptocurrency traders and blocked transfers to several bitcoin exchanges. In both instances, these defensive actions appear to be driven by counterparty verification challenges and associated compliance-related concerns  Regardless of the specific reasons for the changes in policy, the inability to verify customers and counterparties—and the possibility of transacting with sanctioned parties—is precisely the type of blind spot that could lead to significant sanctions exposure for financial institutions.  Commercial businesses  As cryptocurrencies gain wider acceptance among commercial businesses, especially those in the e-commerce space, those entities will need to decide what measures are necessary to protect against sanctions risks.  Many U.S. businesses have adopted screening procedures to vet non-U.S. customers or counterparties and ensure that U.S. goods are not shipped to a sanctioned party or destination. How will U.S. businesses that accept cryptocurrency payments screen transactions appropriately?  It is an open question whether such screening procedures can be readily adapted to vet transactions conducted using cryptocurrencies. If adaptation is too costly or ineffective, then businesses may reevaluate the benefits of accepting cryptocurrencies in the face of clear sanctions risks.  Government-backed cryptos  There are many reasons to be skeptical of Venezuela’s petro and Russia’s cryptoruble, but sanctions should be near the top of the list.  High-ranking government officials in both countries have publicly acknowledged that their planned government-supported cryptocurrencies are responses to U.S. sanctions against those countries and an effort to circumvent the reliance on U.S. currency in certain industries.  In other words, these countries have admitted they are attempting to evade U.S. sanctions.  With respect to Venezuela, OFAC has already made clear that such currency is essentially off limits to U.S. persons. One can imagine a similar fate may be in store for the cryptoruble should it come to fruition.  Additionally, for any non-U.S. persons considering whether to use, accept, or invest in either currency, they potentially could be branded by OFAC as foreign sanctions evaders, which would subject them to sanctions, as well.

According to an order paperhttps://www.gov.sg/~/sgpcmedia/media_releases/parl/press_release/P-20180202-1/attachment/Order%20Paper%20-5Feb18.pdf dated on Feb. 5, which outlines the agenda of the day's parliamentary session, three lawmakers sought comment from the country's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, as to the government's stance on regulatory issues related to cryptocurrencies.  Parliament members Saktiandi Supaat, Lim Biow Chuan and Cheng Li Hui raised questions to the PM as to whether the government is reconsidering the drafting of a regulatory framework and the possibility of banning cryptocurrency trading in Singapore.  As reported previously, while the country's de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, has given an outline of how it would treat initial coin offering activities, the central bank's chief said in last October the institution has no plan to regulate cryptocurrencies.  Although the order paper does not mean any bill is being drafted, it nonetheless reveals interests from the country's legislative members in moving to explore a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.  Furthermore, Supaat and Cheng also requested comment from the government on its measures around tackling the use of cryptocurrency in money laundering and tax evasion, as well as how it would move to protect investors in the case of a cryptocurrency market collapse.  The news comes soon after other nations including China and South Korea have made moves to restrict cryptocurrency activities.  While China closed all cryptocurrency exchanges and looks to be about to block citizens' access to websites of overseas services too, South Korea has so far banned only crypto trading from virtual accounts. However, it is still unclear if reported plans to further restrict exchange-based trading are still on the table.

The sell-off looks even bigger if we take into account the fact that the total market capitalization is down 66 percent from the all-time high of $830 billion seen in January, as per CoinMarketCap.  Zooming into the detail, the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value are reporting double-digit losses for the fourth time in the last five days – a decline that has been associated with some banks' decision to ban credit crypto purchases and regulatory backlash against what some jurisdictions consider excess speculation in the crypto markets.  Due to back-to-back negative news cycles since the start of the year, most currencies are down at least 70 percent from their respective record highs.  As the chart shows, the leaders of the crypto market have witnessed a minimum of 20 percent depreciation in value over the last 24 hours.  Notably, bitcoin fell below $6,000 for the first time since November. However, as of writing, a slight recovery is in progress. The cryptocurrency was last seen trading at $6,278.  Further, most currencies have recovered from their daily lows, but are still reporting double-digit losses. Of particular note is the performance of NEO. The token is the biggest loser among the top 10 today, and it ranks last on the list of currencies with the biggest drop from its record high.

Christopher Giancarlo said that in this ""new digital era"" for the financial markets, cryptocurrencies have brought ""paradigm shift"" in how the world views payments and financial processes, and that ignoring such innovation ""will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response.""  Giancarlo continued:  ""'Do no harm' was unquestionably the right approach to development of the Internet. Similarly, I believe that 'do no harm' is the right overarching approach for distributed ledger technology. ... With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity.""  That's not to say the CFTC will sit back and do nothing, however. The commission chair spelled out how his agency has previously taken civil enforcement actions against several ""virtual currency Ponzi schemes,"" including My Big Coin Pay Inc, The Entrepreneurs Headquarters Limited and Coin Drop Markets.  These actions confirm, he said, that the CFTC, in conjunction with the SEC and other financial enforcement agencies, will protect investors and ""aggressively prosecute"" cryptocurrency schemes that engage in fraud and manipulation.  Giancarlo further addressed the recent arrival of self-certified bitcoin futures products, which have seen some criticism from the traditional futures sector.  He argued that it is the role of the futures exchanges and futures clearinghouses, themselves, and not the CFTC, to address concerns over new product self-certifications.  However, the chairman said that the commission has added an additional element to the Review and Compliance Checklist for cryptocurrency futures products.  Giancarlo explained this entails requesting product providers to disclose to the CFTC the steps they have taken ""to gather and accommodate appropriate input from concerned parties, including trading firms and FCMs.""  Additionally, the CFTC will take a ""close look"" at governance around such products and develop recommendations for possible further action, he added.

42401033,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLc4o,1517911203,ICOs Are Already Changing Tech Startups You Know,"It wasn't so long ago that scraping a flat fee off of a user's transaction was a reliable revenue model.  But with the advent of cryptocurrencies, a new wave of startups is beginning to set its sights on something different, with mainstream brands like Telegram and Kik pivoting to embrace an alternative model that wasn't yet possible when they launched.  If you've been confused about the announcements, there's a simple idea close to the center – namely, that companies in question could use cryptocurrencies to distribute revenue in a more equitable way, using a digital asset that behaves like bitcoin or ether in that it gives users an actual, tradeable stake in a platform's growth.  It works like this: companies issue a certain number of crypto tokens (keeping a percentage for themselves) to be used on a platform now or in the future. If users see value in the platform, they'll purchase the tokens needed to interact with that platform.  Yet, since the amount of crypto tokens is limited, supply and demand pushes the value of the token up (or down). And as the company holds a reserve of the tokens, the value of that reserve fluctuates as well.  Effectively sales revenue is being replaced with asset appreciation, with payroll covered through the early years with proceeds from the coin ""offering."" But, as announcements have shown, you don't exactly have to be a new company to get involved.  After selling $24 million worth of its ethereum-based token in December, YouNow CEO Adi Sideman is already reporting that its revenue strategy has changed.  He told CoinDesk,  ""Our business model shifted from taking a cut, like a 40 percent or 50 percent cut – like YouTube and Facebook do today – [to instead] benefit from the growth in the token and the ecosystem.""  And industry experts like Mason Borda, CEO and co-founder of token sale management company TokenSoft Inc, believe this trend will continue.  ""The more ethically pure way to look at this is the company will be rewarded because their metrics will go up because they will have been able to drive user engagement,"" he said.  He continued, speaking to how the model will make companies build better products and applications:  ""You benefit and you have a stake in making sure the token is useful.""  Making the switch  Yet, not every company will benefit from or be able to execute on the switch to a revenue model that relies on crypto.  YouNow, for example, has a head start in making the transition – it's had a traditional virtual currency, called ""bars,"" on the platform for years now. And according to YouNow, users spend an equivalent of $24 million on bars every year, buying virtual gifts such as super-likes and digital stickers that they can shower videos and content creators they enjoy with.  There's also a reputation mechanism on YouNow. While bars can be purchased outright to buy digital gifts, when a content creator receives digital gifts, their clout on the network increases.  And YouNow shares the money spent on purchases of digital gifts on a broadcaster's channel with the creator.  But on a new app, called Rize, that the company plans on releasing publicly on Feb. 23, a virtual currency, similar to bars, called ""coins"" will work in tandem with the cryptocurrency ""props.""  Rize evolves the user experience from one where viewers just watch content creators to one where viewers are also part of the experience (their cameras will also be streaming, so that content creators can see their reactions). Users will buy coins to purchase digital gifts within the platform, but they'll earn the cryptocurrency props for engaging content.  ""I would call it a move toward more participation,"" said Sideman.  And that engagement should increase the number of digital gifts sent, and in turn, garner revenue for the company, not just in bars sales, but in new users interested in trading props, of which the company kept 30 percent of the 1 billion tokens issued.  In this way, YouNow has shifted away from a company maximizing returns on person-to-person payments to one interested in building new products and services into the platform to entice more users in an effort to see the value of props rise.  Sideman said:  ""Our new model allows us to be completely aligned with everyone else in the ecosystem.""  And Borda argued that systems like YouNow's, that reward users for participating in the ecosystem, should work well. Using the example of frequent flier miles, he argued that consumers are already familiar with these kinds of rewards.  While YouNow isn't decentralizing its whole architecture right away, it is working toward that, outlining its bigger ambitions in a Medium post. Up next, new apps will come out using the same underlying video infrastructure as Rize and allowing users to hop over without the need to rebuild their social graph.  But because there is still a traditional virtual currency that users buy from the company, YouNow is still relying on taking cuts off payments in some ways.  Sideman admits this, but he also told CoinDesk that with the move towards crypto tokens, fundamentally the YouNow business model is based on growing the value of props.  Will it really Rize?  Still, some remain skeptical.  A recent Wired article, which mentioned YouNow, called ICOs a new lifeline for stalled or failing startups. And speaking to CoinDesk, Arianna Simpson, founder and managing partner of crypto hedge fund Autonomous Partners, echoed that sentiment.  ""I’m very bullish on the crypto space in general,"" she said, ""but to think all of these networks are going to have billions of dollars in value accrue on top of them is a little bit naive.""  Plus, she continued, it's not clear yet whether redistributing a significant amount of revenue around the community will be beneficial to companies at large.  According to Simpson, many ICO issuers are just taking advantage of an unskeptical market that will buy any pitch. A large portion of the current market likely intends to speculate on the new tokens rather than buying them to use on the new platforms, for instance.  Although, Kik recently published a report on the beta test of its new crypto token with the app's most engaged users, which suggested that there is interest in earning and spending crypto tokens on its platform.  Yet, even YouNow's Sideman acknowledges that the market is frothy.  ""I think the market should be suspect of companies that are just showing up to the party with models that are being forced into a token economy,"" he said, adding:  ""Versus others cases where the evolution makes sense, it's organic, there's already a two-sided market. This was all a very natural development of the existing two-sided market that was already transacting in a token, except it wasn't a crypto token.""

According to the firm's latest tweet, credit card users from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi and Capital One are all currently prohibited from purchasing cryptocurrencies at the platform.  However, other payment channels such as debit cards and bank transfer are still available, and are being encouraged by Coinbase as alternatives for affected customers.  The notice came as a confirmation to a recent report that Chase, Bank of America and Citi had launched the ban starting in early February over fears that credit card users may run up debt if the prices of cryptocurrencies drop. It further indicates that the restriction also extends to Capital One, another major credit card issuer in the U.S.  This news also arrives amid a major price correction across the crypto markets in the last few weeks. According to CoinDesk's latest report, bitcoin's price has dropped to a 12-week low around $6,000. On the same date in January, prices were closer to $17,000.  Data from CoinMarketCap also indicates that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization slumped today to under $300 billion for the first time since Nov. 25, 2017.  The trend to bar bitcoin buying with credit cards is not just being seen in the U.S. market.

42428506,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Wjh,1517893254,Augur Ahead? One of the Oldest ICOs Is Almost Live,"In what could be one of the year's most talked-about launches, a cryptocurrency project called Augur may soon invite its community to bet against its success.  Created by the Forecast Foundation in 2015, the crowdsourced prediction protocol raised $5.5 million by selling REP tokens long before the term initial coin offering (ICO) had taken hold. Now, after the release of a new version of its white paper, the system that would allow global users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events is getting close to a test launch.  But while Augur will allow people to bet on all sorts of events (from which team will win a specific sports game to whether the Dow Jones will break a certain price), the founders say users will have only one market to make when it goes live.  The Forecast Foundation's operations lead, Tom Kysar, told CoinDesk:  ""Essentially, we are going to launch Augur with one market, and that market is: 'Will Augur be hacked?' or 'Will there be a critical vulnerability discovered in Augur' by a certain date?'""  If that seems risky, it is. But according to Kysar, it will be well worth it in the end.  In parallel with the bet, the Augur team will run a bug bounty, seeding the market with bets that the system won't be hacked. In this way, a confident hacker could then take the other side of those bets, and go to work trying to find flaws in the protocol to collect a big payday.  ""From what we heard from our auditors, we'll probably be the largest and most complex application to be attempted to be deployed on ethereum,"" he said. ""I think it's very naive to think we could launch 6,500 lines of Solidity code being bug-free.""  In an effort to give outsiders plenty of time to find potential bugs, the team will be running the controlled launch for something like three months.  Augur is going through its second round of smart contract audits right now, and once complete, a live launch could be just months away, the team said.  Security model  As for what will be made available at the time, the platform is expected to finally permit real people to serve as ""reporters"" in the markets.  New markets need to designate a trusted reporter to determine how a bet resolves. Odds are, many of these will probably be bots of one kind or another, maintained by trusted developers (not unlike Polyswarm's approach to threat assessment).  Still, as outlined in the white paper, the system has two levels of dispute resolution in case participants disagree with an outcome.  At the most basic level, all Augur users are enlisted in resolving a disputed market. If a market dispute rises to the highest level, Augur forks into new ""universes"" for each outcome, and that's when a crowdsourcing procedure kicks in to determine the correct outcome.  An attacker could try to force an incorrect outcome through an attack, but the Forecast Foundation's models suggest this shouldn't be profitable.  In any case, whenever users participate in deciding how a market resolves, they will need to stake REP tokens to do so. Any time they stake on the correct outcome, they stand to earn a return.  ""The system does also attempt to shift the value of REP upward, or downward, when needed by adjusting the fees that are given to reporters,"" Alex Chapman, Augur's lead contract engineer, explained. ""While the cap of rep is below our target level, the fees will go up every week and vice versa.""  Yet, as the team has been working on the project, they've realized there are limits to how far a project should go on distributing all work. Early on, the team wanted to have every market decide by participant votes. While that's still the backup plan for markets with disagreements, the team has come around to the idea that rewarding centralized decision making turns out to be more efficient.  Kysar said:  ""Distributed reporting is really a worst-case scenario.""  Relinquishing control  And the first live market on whether Augur will be hacked should provide the team with valuable lessons, ones which it will take back to tweak the codebase if necessary.  After this, the full launch will commence, and that, according to Kysar, that is the big moment, both technically and organizationally.  ""Once Augur is live on the mainnet, the full release, we have no more control over Augur than anyone else does,"" he said.  While the Forecast Foundation will keep working on the code and the client, it won't be able to force anyone to accept its work. At that point, Augur will belong to the world, a critically important step since historically prediction markets have been shut down or restrained by governments.  ""If there's a central point of failure anywhere, that's the chance for regulators to come in an shut it down,"" Kysar said.  He continued, ""We're not going to limit it, we're not going to cap it, we're not going to restrict it.""  Instead, people will be able to put as much ether into Augur as they want.  And according to Chapman:  ""Ultimately, it's up to traders whether they believe the platform is secure based on these assumptions and formulas.""

The company, which faces competition from Streamspace, Flixxo, Viuly and Stream, all of which are developing similar concepts, received a $20 million vote of confidence from prominent Chinese seed investor Zhenfund during a private token sale, it announced today.  Explaining the company's mission, its website says that YouTube holds ""enormous power"" over creators and focuses on maximizing profit, which can bring it into conflict with its actual creators.  The site continues:  ""The solution is to create a collectively owned, decentralized means of distribution, which ensures all content value is directly distributed to content creators and affiliated contributors without going through a privately owned entity as a middleman.""  The company's LINO tokens will operate as the system's currency and will be earned by creating and sharing content, as well as from the development of infrastructure and applications on top of the Lino blockchain. In other words, users who run nodes to host content will earn tokens, as will the content creators, according to a Medium post by the group.  ""We believe in decentralized, peer-to-peer [content delivery networks (CDN)], but current projects seem not ready for stability and costs,"" Lino's website states.  Instead, it seeks to provide a decentralized CDN through an auction system, which the founders believe will maintain a high standard of work on the platform, according to TechCrunch.  The value of the content will be determined by human engagement with it, which Lino argues will prevent fraud and bots from manipulating the system. Transactions will be free of charge. The ""auction system"" is a reflection of that engagement – users with more interesting or novel content will receive more of a reward than those who produce less interesting content.  Lino chief executive Wilson Wei told TechCrunch that he expected content creators to garner three to five times the profits they make on YouTube or its competitor site, Twitch.  While the outcome of Lino's project remains to be seen – the product will launch later this year – Wei expressed confidence in its underlying design. He told TechCrunch:  ""The whole content economy is huge, but we believe in the decentralized organization concept.
