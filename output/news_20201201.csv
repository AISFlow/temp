That rollout would come as a single coin (backed one-for-one by the dollar), and with other currencies added to the backing basket later. And it also follows the earlier renaming of Facebook&apos;s digital wallet from Calibra to Novi. Novi told the FT that the currency is ready as a product, but its rollout will be partial for reasons including that it needs to get licenses in up to 10 U.S. states.

42433254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4HTh,1606861194,"Privacy Concerns Over Bitcoin Upgrade Taproot Are a 'Non-Issue,' Experts Say","Bitcoin privacy experts are far from impressed with a recently circling slideshow-style privacy report that puts Taproot, a likely upcoming upgrade to Bitcoin, in the crosshairs.      The Taproot upgrade will boost Bitcoin's privacy and scalability. The years-in-the-making upgrade has been applauded by Bitcoin's most active developers, with the community being invited numerous times to test and scrutinize it. Plus, in an unprecedented move for large Bitcoin upgrades, the majority of bitcoin miners are now signaling support for the upgrade.      Against this backdrop comes a new report from blockchain explorer Blockchair’s lead developer Nikita Zhavoronkov, who has released several privacy-oriented tools. He argues that because Taproot introduces a new ""script"" to Bitcoin – which dictates under which conditions coins can be spent – the Taproot coins will become distinguishable from other bitcoins.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling      Zhavoronkov, who has developed a reputation for his frequent criticism of Bitcoin, now appears to have one goal: to stop the upgrade.      But Bitcoin privacy experts pointedly disagree with Zhakoronkov's claim that Taproot isn't up to snuff.      ""I think the 'research' sucks, to put it bluntly,"" said Bitcoin privacy expert Chris Belcher, who works on Bitcoin privacy projects CoinSwap and JoinMarket). In an email to CoinDesk, he argued that, ironically, what Zhavoronkov proposes – to stop Taproot – would harm Bitcoin privacy in the long term.      ""What Nikita describes is a non-issue,"" pseudonymous bitcoin educator and privacy guru 6102 told CoinDesk.      Veteran bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell, who invented Taproot, went so far as to go on Reddit and call Zhavoronkov's research an ""attack,"" warning, ""Be informed and don't let malicious actors sow FUD in an effort to hurt Bitcoin users.""    The criticisms    Let's dive into the details a bit. Taproot will enable new rules, known as scripts, for locking up coins. Bitcoin has many types of scripts. The most common is just the rule that Bitcoin cannot be sent to someone else unless the user uses a private key to sign it and send it along. But there are others, such as the rule that two-of-three specific users need to sign the transaction to move the coins elsewhere.      Bitcoins locked up in these different scripts each look a little different. Remember, Bitcoin's ledger is open for anyone to see. It's possible for busybodies, namely blockchain analysis companies, to peruse Bitcoin's transaction history and pass on what they find to paying customers, such as government agencies, who may then use this information for a variety of reasonsto crack down on criminals.      In short, Zhavoronkov points out that once the new Taproot script is added, Taproot coins will stand out from other bitcoins.      More specifically, he looks at where bitcoin transactions are sent. Bitcoins are stored in chunks called Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). Say Alice has 3 BTC locked in one UTXO, but only wants to send 1 BTC to Bob. Once she sends the bitcoin to Bob, her 3 BTC UTXO will be split into two pieces: 1 BTC will be sent to Bob, and 2 BTC will be sent back to Alice in what's called a ""change address.""      If the change address script type is the same as the sending address but different from the recipient address then it's easy to guess where the sender sent their coins. Zhavoronkov argues this is an assumption (known as a ""heuristic"" in privacyland lingo), that blockchain analysis companies can use to figure out (or at least guess) where funds are going.      Zhavoronkov argues that adding another script for Taproot will increase the likelihood of this privacy hurdle. And he doesn't think this will be a short-term problem.      Zhavoronkov argues that if Taproot gets 100% adoption, then he agrees with other Bitcoin developers that the upgrade will be a ""net good."" But he doesn't think it will get to that point.      ""Taproot shouldn’t be considered as a 'privacy feature' because it’s not like the shielded pool in Zcash or ring signatures in Monero. The advantages are minuscule and applicable to edge cases only,"" he added.    Devs: Concerns don't hold water    Bitcoin developers argue this is a concern that many have already considered. It's not new information.      ""The reality is that this is already a 'problem' and adding a new type will likely have negligible impact, while bringing other significant benefits,"" 6102 told CoinDesk. He added that the heuristic Zhavoronkov points to can be easily gamed.      Maxwell argued (again, on Reddit) that Taproot was actually designed specifically with the problem Zhavoronkov pointed out.      ""This is a fact that was always discussed along with the development of taproot, and it drove a number of design decisions: e.g., not deploying it as multiple features and making sure new extensions can be deployed in leafs where they may not get exposed,"" he said.      Belcher added there are already many, many script types, each of which can be differentiated from others, and adding one more won't be much of a issue, let alone a catastrophic one as Zhavoronkov describes it.      ""Bitcoin today already suffers from the situation described by that PDF, and Taproot improves the situation on balance,"" Belcher said.    Taproot: A privacy improvement    Further disagreeing with Zhavoronkov, the developers CoinDesk contacted argued the long-term benefits of Taproot far outweigh Zhavoronkov's concerns.      The privacy benefit Taproot brings is actually supposed to be the opposite of what Zhavoronkov describes. With Taproot, Bitcoin users will be able to use different ways of locking up their coins ""without being able to be distinguished from each other,"" as Belcher put it. For example, a transaction used to set up a Lightning channel can be made to look just like a regular bitcoin transaction.      Belcher recently posted a thread on Twitter exploring in more granular detail the ways Taproot will benefit Bitcoin privacy in the long term.      ""Taproot is a huge positive for privacy and it should be added to Bitcoin as soon as is safely possible,"" Belcher said, later adding that ""this glossy and charismatic, but dishonest, PDF is an attempt to reduce the privacy of Bitcoin.""      Bitcoin developer Lloyd Fournier, who earned a grant from Square Crypto earlier this year, also noted that Taproot transactions are cheaper (contrary to what Zhavoronov said) so users will have an extra incentive to adopt them.  ""The immense individual and community effort that went into the specification and engineering around Taproot aims to improve Bitcoin over the coming years and decades. The author's emphasis on very narrow short-term concerns seems to be misaligned with the long-term flourishing of Bitcoin,"" he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | WALLET | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/01/privacy-concerns-over-bitcoin-upgrade-taproot-are-a-non-issue-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad05187e5bc041aede293f8e9cd422111ce11b1a-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433269,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Hth,1606859402,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Falls to $18.1K as Correlation to Ether Picks Up,"The price of bitcoin took a bit of a dip, though overall market sentiment remains bullish. Ether’s correlation to bitcoin is going up despite differences in value propositions.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $19,077 as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET). Slipping 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,171-$19,920  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bullish trending signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin was able to hit as high as $19,920, according to CoinDesk 20 data, before momentum stalled. Traders began hitting the sell button, taking the price to as low as $18,171 before it recovered. It was at $19,123.70 as of press time.      Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, sees $19,511 as a “resistance” level, a price point the world’s oldest cryptocurrency can break through in this time of highly bullish sentiment. “An eventual breakout appears likely from a momentum perspective,” she said, noting that $19,511 “is not a strong resistance level – $20,000 is a psychological hurdle, much like Dow 30,000.”      As for equities, Tuesday was green across major market indexes.    Asia’s Nikkei 225 ended the day up 1.3% as traders expressed optimism a vaccine from several drug manufacturers will hit the market in the near term.  The FTSE 100 in Europe was on the plus side by 1.9% as retail stocks boosted the index on news a few major retail chains may dissolve, with potential survivors making gains.  In the United States the S&P climbed 1.1% as optimism regarding potential economic stimulus helped to bolster the index.    A positive performance out of stocks often means bitcoin’s price will trend upward, but Tuesday’s sideways activity again reiterates how volatile the crypto markets can be. In turn, that raises questions about a major narrative regarding bitcoin’s role.      Read More: Coinbase Brokered MicroStrategy’s $425M Bitcoin Purchase, Exchange Says      “Expect additional short-term volatility, although intermediate- and long-term momentum are strongly positive,” Fairlead’s Stockton said. Thus, when looking at bitcoin’s volatility versus popular traditional assets, the store of value thesis may not be as strong as many believe as volatility is trending up versus other investments.      However, the narrative that bitcoin serves an important purpose in uncertain times still holds for a large swath of the market.      “It is being used as a hedge against inflation that will come from global monetary easing as a result of COVID-19,” said Midori Kanemitsu, a market analyst at cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer.      Some of this increased volatility may simply be because investors are participating in profit-taking at these lofty levels, said Andrew Tu, an executive for quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “Currently, there is less stablecoin inflow into exchanges and more bitcoin inflow into exchanges, which suggests less buying pressure for bitcoin for the very near future,” Tu told CoinDesk.      Analysts are also keeping an eye on ether. The all-time high for the native currency of the Ethereum network is over $1,400 and many think the cryptocurrency is a good buy in this bull market.      “I think ETH is still undervalued versus BTC,” noted George Clayton, managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital. “All this DeFi (decentralized finance) going on is showing the utility of smart contract protocols.”    Is bitcoin leading ether?    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday, trading around $596 and slipping 2% in 24 hours as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET).      Over the past several days, ether has mirrored bitcoin’s price rise closely.      The correlation between bitcoin and ether is also trending upward, though is lower than it was after the March market meltdown.      The fact the two cryptocurrencies are increasingly trading in tandem belies the fact that Ethereum’s 2.0 Beacon Chain launch clearly differentiates some of its use case aspects. While bitcoin’s “store of value” narrative continues to be a strong signal coming from industry analysts, the “programmable money” thesis of Ethereum doesn’t seem to be making the market asset perform based on its own fundamentals – yet.      Read More: Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain Goes Live as ‘World Computer’ Begins Overhaul      “Both assets have definitely seen a [U.S. dollar]-priced upswing, and though BTC has been the one to have a lot of recent news around its proximity to all time highs, Ethereum has been the real star of the summer of DeFi and into the fall compared to BTC,” noted John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritium. “I believe that as confidence in 2.0 with some operating history and broader investor understanding of the economic implications to the valuation of ETH spreads, we will see a bull run in ETH,” he added.

42433270,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Hph,1606853781,Missed the Bitcoin Rally? Here’s a Low-Risk Strategy to Ride the Bull Market,"Bitcoin has come a long way since bottoming out below $4,000 in March. The cryptocurrency clocked a record high above $19,900 early Tuesday and is up nearly 170% this year.      While institutional participation has increased, a large part of the retail crowd may have stayed away from the market. For that group, the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the opportunity to make triple-digit gains may have set in over the past few weeks.      Yet, investing now while the cryptocurrency is trading near lifetime highs may seem risky because there is always a possibility of significant price pullback. Bitcoin has seen several pullbacks of over 20% during the previous bull markets.      As such, investors looking to buy bitcoin now should consider implementing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, according to leading traders in the cryptocurrency space.      ""It is a good way to build exposure to both bitcoin as well as other asset classes such as global equity indices, as both look set to perform well against a backdrop of negative real rates for the next few years,"" Scott Weatherill, chief dealer at the over-the-counter liquidity provider B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk.    How dollar-cost averaging saves money    DCA, also known as the constant dollar plan, involves buying smaller amounts of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of price gyrations, instead of investing the entire amount at one time. The strategy helps investors take the emotion out of their trades and can result in a lower average purchase cost because markets seldom move higher without pullbacks.      Read more: 5 Reasons Why Bitcoin Just Hit an All-Time High Price      ""Dollar-cost averaging in bitcoin has historically been a very profitable strategy that lowers drawdown risk,"" Weatherill said.      To illustrate, let's say an investor has been accumulating $100 worth of bitcoin at the highest price observed on the 17th of every month, starting from Dec. 17, 2017, when bitcoin peaked at $19,783. As of press time, that investor would own roughly 0.48 BTC at an average cost of around $8,660. It also means the investor would be making a nearly 120% gain at the current market price of $18,850.      However, if the investor made a lump-sum investment at the record price of $19,783 on Dec. 17, 2017, the investment would currently suffer a loss of 4.7%. Over a long period, that loss could be more significant when adjusted for inflation.      In the former case, the investor spread out $3,600 over 36 months, buying fewer bitcoin when prices were high and more when prices were low. That helped pull down the average cost and bring in a substantial gain. The strategy has delivered similar results during the previous bull-bear cycles.      ""Ideally, one must invest with a hope of selling at higher prices in the long run,"" Chris Thomas, head of products at Swissquote Bank, said. ""The best way, in my opinion, is to buy each month and build up a position over the longer term.""    The risk of certain option strategies for retail traders    Some investors may think of implementing synthetic strategies through the options market, such as buying a put option against a long position in the spot market. The put would gain value in the event of a sell-off, mitigating the loss (on paper) in the long spot market position.      Yet, such strategies are more suitable for speculators who intend to profit from short-term price volatility and go against the idea of pulling down the average purchase cost via DCA. ""I wouldn't recommend buying puts if you are 'DCAing,' as it would crimp returns,"" Weatherill said.      A put option is a derivative contract that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy.      An option buyer needs to pay a premium upfront while taking a long call/put position. A long put position makes money only if the asset settles below the put’s strike price on the day of expiry. Otherwise, the option expires worthless, causing a loss – in this case, the premium paid – for the buyer.      Read more: Bitcoin Price Sets New Record High of $19,850      What’s more, those trying to combine DCA with an options hedge may end up hurting their portfolios. For example, if an investor buys puts while DCAing and the market goes up, the options bought to hedge against a potential downturn would bleed money, crimping overall returns from dollar-cost averaging.      ""Retail investors should stay away from options trading,"" warned Thomas. He added that one particular strategy, selling out-of-the-money calls, is extremely dangerous.      Savvy traders often generate additional income by selling call options well above bitcoin's current spot price and collecting premiums on hopes the market wouldn't rally above the level at which the bullish bet is sold. However, with short call positions, holders can theoretically suffer unlimited loss because the sky's the limit for any asset.      In the case of bitcoin, that's particularly risky as sentiment remains bullish, with analysts expecting a continued bull run on increased institutional demand. As such, selling call option(s) while DCAing could prove costly.      ""While there may be a temptation to optimize through various trading strategies, the new money should stick to sure strategies: 1) stay long, and 2) buy dips,"" said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic Capital.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/01/missed-the-bitcoin-rally-heres-a-low-risk-strategy-to-ride-the-bull-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7aaa08739acb571731e325d8b62cd8ecfc0c5c9-1920x1893.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Per a blog post authored by Yearn Finance creator Andre Cronje, the so-called decentralized finance protocol may fuse with SushiSwap, another automated market maker (AMM) that forked from UniSwap.      In addition to combining technical features for market infrastructure, the merger would, among other things, combine both markets’ total value locked (TLV, a measure of the total assets deposited in these lending markets) into a single lending pool. Both protocols would also share developer resources and hold each other’s tokens in their treasuries, per the agreement.

(Per DeFi Pulse data at the time of writing, SushiSwap’s TVL is $732 million while Yearn’s is $440 million).    Yearn and SushiSwap: An 'aggressive synergy'    Cronje has spoken with SushiSwap’s de facto leader, a pseudonymous programmer named 0xMaki, about the merger, but Yearn and Sushi token holders from both communities will have to vote on the proposal to make it official.      In his post, Cronje called the move one of Yearn’s “more aggressive synergies.”      “As Sushi focused on expanding their AMM ecosystem, and as Yearn focused on expanding their strategies, more and more overlap became apparent. Yearn needed custom AMM experiences for their strategies, and Sushi started pushing the boundaries of yield and money markets,” Cronje writes in the post.      “With these overlaps, more and more work started to become mutualistic, and at this point it takes the relationship to the next level.”      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment      On SushiSwap’s Discord channel, the news was mostly well received by the protocol’s users.

42433252,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4HRh,1606845204,Why Europe Bests the US at Attracting Crypto Startups,"For years lawyers have warned of the risks associated with running a cryptocurrency business in the United States, especially when a token is involved. Regrettably, those risks are more apparent than ever.      As New York- and Austrian-licensed attorneys, we've talked countless clients out of publicly selling tokens in the U.S. or generally pursuing their businesses there. We've personally witnessed one of our European clients – a small fish by anyone's account – fall victim to U.S. regulators' zeal to shape the law through enforcement, presumably to establish precedent to go after bigger and badder actors in the distant future.    Bryan Hollmann is of counsel at Stadler Völkel Attorneys at Law, a technology-focused law firm in Vienna, Austria. Oliver Völkel is a founding partner at the same firm.    The saying ""the gears of justice turn slowly"" is particularly true for U.S. regulators, who just this year have secured important court rulings against companies that sold tokens in 2017 and 2018. One thing is clear: Token issuers in 2020 and beyond cannot ignore U.S. securities laws without risking severe fines and litigation many years down the road.      Fortunately, the U.S. is not the only market in the world where companies can raise capital by selling tokens. We agree with U.S. lawyer Preston J. Byrne, who remarked in a CoinDesk opinion piece:      ""It is also true that there are, without a doubt, countries in the world that do countenance token offerings. Go there. U.S. securities laws are not meant to restrict the sale of tokens in those places."" (emphasis added)    New token sales    The European Union is one of the hottest regions in the world in terms of raising capital through token offerings, according to ICO Watchlist. And, as more and more companies choose to put the United States on the list of banned jurisdictions alongside countries like Afghanistan, North Korea and Syria, the EU is bound to become even more popular.      In the last year, European-based projects like Polkadot (Switzerland) and Bitpanda (Austria) have sold tokens worth millions of euros through initial coin (ICO) or initial exchange (IEO) offerings. Leading blockchain projects such as Ethereum and MakerDAO are supported by Swiss foundations, and up-and-coming players like Bitpanda and Morpher (both of which are clients of the authors) are Austrian companies that have concluded financing rounds with prominent U.S. venture capital firms while maintaining their headquarters in Europe. On top of that, Bitpanda raised EUR 43.6 million in 2019 by selling BEST tokens. Morpher's public sale of its own MPH token is currently underway.      See also: EU Proposes Full Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrencies      There are good legal reasons why companies are attracted to Europe. For starters, there is no Howey Test, which in 2018 led Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to declare that ""every ICO [he's] seen is a security."" Most European regulators, particularly those in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), distinguish security tokens and payment tokens from utility tokens and acknowledge that utility tokens, for the most part, are not subject to financial services or capital markets regulations.      Unlike in the U.S., European regulators simply do not have a history of cracking down on token issuers. And token issuers are far less likely to get bogged down in private litigation in Europe than in the U.S.    Differing regulatory approaches    These differing regulatory approaches to token offerings can be attributed to historical financing methods used by companies in Europe and the U.S. as well as their distinct legal systems. In the U.S., equity offerings are still much more common than in continental Europe, where debt financing remains to a large extent the prerogative of banks and large financial institutions.    If the present is any indication, our bet is on Europe having the upper hand.    Europe does not have as long a tradition of capital markets exposure as the U.S., and while European capital markets regulation was heavily influenced by the U.S., the need to harmonize the definition of “transferable securities” among the EU member states prevented the EU from employing the Howey Test outright when adopting the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive in 2004. In our personal experience, the constraints of the civil law tradition in continental Europe as opposed to the common law systems of the U.S. and the U.K. also prevent national regulators from introducing a Howey-like test via enforcement proceedings anytime soon, despite efforts to do so particularly with regard to token sales.      In contrast to the U.S., the EU has made significant progress in codifying regulations governing token sales. On Sept. 24, 2020, the European Commission published a draft Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA), which establishes a disclosure regime for token sales, and lays the foundation for stablecoin issuers and cryptocurrency service providers to securely operate within the EU. The regulation is expected to enter into force in all EU member states by the end of 2022.      Once adopted, the legal framework will provide legal certainty for token issuers and will help establish Europe as the go-to jurisdiction for crypto businesses. Time will tell how the divergent regulatory approaches in Europe and the U.S. will shape the crypto industry going forward. If the present is any indication, our bet is on Europe having the upper hand.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,"Bryan Hollmann, Oliver Volkel",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/01/why-europe-bests-the-us-at-attracting-crypto-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/038e2bc0aea88332a94726261ab4b4de07d9e09c-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Libra ""seizes the day"" and rebrands to Diem. Google searches for ""bitcoin"" have doubled since last month.    Top shelf    Coinbase <> MicroStrategy MicroStrategy has revealed Coinbase as the platform that executed its $425 million BTC buy that thrust MicroStrategy into the spotlight of the bitcoin community. Announced Tuesday, Coinbase revealed MicroStrategy’s initial $250 million investment, which occurred over a five-day period in August, came via Coinbase Prime, the exchange’s crypto brokerage arm formed following the acquisition of Tagomi in May. That was followed in September by a further $175 million investment. MicroStrategy is regarded as the first publicly listed firm to convert a portion of its cash reserves into crypto.      Retail interest? Google searches for “bitcoin,” an imperfect measurement of popular interest in crypto, are at its highest level since June 2019. Google Trends data shows searches are twice the value from last month. Bitcoin set a new record high of $19,850 on Monday, having narrowly missed the previous lifetime high of $19,783 last week. The cryptocurrency surged over 40% in November to register its biggest monthly gain since May 2019. However, the market is far from being in a state of retail frenzy seen in December 2017, when the google search for the term “bitcoin price” peaked. The data may validate analysts who say this year’s rally is mainly driven by increased institutional participation.      Identity acquired An identity management provider backed by PayPal (PYPL), Foxconn and others has been acquired, for an undisclosed sum, by Nevada-based holding company Blockchains LLC. Announced Tuesday, the acquisition precedes the release of an un-hosted wallet expected in April, said Blockchains Executive Vice President Lee Weiss. “We reached out to Cambridge and had discussions with them, and it was clear that we shared a common ethos,” said Weiss. “We ended up making a deal and the transaction closed last week.” Cambridge Blockchain principals Matthew Commons, Alex Oberhauser, Muthu Arumugam and the firm’s software developers will join Blockchains’ digital identity team.      Bitcoin rewards BlockFi will launch a bitcoin credit card for users to spend fiat and be rewarded in crypto, in Q1 2021, according to CEO Zac Prince. In a market saturated with bitcoin reward debit cards, BlockFi’s option allows people to earn yield on their bitcoin holdings through consumer spending, without having to spend their crypto. Visa is acting as the card-issuing network, Evolve Bank & Trust provides the Bank Identification Number (BIN) that allows BlockFi to connect to the payments network and Deserve is managing the payments flow technology. The rewards back are 1.5% of fiat purchases, and the bitcoin users receive is deposited into their BlockFi accounts. The annual fee for the card is $200.      Seize the Diem The Libra Association, a 27-member organization shepherding development of a global stablecoin that could launch yesterday, is rebranding to Diem. The effort is seemingly an attempt to distance itself from the original Facebook-led Libra project, which promised a multiple-asset backed stablecoin but was pilloried by financial regulators the world over. Diem has also shaped its leadership team, and reaffirmed that a pared-back version of libra, now diem dollar, will meet the approval of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Diem CEO Stuart Levey said the blockchain-based project is ready to launch at a technical level.

At stake    Eth 2.0 The development of Ethereum 2.0 passed a major milestone today, as the proof-of-stake blockchain’s skeletal system rises. At 12:00 UTC Tuesday, the Beacon Chain, the backbone of an entirely new scalable blockchain, went live.      Ethereum 2.0 intends to solve the intractable problems of scalability that plagued the first generation general purpose blockchain, now worth some $70 billion.      By shifting to proof-of-stake consensus, rather than proof-of-work pioneered by Bitcoin, and introducing a host of other cryptographic solutions, Ethereum 2.0 aims to outcompete payments networks like PayPal and Visa, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.      The multi-year Ethereum upgrade began in 2015, though went full throttle this year. Today’s launch concludes “phase 0,” of Ethereum’s consensus mechanism transition.      Despite chronic throughput issues and high fees, Ethereum’s call to become “the world computer” has already attracted the most amount of committed blockchain developers. Eth 2.0 is seemingly no different in terms of community involvement.      “The launch of the #Eth2 Beacon Chain is characteristic of the emergent, open-source ethos that attracts so many to Ethereum in the first place. More than 27,000 validators from around the globe are now participating in the new #Eth2 consensus model,” founder of the Ethereum incubator, ConsenSys' Joseph Lubin, tweeted.      “The launch of the Beacon Chain is a huge accomplishment and lays the foundation for Ethereum’s more scalable, secure, and sustainable home,” Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan told Foxley in an email. “There is still much work to do, but today we celebrate.”      As Ryan noted, development is far from over. Chief among the technical challenges Eth 2.0 devs must mount is breaking the PoS Ethereum blockchain into multiple datasets called “shards” and adopting Rollups, a throughput solution for decentralized applications.

Shared exclusively with CoinDesk, the Winklevoss’ Gemini cryptocurrency exchange is donating $50,000 to the Human Rights Foundation to fund “open source software which [improves] the privacy, usability, and resilience of the Bitcoin Network.”      The fresh funding comes on the same day the Human Rights Foundation is announcing its sponsorship of yet another developer, Gloria Zhao. An undergrad at UC Berkeley and president of Blockchain at Berkley, Zhao contributes to Bitcoin Core and is working on a project that would improve how “grouped” transactions are relayed. This advancement would, among other things, help with opening and closing payment channels on the Lightning Network.      Zhao’s grant comes from the third round of the Human Rights Foundation’s funding. Its first grant this summer went to U.K. Bitcoin developer Chris Belcher for work on the privacy-improving Coinswap protocol.      A second round went to Evan Kaloudis for work on Zeus, a Bitcoin wallet with a full-node interface; Fontaine, the pseudonymous developer behind Fully Noded, another Bitcoin full-node and wallet software; and Openoms, a pseudonymous developer who is working on an easy-to-use interface for JoinMarket, a privacy tool for mixing Bitcoin transactions.    Cryptocurrency exchanges supporting Bitcoin developers    The new funding from Gemini will go towards a new crop of sponsored developers in Q1 of 2021. Human Rights Foundation Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein told CoinDesk that the foundation has already received many proposals and expects more to come.      Adding to an increasing trend where crypto businesses will donate money to fund Bitcoin protocol development, Gemini joins a growing list of cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Bitmex, OKCoin, Kraken, and Square Crypto, which have sponsored Bitcoin developers.

42433253,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4HPh,1606844645,Ruble or Rubble? Russian Institutions Have Concerns About Proposed CBDC,"Russia is seriously considering whether or not it should launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The Bank of Russia has started a series of consultations dedicated to the potential launch of the digital ruble, a CBDC pegged to the Russian ruble. The central bank has not yet decided if it wants to actually launch the project, but it is gathering feedback from would-be participants and users of the new payment system.      The regulator engaged representatives of several banks and other financial institutions via a Zoom conference on Monday. The overall tone of the conversation was cheerful, with many participants saying they are looking forward to piloting the digital ruble. However, several people hinted they are concerned about certain features of the project.    Sberbank’s alternative    Sberbank (recently re-branded as Sber) is the country’s largest retail bank and an active explorer of blockchain tech. Sber Chair German Gref announced Monday the company is looking into launching its own digital token, as well as a platform for trading digital assets.      The Bank of Russia, however, will not allow any other token to become a payment instrument in the Russian economy – just as no cryptocurrencies can be used for payments in Russia under a new law coming into force in January.      “We will prevent issuance of any new payment tools. If there is a need of a crypto asset for the functionality [of a financial platform], the crypto ruble will be that asset,” said Sergey Shvetsov, deputy chair of the Bank of Russia, during the Zoom conference.      Read more: Digital Ruble Could Be Tool Against Sanctions, Bank of Russia Says      Sberbank Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov voiced concerns about launching the digital ruble as a totally centralized system, where the Bank of Russia would manage users accounts. In this case, retail banks in Russia would have to compete with the regulator for customers.      “That would juxtapose banks and the Bank of Russia, and instead of the further development we’ll have a competition,” Popov said. “It would be a centralized system. This is the concern.""      Shvetsov agreed there indeed would be competition because the digital ruble would be a third form of money in Russia, not a replacement for cash or electronic payments.      “Payments with the digital ruble will be competing with electronic payments, and both will be developing in parallel,” Shvetsov said. He added that retail banks will still have some advantage in this race as they can offer interest on deposits, while the digital ruble will not have such features.    Searching for the model    To be sure, the exact design of the digital ruble has not been determined, and the Bank of Russia’s report offers several models for discussion, each with different approaches to centralization and the role of retail banks.      In one possible scenario, banks will open accounts for their clients using the Bank of Russia's platform, said Deputy Chairwoman Olga Skorobogatova.      “This will alow you to keep the existing client base and will also stimulate competition. We’re going to do a hybrid model,” she said.      In any case, the regulator apparently favors the model in which it will be managing the digital ruble accounts in a centralized way. Sber, on the contrary, suggested the banks should work as intermediaries, converting their clients' balances into the digital ruble.      Read more: Bank of Russia Fields Banking Industry Concerns Over Digital Ruble Proposal      Shvetsov showed a presentation outlining Sber’s concept of how the digital ruble should work. One of the key features he mentioned was the ability to “color” digital rubles according to permitted spending options. For example, if parents give their child money for lunch at school, the child wouldn't be able to cash them out or spend the funds on cigarettes.      The Bank of Russia disagreed with that, too. Although the regulator’s concept includes the “coloring” feature, making digital rubles less liquid is not something the regulator would support. It’s not seeking to limit users' ability to cash out the digital rubles or convert them it into balances on bank accounts, Shvetsov said.      “The kid would buy the cigarettes anyway. We both know it, right?” he joked.    The cost of innovation    Another concern mentioned in the conversation was the potential financial burden for Russia’s financial institutions.      Roman Goryunov, the president of RTS (the association of Russian stock market operators), said that if market participants had to foot the bill for integrating the digital ruble into the economy, “it would be not a very good story.”      In the meantime, the financial incentive overall is not very clear, Goryunov said: “If we are applying all the existing regulations [to the digital ruble payments], it’s not clear why the transactions will become cheaper. We need either to change the regulation and eliminate some of the requirements, or we’ll have to artificially cut the commission fees, just to show that [the new system] is cheaper.”      Shvetsov indicated that these intermediary fees are not a part of the plan.      “The users will access their [digital ruble] accounts via the intermediaries, which will be competing for it,” he said, adding that the banks, obviously will try to keep their clients “by all means.”      Read more: Digital Ruble ‘Promising,’ Pilot Likely in 2021, Says Bank of Russia Chief      The Bank of Russia’s approach will potentially cause many banks to shut down, warned Vladislav Kochetkov, head of the investment firm FINAM. Competition with the central bank will put the retail banks at disadvantage, as people would see a central bank option as a less risky way to store their money, he said, adding:      “It’s important that the innovation does not have too big of a cost for the entire market.”      The Bank of Russia talked to some of the banks and payment processors on Nov. 27, and, according to the Russian newspaper Kommersant, that was a second meeting on the issue. The regulator will accumulate feedback on its digital ruble report until Dec. 31, and then decide if it should be launched. If given a green light, the first pilot might take place at the end of next year.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/01/ruble-or-rubble-russian-institutions-have-concerns-about-proposed-cbdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09eed0153b888d29a0935a6f02323be9839c93fb-1200x868.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433255,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4HVh,1606840613,Hive Reports $7.4M Q2 Profit as Lower Costs More Than Offset ‘Big Spend’ on Expansion,"Publicly traded mining company Hive Blockchain (HVBTF)https://hashrateindex.com/stocks/hive-cv reported a Q2 profit even as the firm continued its “big spend” on upgrading its mining facilities.    Hive took in $13 million in quarterly mining revenue, according to its Q2 earnings report Tuesday, 8% up from the year-ago period's $12 million.      The company posted a profit of $7.4 million, a significant increase from its $1.8 million loss in the same period last year. Gross mining margin expanded to $9.2 million, or a $0.03 profit per share, up from a $11.5 million loss, or a $0.04 loss per share.      ""We've been able to drive down costs, which has led to the highest cash flow in any one quarter since Hive went public three years ago.,"" said Frank Holmes, interim executive chairman. Cash flow was $10.6 million, up from a loss of $4.6 a year earlier.      As one of the largest ether mining firms, Hive noted a year-over-year decrease in bitcoin mining due to ending prior cloud mining agreements, which became unprofitable. The firm has significantly increased its mining capacity, however, and has used ether mining profit margins to enable “acquisition and initial scaling” of new bitcoin mining operations.      The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has “delayed the ability to acquire and deploy” its new bitcoin mining operations, Hollmes said on the firm’s earnings call. But the firm maintains its goal of 1,000 petahashes per second (PH/s) “in the future,” Holmes said.      Shares of the Vancouver-based company have outperformed ether's year-to-date returns by 880 percentage points. Hive over-the-counter traded shares have gained over 1,200% year to date and were near $1.22 at last check.      The firm’s predominant focus on ether mining represents its bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency relative to bitcoin. “We think ether is going to do a big catch-up to bitcoin on a relative basis,” Holmes told investors.      “There’s been a big spend this quarter on upgrading all of our facilities,” Holmes said, adding that the process still has “a long way to go”. By the end of January 2021, he said he expects Hive to have fully upgraded from 4GB GPU mining chips to 8GB chips and “become an even larger player” in the ethereum mining sector.      Beyond its mining capacity, Holmes reiterated his view that the firm serves as “a proxy for people who are reluctant to use a cryptocurrency exchange or set up their own wallet and buy cryptocurrency.”      The dollar value of Hive’s cryptocurrency earnings grew to $10.7 million, up nearly 50% from $7.2 million during the same period last year. Chief Financial Officer Darcy Daubaras told investors that Hive “likes to maintain an inventory of coins” but the company is selling current production to fund its ongoing operational upgrades.      “We have had to accelerate the sale of coins a little bit to fund the upgrades of GPU mining chips,” Daubaras said. “But we feel it’s important to maintain a good inventory of bitcoin and ethereum.”      Update (Dec. 1, 22:03 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify Hive's 2019 reported financial information.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/01/hive-reports-74m-q2-profit-as-lower-costs-more-than-offset-big-spend-on-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e79fcda4fbbef8eb51c7e8e24f05270878370844-854x595.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4HNh,1606838275,"Banks Need to Adopt Crypto, Now","This year, crypto adoption in mainstream fintech has accelerated sharply. PayPal (PYPL), Revolut and Square (SQ) made much discussed moves. Recently, AllianceBernstein, a highly respected independent research house, published a report stating it has “changed their mind about the role of bitcoin in asset allocation.” And Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer, went on record on CNBC the other day to say that “bitcoin could replace gold.”      The crypto industry is prone to announcements about future announcements. In 2016, these announcements used to be “blockchain” proofs of concepts that were never intended to see the light of day. And in 2020, these could just turn out to involve banks paying lip service to crypto to look innovative and avant garde.    Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the crypto co-host of the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a fintech partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice.    But, while crypto believers like me have a tendency to selectively hang on to the positive parts of these announcements, institutional endorsements of crypto are not insignificant. At a minimum, it’s clear that most major investment banks are now covering bitcoin for their clients and a large number of corporate and retail banks are furiously exploring how they can take advantage of the commercial opportunity presented by this level of retail and institutional interest in crypto.      On a recent Citi Digi Money client podcast, Citibank Research’s Ronit Ghose asked me if crypto is finally going mainstream and if it’s time for banks to adopt crypto. While I don’t have access to the original recording or transcript, I have tried to summarize my analysis here.    The future of money    The fundamental question regulators and banks need to ask is not whether bitcoin will go to $50K or $500K or whether the U.S. dollar will crash next week. It’s ""what will payments and investments look like in the future?"" How will consumers experience ""money"" and how will such a system of money and finance be governed and supervised?      As my good friend David Birch has highlighted in his brilliant book, “The Currency Cold War,” the future of money will be built not with cards, SWIFT messages and interchange fees, but with programmable tokens, networked services and intelligent wallets.    Banks have a steep learning curve to climb and crypto and DeFi provides precisely that learning curve today    To state his case in my own examples: If my son wants to pay for digital goods on his Xbox, my wallet will automatically use Fortnite V-Bucks. If I am paying for groceries, the mobile wallet will automatically select Tesco reward points accumulating tokens. A JPMorgan equity token will automatically send me the dividend as Britcoin (GBP) on schedule and DalioCoin held in my neighbors’ trust fund will automatically be locked until an edtech oracle attests that their privileged child has safely landed at Harvard, at which point the token will start releasing FedCoin for his or her socials and boat rides, no questions asked.      This synthesis of crypto and the mainstream financial system towards this future of money is what we all must keep our eyes on. That is the big picture.      To get there, banks have a steep learning curve to climb and crypto and DeFi provides precisely that learning curve today. Banks that jump atop the crypto train will find untold prosperity in the digital frontier, and banks that fear of the unfamiliar will be lost forever in the wilderness. Resistance is futile and the time for doing nothing with crypto was two years ago, not today.      Let’s dive further into how the world of money is changing today and what it means for banks.    Crypto has found real world utility    Critics still say that crypto has no utility other than speculation. I don’t know if bulls**t is a printable word, but that is indeed what that criticism is. There are at last four distinct use cases we can identify in the real world.      First, if we look at economies like Nigeria where central banks are unable to provide sufficient dollar liquidity to small and medium businesses, such trade is often facilitated by bitcoin. In effect, bitcoin has partially displaced the U.S. dollar as the currency of foreign trade and unless there’s digital dollar liquidity made available without the current tyranny of geopolitical sanctions, the digital yuan will likely do so completely in the future. This thesis deserves an entire article of its own and I will take the subject on in the near future.      Second, in countries like Argentina or Lebanon, where there is no social security net and the domestic currency is highly unstable, bitcoin has provided a “digital money mattress” for hundreds of thousands of consumers. This is a real, humanitarian use case that can be difficult for Western Europeans or Americans to relate to.      The third use case is exchange of value among internet-based communities or what I call “Burning Man Money.” Historically we have built money for a world that’s geographically divided but that's not the word we live in anymore. Around two billion people live in internet-based communities that require internet-based money to exchange value. Often these digital natives interact with their internet friends on the other side of the planet much more often than they interact with their next-door neighbors. Gamers understand this use case better than anyone and the rest of us are increasingly beginning to.      The fourth and most important use case is decentralized, internet-based finance. Measured even by a blunt metric like TVL (total value of crypto assets deposited), DeFi is now a $15 billion economy growing rapidly month on month. This is the main reason banks need to integrate crypto – to learn and prepare for rapid disruption. DeFi is integral to the future of money in that DeFi replaces fire-walled financial services that use fire-walled money with networked financial services that use networked internet money. Those who understand the internet understand what this means.    Regulators have shifted    When it comes to regulation, we are not in 2019 anymore. The education and advocacy work we did as a community between 2015 and 2019 has helped regulators see both the inevitability and the economic benefits of internet based money and finance.      I categorize regulators in three overlapping buckets. First, there are regulators that tend to offer a knee-jerk reaction to crypto and say, ""This is not money we understand, this is not money to be controlled, so we have to shut it all down.” These regulators actually try to enforce draconian regulations with little nuance or discretion.      The second and most common bucket is the regulators who are afraid of the uncertainty created by technology led disruption, but they recognize that there is a genuine consumer need for decentralised internet-based money. For example, regulators in Nigeria, India and China have made strict pronouncements to protect consumers from scammers like PlusToken and OneCoin while rarely enforcing the rules against businesses built on decentralized assets like bitcoin or ethereum.      The third bucket is forward-thinking regulators who understand that crypto innovation is a source of competitive advantage for the financial system they are supervising. Literally every regulatory body I have interacted with over the years has at least one or two forward-looking visionaries like the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Brian Brooks, who have been engaging proactively with the industry to create a safe environment for crypto innovation to deliver consumer benefit.    Regulators are competing for innovation    Unlike the neolithic payments systems of the U.S., the European Union and India have shown that instant and free domestic payment systems like SEPA and UPI can be made to work well with existing technologies and frameworks. However, point-of-sale experiences remain firmly stuck in plastic and interchange fees and cross border payments remain a profound embarrassment for the entire global financial system.      In Europe, we have tried to solve these problems by creating a rule, committee or think tank. Initiatives such as the EU-wide Payments System Directive 2 have been delayed or thwarted by legacy institutions often on account of somewhat valid cybersecurity and fraud related concerns.      In the middle of all this analysis-paralysis, there’s stiff competition for innovation. While the West tries to regulate, the East continues to innovate. On their own, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may not have been enough of a wake-up call for Western regulators. But China’s central bank digital currency, i.e., the DCEP (or Digital Currency and Electronic Payments) system has forced the issue on digital money. U.S. and European regulators recognize that if the future of money is Chinese, then China will be the power that dominates trade and military power.      See also: Money Reimagined - Understanding China’s Fast-Approaching Digital Yuan      China’s DCEP is a particularly interesting case because earlier this year U.S. sanctions practically debilitated Huawei. As a result, China recognizes it can no longer rely on an international system of money controlled by the U.S. or a domestic system of money controlled by Tencent and Ant Financial. Where does that leave a political system where the government is supposed to control everything? If it doesn't control the money, it doesn't control the payments, it does not have access to transactions. China’s DCEP is not an experiment; it’s imperative.      Now that the China fintech FOMO trumps crypto FUD, regulators are taking a very different approach to crypto. The regulators are saying, ""Look, if this thing is going to happen anyways, then we might as well bring it into a banking framework and regulation as opposed to saying, let's keep this crypto thing out into an unregulated sector of money."" This is why the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe recently pronounced that “it is not the job of the regulators to protect banks against digital currencies.” He will ultimately prove to be the first of the many to say central bankers that out loud.    No one’s money    So whose money will we use as a settlement currency in a bipolar, or even multipolar, world? China’s money or America’s money? Odds are that we will need money that’s controlled by neither. That money is crypto.      Bitcoin was originally built to serve as peer-to-peer electronic cash, but bitcoin is not cash because it's not fungible. Further, bitcoin needs layer 2 solutions to process large-scale, internet-based payments. Banks and payments companies can help solve this challenge. If I want to move my bitcoin or pivot in a closed loop system where my bitcoin addresses are in two addresses within the same entity database, like PayPal, that you don't necessarily need to move money across a blockchain, you can settle on a blockchain on a deferred basis. This way, Bitcoin or Ethereum can enable a cross-border, global settlement layer that allows cross-border transactions using digital assets that no sovereign state or private company controls. This trustless settlement layer is a necessity of a bipolar world where the U.S. dollar is no longer acceptable to other powers, e.g., China, as the only settlement currency.    Crypto is the gateway    Fortunately, in the West, we still have free-ish markets where consumers and entrepreneurs do not wait for rule-making to make the world a better place. Crypto is changing as well. Crypto started with this vision of no credit, no debt. Some bitcoin maximalists naively believed that everyone was going to live off of bearer assets, but credit is fundamental to society and money. So crypto exchanges and firms like BlockFi ended up creating lending experiences that are not so different from the experience of fiat money-based services we receive from intermediaries today but they are a start.    This synthesis of crypto and the mainstream financial system towards this future of money is what we all must keep our eyes on.    Like the rest of fintech, DeFi is not new finance. It’s a preview of the future of finance as the future of money is realized. Unlike fintechs who have been busy launching wooden and metal cards, the once ignored crypto fringe has moved rapidly towards programmable money tokens. More recently, intelligent agents like Yearn Finance, Aave and Nexus Mutual have started building financial intelligence, banking functions and complex claims directly into such tokens. At the same time, wallet providers like Coinbase, Metamask and Argent have started to enable access to sophisticated functionality provided by DeFi services. In a few years when the technology has evolved further and risk frameworks governing these decentralized protocols have matured, the 100x better experiences provided by DeFi will make it impossible for legacy systems to compete for consumer engagement or share of wallet.      That is the future of money and it's happening right here, right now. Forced by customer demand for crypto, this is the future of money towards which Square's Cash App, PayPal and Revolut have already taken the first step. If banks want to take their eyes off of this Napster movement, they will go exactly where Columbia Records and Blockbuster video went eventually – into profound irrelevance. Resistance is futile but it’s a choice, not destiny.    Where should banks start?    The key for banks is experiential learning. They should start immediately by licensing technology and services from crypto custodians and offering digital wallets that provide integrated access to crypto and fiat money. This is something that Revolut has done particularly well using partnerships with custodians and exchanges. It's not hard for banks to copy quite quickly subject to regulatory permissions and compliance approvals which can take time. This is like providing a locker for digital gold in the same way that banks provide lockers for jewelry and property papers today, just that these are going digital, starting with digital gold, i.e., bitcoin.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - Bitcoin Is Good for PayPal, but Is PayPal Good for Bitcoin?      The second step is to partner with crypto and DeFi startups, even if it’s in a learning or sandbox environment and experiment with programmable, digital money and wallets. What does this experience of self custody, or consumer controlled assets look and feel like? How do peer to peer, mutualized, permissionless, internet-based services work? What possibilities for automation, efficiency and transparency do such decentralized financial services present? This is an important learning exercise for DeFi innovators as well.      The third step is to move from proprietary walled garden solutions to permissionless blockchain solutions. Permissioned ledgers were a good step for banks to experiment with shared operating models built on shared data and shared logic. That ship of “less closed but not fully open solutions” has now sailed. Now it’s time to take all that learning into an open, internet environment.      Overall, to survive, banks have to go beyond superficial mobile apps and design payments and banking experiences for a far more internet savvy consumer who is ramping on to networked services that use programmable money. This is why integrating cryptocurrencies into banking apps and services is critical. A really good time for banks to start was last year.

ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas said the company had released physically settled futures thinking traders would be interested in trading spot bitcoin with the protection of a futures exchange and a futures clearinghouse. Cash-settled contracts don’t require the delivery of bitcoin like physically settled contracts, allowing investors who can’t touch bitcoin to still profit from it.      Physically settled futures won’t become more popular until the exchange can offer physically traded futures on margin, Chippas said. ErisX is working with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to allow the exchange to offer margin in the future.      In the meantime, the exchange is launching cash-settled bounded futures, which provide upper and lower bounds on gains and losses, protecting investors from large price movements      Cash-settled futures have been trading in the U.S. since 2017, when CME and Cboe launched their own products, though Cboe discontinued its bitcoin futures in 2019.

42433268,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Hrh,1606832840,First Mover: Bitcoin's Failure to Break $20K Shows Big Investors Only Just Arriving,"Bitcoin was lower, retreating after rallying over the past 24 hours to a new all-time-high price of $19,920, based on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Cryptocurrency analysts predicted bullish traders might next target the $20,000 threshold, though the market could struggle to break through if large potential holders choose to take profits at that level.      The ""resistance into $20,000 could be more psychological than anything else,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the digital-asset prime broker Bequant. ""It would make sense that once we are finally able to get past this threshold, that the rally has legs.""      In traditional markets, European shares rose, led by banks and energy firms, and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open on the first day of the final month of a tumultuous 2020. Gold strengthened 1.2% to $1,798 an ounce.    Market moves    All sorts of reasons were cited Monday as bitcoin pushed to a new all-time-high, ranging from PayPal's (PYPL) recent entry into the space to the collective market shrug in response to the massive outflows from the OKEx cryptocurrency exchange after a five-month withdrawal suspension was lifted.      What's clear is that most analysts, traders and industry executives are talking about the sudden influx of big investors and Wall Street firms nosing into bitcoin and digital-asset markets for the first time. As noted Monday in First Mover, ""institutional adoption"" has become among the buzziest of buzzwords from bitcoin bulls and marketeers.      The key driver of their interest appears to be the desire for a hedge against inflation, during a year when the deep economic toll from the coronavirus has prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to pump trillions of dollars of emergency liquidity and monetary stimulus global financial markets.      ""With so much excess liquidity in the system, the original investment case for bitcoin is being vindicated.” Rich Rosenblum, who heads trading at the crypto firm GSR, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey.  On Monday, just before bitcoin prices began their single-day price climb of 8.3% to end the month, the market was filled with chatter about a new endorsement from an analyst at the $631 billion investment firm AllianceBernstein. (""I have changed my mind about bitcoin."") Later in the day, CNBC reported that strategists for another Wall Street firm, BTIG, said cryptocurrency had come of age, and that bitcoin should reach $50,000 by the end of next year.      ""The stream of institutions commenting and allocating to BTC became a flood of good news that reinforced the narrative,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Diginex, told subscribers in an email.      CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported that support from institutional investors might help to sustain the latest rally, contrasted with the bull run of 2017 when prices briefly touched these levels before quickly tumbling and then hibernating in a bear market for most of 2018.      “Broadly speaking, institutional positions and high-net-worth individuals are leading the way this time,” Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, told Decrypt.      Another difference from 2017 is that digital-asset markets appear to have evolved dramatically in the past few years and appeared to have handled the recent uptick in intensity and transaction volumes without too many glitches. (The well-trod fiat-to-cryptocurrency on-ramp Coinbase did report delays in processing some bitcoin withdrawals due to network congestion.)      “The trading, settlement and custody services are all far more sophisticated and mature, which instills confidence,” GSR's Rosenblum said.      Major spot exchanges, where retail customers casually buy the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, have seen an uptick. Combined daily volume for Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini and ItBit was at $1.5 billion as of press time Monday, much higher the $488 million average of the past six months, CoinDesk's Dan Cawrey reported.      Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, wrote in his weekly blog that some big investors, due to regulatory concerns, might be using futures on U.S. commodities exchanges or publicly traded investment vehicles in traditional stock markets to gain exposure to bitcoin – instead of just jumping into digital-asset markets. He provided a chart showing how key closures on public U.S. markets over the past week coincided with big swings in 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week cryptocurrency markets.      ""The institutions are coming all right, but they are taking the local bus while the rest of us are on the express,"" Dorman wrote.      The upshot is that bitcoin is reaching new all-time-highs when institutional adoption hasn't even really got going, in the truest sense.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's one-month implied volatility has risen to 6.5-month highs, reflecting increased expectations of price turbulence over the next four weeks.      According to data source Skew, the metric influenced by demand for call and put options has increased to 89%, the highest level since May 18, having bottomed out near 44% in September. The doubling of implied volatility has happened alongside bitcoin's rally from $10,000 to $19,920 and looks to have been caused by relatively higher demand for call options (bullish bets).      That's evident from the record low one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts (bearish bets) relative to calls. The options market looks positioned for a continued rally.      Some analysts say a healthy pullback could be in the offing as bitcoin’s inflow to exchanges has exceeded outflows since the Thanksgiving sell-off, according to data source CryptoQuant. ""That on-chain metric could indicate a short-term bearish trend, sending bitcoin back to a level of around $16,000,"" said Ki Yong Ju, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $18,800, representing a 4% drop on the day.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Google searches for 'bitcoin price' hit 18-month high    What's hot  Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain goes live as ""world computer"" begins long-awaited overhaul (CoinDesk)  Coinbase reported delays processing bitcoin withdrawals on Monday as cryptocurrency's price move to all-time-high created congestion on blockchain network (CoinDesk)  Over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading firms report uptick in purchases by institutional investors during latest bitcoin rally (The Block)  While some near-term pricing correction is likely to be expected, analysts who spoke to CoinDesk said bitcoin’s latest rally will be more sustainable for the long term compared with 2017 (CoinDesk)  European Central Bank President Lagarde says stablecoins ""pose serious risks"" to financial security (CoinDesk)  100x Group, holding company for embattled cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, picks former head of German stock exchange as new CEO (CoinDesk)  Upstart bitcoin exchange LVL, backed by Anthony Pompliano, Jimmy Song and Willy Woo, cuts trading fees to ratchet up competition with Coinbase and Gemini, plans new debit card with Mastercard (CoinDesk)  Authorities shut off electricity to bitcoin miners in China's Yunnan province (CoinTelegraph)  Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance  ""Rather than seeking to create a Chinese-style digital dollar, Joe Biden’s nascent administration should recognize the benefits of integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system,"" economic historian Niall Ferguson writes in op-ed (Bloomberg Opinion)  Fed Chair Powell calls economic outlook ""extraordinarily uncertain"" in prepared remarks ahead of scheduled appearance Tuesday before U.S. Congress (CNBC)  China's new anti-dumping rules on Australian wine could escalate tensions, signal broad effort to tamp down dissent among trading partners (Bloomberg)  As coronavirus cases surge in Hong Kong, banks including Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, UBS and Citigroup bring back work-from-home policies (Bloomberg)  Tech startups are helping to modernize India's agriculture industry (Nikkei Asia Review)  Tweet of the day",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/01/first-mover-bitcoins-failure-to-break-20k-shows-big-investors-only-just-arriving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97d56d190ec921120d71f81d608243759ea22b5d-1200x931.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385206,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAni5p,1606831207,Libra Rebrands to 'Diem' in Anticipation of 2021 Launch,"The Libra Association put together by Facebook last year is rebranding in further efforts to distance itself from the original Facebook-led vision rolled out last year.      The group, composed of 27 member firms, announced Tuesday it was changing its name to Diem (the Latin term for “day”) as it gears up for the potential 2021 launch of a single, dollar-pegged stablecoin. The organization has also finalized its leadership team, which includes Dahlia Malkhi as chief technology officer, Christy Clark as chief of staff, Steve Bunnell as chief legal officer and Kiran Raj as executive vice president for growth and innovation and deputy general counsel.      The new hires join the previously announced CEO Stuart Levey, Managing Director James Emmett, Chief Compliance Officer Sterling Daines, Chief Financial Officer Ian Jenkins and General Counsel Saumya Bhavsar.      Social media giant Facebook unveiled Libra in June 2019 after over a year of secretive development and research work. At the time, the project envisioned a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies, one that could be used worldwide as a means of exchange. It immediately prompted international regulatory backlash, with lawmakers demanding that all development cease until they could better understand it, provide some level of regulatory oversight and ensure there were no risks to financial stability.      A number of its original members departed, mainly financial services firms citing regulatory risks, before Libra could even get started.      Libra’s governing body, which was formally created in November 2019, later tightened the scope of the project, announcing in April 2020 that it would launch a group of stablecoins that were each backed by a single fiat currency or asset instead of the basket-backed token.      Levey believes regulators are warming up to the project, particularly through the changes and the implied distance from Facebook (which wasn’t named in Tuesday’s press release), which isn’t itself a member of the governing association, though its subsidiary Novi (formerly Calibra) is. Another founding member includes Breakthrough Initiatives, a space exploration group run in part by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.      “I think regulatory stakeholders really are welcoming a more autonomous association. They want to see an association strong enough to make its own decisions and have a leadership team that is capable of directing the project. It is in part for that reason we decided to change the name, to move from Libra to Diem, and that will be effective [Tuesday],” he told CoinDesk.      A revised white paper also reduces Facebook's role. While the original document released in June 2019 mentioned Facebook six times and said that ""Facebook is expected to maintain a leadership role through 2019,"" and noted its creation of Novi, the December 2020 version only said, ""While Facebook teams played a key role in the creation of the Association and the Libra Blockchain, they have no special rights within the Association.""    Launching coins    Libra is ready to launch its first stablecoin, the “Diem dollar,” as soon as the new entity is licensed through the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). The Financial Times first reported that a dollar-pegged coin could launch last week.      Levey declined to provide a timeframe, noting that FINMA will make its decision in its own time.      Libra originally planned to launch within the first half of 2020, but the regulatory hurdles complicated these efforts.      Diem's coin, when it launches, will be compliant with international regulations at the protocol level, Levey said. He said this means that compliance with regulations such as the Financial Action Task Force’s “travel rule” will be baked into the network, as will other features like consumer protection.      “That then brings you back to the question of why change the name. ... One of the reasons is that the original name, I think, was tied to an earlier iteration of the project that [saw a] difficult reception from from regulators around the world and we've changed the proposition dramatically,” Levey said.      The organization is still engaging with regulators worldwide to clarify how widely each token can circulate and which fiat currency the next coin will be pegged to. Levey said a number of factors will go into these considerations, including the comfort level of regulators.      Read more: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      The project is ready to launch at a technical level, though developers are continuing to test and iterate on the design, Levey said. And while the project has evolved in scope since its unveiling, it still uses a blockchain.      “We think that there are technological and governance advantages from having a blockchain. It permits innovation and collaboration in the open source space that we think adds real potential to the overall project, it adds collaboration and innovation and frankly one of the things I love about it is there’ll be use cases developed and innovations that we at the Diem, Libra Association would never have thought of ourselves,” he said.      International remittances and merchant payments are still the two primary use cases that the project is eyeing at the moment.      And while Levey said he doesn’t feel “a particular sense of urgency” around launching a basket-backed stablecoin, he can see that being a possibility in the distant future.      “We would aspire to issue other single currency stablecoins over time, and then we wouldn't issue a multi-currency stablecoin, but ... this is the beauty of programmable money, you can create a multi-currency stablecoin, if we have a certain number of individual single currency stablecoins out there,” he said.

42385211,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAni8L,1606831204,BlockFi Announces Early 2021 Launch for Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card,"Cryptocurrency lender BlockFi has taken its first step in the payments space.      The New York City-based company, known for its lending operation, interest-bearing crypto products and trading desk, announced Tuesday it will launch its long-awaited bitcoin rewards credit card in the first quarter of next year.      CEO Zac Prince said the credit card will be the first of its kind in an industry that is already saturated with bitcoin reward debit cards.      “A lot of the debit cards that exist in the crypto ecosystem are the kind that are oriented around this idea of spending your crypto, which at least clients at BlockFi are not interested in doing,” Prince told CoinDesk in an interview. “They want to hold their bitcoin and earn a yield on it.”      While BlockFi is working on functionality that will allow users to pay down their BlockFi credit card debt with crypto, Prince said the company will encourage customers to use the card for everyday spending, not for racking up debt. The interest rates on BlockFi’s loans are much better than the annual percentage rates on the credit card, Prince added.      Read more: Coinbase to Launch Crypto Debit Card in US for Retail Spending      The crypto lender is putting out the new product about a quarter behind schedule because of how many of its partner organizations had to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.      “You have to work with quite a few partners to bring a credit card to market,” Prince told CoinDesk in August of this year. “Some of them haven’t really handled the transition from being fully in-office to being fully remote as smoothly as companies like BlockFi have.”      Visa is acting as the card issuing network, Evolve Bank & Trust provides the Bank Identification Number (BIN) that allows BlockFi to connect to the payments network and Deserve is managing the payments flow technology.    BTC back    The card spends dollars but earns rewards in bitcoin. The rewards back are 1.5% of fiat purchases, and the bitcoin users receive is deposited into their BlockFi accounts. The annual fee for the card is $200. For the first year, BlockFi is giving users who spend at least $3,000 on the card in the first three months a stipend of $250.      The revenue for BlockFi will be one part interchange fee (which will be split between customer rewards and revenue) and another part annual fee, Prince added.      “This will add payments revenue as a category"" on the balance sheet, Prince said. “Payments generally is a revenue type that gets pretty healthy multiples in capital markets.”      Read more: BlockFi Raises $50M From Universities, NBA Star, Others as Crypto Lending Soars      Since the credit card is a premium Visa card, BlockFi plans to offer more credit and debit cards in the future that are also tied to customers’ crypto accounts. Prince also said he envisions a future where customers can deposit their paychecks into a BlockFi account, send remittances with BlockFi, and do bill pay and other regular banking activities as well.      “We’re not announcing what we’re going to do in year two yet,” Prince said. “We intend – like we’re doing in year one – to make it as much of a no-brainer decision as we can for folks to hold the card.”      Prince couldn’t give exact credit limit ranges, but expects to see limits vary from $5,000 on the low end to $25,000 on the high end, depending on the creditworthiness of the customer.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/01/blockfi-announces-early-2021-launch-for-bitcoin-rewards-credit-card,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4e0dc057c771b5b6bdb8743f6be6dfcc302a045-1024x536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385203,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnhzX,1606830008,Blockchain Coalition Launches Tradable Carbon Credit Token,"Stablecoin pioneer Uphold is claiming to have launched the first tradable retail carbon token.      The Universal Protocol Alliance, a coalition of blockchain companies led by Uphold and including Bittrex Global, Ledger, Certik and Infinigold, announced the Universal Carbon (UPCO2) token Tuesday.      Each blockchain-based UPCO2 token represents a certified measure of carbon dioxide. They can be bought and held as an investment, or burned to offset a company or individual’s carbon footprint, the group said.      A rather overloaded term, “carbon credits” can refer to both government-issued credits traded on regulated markets, and voluntary carbon offsetting where credits can help remove emissions via projects that plant trees, for instance. Blockchain technology has been touted as a way to prevent the double counting (or double spending) of carbon credits in all areas and markets.      Read more: Carbon Credits Have a Double-Spend Problem. This Microsoft-Backed Project Is Trying to Fix It      Uphold is starting out by tokenizing voluntary carbon credits, in particular REDD credits that are of high quality, easy to understand and make up about 58% of the voluntary carbon market, explained JP Thieriot, co-founder of the UP Alliance and CEO of Uphold. Each UPCO2 Token represents one year-ton of CO2 pollution averted by a certified REDD+ project preventing rainforest loss or degradation, he said.      Based on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, the tokens are backed by a Voluntary Carbon Unit (VCU), a digital certificate issued by international standards agency Verra, which allows certified projects to turn their greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions into tradable carbon credits.      Today, the retail market for voluntary carbon credits – via sites like TerraPass or Cool Effect – allow access, but not holding or trading, which is the important distinction, said Thieriot.      “We are the first people in the world that are making these credits accessible to retail, and holdable,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. “So there's lots of retail sites that allow you to offset the trip you just took to New Zealand or give somebody a clever Christmas present. But they don't allow the buying and holding for investment or speculative purposes.”      When he began looking at voluntary credits as fungible assets, Thieriot expected the prevailing “NGO mindset” was probably going to be sceptical of a project to harness a younger generation's speculative interest.      “Actually, every single conversation we had, people totally got it. They all understood that if we can pull that trick off, it could change the world,” Thieriot said.      Read more: Climate Startup Nori Raises $4M to Solve Carbon Market Double-Spending      Voluntary carbon offsetting is also of interest to companies like Amazon and Microsoft and Nike, said Thieriot, who are no longer interested in waiting around for governments to take the lead, and have set out to neutralize their current carbon footprint, or even their entire historical footprint, by their own initiative.      Meanwhile, demand for carbon credits is set to outstrip supply by a factor of four to one in 2020, according to the World Bank. And a change in the political climate in the U.S. looks likely, with President-elect Joe Biden announcing a climate administration.      The UPCO2 tokens are to undergo a “curing process,” which amounts to a primary issuance, said Thieriot, whereby they will be made available from today on the Uphold platform.      “Initially we are going to offer it on Uphold for about four to six weeks and then Bittrex Global will light it up,” Thieriot said. “And then we'd like every exchange in the world to pick them up.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/01/blockchain-coalition-launches-tradable-carbon-credit-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77d786fb205b123d81ff757d2ea397b2b8b4127e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report from the South China Morning Post on Tuesday, leader Chen Bo set up PlusToken as a blockchain project in 2018 and attracted millions of people with promises of high returns on investment. They were also required to pay membership fees in cryptocurrencies.  As previously reported, all of PlusToken's 27 alleged masterminds were arrested this summer, along with another 82 core members who were hiding in Cambodia, Vanuatu, Vietnam and Malaysia.  According to today's report, Chen used social media and offline events to recruit members.  In January 2019, Chen and his team fled to Cambodia to continue the PlusToken scam. Chen cashed out an estimated 127 million yuan ($19.32 million) to buy properties and luxury cars.  The Yancheng, Jiangsu, court handed Bo and 13 other operators prison terms of two and 11 years, with fines ranging from 120,000 yuan ($18,000) to 6 million yuan ($900,000).

42385221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAniKv,1606824103,Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain Goes Live as 'World Computer' Begins Long-Awaited Overhaul,"Serenity is knocking.      The first stage of the next-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum 2.0 is now live as of 12:00 UTC Tuesday, according to Beaconcha.in.      A generalized blockchain for decentralizing computer-based applications – from iPhone games to government bonds – Eth 2.0 has been under construction since the genesis of the current proof-of-work (PoW) network in 2015.      Tuesday’s launch concludes the opening act, or “phase 0,” of Ethereum’s consensus mechanism transition, which will see the network – whose native cryptocurrency, ether, is worth $70 billion by market cap – fundamentally change how it settles payments while in motion.      Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0      ""The launch of the Beacon Chain is a huge accomplishment and lays the foundation for Ethereum's more scalable, secure, and sustainable home,"" Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan told CoinDesk in an email. ""There is still much work to do, but today we celebrate.""      The Beacon Chain will be the backbone of a new Ethereum blockchain, a network intended to keep pace with PayPal (PYPL) and Visa (V) in terms of processing speed, while rivaling them in terms of transparency and payment finality.      Eth 2.0 has at least two more technical hurdles to hit its ever-moving timeline: Dynamically breaking the PoS Ethereum blockchain into multiple datasets called “shards” and adopting Rollups, a throughput solution for decentralized applications (dapps).      The Beacon Chain’s near-term functionality is quite limited.      Like the handful of testnets before it, participants in Eth 2.0 now help “store and manage the registry of validators,” according to Ethereum infrastructure provider ConsenSys. Yet, accounts and transfers remain locked until at least Phase 2 while the Eth 1.x blockchain continues in parallel. In other words, Eth 2.0 won’t be usable for paying your electric bill until 2022 at the earliest.    Before Eth 2.0: Ethereum history 101    Ethereum is the creation of Russo-Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin, also the founder of Bitcoin Magazine and member of multiple early alternative currency projects such as Mastercoin. First announced in 2013 at a Bitcoin conference in Miami, Fla., Buterin envisioned a network capable of leveraging Bitcoin’s blockchain architecture for purposes larger than just a digital currency – well outside the bounds of pseudonymous bitcoin developer Satoshi Nakamoto’s original intent.      As demonstrated in his early writings on the subject, Buterin argued a PoS consensus mechanism would be central to this new type of blockchain. Buterin has long held that PoS offers higher security guarantees in the long term than Bitcoin’s mining-based PoW blockchain. Many Ethereum developers also favor PoS over Bitcoin’s PoW due to environmental concerns.      Under the auspices of the Ethereum Foundation, Eth 2.0’s central specification written by Buterin and other developers was coded into multiple programming languages in what are called clients.      Read more: CoinDesk Is Spinning Up an Ethereum 2.0 Node. Here’s How to Follow Our Journey      The decision to program Eth 2.0 into multiple languages remains a chief reason for its patient advance towards launch. Indeed, Ethereum developers have shifted timelines throughout the last five years to many investors’ frustration.    Launching the Beacon Chain    Tuesday’s launch, however, is the culmination of not only years of sustained blockchain research, but a more recent push goaded by investor anxiety. A perceived lack of development reached a fevered pitch this past summer as further delays put the Beacon Chain’s 2020 launch in question.      The Ethereum community’s expectations were “loud and clear,” Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said in a July tweet, setting “phase 0 genesis in 2020” as the goal. As of Tuesday, that goal has been met.      A flurry of client activity followed Drake’s tweet in preparation for a mainnet launch: the Medalla testnet on July 22, followed by Spadina and Zinken in late September and early October, concluding with Pyrmont’s deployment on Nov. 18.      The long-awaited deposit contract for Eth 2.0 was released Nov. 4 by the Ethereum Foundation after one further October delay, with a targeted genesis date of Dec. 1. For once, Ethereum was on time.      In order to launch, the deposit contract needed 524,288 ETH seven days before the genesis date. Although large quantities of ETH were put into the contract, including some $1.4 million by Buterin himself, it took the better part of two weeks to fill the contract.      However, the contract’s conditions were satisfied Nov. 23 – nearly six years to the day of Ethereum’s first Devcon conference in Berlin, developer Lefteris Karapetsas pointed out on Twitter.      A final week gave clients an additional buffer to adjust any last-minute specifications. As of publication, 880,992 ETH worth some $542.7 million is currently locked in the deposit contract, according to CoinDesk price data.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/01/ethereum-20-beacon-chain-goes-live-as-world-computer-begins-long-awaited-overhaul,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/716089ece0945804a010ff7f4ae065d62222b381-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385218,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAniH9,1606824040,"Coinbase Brokered MicroStrategy's $425M Bitcoin Purchase, Exchange Says","U.S. cryptocurrency platform Coinbase facilitated MicroStrategy's $425 million bitcoin buy earlier this year, the exchange said.      In an announcement Tuesday, Coinbase revealed MicroStrategy's initial $250 million investment, which occurred over a five-day period in August, came via Coinbase Prime, the exchange's crypto brokerage arm formed following the acquisition of Tagomi in May.      That was followed up in September by a further $175 million investment from the Virginia-based business intelligence firm, bringing MicroStrategy's total investment to $425 million in bitcoin. MicroStrategy became the first publicly traded company to acquire a large chunk of bitcoin to hold on its balance sheet as a primary treasury reserve asset.      In retrospect, on-chain data suggests Coinbase was transacting with a large customer in the months leading up to MicroStrategy's August announcement. A series of large quantities of bitcoin – nearly 80,000 in total – began moving out of Coinbase Pro's reserve starting in the middle of the year and ending in the autumn. ""Those outflows went to Coinbase Custody wallets (interoperated with over-the-counter wallets), not exchange wallets,"" explained Ki Young Ju, CEO of analytics firm CryptoQuant, adding that Coinbase usually uses 8,000 BTC to make an initial custody wallet and requiring a minimum custody deposit of $10 million.      Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy's CEO, did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment by press time. Coinbase's announcement quoted him from an earlier MicroStrategy press release as saying that investing in bitcoin is part of the firm's ""new allocation strategy."" The strategy aims to maximize long-term value for shareholders while reflecting the cryptocurrency's use as a store of value with greater ""appreciation potential than holding cash.""      See also: MicroStrategy CEO Explains Why Bitcoin Is ‘a Million Times Better’ Than ‘Antiquated’ Gold      In Tuesday's announcement, Coinbase outlined three reasons why MicroStrategy chose the San Francisco-based exchange: the firm's smart order routing, trading algorithms and white-glove service. Coinbase also said it had been involved in several pre-trade calls with the firm during the onboarding process and was asked to conduct a small ""test trade.""      The test trade assessed data gathered from Coinbase and was analyzed by the exchange's OTC and Coverage teams. When an optimal pace to minimize market impact was decided upon and successfully executed, Coinbase received a green light from MicroStrategy to proceed with the ""larger investment.""      Following the test, Coinbase executed real-time trades using the time-weighted average price algorithm – a strategy that takes into account the average price of an asset over a specified time to minimize market impact.      ""Our system takes a single large order and breaks it into many small pieces that are executed across multiple trading venues,"" Coinbase said via email. ""The trading team achieved an average execution price that was less than the price at which buying started.""      The revelation is a notable public relations win for Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong following a weekend New York Times article alleging mistreatment of Blackemployees and several service outages during volatile market periods.      Armstrong's exchange can now claim bragging rights in the market as the one that helped a publicly listed company take a nine-figure leap of faith on bitcoin as a reserve asset.      UPDATE (Dec. 1, 13:30 UTC): Modified the headline and fourth paragraph to clarify that the quote from Michael Saylor included in Coinbase's announcement was sourced from an old MicroStrategy press release.

As of last week, Google Trends, a barometer for gauging general or retail interest in trending topics, returned a value of 21 for the worldwide search query ""bitcoin price."" That's over double the value of 10 observed roughly a month ago and the highest level since June 2019.      Bitcoin set a new record high of $19,850 on Monday, having narrowly missed the previous lifetime high of $19,783 last week. The cryptocurrency surged over 40% in November to register its biggest monthly gain since May 2019.      What makes bitcoin's ascent more impressive is that traditional assets seldom chart a 40% rally to record highs in a single month.      However, the market is far from being in a state of retail frenzy seen in December 2017, when the google search for the term ""bitcoin price"" returned a maximum value of 100.

PayPal has also started offering cryptocurrency services, possibly driving a bitcoin supply shortage.      ""The differences between 2020's run toward $20,000 and 2017's is that this current one is against a backdrop of greater geopolitical chaos, increased adoption but less general audience interest and less new coin supply,"" Clem Chambers, founder and CEO of financial markets website ADVFN.com, told CoinDesk in an email.      Many observers expect institutions to power more substantial gains over the long run. ""We believe we have just scratched the surface,"" Arjun Vijay, co-founder and COO of cryptocurrency exchange Giottus, said in an email. ""We will have the mother of all bull runs in 2021 when the cryptocurrency gets adopted by masses and cryptocurrencies go mainstream.""      According to Chambers, bitcoin will sail through $20,000, and the ""sky is the limit"" in the long term.      Traditional and non-financial media widely reported $20,000 as the record high back in December 2017.

42385213,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAniC7,1606780895,"Bitcoin Exchange Backed by Pomp, Song and Woo Removes Trading Fees to Contend With Coinbase, Gemini","Upstart crypto exchange LVL wants to take on U.S. giants Coinbase and Gemini by removing trading fees.      Announced today, LVL (pronounced “level,” as in playing field) is making its entire service free to use. LVL, which is backed by Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony Pompliano and bitcoin advocates Jimmy Song and Willy Woo, previously had no trading fees but only for subscription users.      LVL is also partnering with Mastercard to release two debit cards in early 2021. A standard plastic debit card will be available to free-tier users for a $10 issuing fee, while a metal Mastercard is included with three months of LVL’s Premium service.      The new features come as bitcoin is hitting all-time highs.      “We’ve always been behind a subscription paywall but now we’re just making our entire service free to use,” said LVL CEO Chris Slaughter. “You can buy and sell bitcoin, you can use the plastic debit card. So now in North America, there’s a regulated exchange that’s 100% free to use.”      Read more: Bitcoin Trading Fees on PayPal, Robinhood, Cash App and Coinbase: What to Know      LVL’s point is that large U.S. exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini with remarkably similar pricing schemes create a lack of competition. If it takes a scrappy minnow with just $2.5 million raised to date to disrupt the monopoly effects of these crypto exchanges, Slaughter said, then bring it on.      “We are a super scrappy business contender by nature,” he said. “Like, we only have seven people but we have the first Mastercard approval in North America. We’re registered with FinCEN. And not only do we have bank accounts, they are full checking accounts.” (LVL also provides FDIC insurance on those accounts through banking platform Evolve, Slaughter said.)    Revenue model    The exchange makes its money, Slaughter explained, by charging $3 for withdrawals, which primarily covers network fees. (Coinbase charges a $1-$5 network fee.) The trading platform also charges $5 for same-day bank transfers and wires, which covers the exchange’s risk provisioning credit to users and generates some income for LVL, Slaughter said.      The premium service at $9 per month, which also includes live-chat facility with a banker, is the means by which LVL Autopilot brings liquidity to the platform. The system runs industry-standard market-making algorithms, providing liquidity to traders and generating passive income for the Autopilot user, says Slaughter.      “Based on our current number of pro users, and the way we expect liquidity to grow following this announcement, we expect to pass Coinbase’s liquidity within the 2% band in January,” said Slaughter.      Read more: 5 Reasons Why Bitcoin Just Hit an All-Time High Price      For now, LVL is available in 28 states and territories representing 60% of the U.S population, and is expected to service 94% of Americans by the end of 2021, Slaughter said.      “William [Woo] and Jimmy [Song] were involved so freakishly early that they actually have founder shares,” said Slaughter. “Pomp got involved in the second half of last year and we have regular weekly meetings with him to talk about marketing.”      Song said the aim is to even the playing field for users who are currently being scalped for fees.      “Level is a revolutionary exchange that will change the game,” Song said via email. “Unlimited trading allows for really interesting innovations like an autopilot market-making which will give users a return on their Bitcoin.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/01/bitcoin-exchange-backed-by-pomp-song-and-woo-removes-trading-fees-to-contend-with-coinbase-gemini,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cc946f07f617bf685028b0c40406ba258d7968e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
