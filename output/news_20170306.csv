42379258,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XjL,1488841765,"Bitcoin Price Hits Resistance in Bid to Breach $1,300","Bitcoin prices appear to be encountering some resistance near $1,300.  Order books on digital currency exchange Bitfinex show a rise in the amount of sell orders closer to that level, according to figures provided by BFX DATA. As of roughly 22:15 UTC, that increase can be seen in sell orders starting slightly below $1,280.  Bitfinex sell orders accounted for more than 90% of all orders in the hour leading up to this time. However, buy orders maintained a very slim majority in the 24 hours before 22:15 UTC, making up 51.3% of all orders placed during this time.  The exchange constitutes roughly 14% of the total bitcoin exchange market share by trade volume over the past 24 hours, data from Bitcoinity shows.  This apparent resistance comes after the digital currency’s price set a fresh all-time high for the first time since late 2013, found parity with gold and repeatedly rose to new record heights. Amid this trend, bitcoin prices have repeatedly neared $1,300 but have thus far failed to reach it.  The digital currency’s price has surpassed $1,280 and even $1,290 on more than one occasion, climbing as high as $1,293.47 on 3rd March, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. At press time, the price of bitcoin is averaging $1,279.63.  As for what's driving the digital currency’s price in recent days, many market observers have pointed to the bitcoin ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Currently, the SEC has a deadline of 11th March to decide on whether to approve or reject the ETF, though the decision could come at any time before that date.  While some analysts have given the proposed fund low odds of approval – and at least one prediction market rateshttps://www.bitmex.com/app/contract/COIN_BH17 it at roughly a 50-50 chance – signs indicate that the broader market is already pricing in a positive decision.

42379252,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82Xd3,1488834728,What You Need to Know About Bitcoin's Upcoming Code Release,"Bitcoin's best-known proposed code change isn't the only one that matters.  While the last few bitcoin code versions saw the gradual release of SegWit (a proposal that would alter transactions to boost scalability), developers are quietly improving bitcoin in other ways.  The upcoming release – version 0.14.0 – is composed of performance boosts and long-in-the-making code shuffles that could pave the way for future upgrades. The version will be made available once a trial version successfully withstands testing by developers.  As explained by Chaincode engineer Russell Yanofsky:  ""There's been a lot of performance improvements and there's been a lot of ongoing improvements on the networking code – making it more maintainable. But [developers] are also laying the groundwork, doing all this clean-up to make it multi-threaded and for more improvements in the future.""  Speeding up downloads  You could argue that running a full node is the best way to take advantage of bitcoin's unique ability to minimize trust in third parties.  Using the wallet features baked into the node is the most 'pure' way to send and receive payments, as well as to ensure better security and privacy of transactions. At least, that's compared to more popular, mobile-based SPV wallets, which store a smaller slice of block information and, as a result, require more trust in the network's miners.  However, running a node continues to be a pain point for users, since it requires downloading every transaction sent since bitcoin emerged nearly 10 years ago.  Perhaps the biggest performance improvement in 0.14.0 is that nodes can initially sync up with the network more quickly. Although the overall storage size is the same, in a trial run, 0.14.0 synched 5.7x faster than 0.13.2, the previous version, according to developers.  This is accomplished with 'assumed valid blocks', which separate two processes: verifying historical signatures and checkpoints, where old block hashes are hardcoded into the software to prevent denial-of-service attacks.  Further, while users have had the option of 'pruning' the blockchain for a while now, 0.14.0 introduces a 'manual pruning' option, where users can use a command-line option to cut out block information and, as a result, retain a smaller version of the blockchain.  Stuck transactions?  After that, there’s bumpfee, for which Yanofsky recently ""inherited"" the role of lead developer, and has been helping to test and complete.  The idea is that bitcoin transactions are sometimes slow to be added to the blockchain, as there's limited room in each bitcoin block. And, since miners have some choice over which valid transactions are packaged into each block, they're more likely to include transactions with a higher fee.  With a ""conservative"" fee, Yanofsky explained, you're not sure when your transaction will be included in a block. However, you can speed it up by using bumpfee to replace the old transaction with a new one that has a higher fee attached to it.  ""Previously you would be kind of stuck because you don’t want to send a new payment. If they both go through then you’d pay twice,"" he told CoinDesk.  The functionality is turned off by default, but users can activate it by using the command line, and is a feature that might be particularly useful as blocks are filling up. (This has long been a topic of bitcoin’s scaling debate, which we won’t get into here).  Bumpfee uses opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) under the hood, a feature that was introduced earlier that allows users to swap unconfirmed transactions with those with a higher fee. Developer James Hilliard spoke to the benefits of the underlying technology more generally – some of them longer-term.  ""It's something important for things like [the] Lightning network as well, which need reliable transaction confirmations,"" he said.  Though bumpfee uses a version wherein users can opt-in to replaceable transactions, it's worth noting that a full version, where every bitcoin transactions uses the feature, was controversial in the past.  Network changes  There are many other changes, some of which aim to optimize the mining process.  One change improves block processing speeds by reducing the redundancy of verifying signatures in blocks, while the enhanced ""high-bandwidth mode"" can speed up block propagation across the network in some cases.  ""Version 0.14 has plenty of optimizations such as networking-side stuff,"" Hilliard added.  Further, Bitcoin developer Cory Fields’ peer-to-peer refactoring finally made it into the 0.14.0 release, after nearly two years of work. The hope is that it will clear the way for future upgrades and help new developers make sense of the codebase faster.  Though, like many of the other miscellaneous changes included in the release, it’s not something that average users are likely to notice — at least not yet.

42379254,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XfZ,1488828763,Irish Fund Managers Complete Blockchain Data Reporting Trial,"An investment industry trade group based in Ireland has completed a blockchain proof-of-concept aimed at streamlining regulatory reporting.  Irish Funds announced the end of the trial today, conducted at Deloitte's Dublin-based blockchain lab. The test, which began early last month, featured Deutsche Bank, Metzler, Northern Trust and State Street as participants.  Dubbed ""RegChain"", the pilot utilized technology from ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to track and analyze transactions, then organize the data into completed financial statements to then be viewed by the relevant regulatory agencies.  The test sought to create a platform for developing Money Market & Investment Funds returns, the reporting format for investment funds in Ireland. According to Irish Funds, it showed that this process can be streamlined to become more efficient, enabling the exchange of transaction data with relevant parties, including regulators.  Irish Funds CEO Pat Lardner said that the organization would pursue additional research into the area, calling the test ""an important first step"" in that broader process.  Lardner said of the test:  ""The successful completion of this project is an important first step in demonstrating the power of blockchain for regulatory reporting and industry collaboration around innovation. This foundation will enable additional development and progress to be made with other key stakeholders and confirms Ireland’s place a leading location for FinTech globally.""  The trial is the latest from Ireland's financial space centered on regulation.  In April 2016, the Bank of Ireland, one of the country's ""Big Four"" banks, developed a prototype centered on trade reporting. Working with Deloitte, the Bank of Ireland used the tech to create a visible platform used for monitoring clients' trading activities.  Speaking about the test after the fact, bank representatives said that blockchain could help them reduce up their regulatory burdens by creating more effective channels for capturing data.

FnConn, the financial services arm of Taiwan-based Foxconn, launched the platform alongside Dianrong, a Chinese online lending marketplace. Dubbed Chained Finance, the platform is aimed at providing working capital to smaller businesses involved the manufacturing supply chain. According to the two firms, a previous proof-of-concept involved the issuance of loans worth $6.5m to a group of unnamed companies.  Chained Finance has an initial focus on the automotive, electronics and garment production industries, though FnConn and Dianrong indicated that this scope could be widened in the future. The new company employs 40 people, representatives for the firm said, a number expected to rise in the months ahead.  Jack Lee, CEO and executive director of of FnConn, said in a statement:  ""By using the Chained Finance platform, every payment, every supply chain transaction, can be more transparent, manageable and easily authenticated. Chained Finance will provide timely, efficient support to far more suppliers of all sizes. It will also help ensure the timely delivery of products to end customers and improve efficiencies across the entire supply chain.""  Both FoxConn and Dianrong have worked with the tech in the past.  FoxConn is one of a number of Fortune 500 firms working on a blockchain-based Internet of Things concept. Dianrong, by comparison, joined the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project in December.  Founder and CEO of Dianrong, Soul Htite, said in a statement:  ""Chained Finance creates a unique ecosystem that will provide supply chains with easier access to funding at competitive rates.""

42379243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XSz,1488816162,Consumer Watchdog in Italy Moves Against OneCoin Investment Scheme,"Regulators in Italy have moved to suspend the operations of several affiliates of OneCoin, the digital currency investment scheme widely accused of being fraudulent.  Late last month, the Italian Antitrust Authority, a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization that focuses on consumer protection, said that it had ordered the ""precautionary suspension"" of the efforts, led by three unnamed individuals. The Antitrust Authority is funded by Italy’s Ministry of Economic Development.  The Antitrust Authority said that its investigation of OneCoin – which accelerated in December with a preliminary injunction against three affiliates – found that most of the money generated came from recruitment efforts. Those who take part in the OneCoin scheme purchase packages of ""tokens"" that can later be redeemed on an online website or sold to others, who in turn are encouraged to find buyers of their own.  The Antitrust Authority said (in a translated statement):  ""In fact, the bulk of the revenues...derives not so much from the purchase of [the] virtual currency OneCoin but rather by the payment of fees that consumers are requested to bear in the accession to the system, which in time to reach the goal of profit, appear to be required to recruit other consumers. These arrangements appear attributable to the typical dynamics of pyramid schemes.""  The suspension is one of the most aggressive moves to date against OneCoin, which has been accused of misleading buyers by promising big gains on its eponymous digital currency.  Central banks in Africa, including those in Nigeria and Uganda, have issued strongly-worded advisories about the scheme.  Regulators in Belgium and the UK, too, have warned consumers about OneCoin. In the UK, the London police are said to be investigating the scheme as well.

42379248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XY1,1488812387,Australian Finance Regulator Unveils Blockchain Research Effort,"An Australian financial regulator has opened a new innovation center dedicated in part to blockchain research.  According to AUSTRAC – the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre – its innovation hub is aimed at exploring new technologies like blockchain in partnership with private-sector firms. As part of the initiative, it also plans to open a regulatory 'sandbox' in which firms can test new financial products.  The hub is part of a broader effort focused on financial intelligence, launched last week by AUSTRAC, aimed at reducing money laundering.

This will flow into broader engagement allowing AUSTRAC to improve its services and policies, and develop online information, public seminars and webinars.""  AUSTRAC was one of several agencies in Australia to back a wide-ranging fintech policy statement released over a year ago, and aimed at providing a bridge for the government to experiment with, and potentially deploy, financial technologies.  At the time, representatives for the agency said that it would work to develop regulatory approaches around blockchain as part of its mandate.  Further, in August, the regulator announced that it was working with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to explore technologies like blockchain for their potential use in data tracking and management.

42379253,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XeJ,1488808808,China's Biggest Blockchain Backer Launches Startup Accelerator,"A blockchain venture backed by Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang Group has launched a new startup accelerator.  The kick-off, which formally took place on 22nd February, comes soon after Wanxiang pledged to spend as much as $30bn on a smart cities initiative, set to be invested over a seven-year period. As part of that plan, Wanxiang, best known as the country's biggest makers of automotive parts, said it would look to fund blockchain entrepreneurs.  As a continuation of that plan, China’s first dedicated blockchain accelerator – dubbed the 'Chainbase Accelerator' – will initially launch with four startups under its wing.  During the launch event in the Hongkou District of Shanghai, Feng Xiao, vice president and executive director of China Wanxiang Holdings – the group’s financial arm – invoked its smart city initiative once again, stating that the conglomerate sees a role for blockchain in the areas of next-generation energy delivery, digital currency and smart governance.  The executive told attendees:  “The Wanxiang Group is willing to leverage blockchain technology, in the ... innovative new energy city whose core industry is the manufacturing of new energy vehicles. Blockchain will play crucial part in the Internet of Value, in the Internet of Industry, in the servitization of industrial manufacture, and also in the governance model.”  During their time within the accelerator, the startups will work directly with Wanxiang staff, focusing on product iteration and business-model development, representatives of the company said. Further, Wanxiang’s cloud-based blockchain platform, WanCloud, will be utilized as part of the initiative.  The Wanxiang-backed blockchain venture was first revealed in September 2015, as part of a broader plan to invest as much as $50m in venture capital in the space.  The first four  The initial group of startups chosen for the Chainbase Accelerator reflect the group's push toward the deep integration of technology in a 21st-century urban concept.  Dorling Abby, for example, is a startup that, like others in the blockchain space, is looking to leverage the technology to create smart devices managed by asset-controlled smart contracts. Specifically, Dorling Abby wants to deploy smart contracts to manage domestic locks, enabling the creation of an on-demand rental economy.  Yuanben, by comparison, is looking to develop a blockchain-based trading platform for copyright. According to Wanxiang, the startup’s platform aims to record cryptographic signatures tied to copyrighted content, with that information being published on a distributed ledger.  The third startup, Bianjie Intelligence, is hoping to create a delivery vehicle for medical information, leveraging blockchain technology to handle the exchange of that data. The startup is said to be founded by Heng Cao, a former big data expert for IBM's Global Research Institution.  And, finally, Moceng aims to deploy the tech in the gaming space, using blockchain as a means to catalog download and registration counts, as well as payment histories, for games. The startup further indicated that plans to create real-time payment mechanisms for game purchases.  Smart push  During his speech, Xiao pledged that, in the coming months, Wanxiang would begin to divulge how it intends to build its smart city.  “We aim to build the nine square kilometer [city] into a global innovative platform of business endeavors. In one or two months, we will release some application demands regarding the innovative new energy city,” he said.  Among the applications Xiao invoked in his speech are smart products that feed information into a wider Internet of Things, which Wanxiang sees as a key aspect of its smart city plan. Blockchain, according to Xiao, could provide an essential means of establishing the identity of a particular device and its owner.  “How to manage the identities of these devices? How to ensure that certain data was originated from Mr Zhang’s refrigerator rather than that of Mr Li? In this case, blockchain may be a perfect solution,” he said.  His comments come during a significant period for blockchain in China. Amidst a rise in domestically based startups working with the tech, China’s central bank itself is experimenting with the concept of a central bank-issued digital currency, reflecting work taking place at other central banks around the world.  At the same time, the People’s Bank of China has boosted its scrutiny of the country’s bitcoin exchange ecosystem, a move that resulted in a shift in policy at Chinese exchanges and a broader sea-change in the global market.  For now, at least, Wanxiang has struck a bullish tone on its plans, and as part of of that process, Xiao indicated, the conglomerate’s blockchain wing will look to work with entrepreneurs in the space.  “We will be reaching out to global talents with technology, ideas and conviction, to pursue their business endeavors on our platform,” Xiao concluded.

42379256,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82Xi5,1488805211,Why the ICO Model's Success Could Be Its Downfall,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered exclusively to our subscribers.  Last week, CoinDesk released the results of its first Spotlight Survey of 2017: Blockchain ICOs. While the whole thing is worth a look, here I want to highlight a couple of slides that point to this new financing method’s rise and, at the same time, its potential fall.  But first, let me tell you a joke. (Bear with me, this is leading somewhere…)  It was late autumn and the Indians on a remote reservation in South Dakota asked their new chief if the coming winter was going to be harsh. He hadn’t yet learned how to read the skies, so he said they should gather firewood just to be safe.  After several days, he managed to get through to the National Weather Service. “Yes,” the meteorologist replied, “it looks like this winter is going to be quite cold.” So the chief told his people to collect even more firewood. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. “Yes,” he was told, “it’s going to be very cold.” So the tribe gathered more.  A week later, the chief called again. The weatherman was certain: “It looks like it’s going to be one of the coldest winters we’ve ever seen.”  “How can you be so sure?” the chief asked. The weatherman replied: “Because the Indians are collecting a sh*tload of firewood.”  From weather concerns, we move to slide 13 of the report, where we see another beautiful circularity and a different type of deforestation:  The vast majority of respondents who invested in an ICO did so for the potential price increase, rather than the token’s utility.  Slide 21 shows that almost half of respondents believe that institutions will come to dominate the ICO investment space.  There’s the circularity: if some institutional investors treat blockchain tokens as an asset class, then they become an asset class attractive to other funds.  Institutional investors are competitive. Therefore, success in an ICO bet encourages others to take a similar risk, and before you know it, hedge fund managers are competing to grab tranches of interesting projects. The success of some recent issuances could be an indication that we are already seeing the effects of competing funds chasing relatively illiquid investment opportunities.  While the notion of institutions muscling in on a financing method originally aimed at involving the community of developers and users is disquieting to some, that’s not the part that will weaken the system.  It’s this: if investors are buying tokens for investment or as a speculation, as our survey showed, then they are a security. And if they are a security, the SEC (or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) will take an interest.  And if the SEC takes an interest, it’s generally to (at best) increase the reporting requirements and compliance hurdles, which significantly raises the cost of financing through this method. In fact, it could end up pricing this path out of the reach of the small startups that had hoped to crowdfund their initial operations.  If this trend progresses, we could see an intentional dial-back of the investment appeal. Allocations could be limited, the utility of the token could be emphasized and institutional investors may end up deciding that there are more interesting high-risk opportunities elsewhere.  Without a shift in direction, the future of ICOs looks rocky. Just like a tribe’s reputation as weather diviners ends up killing a lot of trees, the success of token sales as an investment could end up being the nail in their coffin.

42379262,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XoN,1488801613,6 Trends From CoinDesk's New 2017 State of Blockchain Out Today,"CoinDesk Research's 2017 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events in the public and enterprise blockchain sectors in 2016.  This article previews six of the key takeaways as identified by our research team. To download the full report, visit CoinDesk Research.  2016 signified a strong shift in several areas of the blockchain industry.  Announced today  , CoinDesk's State of Blockchain 2017 report provides a 100-slide analysis of that shift – covering developments in the bitcoin, public blockchain and enterprise distributed ledger technology (DLT) sectors.  Our full report dives into these takeaways, as well as overall data and trends in the public blockchain space.  Here, we highlight six of the most significant trends that defined both Q4 and over the last 12 months.  1. Bitcoin's 'true volume' revealed  Bitcoin's 2016 exchange data tells a complicated story.  Looking back, for example, the three largest China-based exchanges (OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC) at first appear to account for 94% of the global annual volume. Using simply reported volumes, 459 million bitcoins were traded in Q4 2016, more than a three-fold increase from Q4 2015.  But, since China has historically offered no-fee bitcoin trading, these numbers, however record-breaking, had always seemed inflated.  Prior to China instituting a fixed flat rate charge of 0.2% on all bitcoin trades, cryptocurrency enthusiasts had tried to estimate a 'true volume' – a more realistic trading volume for Chinese exchanges that may indicate the region's actual dominance in the market.  Now State of Blockchain 2017 can finally reveal data that sheds light on the matter.  China's major exchanges introduced trading fees amidst regulatory pressure from the People’s Bank of China earlier this year, and CoinDesk Research delved deeper into the new post-fee market shares to gain a more realistic outlook on bitcoin exchange traded volume.  In post-fee world, the former 'Big 3' have seen a startling drop in exchange traded volume. Re-interpreting their market share, it appears the true aggregate volume of OKCoin, Huobi and BTCChina is closer to 35% of the global bitcoin market.  Integrating the new implied market share into 2016 trading volume gives us a more realistic interpretation of the year's volume than recorded data seemed to show.  At 35% market share, Chinese exchange volume steps down to $103m of bitcoin traded daily, down from the apparent $1.6bn-worth traded daily before the implementation of fees.  Amid the shifting regulatory landscape it seems that some traders have decided to stick with these Chinese exchanges.  Coindesk Research will continue to track exchange volume closely to see how the story unfolds throughout 2017.  2. Enterprise incumbents move on blockchain  To date, the enterprise blockchain market has had two main participating groups – incumbent banks and financial firms, and startups. It was perhaps the former group that gained the most ground in 2016.  Rather than simply testing proofs-of-concept, incumbent firms began to take more dedicated steps toward making their vision of blockchain's impact apparent over the course of the year.  For instance, PwC’s Vulcan blockchain is more of a technology that seeks to create interoperable digital assets that trade alongside established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Built in conjunction with Bloq, Netki and Libra, the Vulcan platform is PwC’s effort to deploy enterprise grade blockchain-based applications.  Likewise, Microsoft's business development director Marley Gray describes Project Bletchley as the company’s effort to deliver an open and flexible blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering.  At the end of Q3 2016, Microsoft released a white paper outlining Bletchley as way to construct permissioned consortium blockchains.  JP Morgan ended 2016 with two blockchain offerings, Juno and Quorum. The joint effort by the bank and Ethlab, Quorum appears to be an enterprise-ready distributed ledger mainly targeting long and costly settlement times. Juno is run on a different consensus model entirely, inspired by a variant of Raft consensus. Current versions of JP Morgan’s Juno blockchain can handle up to 500 transactions per second.  Accenture separated itself from other blockchain incumbents through its 'editable blockchain'. Accenture capital markets lead David Treat suggested that, in the long-term, blockchain solutions will need to compensate for real-world emergencies or even mistakes where information will need to be redacted or modified.  IBM has a standalone blockchain separate from its work with Hyperledger, however, its core product offering runs on the same code. VP of blockchain tech Jerry Cuomo sees IBM’s blockchain as a way to leverage smart contracts, automating business processes for supply chain management, trade finance and IoT among other industries.  Eric Piscini, a Principal at Deloitte, sees Deloitte’s Rubix software platform as a way to accelerate the auditing process of transactions that occur on the blockchain. Rubix piloted test use cases across the pharmaceutical supply chain including drug safety, drug channels and any end-consumer issues with pharmaceutical drugs.  In the scope of enterprise blockchain, R3's associate director sees 2017 as the ""year of the DLT pilot"". This year may see newer enterprise blockchains push hard against industry standouts like R3CEV and Chain.  3. Token sales challenge traditional VC investment  While 2016 traditional blockchain venture capital investment reached $496m (near-stagnant growth when compared with 2015's figures), a new method of raising money is challenging old norms.  Over the year, blockchain token sales, colloquially known as 'initial coin offerings' or ICOs, quickly became an alternative to traditional venture capital.  Since investor money was returned in the collapse of the DAO via ethereum’s hard fork, some analysts who report on the space have chosen not to include The DAO in yearly investment figures.  While CoinDesk Research understands why investors still retaining their funds may preclude some from including The DAO in yearly ICO investment, we felt that excluding the figures obscures the impact that ICOs have had.  Accounting for The DAO, ICOs raised $236m in 2016. This amount represents nearly half (48%) of all the money raised through traditional VC and angel investment.  The average size of a completed ICO for the year was $7.3m, slightly below the average traditional blockchain investment of $9m.  Our recent ICO spotlight study goes into more detail on market sentiment regarding the impact of blockchain token sales on venture capital.  4. Consortia gain steam  While incumbent financial institutions released notable standalone projects, blockchain consortia were hard at work courting new business as well.  Banking consortium startup R3CEV freely released the code for its Corda platform in tandem with its submission to the Hyperledger project.  After conducting a successful KYC-based registry using the Corda blockchain, R3’s Associate Director Clemens Wan discussed Corda’s unique features, ""CorDApp development"" and the future of R3.  Drawing an analogy between the Corda platform and the Xbox gaming system, Wan went on to describe it as the “ecosystem” and “connectivity” needed in order for developers to build financial-grade distributed applications.  In other consortia news for the year, with the introduction of four China-based companies, Hyperledger has officially passed 100 members. As Hyperledger continues to grow and Chinese company membership hits 25%, the project has made a commitment to the region with the Technical Working Group China proposal.  Still, there were those who offered a counter-example to this model.  Blockchain startup Chain has so far bucked the idea that it needs to be a part of Hyperledger (or other consortia) debuting its new tech at Construct 2017 months after open-sourcing the Chain Protocol.  Chain product architect Oleg Andreev showcased a new method to implement privacy inside of the cryptographic protocol.  With what it calls 'Confidential Assets', transaction amounts and account identities on the Chain Protocol are kept private. The Confidential Asset scheme adds 'noise', or inconsequential data, to hide asset IDs and values. A key is then required to obtain and subtract the noise values in order to arrive at the original data.  Andreev went on to compare Confidential Assets with other blockchain networks like zcash and monero that are leading the push towards privacy, ultimately citing scalability issues with zcash in certain enterprise instances.  Also at Construct, Chain’s Chief Product Officer Devon Gundry noted the company is working to develop Confidential Assets as an enterprise product offering within the Chain Protocol.  5. The push for privacy continues  Privacy has become an important consideration in blockchain protocols and old and new networks alike are establishing themselves at the forefront of the field.  While some may have sidelined monero as a legacy cryptocurrency, enthusiastic developers like Riccardo Spagni remain evangelistic toward monero and continue to champion its potential, 2016 metrics and current market cap standing in 2017.  Monero now has the sixth largest market cap in the cryptocurrency space, one position above ethereum classic and $20m away from eclipsing litecoin. Developers like Spagni continue to emphasize the sizable increases in monero’s transactional growth over its price, which peaked around $14 in early Q3 2016.  The presumptive explanation for renewed interest in monero is arguably the cultural shift towards privacy on the blockchain, a foundational element of the monero protocol.  Monero’s uniqueness comes from its implementation of a cryptographic tool known as ‘ring signatures’ that allow users to send and receive funds without the transaction details being revealed on the blockchain.  The extraordinary volatility zcash experienced through Q4 2016 also signals the industry interest in privacy protocols. Zcash’s Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge technology, more conveniently referred to as zk-SNARKs, sought to be the all-encompassing solution for confidentiality on the blockchain with enhanced privacy features.  As the price of zcash crashed to $28 towards the end of Q4 from $4,800 at launch, some enterprise blockchains have cited potential scaling issues in the underlying technology of zcash as a reason to look elsewhere for privacy solutions.  These concerns, compounded by reports that hardly anyone is using optional privacy features on zcash, signal an uphill road for the cryptocurrency in 2017 in order to regain its position in the industry push to privacy.  6. Bitcoin volatility continues  The last year saw developments in the long-standing debate over whether bitcoin can truly provide the basis for a payments system, or if it is better considered as a novel asset class.  While Q3 2016 signaled slight evidence of bitcoin prices stabilizing and reaching something of a 'safe haven' status, Q4 2016 disrupted this notion with a level of volatility the industry had not seen for a few months.  In what may come to be historically known as the 'Trump bump', the price of bitcoin soared post-election, as did volatility, which approached 62% for Q4.  Although Q4 volatility was not necessarily a year high for bitcoin, looking at the swings from quarter to quarter provides a decent counter argument to analysts and firms that see bitcoin approaching the status of an off-risk asset and safe store of value.  With bitcoin now at record highs and the Trump Administration still figuring out public policy amidst geopolitical uncertainty, analysts are scratching their heads with regard to near-term bitcoin price predictions.  If 2016 is any indication, we may be in for another wild ride.

42379242,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XQT,1488797149,Dubai Claims Title of Blockchain's 'Global Capital' at Keynote Event,"""We believe that Dubai is the global capital of blockchain. We know how to execute and we're creating the ecosystem.""  That statement, given during a talk by Wesam Lootah, CEO of the state-backed smart cities effort Dubai Smart Government, cut to the core of the message from government officials at Keynote 2017, a blockchain technology event held at the city's famed Burj Al Arab today.  Featuring speakers from Dubai's Department of Economic Development, the Dubai Future Foundation and Emirates NBD, the event sought to showcase the vision city leaders have for the tech, and the ecosystem approach they have thus far taken to encouraging its development.  This message was again visible during a morning address by Noah Radford, COO of Dubai Future Foundation, the government-backed incubator that kickstarted much of the innovation ongoing locally. While scheduled to be focused on implementation, Radford's instead shifted to providing a wider, global context for Dubai's approach to innovation.  Radford said:  ""What I want to talk about is more important than implementation, and that's vision. This will be particularly important in the next 10 years.""  Elsewhere, this broader narrative was called back by Danish Farhan, CEO of innovation consultancy Xische Holdings, in a talk that stressed the importance of stories in inspiring disparate groups to unite around ideas.  ""When Dubai announced that it wanted to be the first government to run on blockchain, you needed a narrative that was far greater than the promise of blockchain,"" Farhan said.  The talks come amid an active time for blockchain development in the UAE, one propelled forwarded by Dubai's crown prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who has set the goal of moving all government documents to a blockchain by 2020.  Lootah's talk emphasized the smaller steps toward this big vision, discussing how the Smart Cities program has sought to unite developers, researchers and business leaders to create an environment that could one day be ""powered by blockchain"" across its various services.  ""His Highness has asked us to do today what others will do in 10 years. We are creating the future of blockchain right here in Dubai,"" he said.  The work comes on the heels of the organization's role in the development of blockchain locally through the consortium Global Blockchain Council (GBC) and Smart Dubai's own 'Blockchain Challenge', an initiative launched in February to boost local startup activity.  Pipeline of projects  Yet, Lootah also cited the inherent challenge of this aspiration at a time when vendors ""haven't even released the 1.0 versions of their software"".  In contrast to last year's event, which saw the Global Blockchain Council debut use cases and proofs-of-concept, there were noticeably fewer announcements this year. Still, hints were given at work underway.  Mohammed Shael Al Saadi, CEO of strategic affairs at the Department of Economic Development, discussed the historical challenges the organization has faced when attempting to encourage new businesses, and how blockchain could come to play a role here.  In one part of his talk, Al Saadi cited how new business owners could benefit from a unified ID, and why such a business licensing regime could benefit from the data security provided by blockchains.  He explained how such an idea could enable a ""virtual customs"" department whereby goods and the documents they require could more easily move between the relevant regulatory and private-sector entities worldwide.  Al Saadi said:  ""[With blockchain], we could have the customs authorities of each of these companies and countries in Dubai. If you find a problem with the goods or the movement, we think that blockchain is the right tool for that.""  Stress factors  Another notable debut was a use case presented by Emirates NBD VP of enterprise architecture Naimish Shah, who discussed the bank's work with a blockchain-based system aimed at eliminating check fraud.  Framed as an $AED25m (roughly $6.8m) opportunity, Shah explained how the bank is piloting a system by which checks could be marked with a QR code that would be embedded with data linked to a blockchain.  ""When you give the check to the beneficiary, there's a self-service channel where the beneficiary can scan the QR code and know whether it's fraudulent,"" he explained. ""You can identify the fraud at the source and validate the check instrument.""  Still, Shah sought to voice some frustrations with his company's experimentation, and its struggle to make its ideas real.  For instance, he noted that it is not yet clear to banks which specific blockchain platforms will emerge as winners, or whether banks will grow comfortable with arrangements that will enable the technology's network effects to be best utilized.    In this way, Shah's talk provided evidence Dubai's incumbents, while moving quickly toward blockchain solutions, may be still be hitting some of the same roadblocks as their international peers.
