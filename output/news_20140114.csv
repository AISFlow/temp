42425297,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrvh,1389722433,Chicago Sun-Times and BitWall to Trial Bitcoin Paywall,"Bitcoin paywall provider BitWallhttp://www.bitwall.io/ is partnering with the Chicago Sun-Times to conduct a 24-hour bitcoin paywall test. The experiment, the first of its kind for a major US publication, will happen on the Sun-Times website on 1st February.  Readers accessing articles during this time will see an overlay “wall” before accessing an article. They will be given the option to pay to see the article with bitcoin, or to tweet the story for access.  ""We continue to experiment and test new technologies that we believe engage our readers and look forward to being the first major USA newspaper to test a bitcoin-based paywall,"" said Jim Kirk, chief editor for the Sun-Times.  Major US newspaper  The Sun-Times is the ninth-largest newspaper in the United States. Its parent company, Wrapports, owns a number of other news outlets, including seven Chicago suburban papers and 30 other media properties. Nic Meliones, the CEO of San Francisco-based BitWall, said in a statement:  “The Chicago Sun-Times is showing its technological leadership by being the first major newspaper to adopt a social paywall and bitcoin-powered monetization strategy. Bitcoin is an innovative technology well suited to online monetization.”  BitWall is backed by Adam Draper’s Boost Bitcoin Fund. That fund has an incubator called Boost VC that is run in San Mateo, CA. Boost helps startups with incorporation, capital and business advice. The program leans heavily towards bitcoin-based startups, and BitWall spent time in the accelerator last year.  Bitcoin-based paywalls could prove to be popular in the publishing industry. That’s because bitcoin's fees are often smaller than other forms of electronic payment.  This makes small transactions like bitcoin micropayments a win-win scenario for both publishers and bitcoin enthusiasts.  On one hand, publishers can produce revenue from articles by utilizing bitcoin. On the other, bitcoin payments make the distributed currency more than just a speculative store of value.  A good cause  The proceeds from the Sun-Times test will be donated to charitable organization the Taproot Foundation. The Taproot Foundation provides technical professionals for pro bono work at non-profits. This includes design, IT and HR services, among others.  “Taproot is thrilled to be the recipient of an innovative collaboration between BitWall and the Chicago Sun-Times. The Sun-Times is a longstanding partner in Taproot’s work to build pro bono in the corporate sector, which strengthens and grows nonprofit infrastructure,” said Elizabeth Schwan-Rosenwald, Taproot’s executive director.

42425285,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvs5h,1389707892,New York's Bitcoin ATM Could Hit BitLicence Snag,"The combination of Gotham and cryptocurrency has proved to be a powerful lure for New York City's top tabloid this week.  The New York Post reported on a Brooklyn man who has purchased a Lamassu bitcoin ATM and is planning to install it in the city's fashionable East Village.  The Post likened Lamassu's compact table-top units, which stand 48cm tall and weigh about 45kg each, to a ""typical deli ATM"" – the small cash points often found in a corner of the city's ubiquitous provisions shops.  The Lamassu units, which convert fiat currency to bitcoin, have been described by the company's co-founder Josh Harvey as bitcoin ""vending machines"" rather than ATMs.  The ATM owner is 30-year-old Willard Ling. Ling is planning to install his machine at a 'bubble tea' shop called Just Sweet, in downtown Manhattan's stylish East Village. Bubble tea is a sweet, milky, tea drink that usually contains chewy tapioca balls, known as 'bubbles'. The drink was popularised in Taiwan and has since spread across the globe.  Ling said he ordered his Lamassu unit after reading this CoinDesk article about the rapid growth in Lamassu's sales. He said the machine would be installed after he incorporated a company to operate the ATM and worked out whether the machine is legally considered an ATM, vending machine or kiosk. He is also awaiting the results of New York state's public hearings on so-called 'BitLicences'.  New York's BitLicenses  In recent months, the state of New York has started to engage with the bitcoin economy. The state's Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) will hold public hearings on the regulation of digital currencies on the 28th and 29th of January in the city.  Meanwhile, Lamassu and rival manufacturer Robocoin are racing to sell ATMs around the world, from Slovakia to São Paulo and Hong Kong, even as new competitors, like the Skyhook ATM, enter the scene with cheaper models.  At the core of the New York regulatory discussion are the so-called 'BitLicenses', which would be a licensing requirement specifically for businesses dealing in what the NYDFS terms ""virtual currency"", which would include bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The NYDFS hearing will include a ""broad cross-section"" of observers and participants in the ""virtual currency industry"". Ling welcomed the regulatory engagement on the matter. He said:  ""Hopefully [BitLicences] will be issued and will affect me and everyone else in the industry positively.""  As a result of New York's regulatory focus on bitcoin, there is a possibility that Ling's bubble tea ATM won't be installed any time soon, as Inc. magazine's Wire blog pointed out. In the meantime, the cryptocurrency machine will sit gathering dust in Ling's apartment.  Updated to include Ling's quotes on 15th Jan.

42425260,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoDh,1389700853,Bitcoin Can Now Buy You Breakfast in Glasgow,"Scotland just got its first bitcoin eatery thanks to Jonny McDonald, manager of the Brooklyn Cafe.  Located in Glasgow’s Shawlands, the family-run Brooklyn Cafe is a cosy little bistro that serves all-day breakfasts and giant burgers, as well as desserts and coffee.  The idea of embracing bitcoin came from McDonald, who has been with the cafe for more than a decade. In addition to free publicity, McDonald believes bitcoin can speed things up and make transactions easier.  [post-quote]  Brooklyn Cafe began accepting bitcoin payments back in December, but the Daily Record reports that the first official transaction was carried out last week.  McDonald said his first bitcoin payment was very exciting: “When the customer said how he wanted to pay, we checked the value of bitcoin on various sites, and I gave him the best exchange rate I could find at the time.”  “A lot of people have been talking about bitcoin and we have found that a lot of our customers know about the currency, although not many actually have them so far.”  McDonald also pointed out that bitcoin transaction fees are often much lower than the customary 2 to 3% on credit cards. Additionally, bitcoin transactions are faster than credit card payments:  “Our credit card machine takes around 45 seconds to process a payment, whereas a bitcoin transaction takes just 10 seconds.”  Brick and mortar  He added that the Brooklyn Cafe is the first brick-and-mortar business in Scotland to accept bitcoin, although there are a few Scottish companies that accept the currency online.  Dozens of bars, cafes and restaurant across the world are already accepting bitcoin payments, from China, through Russia, to Israel, Europe, North America and even Australia. Although adoption is still comparatively low, and – as always – many businesses are embracing bitcoin as a publicity stunt, things are slowly changing for the better.  McDonald said that he plans to expand his cryptocurrency network over the coming weeks:  ""[We] hope to open up litecoin transactions soon followed by any other cryptocurrency our customers have kicking about on their hard drives! ... We will currently take any coin with prior notice but can only accept bitcoin on a drop in daily basis.""  The Glasgow cafe is also giving away a free Ice-Cream Sundae to every table who pays a £20+ bill with bitcoin this week.

42425269,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoXh,1389693653,5 Ways to Play Bitcoin on the Public Markets,"As the bitcoin economy expands, so do the number of ways to gain exposure to the all-conquering cryptocurrency.  Public equity markets are still a popular and convenient way for many retail investors to park their cash.  Here's a list of five (OK – four and a quarter, accounting for the Bitcoin Investment Trust and Zynga) stocks that you can buy to gain exposure to bitcoin without actually having to hold the cryptocurrency yourself.  1. BTX Trader  WPCS International  (NASDAQ) announced the release of its bitcoin trading application BTX Trader on 26th December.  The company's stock price jumped from $1.51 before the announcement to $2.53 the following day, hitting a high of $2.75 on 2nd January. It is now trading at $2.05.    BTX Trader is touted as the first trading platform to allow users to execute orders on five of the most popular bitcoin exchanges. The exchanges include Mt. Gox, BTC China and BitStamp. The software also lets users place stop-loss orders on trades, monitor real-time price feeds and use various charting tools.    WPCS International  said in a filing to the exchange on 26th December that it had recently acquired BTX Trader LLC. The acquired firm is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPCS International. BTX Trader appears to have made its public debut in a post on Bitcoin Talk in May, when the developers announced it was open for a free private beta.  WCPS International works on engineering projects in wireless communication, specialty construction and electrical power, working on things like installing and managing infrastructure like power cables, according to its website.  As other media outlets have noted, little has been written about WPCS International since it was floated in 2003. Its shares have not performed well since then; it was offered at $140 and trades at about $2 today.  2. SmartTrans (ASX)  This mineral exploration company listed on the main board of Australia's stock exchange is trading in its diamond drills for super-fast computers, as it revamps itself into a software services company with a subsidiary focused on bitcoin mining.  The firm bought a $500,000 ""bitcoin mining contract"" on 30th November through a joint venture it owns with Zhenya Tsvetnenko.  According to SmartTrans, the contract had already generated about $150,000 of gross revenue in its first seven days. The contract is to run for 12 months in total. SmartTrans has a 50% stake in the joint venture with Tsvetnenko, which is a Hong Kong-incorporated firm called Digi8. SmartTrans stock has traded at about AUD0.025 since the announcement.  SmartTrans has interests in mines in Australia ranging from zinc to gold and copper. However, the firm is dramatically repositioning itself into a China-focused tech company.  The latest SmartTrans annual report, for 2013, said the firm will focus its future activities on its mobile phone and Internet operations in China and that it would seek to rationalise its mineral exploration projects through joint ventures or sales.  SmartTrans is engaged in developing online and mobile billing systems in China. One of its clients is a firm that is building the ""Angry Birds Playground Curriculum and Learning Space"" in the Middle Kingdom, according to its third-quarter report from 2013. SmartTrans reported a loss of about $1.9mn for 2013 on the back of about $2.45mn in revenues.  3. Overstock (NASDAQ)  The online retailer can't stay out of the headlines as it announced both its decision to start accepting bitcoin payments and the stellar results from that move. It made $130,000 in sales from Bitcoin within 24 hours of accepting the cryptocurrency.  Overstock.com's  share price has been trending down since it announced it would take bitcoin on 9th January. The stock opened on that day at $29.79 and is trading at $28.43 at the time of this writing.  Overstock's chief executive and chairman, Patrick Byrne, is famously bullish on bitcoin. He said in the retailer's press release announcing the move to take bitcoins:  ""Digital currency will be an important part of the future and Overstock is excited to be the first major online shopping retailer to accept it.""  Given Byrne's rosy pronouncements on the future of bitcoins, it's fair to expect Overstock to continue supporting its adoption. Traders who think bitcoin will be embraced by the high street shoppers of the future might want to take a look at this stock.  4. Bitcoin Investment Trust  SecondMarket's Bitcoin Investment Trust isn't a publicly listed security, but sophisticated investors, which is its target market, can still buy units in it relatively easily.  The trust is open to accredited investors as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes individuals with a net worth above $1m or an income exceeding $200,000 annually, among other conditions. Investors can sign up online but must submit identification documents.  The Bitcoin Investment Trust has proved to be popular, raising $61.1m from investors within three months of its launch. This amount has greatly exceeded the fund's initial goal, which was $10m by the end of 2013.  The Bitcoin Investment Trust is designed to make buying and storing bitcoins safer and more convenient for investors who are willing to pay the hefty fees, which amount to about 5% in total. The minimum investment is $25,000.  Investors can redeem their units in BIT through SecondMarket auctions, which are slated to start this year. Several individual retirement account platforms, including Pensco and Entrust, can be used to invest in the BIT, including, briefly, Fidelity.  If the idea of trading bitcoins yourself through exchanges or other means aren't your thing — or if wallet security is keeping you up at night — then this SecondMarket product might be worth considering.  5. Zynga (NASDAQ)  When the social gaming giant Zynga announced it would start testing bitcoin payments on 4th January, the news added 10 percentage points to its stock price to a high of $4.059 in intra-day trading.  The price has trended upwards to a $4.23 on 8th January before tapering slightly to about $4.10 at the time of writing.  The games company hasn't announced the outcome of its bitcoin trial yet. It is working with payment processor BitPay to accept bitcoins for in-game purchases. The firm reported annual revenues of $1.28bn in 2012 but a net loss of $209m.  Its stock has languished at around $4 for much of the last 18 months. It's a far cry from its exuberant opening-day price of $10, which then steadily climbed to an all-time high of $15 in March 2012, before falling into a steady decline.  It's unclear at this point whether Zynga will continue to support bitcoin adoption within its portfolio of games. But with $1bn in sales, the company could be a natural ally to bitcoin bulls if the results of its current trial prove positive.

42425250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvnxh,1389673714,GoCoin Adds Litecoin to Payment Offering,"Bitcoin payment processor GoCoin is now accepting litecoin. The firm, formed in July, expanded its portfolio to include the altcurrency this week.  “Litecoin has reached the tipping point in our minds with sufficient liquidity to support merchant activities,” said GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard. “Like with our bitcoin interface, we are building in safeguards in the event the volatility becomes extreme in the wrong direction.  GoCoin, which raised $550,000 in venture funding in November, has been testing litecoin services with early adopters since late last month.  “We have not been focused on volume, we've been focused on functionality and workflow so we can scale quickly,” Beauregard said.  Roughly 20 merchants a day are signing up for the service, which offers the same transaction fees as for GoCoin’s bitcoin processing: 1% for the first $2,500 per month, decreasing after that on a sliding scale.  The firm offers an open API, client libraries for PHP, Java, and Node.js for developers that want to integrate with their own websites. It will shortly follow this up with integration options for Microsoft’s .Net.  Merchants can retrieve their payments either in altcoins or in periodic wires of fiat currency based on thresholds that they set.  GoCoin isn’t the first firm to offer litecoin-based payment processing for vendors. Kojn and CoinPayments also accept the altcurrency.  The more the merrier, said Charles Lee, litecoin’s founder. “I am very excited about GoCoin supporting Litecoin. As I've always said, the end goal is merchant adoption,” he said, pointing to Overstock’s adoption of bitcoin via Coinbase last week. “People are starting to realize that bitcoin/litecoin is a great one-two punch,” he continued. “I'm looking forward to seeing Litecoin being accepted everywhere.""  Lee works for Coinbase, a dominant payment processor in the bitcoin market that is not supporting Litecoin. “We think Litecoin is great, but no current plans to add support,” confirmed Brian Armstrong, CEO for Coinbase. “There is enough complexity trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream right now, and we don't want to add any additional confusion. For people who are first learning about digital currency, the learning curve can be quite steep.  Beauregard differentiated himself from Coinbase, which offers a wallet and bitcoin sales alongside its merchant services.  “GoCoin has a laser focus on providing services to merchants and not trying to be all things to all people out of the gate,” he said. “We will align with other best of breed solutions like ExpressCoin that have an equally sound focus to provide integrated solutions.”  He also identified a ""second movers advantage,"" much as Google did with AltaVista and Yahoo!. GoCoin’s offshore status (its headquarters are in Singapore) also protects it from regulatory pressures, he added.  The firm will support other altcoins in the future but has no specific candidates yet.

42425257,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoBh,1389669792,Get Paid in Bitcoin With BitPay's New Payroll API,"What's the easiest way to get bitcoins into your wallet? Answer: Get paid in bitcoin. BitPay, the world's largest digital currency payment processor, now lets employees do that with the beta release of its Bitcoin Payroll API for employers.  ""For the longest time the hard question was ‘How do I buy bitcoin?'"" said Tony Gallippi, co-founder and CEO of BitPay.  ""Now the answer is easy: ‘Ask your employer.'""  American W-2 employees (see below) can elect to have all, or part, of their salary paid in bitcoin for every pay period. It works as a 'net payroll deduction', meaning taxes and garnishes are removed from an employee's gross income first, and the bitcoin portion is deducted from take-home pay.  What about the IRS?  This system works better for employees worried about how they might be affected by tax issues.  ""Since all payroll and withholding taxes are taken out first from the employee’s gross income, bitcoins can be sent from the net pay tax-free, and the employer’s gross income reporting to the IRS remains unchanged,"" said Bryan Kohn, BitPay's CFO.  For now, the beta release is open to employers in Georgia or South Carolina, and other licensed payroll providers nationwide in the US.  In case you were wondering, yes, all 20 BitPay staff receive at least a portion of their salaries in bitcoin. Four of them, including CEO Tony Gallippi, receive 100% of their net pay in bitcoin.  It was after receiving requests from its own employees that BitPay decided to develop the API for others to use as well. The company has already used the system itself for over six months, and discovered workers at other companies were interested too.  ""We had enough requests to make the effort of creating the API worthwhile,"" said Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's VP of Marketing.  20,000 bitcoin merchants  BitPay is still the most popular bitcoin payment processor in the world, removing price volatility risk for curious-but-nervous merchants by converting their bitcoin income instantly into local currencies. Adding new merchants at a rate of 1,000 per week, the company also announced it now had over 20,000 bitcoin accepting businesses as clients. It is also the headline sponsor of the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida, from 24th-26th January.  In the US, a W-2 employee is a regular employee or contractor through an agency. W-2 employees have income tax, Social Security and Medicare withheld, while employers must pay 50% of those and have Workmen's Compensation coverage. They are also eligible for unemployment compensation.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.
