As previously reported, Bitsonar is an investment firm that managed to raise up to $2.5 million in crypto from investors worldwide and went bust this summer. Investors from the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ukraine and other countries currently cannot access their funds after Bitsonar froze withdrawals in February and the website went offline in August. Shtadchenko quit the company and publicly accused its founder of conducting an exit scam.      Now he is asking U.S. law enforcement to take action against Alexander Tovstenko, Bitsonar's founder and a former clerk in the Ukrainian government.      Shtadchenko said he filed his notice of criminal offence with the Federal Bureau of Investigation through the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, where he is based, and shared the document with CoinDesk. According to the notice, Shtadchenko was hired by Tovstenko in mid-2018 ""to provide consulting services"" on marketing strategy and website development.      In the spring of 2020, however, Shtadchenko ""became aware that Bitsonar was actually a financial pyramid and all its activities were aimed at attracting investments with no intention of returning it,"" the notice reads.      Read more: Whistleblower Kidnapped in Ukraine After Accusing Crypto Firm of Exit Scam      He also figured out the trading bot that was supposed to earn money for Bistonar's investors was, in fact, ""operated manually, which is a clear sign of a deliberate fraud,"" he wrote.      In his notice, Shtadchenko accused Tovstenko of six criminal offences, including bank fraud, securities fraud and major fraud against the United States. He told CoinDesk he was also planning to find complaints with Europol (Interpol's European branch) and Ukrainian law enforcement.      In July, Shtadchenko gave an interview to the Russian-language crypto publication Forklog under the pseudonym Jan Novak, accusing Tovstenko of exit scamming. He also published his accusations against Tovstenko on Bitsonar's old website, providing Tovstenko's contact information and accounts in social networks.      On Aug. 27, Shtadchenko went missing in Kyiv but resurfaced four days later, saying that an apparent kidnapping was actually a special operation by Ukrainian law enforcement. The same day, the Security Service of Ukraine announced that it prevented the contract killing of ""an IT businessman"" working for a cryptocurrency company and arrested his ""partner,"" who put a bounty of $5,000 on his head.

CryptoCompare said crypto derivative volumes rose 54% to more than $710 billion in August in its monthly Exchange Review.  That's a new all-time high, with August's figures now far exceeding the $602 billion monthly volumes reported in May.  Spot markets also experienced a surge in activity, with August trading volumes coming to $820 billion – nearly $400 billion up from July's numbers.  Constantine Tsavliris, CryptoCompare's head of research, told CoinDesk that the surge in crypto derivative volumes was likely a result of last month's rally, which brought bitcoin from $9,200 to near $12,400 at its peak.  Spot price movement and volatility were higher in August than July, said Tsavliris.  As a rule, this generally leads to greater trading activity for cryptocurrencies and their derivatives.  Derivative volumes soared to then-record highs in May due to speculation surrounding the bitcoin halving event.  Volumes in March were also high, primarily as a result of the pandemic and the ensuing global sell-off in both crypto and traditional markets.  Derivative volumes in June and July were lower, at $445 billion and $393 billion respectively, when volatility was stuck in the doldrums.

Since it is similar to other financial assets, ""Bitcoin should be traded like a stock. That is the only legal status that it can get, and it should get this status,"" Kapoor, who created the BEGIN India think tank, told BusinessWorld on Monday.  Kapoor was against the idea of legalizing bitcoin as currency, however.  ""You make it legal and you might put the entire economy of the country at stake,"" he argued, describing bitcoin as a ""private currency.""  Nischal Shetty, CEO of Mumbai-based crypto exchange WazirX, opposed the idea of regulating bitcoin like stocks.  ""Bitcoin is not a slice of a company that you can buy or invest in. Rather, it is seen as an asset, like gold for example. Hence, it can't be seen a stock,"" Shetty told CoinDesk.  Kapoor's call for regulation came as part of an interview about fears around the use of cryptocurrencies in terrorism-financing schemes.  The U.S. recently seized millions of dollars in bitcoin and more than 300 cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the terrorist organizations al-Qaeda and Hamas.  Kapoor pointed out India has yet to officially recognize cryptocurrency-based crimes.  ""I would want senior people from investigative and law enforcement agencies to first at least know about it and to know what is the world moving towards,"" he said.  At present, the regulatory environment in India remains uncertain, with the government said to have been considering an outright ban.  As per a Nikkei article retweeted by Syed Akbaruddin, India's former United Nations envoy, the government is now preparing to debate the possible cryptocurrency options.  Ratan Sharda, author, editor and TV panelist, told BusinessWorld for the same article that banning would not work, and the ideal way is to make cryptocurrencies legal and ensure everything is tracked.  ""Just like you cannot ban porn, you cannot ban cryptocurrency,"" Sharda said.  The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) is currently developing a code of conduct for cryptocurrency firms in the nation.  ""This will also curb illegal activities as well as scams,"" said Shetty, whose exchange is a member of the association.

While the matter is still under discussion, some developers worry tokenized gas could one day act as a “price floor” for transaction fees and keep them permanently high.      As fees hit record highs twice in the same week, developer Alexey Akhunov’s June Ethereum Improvement Proposal to get rid of gas tokens, (EIP) 2751, is getting renewed attention.      Akhunov’s napkin math in the Ethereum Research and Developers messaging app shows that about 1.5% to 2% of Ethereum transactions over the summer used a prepaid gas token. Moreover, many algorithmic traders have similar setups that Akhunov’s analysis does not capture, developer Ali Atiia added.      See also: BitGo Weighs Building a Sidechain for WBTC as Ethereum Fees Climb      “Transaction pools are basically like a one-sided order book where you bid for the gas prices. Those orders placed in a particular place are to make sure you buy the dips, like in the traditional two-way order book,” Akhunov said on Friday’s biweekly developer call, adding that he is still conducting analysis on the magnitude of gas token usage.    Paid to prune    Blockchains, at their very core, are data settlement layers. Some data is more valuable than other data and maintaining data on-chain is a cost node runners have to bear.      Ethereum tries to mitigate this problem by offering ether (ETH) back for deleting old contracts or information from contracts. This, some claim, is now being gamed to nab lower transaction fees.      Originally concocted by a handful of academics and developers out of crypto commodities study group Project Chicago in 2017, tokenized gas is, at its core, a small script you run when you send a transaction. That script deletes previous data stored on a gas token smart contract when fees were lower.      The network rewards you for deleting the old data. If the price of sending an Ethereum transaction is high enough, the tokenized gas (which deletes the data) can subsidize up to 50% of it. That comes in handy at a time when the decentralized finance (DeFi) craze is pushing Ethereum fees to new records.      See also: Ethereum Developers Consider New Fee Model as Gas Costs Climb      “In principle, GasToken can thus be used to reduce that gas cost of any transaction, in DeFi or other applications,” GasToken co-creator Florian Tramèr told CoinDesk in an email.      Some, such as Akhunov, warn the result could be a permanently high fee market. Developer Philippe Castonguay, on the other hand, says it merely smooths out the fee market. Indeed, there are secondary markets for gas tokens such as aggregator 1.Inch’s chi (CHI) token, which launched in May.      Of course, gas tokens are merely one issue in the fee market right now. DeFi applications such as Uniswap or Chainlink remain among the top gas-guzzlers, according to Ethgasstation. And then there are stablecoins such as tether (USDT) or USD coin (USDC), which continue to rise in popularity.",NEUTRAL,ETH | USDT,ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/07/ethereum-developers-weigh-gas-rule-change-to-ease-fee-pressure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f30d1f2c21f5b766d6c9b823101562c27ebbf14-1200x836.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAkoAZ,1599475405,"Investors Buying Bitcoin Amid Price Slump to Near $10K, Data Shows","Despite significant losses for bitcoin since mid-August, the ""buy the dip"" mentality in the crypto markets is still strong, blockchain data suggests.    While the cryptocurrency has declined from $12,400 to $10,000 in the past three weeks, the number of ""accumulation addresses"" has increased by 2% to 513,000, according to data source Glassnode.  ""Lots of new daily buyers are coming in to absorb supply,"" Su Zhu, CEO of Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Accumulation addresses are those that have at least two incoming non-dust transfers (representing minuscule amounts of bitcoin) and have never spent funds.  The metric excludes addresses belonging to miners and exchanges, and addresses active more than seven years ago to exclude lost coins.  The divergence between prices and accumulation addresses suggests that investors view the recent price drop as a typical bull market pullback and expect prices to rise once more.  ""Markets typically retrace one third or more in a bull market after local euphoria,"" Zhu tweeted on Friday, suggesting prices could drop to as low as $8,800 and still be a ""healthy target.""  Bitcoin fell by over 10% on Thursday, confirming a head-and-shoulders breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern – and a violation of the six-month-long bull market trendline.  Usually, such patterns invite more substantial chart-driven selling, yielding deeper price declines.  So far, bitcoin has managed to defend the $10,000 support – possibly a sign of an underlying bullish tone in the market.  ""I am flabbergasted by the strength shown at $10,000, and it probably means $100,000 is more likely than $5,000 at this stage,"" Zhu said in another tweet.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $10,117, representing a 1.59% decline on the day.

Ziglu announced Monday it had launched peer-to-peer payments for supported cryptocurrencies as well as pound sterling.  This means users can send and receive assets to and from any other Ziglu user instantly, according to a press release.  The news comes a week after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved the payments platform as an EMI – which authorizes it to store and facilitate the transaction of digital forms of money.  While an EMI license authorizes Ziglu to perform some of the functions associated with traditional banks, it isn't the same as a full banking license and doesn't give the platform the ability to issue loans or to offer interest on balances.  Ziglu was founded by Mark Hipperson, the former CTO of London-based challenger bank Starling.  The app launched in mid-June and announced a £5.25 million (roughly $6.9 million) seed round just two weeks later.  Ziglu currently supports bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash, with XRP due to be added later this month.  The platform says it will list other digital assets based on customer demand.  Cryptocurrencies held on Ziglu are insured up to £50,000 (around $66,000).    EDIT (Feb. 8, 2021): Removed reference to Mark Hipperson being a co-founder of Starling Bank.

42384619,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAknsx,1599470031,Binance Unveils New Product for 'Yield Farming' Crypto Assets,"Popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance has released Launchpool, a way for users to make income by staking tokens for so-called yield farming.    According to a Binance announcement on Sunday, users of Launchpool will be able to stake Binance's BNB token and BUSD stablecoin, as well as the ARPA token, for interest-bearing rewards.  The first project to be hosted on Launchpool is Bella Protocol (BEL), which recently raised $4M in a seed funding round led by Arrington XRP Capital.  The BEL project aims to fix the complex user experience issues related to DeFi assets, such as the need to hop among different protocols and platforms in search of higher yields.  Users will be able to stake their tokens in three separate pools to farm – earn profits by providing staked liquidity – BEL tokens over a 30 day period starting Wednesday.  A week later, on Sept. 16, Binance will list BEL for trading and open trading pairs on its exchange for BEL/BTC, BEL/BNB, BEL/BUSD and BEL/USDT.  The news comes on the heels of Binance's recent mainnet launch of its smart contract-enabled blockchain and introduction of staking for its BNB token.  It also launched a new DeFi-like platform last week, allowing trades via an automated market maker exchange.  Staking involves committing funds as collateral onto an existing protocol in order to increase the liquidity of a project and brings voting rights to help decide on governance issues.  Stakers in such decentralized finance projects earn rewards in the form of interest ranging generally up to 10%, though it can be much higher, according to DeFi Rate.  For Launchpool, Binance is offering BEL rewards at 1% for users staking ARPA, 9% for staking BUSD and, it claims, 90% for staking BNB.    See also: What Is Yield Farming?

As reported by the Financial Standard, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), New South Wales resident John Bigatton may not work in financial services for the multi-year period.  An investigation is still ongoing, per the report.  ASIC made the ruling after it was discovered Bigatton had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in promoting BitConnect.  Bigatton was an Australian national representative of cryptocurrency platform BitConnect, as well as its investment scheme BitConnect Lending Platform, between 2017 and 2018.  Over that time, the watchdog alleges Bigatton provided unlicensed financial product advice that was deceptive, misleading or likely to mislead investors, regarding the BitConnect scheme.  ASIC found Bigatton not to be a ""fit and proper person to provide financial services,"" ""not adequately trained"" and was ""likely to contravene a financial services law.""  Bigatton now has the right to appeal ASIC's decision at Australia's Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  BitConnect was a cryptocurrency investment scheme that encouraged investors to exchange bitcoin for its own BitConnect Coin (BCC) promising high-interest returns.  It has been alleged to be a fraud in various lawsuits.  In January 2018, the Texas State Securities Board ordered BitConnect to cancel another planned token sale, ruling the proposed token qualified as an unregistered security.  Weeks later, BCC's price collapsed amid news BitConnect's lending and exchange operation was shutting down.  That came after state regulators issued cease and desist orders over the scheme's failure to register its services and offerings under securities rules.

42384630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAko31,1599448620,Fishy Business: What Happened to $1.2B DeFi Protocol SushiSwap Over the Weekend,"SushiSwap investors were handed a raw deal over the weekend after the pseudonymous founder of the $1.27 billion, 1.5-week-old decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol cashed out.      A fork of DeFi darling Uniswap, SushiSwap is the brainchild of a pseudonymous founder, Chef Nomi, who took the former project an extra yard by adding rewards for providing liquidity to the exchange through a liquidity provider token (LP), called sushi (SUSHI), that earns a portion of the AMM’s revenue.      In essence, AMM’s provide the infrastructure to match lightly traded tokens with liquidity. A variant of other decentralized exchange (DEX) experiments, Uniswap has grown to be the largest AMM with volumes nearing those of centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Pro.      The episode underscores the complexity, creativity and unpredictability of the white-hot DeFi space, where more than $8 billion worth of cryptocurrency is currently locked up in smart contracts, according to DefiPulse.      But, as sushi investors discovered Saturday, putting money into an unaudited contract controlled by an unknown founder was not a great idea after Chef Nomi unexpectedly sold his share of LP tokens Saturday.      As reported by The Block, Chef Nomi swapped his Sushi LP tokens for some 37,400 ether (ETH) worth about $13 million in what bears strong resemblance to an “exit scam.”      The sushi token immediately fell 73% in price, dropping from $4.44 to $1.20 over the subsequent 18 hours, according to CoinGecko. The token is now trading hands at $3.16 as of publishing time.    Control-C, Control-V    Long story short, adding a native token to an AMM was a good idea, or at the very least one that sparked digital bread and circuses.      Chef Nomi launched the Uniswap rival Aug. 28.      Eleven days later on Sept. 6, $1.27 billion is “locked” in Sushi contracts. That’s equivalent to 77.4% of Uniswap’s tradable assets, according to Sushiboard.      Read more: Uniswap Rises to Top of DeFi Charts Thanks to Rival Looking to Unseat It      SushiSwap's transcendence to DeFi unicorn was made possible through an innovative leaching of its rival, Uniswap. Chef Nomi bootstrapped SushiSwap by leaning on Uniswap’s popularity within DeFi circles.      In a technique called “Zombie mining,” SushiSwap gave extra LP tokens for users providing liquidity to the ether/sushi pool on Uniswap. LP rewards, moreover, were ten times higher than they would normally run up to a certain time. That created a mad rush to earn LP tokens through farming Sushi on Uniswap as shown by an exponential rise in Uniswap volume late last week.      Zombie mining has an end game. Chef Nomi planned on “migrating” the liquidity created on Uniswap through token dispersals to SushiSwap once enough volume was created. As CoinDesk reported Friday, that day moved to Sunday as the AMM continued to attract outsized demand.    'Chef Nomi sucks'    But then everything changed when Chef Nomi attacked.      The founder, who ostensibly became a multi-millionaire by merely copying and pasting Uniswap’s code, shortly became the center of a Twitter doxxing campaign. His identity has yet to be confirmed.      Meanwhile, Chef Nomi, DeFi founders and sushi investors became engaged in verbal sparring.      Chef Nomi declared his intention to stick with the Sushi protocol and that his Sushi sale was well within his rights as a founder.      Others, such as FTX CEO and sushi investor Sam Bankman-Fried, were not enthused about that decision: “First of all, Chef Nomi sucks,” he tweeted Sept. 5.      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment      Yet, the clock kept ticking on the planned migration from Uniswap to SushiSwap. And, at this point, virtually no one trusted Chef Nomi to undertake the transfer in an honest fashion.      Through push and pull, Chef Nomi decided to give up his keys to the SushiSwap contract he and he alone held. To boot, the contract to the $1.25 billion protocol was given to none other than Bankman-Fried, who canceled the migration.      The entire exchange took place on Twitter Sunday with Chef Nomi lamenting his position. “Again I did not intend to do any harm. I'm sorry if my decision did not follow what you expected,” he tweeted.      As of now, Bankman-Fried controls the SushiSwap contract. In a Discord message, he said he plans to move the contract to a multi-signature contract until the project can be fully decentralized into the hands of SushiSwap LP token holders, similarly to other DeFi protocols.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | UNI,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/07/fishy-business-what-happened-to-12b-defi-protocol-sushiswap-over-the-weekend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5786facc646d352d1ccc3a0e5cb931f259835ea4-1500x1117.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
