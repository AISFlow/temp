13221307,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=481568,1642636773,Ethereum The New Hard Money?,"A debate arose about the possibility of Ethereum becoming hard money and ended up highlighting more downsides to the digital asset than anything else. The founder of a Bitcoin investments managing platform, Charles Edwards, shared a chart that showed the circulating supply activity of Ethereum and Bitcoin and argued that &apos;Ethereum has entered the hard money game. For the past 3 months, Ethereum&apos;s inflation rate has been lower than Bitcoin.&apos; &apos;Hard money is not only about low inflation of supply, it is also about immutability of inflation - oil is not suddely hard money even when OPEC decides that supply rates are throttled.&apos; -Twitter user @alpha_authority Related Reading | Solo Ethereum Miner Hits The Jackpot With 170 ETH For Mining A Block Hard Cash Or Hard Fees?

42423892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hefh,1642634824,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Slides Under $42K; Altcoins Fall,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin's price drops below $42,000 on continued concerns about macroeconomic conditions.  Technician's take: BTC Buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day as momentum improves.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,866 -1.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,144 -1.7%  Top gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cardano ADA +9.1% Smart Contract Platform Litecoin LTC +4.0% Currency`  Top losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −7.9% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK −7.2% Computing Polkadot DOT −7.2% Smart Contract Platform`  Markets  S&P 500: $4,532 -0.9%  DJIA: $35,028 -0.9%  Nasdaq: $14.340 -1.1%  Gold: $1,840 +1.4%  Market moves  Bitcoin continued to slide, falling under $42,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been languishing well off last week's high as investors worry about dicey macroeconomic conditions, including supply chain issues, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, rising inflation and a slump in technology markets.  At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at $41,866, down 1.4% for the day.  ""The market is digesting a number of things,"" Osprey Funds founder and CEO Greg King told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday. He added: ""Risk assets like crypto are going to sell off or experience a bit of churn as the market adjusts to a different macro environment.""  Ether followed a similar path and was slightly down for the day, trading between $3,000 and $3,200 throughout the previous 24 hours. At the time of publication, ether was at 3,144, a 1.7% drop for this period. Most of the major altcoins spent their day in the red.  King noted the impact of inflation on the economy, which he said ""nibbles away at your purchasing power over long periods of time,"" and highlighted the correlation between the recent decline in tech stocks and crypto. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.1% and is off over 10% from its all-time high November. Shifts of more than 10% are thought of as market corrections. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both dropped nearly 1%.  Still, King sees crypto rebounding in the long term. ""We are still bullish on the space and I would suspect that, at the end of the year, values will be much higher than they are.""  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $40K; Faces Resistance at $43K-$45K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold support above $40,000 as momentum improves on intraday charts.  The cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past week, although multiple oversold readings suggest buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day.  Still, upside appears to be limited toward the $43,000-$45,000 resistance zone. And $48,000 could present another hurdle for buyers given the series of lower price highs since November.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart approached an oversold level on Tuesday, similar to what occurred on Jan. 5, which preceded a near 10% price bounce a few days later.  On the daily chart, the RSI has remained in oversold/neutral territory for about a month, which is common during a price downtrend.

The digital asset&apos;s downtrend had then promptly dragged their metrics like implied volatility down with it. This decline has been even sharper as bears have gotten a tighter grip on the market. For some, this could be bad news. However, for others, it could mean a period of opportunity. Bitcoin Implied Volatility Crumbles Bitcoin&apos;s implied volatility is a metric that is used to illustrate investor expectations of future price volatility of the digital asset going forward. This metric is not only prominent in the crypto space but is used across a number of actives to map out investor expectations over time when it comes to volatility. If this metric is high, then investors are clearly expecting price volatility to be on the high side going forward, which is why this is an important metric for investors, especially those invested for the short term.

He added that the same day, “all of the accounts that were affected were reimbursed so there was no loss of customer funds.”  According to on-chain data, approximately $15 million in ether (4,600 ETH) was stolen in the attack and being laundered via Tornado Cash, although Marszalek would not say on Wednesday how much money had been taken. He said Crypto.com would release a post-mortem in a few days that would include the final amount.

42411552,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOoKb,1642631356,The Balance Between Art and IP Theft in NFT Culture,"The most popular show in Netflix history, “Squid Game,” earned an estimated $900 million for the streaming company. And the producers are not stopping there. They are gearing up for even more revenue as they look towards season two and have secured more than two dozen trademarks for the property as they tee up a range of merchandising and licensing deals.  Sam Ewen is the head of CoinDesk Studios.  What the company did not approve of in their effort to grow their bags were the non-fungible token (NFT) collections for The Squid NFT, Squid Game Cardhttps://opensea.io/collection/squid-game-card-nft. The two derivative franchises – one a play-to-earn contest, the other a “Squid Game Metaverse” – have brought in a combined 245 ETH ($776,685 at current pricing) in secondary sales on OpenSea. Neither has ties to Netflix or the show’s creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Neither did the Squid Game token that ended up in a rug pull back in November that left many investors wishing they had chosen not to play.  In fact, none of the 682,569 items listed when searching Squid Game on OpenSea have any relationship with the intellectual property (IP) holder as it has not licensed anyone to use the trademark for a digital blockchain asset. Yet, all of these derivatives and, frankly, some direct stolen imagery are available for purchase or trade on the world’s largest NFT platform.  Memes and derivatives are at the heart of internet and NFT culture. Constantly evolving remixed combinations of image, audio, text, collage, video clips and more speak for us as much as they speak to us (the idea that people use memes to both represent their feelings and see their own perspectives reflected back to them in the feeds of those they follow or friend). But once you add in a creator-first economic marketplace and the value that some NFT collections have attained, trademark owners are starting to wonder why others are profiting off of their intellectual property.  NFTs themselves are not the issue, it is what the seller does with it. “NFTs themselves don't really implicate copyright at all, because they typically just consist of a URL pointing to an image,” Brian Frye, a professor at the U.K. Rosenberg College of Law told me. “But putting the image at the URL does implicate copyright and is typically infringing if the person putting it at the URL doesn't own the copyright or have permission to use the image in that way.”  Recently, in the “this is why we can’t have nice things” camp of creative opportunity, when brands and lawyers get involved, the anything goes approach to art and expression is starting to get reigned in. We saw the same thing in the late 1980s when the music industry targeted hip-hop in regards to sampling and a similar technology policing is coming for NFTs.  Just recently Non-Fungible Olive Gardens, the project that promised ownership of a virtual franchise of the family-friendly restaurant started selling 880 NFTs of different Olive Garden locations. They went on sale for $20 each and prices climbed. Within days one sold for 100 times the initial offering price. The meme value alone drove a ton of conversation on Crypto Twitter as more than 500 collectors purchased the tokens at rising values.  That is, until Darden Concepts, the owner of the actual Olive Garden chain, sent a DMCA takedown order to OpenSea, which complied and the collection was removed. We have seen how this plays out before. Back in the early YouTube days there were thousands of music videos and movie clips, so much so that the industry could not catch up. It took machine learning and broad licensing deals to to help stem the tide, if only partially still to this day.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - What You Own When You Own an NFT  What is copyrightable and what is artistic interpretation is a matter of open and ongoing debate. “Copyright law provides a ‘bundle of rights’ which are exclusive to the owner of the copyright in a work. These rights include the right to reproduce, prepare derivatives, distribute copies, publicly perform, and publicly display,” Moish E. Peltz, an NFT lawyer recently said.  Yet, IP expert Frye says, “If a copyrighted image is used in a critical, parodic or scholarly way, it could be fair use and therefore non-infringing. A caveat is that NFT projects are a commercial use, especially if you are selling a lot of NFTs of a particular image, which could cut against a fair use finding.”  That’s a pretty wide interpretation gap, which may challenge those creators pushing the limits of what is art and what is trademark infringement when it comes to NFTs.  Another example of legal murkiness around NFTs: the on-going battle between Hermès and artist Mason Rothschild surrounding the latter’s MetaBirkins. Not only did Rothschild put “Birkin” (an iconic ladies’ bag) in the name of the NFT collection, but he uses the signature silhouette of the product along some of the notable accessories, a padlock for example, in many of the works. Legally, brands often secure not only their logo marks but can trademark everything from a tone to a silhouette. Just as Harley Davidson owns its engine sound and CocaCola owns the shape of its bottle, it would seem Hermès is on good footing in this case. Additionally, that Rothschild did not create one artistic derivative but in essence has a “product line” of 100 highly valuable digital goods could lead one to think of his presence on Rarible as more of a storefront than an art gallery.  “It’s more irksome to see the work of gifted digital artists being ripped off, but there seems no shortage of brand IP in the mix, much of which is done without a lot of care or imagination,” says Matthew Davis, who co-authored early NFT patents at Nike dubbed “Cryptokicks.” “This has more to do with the unfortunately transactional dimension of all this. I could see brands having a more open mind were it not so derivative, messy and engineered for profit.”  Cultural brands are probably the easiest target for copyright infringement and have the widest collector base. Searches on NFT platforms for Supreme, adidas, PlayStation, Gucci, LEGO, Off-White and others yield countless results and representations of brands, often in ways that would make any brand creative director want to quit the business. But it isn’t just the fashion industry. Ford, Ikea, KFC and many other logos are slapped on NFT projects for sale or auction.  Not only is the line between brand and NFT creative use blurring but determining who owns the rights to sell NFTs between an IP owner and those who originally came up with the concept can be troublesome. Nobody would challenge that Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed “Pulp Fiction.” But Miramax is still trying to block him from selling the pages from his handwritten script as NFTs, arguing it holds the IP rights to the work.  Read more: The Bored Ape Founders Haven’t Yet Joined the Yacht Club  Creators of original memes do have copyright protection on their initial work. For example, Chris Torres, who created Nyan Cat, sold a unique version of the much-copied and duplicated meme for almost $600,000 early last year.  As more companies and brands jump into NFTs and the metaverse we should expect that they and their legal teams will be aggressively challenging those who are trying to profit off of their trademarks. Meanwhile, popular properties like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Crypto Punks, Aku Dreams and World of Women may face similar issues of infringement against their own work (there are already plenty of Ape copycats).  As Web 2 transitions into a decentralized Web 3, it is bringing tremendous opportunities for many builders and creators. But as both the music industry and YouTube have taught us, you can only go so far on stolen IP. Combine that with the blockchain’s unique trackability of asset ownership and this time it is not only the creators who may pay the price but the collectors as well.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Ewen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/19/the-balance-between-art-and-ip-theft-in-nft-culture,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6eacd072debf53ec3411531ba14aa8ffe9cda02c-2068x1332.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The United States GAO (Government Accountability Office) blames crypto kiosks for increasing drug trafficking and human trafficking.

42423890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hebh,1642629010,MLB NFTs on Candy Digital Clock $2.7M in Marketplace Debut,"Candy Digital, which started selling Major League Baseball (MLB) NFTs in the fall, finally opened its trading venue on Jan. 15.  And the appetite for sales was fairly robust.  The Galaxy Digital-backed non-fungible token marketplace, which announced its partnership with the MLB in June, posted $2.7 million in weekend sales, passing $1 million in trade volume within the platform’s first eight hours.  The trading volume, for now, rivals that of Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot, which has seen roughly $2 million in sales each day of January, a representative told CoinDesk. The sales figures offer another glimpse at an NFT market that has weathered a general downturn in crypto prices from 2021’s frothy highs. NFT marketplace OpenSea, for example, has seen its highest volume month ever so far in January while ETH, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has sagged 15% over the same time period.  Candy’s MLB marketplace runs on the Palm blockchain, which the company tapped for its low transaction costs. While Candy’s debut Lou Gehrig NFT collection was released on Ethereum, still boasting a 4.5 ETH (roughly $14,400) floor price on the popular secondary market OpenSea, the platform sees the network's gas fees as unsustainable to its business model.  “If you're selling products for $20 or $50, dealing with gas costs and transaction speeds on [Ethereum] mainnet is an issue, and the gas costs on Palm are close to zero,” Scott Lawin, CEO of Candy Digital, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Read more: Galaxy Digital-Backed Candy Digital Launches, Inks Debut Deal With MLB  It’s a sentiment that’s become common in today’s NFT landscape, with non-Ethereum marketplaces on blockchains like Solana and Flow finding their niches among largely non-crypto-native audiences. (Many platforms, like Candy, accept only fiat currency.)  Product plans  Lawin says the platform is preparing to introduce “eight to 10 different types of NFT products” with MLB over the course of next year, ranging from high-value, limited-edition drops to utility-based momentos without much secondary market potential.  “We have a thesis that there is no one-size-fits-all,” Lawin said. “And so we're building, as I said, these ecosystems of products that appeal to lots of different types of collectors.”  Investors seem to agree with the concept’s potential, having backed the platform with a $100 million funding round at a $1.5 billion valuation in October.

42423894,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hejh,1642627428,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes; Analysts See Relative Value in Altcoins,"Bitcoin traded around the $41,000 on Wednesday as some traders appeared to be in no rush to pick a price bottom. Analysts see the potential for a short-term price bounce, especially as technical indicators have remained in oversold territory for about a month.  ""Investors and traders appear to be digesting the macro possibilities within this new inflationary regime markets have entered, alongside an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve,"" Will Hamilton, head of trading and research at Trovio Capital Management, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley stated that the imminent start of central bank tightening is putting pressure on the crypto market. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has tracked the growth of global money supply, which peaked in February 2021 (two months before a 50% drop in BTC's price), according to Morgan Stanley.  For now, some traders are still finding relative value in some alternative cryptocurrencies. Relative value is a method of determining an asset's worth that takes into account the value of similar assets.  ""Lower demand for bitcoin has been driven by market participants shifting focus towards outperforming mid-cap assets, including Fantom and FTT, which have returned ~31% and ~15% respectively during the past week,"" Hamilton stated, referring to the Fantom smart contract platform and the FTT token associated with crypto exchange FTX.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $41703, −0.19%    ●Ether (ETH): $3120, −0.15%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4533, −0.97%    ●Gold: $1844 per troy ounce, +1.72%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.83%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  GBTC discount widens  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares have widened their discount relative to the underlying cryptocurrency held in the fund, reaching a record of 26.5% on Wednesday.  GBTC has been the preferred venue for institutional investors to gain exposure to crypto without having to purchase bitcoin directly, but the shares have traded at a steep discount over the past year as demand for the product shrank. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  ""There's still no way for bitcoin to ever leave GBTC, which means it should continue to trade with a substantial discount to reflect that illiquidity,"" David Nadig, director of research and chief investment officer at ETFTrends.com, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Bitcoin dominance stabilizes  Bitcoin's market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, or the BTC dominance ratio, is starting to stabilize around 40%. That's the lowest level since 2018, which was when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experienced greater price declines than BTC. Crypto investors tend to seek relative safety in bitcoin during times of market stress.  For now, it appears that bitcoin's dominance ratio could have further room to drop toward the 2018 low of around 36%. Some analysts expect a continued rotation to alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens due to their many use-cases compared to bitcoin's appeal as a store of value.  ""FTM, LUNA, ATOM and MATIC have exhibited relative strength among the larger market-cap altcoins, with upcoming product updates prevalent in these pairs,"" FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a Wednesday newsletter.  Also, a number of Ethereum competitors are starting to gain market share.  ""Despite major developments in the bitcoin market, the current market narratives continue to lean towards emerging developments outside Ethereum and Bitcoin, namely Ethereum competitors, scaling solutions and OpenSea alternatives,"" 21Shares, a crypto investment firm, wrote in a report.  Altcoin roundup  Cardano's ADA token leads crypto majors lower: Earlier on Wednesday, ADA dropped about 10% along with smaller declines in other altcoins such as MATIC and SOL. ADA's decline appears typical of a correction often seen after a notable price rally. The token jumped nearly 60% to $1.64 earlier this month, outperforming bitcoin as the impending launch of SundaeSwap, the first decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange on the Cardano blockchain, revved up investor interest in the cryptocurrency.  Active blockchain games on the rise: The prices of tokens for gaming projects like Axie Infinity have fallen recently, but user metrics in this subsector of cryptocurrencies are soaring. There are now 398 active blockchain games, defined as having at least one active wallet in the past 24 hours within the game, according to the data tracker DappRadar. That's a 92% increase from a year ago. Read more here.  Ethereum vs. Solana: Ethereum’s dominance in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is shrinking because of congestion and high gas fees, JPMorgan said in an analyst report. The network’s market share of NFTs has dropped to around 80% from about 95% at the start of 2021. JPMorgan cautions that if Ethereum’s loss of NFT market share continues in 2022, it could be a bigger problem for its valuation.

The Secret ecosystem fund will provide long-term financial and strategic support to developers and founders building on the network, SCRT Labs, the core development team behind the network, said in a blog post on Wednesday.  A long list of investment partners, including Alameda Research, Arrington Capital, CoinFund and DeFiance Capital, chipped in.  “The primary goal of the ecosystem fund is to ensure that every individual, team and organization building on Secret has a clear path to self-sustainability and support in bringing their products to market,” the Secret Network team wrote.

The pool will support decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, metaverse and other kinds of applications on the network.  SCRT was down about 3% on the day but started perking up around the time of the announcement, according to CoinGecko data.

42411545,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOo0l,1642619649,Meta Leans In to Tracking Your Emotions in the Metaverse,"New patents held by Facebook parent company Meta Platforms have given us an utterly predictable and bleak glimpse of Our Zucked Future. The concepts suggest that once its shared virtual space Horizon Worlds has reached its full potential, users’ facial expressions and other biological processes could be tracked and cataloged to make in-world advertising more effective. We should expect nothing less from a company whose main product is, in essence, mind control.  The patents, compiled by the Financial Times (FT), might or might not wind up in actual products. But several of them are conceptual layups that follow clearly from the one thing that Facebook has done effectively on the two-dimensional internet: spying on user behavior and using that data to target users with tailored advertising. Meta spokesman Nick Clegg effectively confirmed to FT that Horizon Worlds will rely on the same basic model of targeted advertising and commerce.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Meta is working to make sure that its tracking and targeting within Horizon Worlds, though, will be even better. (For the record, Horizon Worlds thus far appears to be a walled garden owned by one company. That is by definition not part of the “metaverse.”) That means it will gather even more data about users than Meta’s current sprawling surveillance apparatus – including, potentially, biometric data about the most intimate nuances of your real-world body.  One Meta patent found by the FT, for instance, would change media content based on the user’s facial expression through Meta’s virtual-reality headset. Another was for body-tracking hardware, nominally for use as an input controller, but also ripe for gathering data about users’ pose or other bodily data. A complementary patent would allow Meta’s customers (its advertisers, that is, not its users) to “sponsor the appearance of an object” in a virtual store.  These tools would allow Meta to track your moods and reactions and alter your metaverse experience to elicit the responses that best serve its business model. In the current version of the Facebook app, the desired response is broadly “engagement” – that is, reading, clicking, buying or otherwise interacting with a piece of content. As a variety of investigations have shown, Facebook/Meta over the years has relentlessly optimized for engagement, even when that engagement was with harmful content.  This could amount to a vastly deeper level of emotional influence than Meta already has over its users. Meta’s machine-learning models of individual biometric response data could be massively powerful for influencing users’ behavior, not just within Horizon Worlds, but anywhere online.  “My nightmare scenario is that targeted advertising based on our involuntary biological reactions to stimuli is going to start showing up in the metaverse,” a technology lawyer told the FT.  That presents immense privacy concerns, particularly given Facebook/Meta’s track record.  “These patent applications indicate that Meta has not learned its lesson, having been accused previously of storing users’ biometric data without permission,” Emma Taylor, a technology analyst at GlobalData, said in a statement, responding to the report. “It is likely that the same issues surrounding data privacy from existing social media platforms will be extended, or even exacerbated, in the metaverse.”  For investors, of course, all of this terrible prognostication just sounds like thousands of cash registers going “ka-ching.” If emotion-targeting ads work, they’ll be laughing all the way to the bank as Meta’s users cede their willpower. That demands a different question: Meta’s plans are just deliciously evil … but do they actually make sense as a business proposition? Investors are the main audience for the entire Meta project at this point – but what if they’re the ones getting snowed?  See also: Facebook, Walmart and How Companies Shouldn’t Set Up in the Metaverse | David Z. Morris  The focus on advertising is a good start if you’re a Meta stockholder. Targeted advertising is basically the only thing Facebook has ever actually done well. Check out this genuinely hilarious chart, on which Facebook’s “advertising” revenue is an up-and-to-the-right line, and “other” revenue is a worm crawling along the seafloor.  Even Google, whose revenue comes mostly from ads (80%), is much more diverse. Meta has no equivalent to Android, the Play Store or the Chromebook. It has consistently flubbed and fumbled its attempts to diversify. Arguably, its biggest expansion success was its acquisition of Instagram, which ended with the founders reportedly leaving acrimoniously. Mark Zuckerberg isn’t a genius, he’s the caretaker of an enhanced Hot or Not clone who will go to his senescence mumbling about Community from behind those doll-dead eyes while cashing a river of checks from Chinese factories making knockoff Skylanders fidget spinners.  So building an ad-backed social network BUT IN 3D is about as ambitious as investors should trust Meta to be. But despite the dire warnings, I wonder just how much actual advertising alpha Meta can generate from the emotional content of a facial expression. The real meat and potatoes of a social advertising platform is product and service sales, and understanding a user’s desires on that front relies mostly on text or language, searches they input or things they enthusiastically post about. Rest assured Meta will be tracking all of that within Horizon Worlds as well, but the addition of facial expression may turn out to be a marginal advance, at least in the short term.  And we must again return to the bare truth: Meta is just absolutely abysmal at actually building usable products. So far, Horizon Worlds looks incredibly low rent and generic, and being constantly targeted with tailored ads while creepily aware that your body is being tracked won’t make it more pleasant. I can’t imagine a critical mass of human beings wanting to spend enough time there for Meta to learn very much about them, however sophisticated the spy gear.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

Intel, one of the world’s largest chip makers, said on Jan. 18 it will unveil an “ultra low-voltage bitcoin mining ASIC” which will be a more efficient specialized mining computer, competing with current miners that are in the market. “The fact that a $200+ billion tech firm is providing solutions for Bitcoin mining is more confirmation of big players entering the crypto space,” said GlobalBlock’s analyst Marcus Sotiriou.  The chipmaker said its new miner will reduce power consumption by about 15%, Sotiriou said, adding that such an increase in efficiency will help more institutional investors to enter the sector as ESG (environmental, social and governance) is one of their key investment priorities. If such a scenario plays out, it will likely help support bitcoin’s price.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Crypto miner Griid Infrastructure, which is going public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Adit EdTech Acquisition Corp., has already signed a supply agreement with Intel to potentially buy the chip maker's new ASIC miners, according to a filing.  Meanwhile, payments giant Block said on Jan. 13 that it's going ahead with its plan to build an open-source bitcoin mining system to make “mining more distributed and efficient.” If this feature is integrated with Cash App, it might increase the use of bitcoin to pay for goods and services by its users, furthering bitcoin adoption by the masses, Sotiriou noted.  “If successful, this will dramatically increase bitcoin’s use case as a means of exchange, rather than just a store of value – this would result in significantly more adoption and hence help bitcoin reach price figures of over $100,000,” he said.  Bitcoin is now trading near $42,000 since reaching its all-time high of just under $69,000 in November.

In the new program with Bitfinex, users could receive up to 41% in annualized staking rewards by participating in the new MATIC program – but that is only ""available for a limited time,"" according to the post.  Bitfinex also warned that the estimated percentage was based on certain market assumptions and that ""this hypothetical is only an illustration and not a prediction or guarantee.""

GBTC has been the preferred venue for institutional investors to gain exposure to crypto without having to purchase bitcoin directly, but the shares have traded at a steep discount over the past year as demand for the product shrank. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The premium flipped to a discount last February, and the discount has steadily widened ever since due to several factors, including the launch of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Canada, which provided an alternative to those looking to invest in bitcoin through a stock market vehicle.  The persistent discount could also be due to investor skepticism regarding Grayscale's plan to convert the fund into a spot-based ETF. Some analysts don't expect a conversion anytime soon, and in the meantime, investors are getting charged fees.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn't approved a spot bitcoin ETF.  ""There's still no way for bitcoin to ever leave GBTC, which means it should continue to trade with a substantial discount to reflect that illiquidity,"" Dave Nadig, director of research and chief investment officer at ETFTrends.com, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  The recent crypto sell-off also may have contributed to a wider GBTC discount.

The search giant had previously retreated from a push into banking, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news of the hire.  Goldberg’s hire is part of a broader strategy for the company to incorporate a wider range of financial services, including cryptocurrencies, Google’s president of commerce, Bill Ready, told Bloomberg. Google has historically avoided offering crypto as part of its financial services.  “Crypto is something we pay a lot of attention to,” Ready told Bloomberg. “As user demand and merchant demand evolves, we’ll evolve with it."" Google declined to provide additional detail to CoinDesk about its crypto plans.  Arnold previously served as the chief product architect and general manager at PayPal, where he led the company’s core checkout and merchant services businesses.  Late last year crypto platform Bakkt said its virtual Visa debit card would be available for use on Google Pay online and in stores. Bakkt’s Google Pay support follows in the footsteps of Coinbase, which rolled out support for Apple Pay and Google Pay for its Coinbase Cards earlier this year. Google is also working with Bitpay and Gemini to support their crypto cards, meaning that people who use these cards can add them to Google Pay, but the transaction is in fiat currencies, according to a Google spokesperson.

Terms for the Omniex acquisition announced Wednesday were not disclosed. Omniex provides order, execution and portfolio management services for institutional crypto traders.  The acquisition comes less than a week after the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss acquired digital asset management startup Bitria to expand its ability to manage clients' portfolios from a single interface.  Gemini announced the launch of Gemini Prime, which aims to simplify trading for institutional investors by providing access to multiple exchanges and over-the-counter liquidity sources. Gemini Prime, which is already being used by a select group of clients, will be fully rolled out in the second quarter.  A growing number of institutions have expressed a desire to provide crypto services, not least due to demand from their wealthy clients. Last May, Swiss financial giant UBS Group said it was looking for ways to offer exposure to crypto, and a survey in July found that 82% of institutional investors expect to increase their exposure to digital assets by 2023, with four out of 10 expecting to do so dramatically.  While Gemini had a trading volume of around $150 million in the last 24 hours, it lags some way behind rivals such as Crypto.com, FTX and Coinbase whose volumes number in the billions.

42423895,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2helh,1642609095,Number of 'Active' Blockchain Games Doubled in Past Year to Almost 400,"With broader cryptocurrency markets in the doldrums, at least one area of the digital-asset industry appears to be mostly unaffected and has continued to grow: blockchain-based gaming. Although token prices for leading blockchain games like Axie Infinity have fallen recently, the user metrics are up.  There are now 398 active blockchain games, defined as having at least one active wallet in the past 24 hours within the game, according to the data tracker DappRadar. That's a 92% increase from a year ago. The total number of blockchain games, including those that are inactive, has climbed by 71% over the past year to 1,179.  Modesta Massoit, finance director at DappRadar, said that the growth looked impressive given that “it takes time to build great games, and in traditional industries, it takes two to four years to build a great game.”  User statistics show the rapid pace of adoption of blockchain gaming. According to Massoit, the number of daily unique wallets interacting with game-related smart contracts surged to 1.3 million last year, a 46-fold increase over the 28,000 at the end of 2020.  Meanwhile, venture capital firms have invested $4 billion to support the development and creation of blockchain-based games and their underlying infrastructure, according to Massoit.  And the fast expansion shows few signs of slowing: “2022 is going to be huge for crypto and gaming,"" says Gerald Votta, director of GameFi research for Quantum Economics. ""Look for the number of games in the space to more than double over the next few years.”  Read more: Crypto VCs Are Making a Big Bet on Gaming Guilds. Why?  The popularity of ""play-to-earn"" – gaming powered by cryptocurrency rewards – picked up in 2021 with the Pokémon-inspired Axie Infinity leading the way (and its AXS tokens racking up impressive gains). The play-to-earn game is ranked the second-largest game using blockchain technology on DappRadar by user base, becoming a hit among lower-income populations in the Philippines and Venezuela. It reached a record-high of $2.5 billion in trading volume in September and surpassed sales records of NBA Top Shot and CryptoPunks, according to a report by the Blockchain Gaming Alliance.  Ranking first on transaction volume is DeFi Kingdoms, a play-to-earn, metaverse-based blockchain game. DappRadar data shows that the number of users on the game has nearly quadrupled just in the past two months.  GameFi adoption unaffected by recent market trends  Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency markets in 2022 have suffered one of their worst-ever starts to a year and remain far off their all-time highs. Bitcoin is down 12% year to date and Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 15%.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming appear less affected by macroeconomic events and tend to trade more independently, according to a study by DappRadar. The firm attributes the sector's rising adoption and popularity over the past year to narratives like play-to-earn or the metaverse. (Remember Facebook's rebrand?)  The trend has firmed as more traditional gaming companies like Ubisoft and EA Originals join the ranks of play-to-earn and NFT gaming, said Votta of Quantum Economics.  Jeff Holmberg, head of investments at Yield Guild Games, a play-to-earn gaming guild, says adoption of blockchain games has been driven in part by the ability of players to have digital ownership over in-game assets.  ""This is a huge shift away from the typical centralized Web 2 models that have dominated the industry to date,"" Holmberg said in an interview with CoinDesk. The most successful games are those with a strong community, robust play-to-earn mechanics and guild features, because they have higher chances of attracting players, he said.  Sebastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Sandbox who serves as president of the Blockchain Game Alliance, said that there's a growing diversity of games involving blockchain, NFTs and play-to-earn mechanisms.  “This is a great indicator of the overall growing interest of the industry,” Borget said.  Traditional game players are still skeptical  One obstacle to further adoption: the reputation of cryptocurrencies among many traditional video game players.  The blockchain gaming industry has faced criticism from traditional gamers, and many think that gameplay for these projects has a long way to go.  Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, acknowledged that blockchain gaming has been one of the core themes of last year and thinks that will continue into 2022, but he noted that the next phase of growth might come only after existing games deliver and the infrastructure evolves further.  The tokens of several play-to-earn games have suffered large price drops this year as broader cryptocurrency markets have trended downward. (Maybe they don't trade so independently after all.)  AXS, an Ethereum-based token that powers Axie Infinity, is down 40% in the past three months, Yield Guild Games' YGG token is also down by 40%. The Sandbox (SAND) is down 16% over the past seven days, but is still up 400% over the past three months.",POSITIVE,AXS | ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/19/number-of-active-blockchain-games-doubled-in-past-year-to-almost-400,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cb5fd7843df6068ca6e6e8de708e67a88d32f60-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411836,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glga7t,1642606391,What Is KYC and Why Does It Matter For Crypto?,"As the cryptocurrency industry grows and matures, global and national financial regulators are putting more pressure on firms that offer digital asset services to comply with the same rules as traditional banks. While there is an on-going debate about the balance between privacy and security, proper know-your-customer (KYC) measures help to prevent the illegal use of cryptocurrencies.  What is KYC?  KYC means ""know your customer."" It refers to a financial institution’s obligation to carry out certain identity and background checks on its clients before allowing them to use its product or platform. It is part of a broader set of measures that regulators around the world use to fight money laundering.  In other words, it stops bad actors from hiding the illicit source of their money behind legitimate financial activity.  Read more: Is Bitcoin Legal?  KYC clashes with crypto exchanges  KYC is one of the biggest regulatory hurdles that crypto firms have had to clear in recent years. By its nature, the decentralized economy is prone to problems regarding KYC. Many decentralized services are designed to allow customers to remain anonymous and keep their personal information private from any central authority. This means many crypto firms are not able to identify who their customers actually are; something regulators do not find acceptable.  Even the most reluctant crypto firms have been compelled to introduce steadily more stringent KYC measures, as they face growing pressure and penalization from regulators.  Crypto exchange Binance announced in August 2021 that new customers would have to provide a government-issued ID and pass facial verification in order to make deposits and trades. This followed announcements by U.K. and Japanese regulators that Binance was not authorized to operate in their countries, among other admonitions.  Crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX made a similar move to comply with KYC a year earlier, requiring information on trading experience as well as identification, partly to “get ahead of evolving regulation.” Users had formerly only needed to provide an email address.  Despite these efforts, federal prosecutors still chose to charge BitMEX with a variety of regulatory violations in late 2020, including lacking effective KYC safeguards. The following year, the company said all its users had been verified, before announcing a $100 million settlement with regulators.  KYC requirements do not apply to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), meaning those that organize trades through smart contracts instead of a central trading desk are not required to disclose their identities. The institutions that create DEX dodge the regulations because they are not financial intermediaries or counterparties. Their users trade directly with one another by leveraging the infrastructure provided by the DEX.  ShapeShift's CEO said it lost 95% of its users as a result of the KYC measures it was forced to implement. The changes requiring customers to reveal their identities began in 2018 shortly before The Wall Street Journal alleged the exchange had been widely used to launder money – which the company denied. In a bid to shrug off KYC requirements, ShapeShift pivoted business models and relaunched as a DEX in 2021.  Read more: Centralized Exchange (CEX) vs. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): What’s the Difference?  Crypto firms go overseas for lax KYC rules  Some crypto exchanges avoid KYC requirements by domiciling in softer regulatory environments. Blockchain analysis firm CipherTrace has reported that as many as half of the exchanges registered in Seychelles have poor KYC measures in place. In 2020, the FBI claimed one defendant in the BitMEX case admitted it only cost “a coconut” to bribe Seychelles authorities.  Media attention and U.S. pressure can encourage those jurisdictions to toughen their stances. A senior figure in the Seychelles Financial Services Authority said “there’s going to be a tightening up now” in the aftermath of the BitMEX case.  Why does crypto need KYC?  Enforcing KYC compliance could help to tackle malicious activity adjacent to the crypto space, such as ransomware attacks that block a user’s access to a computer or network until payment is made. In 2020, victims paid nearly $350 million in crypto to attackers, who leveraged the anonymity provided by decentralized cryptocurrencies to evade detection.  A 2021 report by the Ransomware Task Force, an international grouping of public and private experts, described the crypto sector as enabling this kind of attack and proposed stronger enforcement of existing KYC laws, among other measures.  KYC may also be important in improving crypto’s public image throughout the economy. Stronger compliance, via more robust identification procedures, could help crypto shed its perceived association with money laundering and other criminal enterprises. This, in turn, could encourage wider adoption and investment.  Learning to live with KYC  A number of startups are now specifically devoted to solving KYC problems for crypto firms. ID verification startup Passbase offers apps a tool through which their users can upload a selfie along with their ID for speedy verification. The company has raised $13.5 million in seed and Series A round funding.  Identification startup Burrata, which has also recently raised seed funding, issues ""digital identity tokens"" to attach to cryptocurrency wallets. This approach can help other crypto firms to avoid storing users’ data themselves, keeping to their decentralized ethic.  These kinds of tools could ease many crypto firms into compliance, but they will not resolve the ideological opposition to ID checks found in some corners of the crypto world.

42410930,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSbX,1642604753,Liquidity Mining Is Dead. What Comes Next?,"Liquidity mining is dead, and trying to figure out the best way to replace it is the focus of one of crypto’s hottest subsectors.  The primary driver behind 2020’s “DeFi Summer” craze, liquidity mining refers to the practice of a protocol incentivizing user deposits with token rewards.  In recent months, however, liquidity mining has come under fire for being an imprecise incentivization tool often attracting mercenary farmers.  As a result, a range of novel new services such as bonds, time-weighted voting systems and DAO-to-DAO-focused stablecoin issuers have emerged to replace it – a broad range of advancements with the potential to permanently alter how DeFi protocols attract fresh deposits.  Depending on the project, the mechanics at play might be referred to as “liquidity as a service,” “protocol controlled value” or even “DeFi 2.0,” but in all instances, the basic principle is the same: to manage and direct vast sums of capital via incentive mechanisms.  These efforts are also united in that they attempt to answer a deceptively simple question: until now “free” money has been the animating factor behind DeFi adoption. What’s a more precise approach?  Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained  As the new year gets underway, projects working on solving this quandary are some of the most popular among traders and investors. In spite of a broader market rout, protocols focused on channeling liquidity are catching a healthy bid.  According to some, the trend is part of a broader one in Web 3, where value can be harnessed and commodified much like information on the internet.  “Liquidity is king,” Fei Protocol co-founder Joey Santoro told CoinDesk in an interview. “The way I frame it is that the internet is commanded by services and storage for information – cloud compute and data storage. When you translate that to DeFi, you need value services – lending platforms and AMMs [automated market makers] – and you need value storage, and that’s liquidity management.”  Whoever controls liquidity controls DeFi.  Others, such as angel investment collective eGirl Capital’s pseudonymous Cryptocat, believe that the liquidity trade is a passing trend.  Regardless of whether liquidity as a service turns out to be a narrative fad enjoying a temporary pump in crypto’s notoriously fickle attention economy or a new bedrock of on-chain market structure, at the moment at least, the arms race to control the flow of deposits in DeFi is, in essence, a battle over large swaths of the $230 billion sector itself.  “Liquidity is one of the two most important resources in this new world, and whoever controls liquidity controls DeFi,” said Santoro.  Liquidity mining  From the perspective of protocols looking to bootstrap usage, at first liquidity mining seemed like the future of how projects would find product-market fit.  During 2020’s DeFi Summer, Compound kicked off the craze by bolstering the returns on deposits to its lending platform with COMP token rewards, and protocols like Sushi managed to briefly overtake rival Uniswap on the back of similar incentive programs.  Read more: DeFi 'Vampire' SushiSwap Still Hemorrhaging Liquidity  Critics, however, have recently pointed out that while directing a fire hose of rewards at users will certainly incentivize deposits in the short term, liquidity mining is an imperfect tool that also attracts what prolific DeFi developer Andre Cronje has referred to as “liquidity locusts” – temporary “farmers” who take their rewards and leave for the next geyser of tokens when the current one runs dry.  “I think liquidity mining is one of the dumbest things happening right now in crypto,” said pseudonymous Deribit Insights researcher Hasu on a recent podcast. “Why? Because, for me, there is absolutely no strategic thinking behind it. You should start from thinking, ‘What do we want out of this? What’s some kind of target liquidity we want in our protocol?’ And once you reach it, there should be no further rewards.”  Core users  By contrast, the new crop of projects harnessing liquidity aims to make payoffs more transparent. They seek to measure how many dollars in token rewards a protocol is paying in order to attract how many dollars in deposits. In some caseshttps://www.olympusdao.finance/pro, they’re actually putting a protocol’s liquidity under a DAO’s direct control.  One of the first of these alternatives emerged almost by accident.  Automated market maker Curve introduced a “vote locking” feature in August 2020. This allowed CRV holders to lock their tokens in exchange for veCRV (voting escrow CRV) for up to four years. VeCRV in turn grants the ability to vote on which liquidity pools received a boost to CRV reward emissions, with voting power weighted in favor of those who locked their tokens for longer time periods.  At the time, it appeared as if it were a tool for individual farmers to maximize their returns: By locking a portion of their CRV rewards, they could direct even more rewards to their favorite pools and secure greater profitability in the long run.  Instead, however, other protocols have proven to be the primary benefactors of this system rather than individual farmers, with a race underway to accumulate CRV in what many have labeled the “Curve Wars.”  Read more: CRV Extends Rally as ‘Curve Wars’ Intensify  According to one analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity, this vote-locking system – also referred to as “venomics” – “pretends to select for time preference, but in reality actually centralizes governance on whoever can accumulate the most tokens.”  In short, whoever accumulates the most veCRV controls CRV rewards emissions.  Right now the “kingmaker” protocol in control of Curve’s rewards is Convex Finance. Convex has hoovered a stunning 43% of all circulating CRV, and Convex’s governance token, CVX, accounts for 5.1 CRV in voting power per token, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard.  Curve and Convex are also the two largest protocols in DeFi, commanding a combined $40 billion in deposits, per DefiLlama.  As a result, a cottage industry has emerged where protocols use platforms like Votium – an interface built on top of Convex – to “bribe” vote-escrowed CVX holders to direct liquidity to pools that are important to them.  “Bribing” for deposits has clear benefits for protocols.  For instance, in the case of a stablecoin like Terra’s UST, deposits in Curve pools help UST ensure healthy, liquid markets, aid in UST remaining pegged to a dollar and create utility for the stablecoin – achieving all the goals a liquidity mining program might but with much more transparent costs, payoffs and goals.  Indeed, in a recent governance forum post, a UST stablecoin team member concluded that the protocol’s ongoing programs to incentivize deposits via CVX bribes and accumulate CVX are “going extremely well.”  They want to get bribed as much as the next guy, so here we are.  The benefits mean that venomics might be here to stay, according to some.  “Say you’re a stablecoin. The number one thing for stablecoins is building liquidity,” said Redacted founder 0xSami in an interview with CoinDesk. “It makes sense for you to go and acquire Convex, if you want derivatives liquidity you should go acquire Ribbon’s voting escrow token, Sushi for DEX liquidity, or Aave so you can become collateral for lending. This is going to be a big trend this year.”  Bribe ecosystem  On the heels of the emerging bribe economy, a number of new products are coming to market that serve as governance or voting middleware in an evolving tech stack devoted to helping protocols route and control liquidity: Warden, Bribe, Llama Airforce, Votium and Votemak.  Votemak was recently acquired by Redacted, and Bribe closed a funding round in recent weeks.  Read more: Pay-to-Play Governance Builds Steam as Bribe Raises $4M  Part of this proliferation is the result of other projects implementing variations on venomics, creating a clear need for more marketplaces where protocols can buy votes.  Tokemak is one such project. The protocol is aiming to become a decentralized market maker: users deposit funds and receive TOKE token rewards, which can be used to vote on where liquidity is deployed. As a result, Tokemak is now another target for protocols looking to direct liquidity via bribes, and other projects – such as Frax and Yearn – have introduced venomic models as well.  “[The] retail audience immediately understands what we’re doing and the importance of it. They want to get bribed as much as the next guy, so here we are,” said Bribe’s pseudonymous founder, Condorcet, in an interview with CoinDesk. Tokemak will be one of Bribe’s initial integrations.  The emerging sector has, unsurprisingly, also caught the eye of venture capital investors.  “We think it’s an interesting trend,” said Dragonfly Capital’s Ashwin Ramachandran, one of the participants in Bribe’s recent round. “It’s definitely an order of magnitude increase in terms of capital efficiency and pricing as far as liquidity mining schemes, which can cause excessive sell pressure on native governance tokens.”  Token control  While some protocols are playing the bribe game in an effort to direct liquidity to favorable pools, others are vying to control the liquidity directly themselves – an emerging trend of “protocol-owned liquidity.”  Algorithmic stablecoin project Fei is working with Ondo Finance, a risk-tranching protocol focused on mitigating impermanent loss, to build a product that will allow protocols to pair native governance tokens from their treasuries with Fei’s stablecoin to directly create liquidity pools.  Instead of protocols blasting incentives at a pool to generate user deposits, this would allow protocols to create the pools directly – and, critically, also keep a portion of the trading fees from the pool, creating a new revenue stream.  This logic also applies to Olympus Pro, Olympus’ bond program. There, protocols exchange liquidity pool positions for bonds, once again allowing protocols to control the liquidity of their token, as well as earn the trading fees.  Santoro, the Fei founder, said in an interview that this is part of an emerging sector of “direct-to-DAO” services where third parties help DAOs more efficiently bootstrap liquidity for their tokens, among other needs.  Protocol-owned liquidity is also becoming a kind of vertical unto itself. Olympus and its various forks, including protocols such as Wonderland and Redacted, have accumulated large sums of CVX and other tokens with bribe earnings potential – treasuries that founders argue can now be used to generate returns.  In a recent Tweet, Wonderland developer Daniele Sestagalli wrote that the protocol was moving away from Olympus’ much-maligned high APY scheme.  Redacted’s 0xSami, meanwhile, told CoinDesk that he envisions the protocol becoming a “meta governance token” that will enable projects to come to a single asset, in this case Redacted’s BTRFLY, and hold sway in multiple governance processes. The treasury would earn fees for this service, and the fees could be distributed via a debenture bond or similar financial instrument.  “Obviously we need the high APY for a competitive edge right now, but once the treasury has been established the token doesn’t even have to rebase at that point – we can introduce a project with sustainable returns,” he said.  This bait-and-switch from a high APY money game to a revenue-generating treasury has been the target of ire over the last few weeks as Olympus and its various forks have been crippled by lowering prices:  Indeed, in what may be the first example of “quantitative easing” by a DeFi project, Wonderland conducted a major buyback using its treasury on Tuesday – a sign that the OHM forks are beginning to leverage their considerable treasuries.  Read more: DeFi’s Wonderland Is Buying TIME  Layer 2 expansion  Curiously, until recently, much of the experimentation in liquidity as a service had been concentrated on Ethereum. Multiple alternative layer 1s currently have incentive programs running but are using classic liquidity mining tools – an inefficiency ripe for disruption.  “I think you’re going to see the exact same two narratives play out – emissions farming becoming protocol-owned liquidity,” Santoro said of incentive programs on Ethereum alternatives.  Being able to allocate your tokens to the future growth of the platform, that’s an extremely powerful concept.  Indeed, protocols deploying venomics are beginning to emerge in other ecosystems. Cronje and Sestagalli are collaborating on an unreleased Fantom-based project currently being referred to as ve(3,3) – a mashup of the shorthand for venomics and Olympus’ staking program.  The unreleased project is already showing signs of tremendous popularity. One project that was released on Tuesday, veDAO, aiming to claim a controlling stake in Cronje and Sestagalli’s new protocol, reached over $785 million in total value locked in just hours.  Santoro, meanwhile, says Fei is plotting to pick a layer 2 to migrate its ecosystem to, which he believes would immediately establish it as a leader with Fei’s alternatives to liquidity mining.  “We’re going to move together to whatever L2 we see fit, and we’re going to kingmake that L2. Who is going to be able to compete with a billion dollars in unincentivized TVL?” Santoro said.  Future play  While liquidity as a service is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto, not even those working in it know if it’s guaranteed to become the future of project bootstrapping.  Redacted’s 0xSami said that projects like Curve and Tokemak that are aiming to become central hubs of liquidity with their incentive programs will either win a majority of market share, or the trend will simply fizzle out.  “Either until one of them becomes the ultimate hub of liquidity for DeFi, or until the narrative gets exhausted. One or the other,” he said.  Some analysts have noted in recent weeks that while TVL is higher than ever, Curve’s percentage of stablecoin swap volume – a bedrock of its market share – has been slipping in recent weeks as low-fee Uniswap v3 pools encroach on Curve’s turf.  An analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity also cast doubt on the venomic model winning out, saying ve-tokens aren’t “optimizing for the right things,” but “liquid governance and control of emissions are incredible.”  “That’s Curve’s greatest gift to the DeFi ecosystem – being able to allocate your tokens to the future growth of the platform in the form of liquidity emissions, that’s an extremely powerful concept,” he said.  Fei’s Santoro, meanwhile, believes the outcome won’t be a monolithic winner, but instead a world with multiple competing allied projects commanding vast swaths of liquidity.  “I don’t think it’ll be a monopoly, but a bunch of competing ecosystems.” he said. “It’s part of the whole consolidation narrative. You’re going to see the Tokemaks, Olympuses, Tribe DAOs, Curves of the world suck up liquidity and control. The DAOs that align [with them] will benefit from that.”  Even with the outcome uncertain, the current crop of projects emerging in the wake of the heady days liquidity mining nevertheless represent a progression in how projects entice and incentivize deposits from users and DAOs – even if venomics is a misdirection, tools like bonds and protocol-owned liquidity are likely here to stay.  “I’m bullish on the experimentation,” Santoro concluded.

In a press release on Wednesday, Osmosis announced the Gravity Bridge, an inter-blockchain protocol (IBC) to Ethereum “translator” built by internet services provider Althea.  To date, decentralized exchanges have largely expanded by deploying implementations of their contracts on alternative chains, with only a handful of projects – such as Thorchain and Ren – attempting to enable cross-chain asset swaps and unified liquidity pools.  According to Osmosis labs co-founder Sunny Aggarwal, that expansion-by-redeployment has a number of clear drawbacks.  “There’s two views of how the multichain system will work. There’s one where you have all these layer 1 blockchains, and you have apps that redeploy on all of these chains,” Aggarwal said in an interview with CoinDesk. “In our opinion, this ends up fragmenting the liquidity, the user experience, everything.”  Read more: Thorchain Is Ready to Grease the Wheels of Crypto-to-Crypto Trading  Enabling asset swaps between Ethereum and Cosmos IBC required a number of innovations.  According to Aggarwal, the Althea team has been working on the Gravity Bridge for a number of years, and boasts a sophisticated slashing system for validators who underperform. Additionally, Osmosis is an app-specific chain, meaning that Osmosis Labs could take drastic steps to improve user experience, including allowing for MetaMask signatures, which usually isn’t compatible with Cosmos.  The MetaMask integration in particular is a key cog in the team’s expansion plans.  “There’s two big markets you need to think about. One is the cross-ecosystem trading market, and the other is the intra-ecosystem market. In a way, Osmosis has a heavy focus on the intra-Cosmos market for sure, but our focus when the Gravity Bridge goes live will be getting into the market of cross-ecosystem trades,” Aggarwal said.  One area of focus for that will be swaps between stablecoins.  Aiming for UST  Aggarwal said that Osmosis is aiming to capture volume for the Terra stablecoin, UST, in particular. He noted that there is only $24 million in liquidity for the Curve Finance UST-3pool, while there is $160 million in liquidity on the OSMO/UST pool on Osmosis alone.  “I think this is a market we’re well positioned to capture, and there are new stablecoins coming on to Cosmos as well,” Aggarwal said. “Really getting that stablecoin market between Cosmos and Ethereum, that will be important for TVL.”  Osmosis has been growing rapidly as of late, nearly doubling its total value locked (TVL) over the course of a month to $1.6 billion.  Integrations with other Ethereum Virtual Machine-enabled chains are on the horizon as well, and the team hopes to enable cross-chain trading for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the near future.

42411846,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaiG,1642600136,What is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?,"Bitcoin’s scalability issues mean that smaller transactions can congest the blockchain. The Lightning Network was created to fix that.  Since each block on Bitcoin’s blockchain takes an average of 10 minutes to process, only a small number of transactions can go through at a time. In 2016, developers Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon proposed an idea that could enable fast and cheap transactions on the network without having to change the block size. They called it, the ""Lightning Network.”  The Lightning Network creates a second layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain that uses user-generated, micropayment channels to conduct transactions more efficiently.  These transactions are much faster than regular bitcoin transactions because they don’t need to be broadcast to the entire network. And because there are no miners that need incentivizing, transaction fees are low or even non-existent.  How the bitcoin lightning network works  Think of Bitcoin’s main blockchain as a highway, and the Lightning Network as a series of side streets that reduce the highway's congestion from smaller transactions.  First, two parties who wish to transact with each other set up a multi-signature wallet (which requires more than one signature to enact a transaction). The wallet holds some amount of bitcoin. The wallet address is then saved to the Bitcoin blockchain, setting up the bidirectional payment channel.  The two parties can now conduct an unlimited number of transactions without ever touching the information stored on the blockchain. With each transaction, both parties sign an updated balance sheet to reflect how much of the bitcoin is stored in the two wallets.  Once both parties finish transacting and close out the channel, the resulting balance is registered on the blockchain. In the event of a dispute, both parties can use the most recently signed balance sheet to recover their share of the funds.  It is not necessary to set up a direct channel to transact on the Lightning Network – you can send payments to someone via channels with people with whom you are connected. The network automatically finds the shortest route. The network's goal is to allow users to make smaller payments without transaction fees or delays.  Where are we now with the Bitcoin Lightning Network?  The Lightning Network launched a beta version in 2018, but was far from fully operational. Since then, the number of nodes on the Lightning Network has doubled year over year, moving the project closer to achieving its goal of making bitcoin a viable currency for day-to-day transactions.  Once both parties finish transacting and close out the channel, the resulting balance is registered on the blockchain. In the event of a dispute, both parties can use the most recently signed balance sheet to recover their share of the funds.  The network went from 8,321 nodes in January 2021 to 19,374 in January 2022, a 132% increase. It should be noted that this includes only public nodes (nodes accessible to anyone). The number of total nodes is much higher if you were to include private connections (nodes accessible only to permissioned users).  Despite significant growth in recent years, the Lightning Network still faces challenges to overcome if it wants to solve bitcoin’s scalability issues. The most demanding issue is security. Because nodes on the Lightning Network are required to always be online, they become more vulnerable to attacks. And while the network aims to reduce fees incurred from processing transactions on bitcoin’s main network, it includes its own set of additional costs for opening and closing channels, along with routing fees. These are issues that will likely be solved with time, as its technology develops and becomes fully optimized.  Exchanges are also beginning to adopt the technology to optimize their users’ bitcoin withdrawals and deposits. Kraken announced in 2020 that it would be adding support for the Lightning Network in 2021, but as of January 2022, it has yet to be implemented. Network support has been added by U.K.’s CoinCorner, Vietnam’s VBTC and San Francisco-based OKCoin. In 2022, Block announced it is integrating the Lightning Network into its popular Cash App, a move they first promised in 2019. The adoption of Lightning by prominent exchanges is good news for the network’s future, and while most agree that the Lightning Network won’t be the solution to all of bitcoin’s future challenges, it will certainly play an important role in the cryptocurrency’s future.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,"Noelle Acheson, Hoa Nguyen, John Biggs, Eli Tan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoins-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/179054ce7655b86b6460b1638fe16cf243dd940e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410944,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtTBu,1642595400,Ethereum Is No Longer a One-Chain Ecosystem,"Earlier this week, Evan Van Ness of Starbloom Ventures and Josh Stark of the Ethereum Foundation released an Ethereum year-end report, The Year in Ethereum 2021, diving into activity on the network last year. Here are some of the report’s most promising developments and trends within the current Ethereum ecosystem.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Adoption from all angles  Demand for blockspace on Ethereum skyrocketed during 2021, with $9.9 billion in transaction fees being paid throughout the year. Since fee per transaction is vastly different chain to chain, the metric is not great for comparing usage on layer 1s and 2s, but it does provide insight into how eager users were to access DeFi, NFTs and DAOs.  On basically every metric, Ethereum showed adoption: total value locked in DeFi, active addresses on the network, OpenSea volume and application developer activity all grew exponentially.  More important, the report highlighted that Ethereum is no longer a one-chain ecosystem. In order to achieve scalability, the Ethereum community will need to offer layer 2 technologies capable of handling transactions from billions of users. 2021 proved to be the first step in experimentation with both optimistic and zero knowledge proof rollups, and the two finally began to take significant market share in daily transactions away from Ethereum L1.  As a technology, Ethereum and other smart contract chains have proved to be an exciting and profitable platform for creators and developers to build and share their work. DeFi developers have created billions of dollars in value by building financial products open and accessible to the world, and artists have found amazing success with creating digital, liquid art in the form of NFTs. That being said, Ethereum's “creator economy” is competing with top platforms like YouTube, Spotify and OnlyFans, delivering $3.5 billion in earnings to those building on top of the network.  The report also focused on the technical state of the network, diving deep into the pending transition to proof-of-stake, EIP 1559’s effect on the network and the issue of client diversity on the Beacon Chain. A full look at Van Ness and Stark’s work can be found here.  Welcome to another issue of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week.

BACKGROUND: Excitement around Axie Infinity and DeFi Kingdoms has investors looking to support the next generation of on-chain gaming. The non-fungible yet composable aspects of NFTs make the digital assets an interesting experiment throughout the gaming industry.  North Korean hackers were responsible for exploiting around $200 million in ETH throughout 2021. BACKGROUND: According to Chainalysis, a North Korean hacking group was able to exploit Kucoin and other centralized exchanges using phishing, malware and code exploits. The funds were linked to addresses controlled by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and are laundered through Tornado Cash and other popular mixers.  Smart contract network Near Protocol raised $150 million from investors to develop an ecosystem war chest. BACKGROUND: Near followed in the footsteps of other major chains like Avalanche and Polygon, raising a large sum of capital to incentivize ecosystem growth via DeFi grants and liquidity mining. The massive raise was completed in less than two weeks, showing the hunger for exposure to the “next layer 1” opportunity.  Recent client diversity numbers show Ethereum’s Beacon Chain is still heavily reliant on Prysm. BACKGROUND: A client is “the implementation of Ethereum that verifies all transactions in each block, keeping the network secure and the data accurate.” Diversity in client software allows the network to overcome bugs that may negatively impact a percentage of the nodes validating the network. While there are several high quality clients available, Prysm currently accounts for 68% of all nodes on the network.

The network’s market share of NFTs has dropped to around 80% from about 95% at the start of 2021, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in the note published last week.  Since August, the Solana blockchain has been capturing the most NFT volume share at the expense of Ethereum, the bank said, noting that was when the NFT market started a major expansion. Ethereum has also been losing market cap share to Solana in line with the declining NFT volume share.  Because NFTs are the “fastest growing universe in the crypto ecosystem,” Ethereum’s share of this market is likely to be more important than its share of decentralized finance (DeFi), according to the note. Earlier in the month, the bank warned that Ethereum’s dominance of DeFi was also at risk as the scaling of the network needed to maintain its dominance could arrive too late.

Alexander Lange, general partner and founder of Inflection, told CoinDesk in an interview that the fund doesn’t want to be “locked into any particular categories” regarding its investment focus.  “We are keeping a very open mind within this very quickly expanding economy and can’t really tell you what will be the rising narratives a year from now. What we’re trying to do is be very sensitive to adoption cycles,” Lange said.  Limited partner investors in the Mercury Fund include Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company), Accolade Partners, Evanston Capital, Isomer, Hutt Capital, Multiple Capital, Presight Partners and Rockaway, as well as individual backers Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz and noted tech investors Bo Shao and Erik Voorhees, among others.  Inflection typically invests between $500,000 and $1.5 million into early-stage companies. The firm said it has a community-centric investment approach, sharing ownership stakes in the fund with founders of the investment companies and innovator communities.  Founded in 2019, Inflection has a global team that is spread out across Boston, Berlin, Munich, Madrid and Denver.  Previous Inflection investments included programmatic asset management protocol Balancer, peer-to-peer code collaboration platform Radicle and Web 3 operating environment Anytype.

42423905,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ho7h,1642585988,"Cardano's ADA Token Leads Crypto Majors Lower, Bitcoin Nears $41K as Bond Yields Rise","The crypto market is a sea of red again, with recent outperformers like programmable blockchain Cardano's ADA token leading major cryptocurrencies lower.  At press time, ADA was trading near $1.36, a 10.6% fall in the last 24 hours. Scaling tool Polygon's MATIC token fell 6%, even as the network implemented Ethereum's fee-burning mechanism, which will destroy MATIC tokens, making its supply deflationary. Solana's token SOL, Binance token BNB and ether each fell over 2%, while bitcoin traded 1% lower near $41,200, according to CoinDesk data.  ADA's decline appears to be typical of a correction often seen after a notable price rally.  The token jumped nearly 60% to $1.64 earlier this month, outperforming bitcoin as the impending launch of SundaeSwap, the first decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange on the Cardano blockchain, revved up investor interest in the cryptocurrency.  Pseudonymous Twitter-based ADA whale said that some of the reasons for ADA's recent bullish momentum was popular trader Cobie tweeting about buying ADA at $1.20 and Cardano winning Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's Twitter poll asking the community which blockchain would be a suitable alternative to Ethereum.  Cardano is likely to be in the news in the coming weeks. ""Keep eyes on the various scaling initiatives coming to Cardano the next months,"" ADA whale told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. ""Cardano Chain is currently running at pretty much full capacity, block size likely increases by the end of the month, next month will see the Babbage hard fork, which helps things further.  ""Transactions per second should scale to 500-1,000 this year in various ways,"" ADA whale added.  While those impending developments can put a fresh bid under ADA, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to a continued sell-off in bitcoin, if any.  ""There have been selected alternative cryptocurrencies that are performing rather well, including cardano. We don't foresee these holding up very well if we continue in this 'risk-off' sentiment,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  Risk-off weighs over bitcoin  Bitcoin and traditional market risk assets remain under pressure as bond yields continue to rise on expectations of earlier and quicker rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Notably, the two-year Treasury yield, which tracks short-term interest rate and inflation expectations, hit a fresh 11-month high of 1.076% soon before press time.  Early Wednesday, Anna Wong, chief U.S. economist for Bloomberg Economics, said that a 50-basis point (bps) interest rate hike is warranted at the Fed's March meeting, according to FXStreet. The Fed funds futures are pricing a 93% chance of the central bank raising rates by 25 basis points in March.  Policy tightening is bearish for asset prices in general. Some observers are of the opinion that the worst may be behind for bitcoin.  ""I'm really surprised BTC is holding up while Nasdaq pukes. In retrospect, the bitcoin sell-off led the Nasdaq and looks like BTC has found its bottom already while Nasdaq hasn't,"" one investor tweeted early Wednesday.  While the Nasdaq index fell 2.6% on Tuesday, bitcoin ended the day flat. The cryptocurrency has lost nearly 40% of its value since mid-November as the Fed went from predicting a single rate hike in 2022 to three hikes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq peaked after mid-December and has declined over 8% since then, according to data provided by charting platform TradingView.  Stack Funds' Dibb said, ""The crypto market more broadly is showing some resilience, with trading volumes remaining low in the absence of large bids/offers despite equities recently heading lower.""  Dibb, however, foresees a deeper decline if the bulls fail to defend the recently held psychological support of $40,000.  ""The market has been eyeing the $40,000 handle as strong support. However, a close below this area will likely lead to larger liquidations and a grind down to the mid-30's,"" Dibb said.  Looking ahead, aside from macro factors, the market may take cues from the U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee's review of the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies scheduled for Thursday.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/19/cardanos-ada-token-leads-crypto-majors-lower-bitcoin-nears-41k-as-bond-yields-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6385579d1add7eaa64b736571e755b0f00e938f-2476x1374.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Erik Thedéen said EU regulators should nudge the crypto industry towards the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake mining, in an interview with the Financial Times.  ""The solution is to ban proof-of-work,"" he said. ""Proof-of-stake has a significantly lower energy profile.""  The proof-of-work model involves miners using scores of powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems in order to record transactions on the blockchain an be rewarded with new coins. The world's largest two cryptocurrencies - bitcoin and ether - both use this model.  Proof-of-stake mining is less energy intensive in that users win the right to record transactions based on how much investment - or ""stake"" - they have in the network. Ether has plans to migrate to a proof-of-stake model later this year.  The EU does not currently account for a particularly significant share of the proof-of-work mining industry. Bitcoin mining is currently dominated by the U.S. (share of 35.4%), Kazakhstan (18.1%) and Russia (11.23%), according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.  However, with mining banned last year in the previously dominant China, there may be concerns among EU administrators that its previously small share of the mining industry could naturally grow as miners search for new homes.

It also intends to ban incentives such as refer-a-friend and new-joiner rewards.  ""Too many people are being led to invest in products they don’t understand and which are too risky for them,"" Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's executive director of markets, said in a statement.  The government began consulting on a proposed framework for regulating crypto promotions in 2020. Since then, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has stepped in to ban misleading ads on a number of occasions.

The seed round was led by Dragonfly Capital, Pantera Capital and Hashed.  Ancient8 says it will use the funds to form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in order to further build the community around play-to-earn games.  Play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity require players to buy a character NFT from a marketplace to enter the game. As these NFTs can cost thousands of dollars each, gaming guilds purchase the NFTs and rent them to players (known colloquially as scholars) in exchange for a cut of the earnings. Community managers assist with the recruitment and training of players.  Effectively this is a labor arbitrage play, using low-cost labor in Southeast Asia to earn in-game tokens. A similar industry existed during the height of World of Warcraft’s popularity in the late 2000s, where laborers in China mined in the in-game currency by doing repetitive tasks.  The play-to-earn vertical has attracted significant interest from investors. In August, a16z lead a $4.6 million investment in gaming guild Yield Guild Games. GuildFi, another gaming guild, closed a $6 million round co-led by DeFinance Capital and Hashed in November.  “Games provide the perfect starting point for mainstream adoption of blockchain-based products, especially as people start transacting and earning income while playing,” Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, told CoinDesk in a statement. “Leading guilds like Ancient8 are the easiest gateway into blockchain gaming today, with the potential to become major financial services platforms and contributors to their local communities.”  Some analysts have pointed out that these gaming guilds as an investment proposition are wholly dependent on the yields generated by their assets – the gaming NFTs their own. Should the game fall out of favor with the market, or the vertical itself attract too much regulatory scrutiny, it would impact the ability of the gaming guild to earn yield.  Crypto gaming tokens have a total market cap of approximately $29 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The largest is the MANA token, used in Decentraland, with a market cap of $5 billion.

42423906,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ho3h,1642581056,Crypto Miner Argo Diversifies Into Non-Mining Blockchain Business,"Bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain is starting a non-mining business unit called “Argo Labs” to diversify its business and take advantage of other opportunities in the blockchain ecosystem.  “We've always felt that the blockchain space has more potential than just mining,” said Argo CEO Peter Wall in an interview with CoinDesk, adding that the new business unit will be “an in-house innovation arm” for the company.  The London-based Argo Blockchain has been operating as a publicly listed crypto miner, generating revenue primarily from minting bitcoin and zcash. Meanwhile, Argo Labs is still a very early-stage project with a small team that has been working behind the scenes for about the last nine months and is still building out the entire workforce as it launches officially.  Argo Labs will mainly focus on network participation and strategic diversification through the efficient deployment of the company’s crypto treasury assets. The network participation will consist of providing infrastructure support, running nodes and validators, and staking in innovative projects. Meanwhile, the other half of the business will include supporting early-stage projects, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the non-fungible token (NFT) and metaverse ecosystems.  The new business will be funded internally, and the company has allocated approximately 10% of its own crypto assets for Argo Labs. The company has also hired Vakeesan Mahalingam as the head of Argo Labs.  “Our vision at Argo Labs is to support the company’s mining efforts by engaging with the disruptive and innovative sectors of the crypto ecosystem,” Mahalingam said in a statement on Wednesday.  Shares of the company rose as much as 8.4% on the London Stock Exchange as of 9:30 UTC.  Strategic diversification  That’s not to say Argo is losing its identity as a crypto miner, rather its “a strategic diversification,” according to Sebastien Chalus, chief strategy officer of Argo Blockchain. “We still believe in bitcoin, but there's the other side of the ecosystem that's really promising and building new applications every day,” he said during an interview with CoinDesk.  Crypto miners generate most of their revenue from mining, which makes them highly leveraged to the price of the digital assets they mine. This is apparent from the recent sell-off in publicly traded mining stocks when bitcoin and broader crypto markets declined after peaking in November.  In fact, Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining and Semiconductor ETF (RIGZ), a miner-heavy exchange-traded fund (ETF), has fallen more than 50% since its peak in November as bitcoin's price fell about 35%. Argo’s shares (ARBK) in Nasdaq have fallen about 44% while other miners, such as Marathon Digital (MARA), fell 66% since their November peak.  Such diversification to supplement the mining business will likely help Argo gain exposure to not just digital assets they mine but also from the rest of the blockchain projects. “We're taking a portion of that bitcoin [that Argo mines] and supporting other cryptocurrency projects, which we think further enhances our overall operations,” Wall said.  “Investors get that we are not just a straight mining company, we’re a blockchain technology company,” Wall added, noting that the company had previously made investments in areas other than mining, such as $10 million in crypto venture capital firm Pluto Digital Assets’ new fund.  Future-ready  One of the main reasons for Argo to launch this new business is to be ready for the future of blockchain technology, according to Chalus. There will be many innovations and trends that will take place over the next few years that will change the blockchain ecosystem, and by participating in such projects now, Argo will be ready for the future, he added.  “I think it's a way for us to make sure that we are being opportunistic about the space in the future,” according to Wall. “And I think there's so much energy going into Web 3 projects, DeFi, the NFT world right now that we would be foolish not to explore,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/19/crypto-miner-argo-diversifies-into-non-mining-blockchain-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b3724c991319a2217a01f279533a65ec4fc8313-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At this point, it is safe to assume that everyone has heard of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but crypto alone is far from the only game in town. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are quickly surpassing cryptocurrencies in popularity as they gain mainstream attention for their use in sports, gaming, contemporary art, and even real estate. Currently, the NFT market boasts a multi-billion dollar valuation which is bigger than many well-established cryptocurrencies projects that have been around for several years. The market is projected to grow even more as companies and organizations begin to adopt these NFTs across an array of different industries. However, while they are mostly associated with art or gaming and collectibles NFTs are also making waves in the sports industry. NFTs in Sports The world of sports makes for a prime example of how NFTs can truly change the way fans interact with each other as well as with their favorite teams.

One project to look out for, Hubble Protocol, will be making a huge addition to the DeFi offerings on Solana when it launches a stablecoin borrowing platform (being called &apos;the MakerDAO of Solana&apos;) on Mainnet Beta this January 28th, 2022. Before the launch of Hubble&apos;s stablecoin, USDH, the protocol will hold three separate HBB token launches on three different launchpads: SolRazr (link), Solanium (link), and DAO Maker (link). There are a ton of reasons why Hubble&apos;s IDO will be the hottest IDO in January-one that shouldn&apos;t be missed. Here&apos;s why anyone serious about DeFi should mark their calendars and think about getting their hands on some HBB. Users Can Earn Hubble Protocol&apos;s Fees By Staking $HBB Hubble is a fee-sharing DeFi protocol. This means that it collects fees for its services and distributes the majority of this revenue to the Hubble community. The method for receiving a share of Hubble&apos;s revenue is straightforward: stake HBB, and the protocol&apos;s smart contract automatically divides the collected fees among users. Right now, 85% of all revenue from minting USDH (a one-time 0.5% fee) will go to users who stake HBB. As Hubble increases, the number of services it offers, the amount of fees collected by the protocol will increase, and users who stake HBB will benefit from this as well.

(SoFi) has received conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to create a full-service national bank, provided the new entity does ""not engage in any crypto-asset activities or services,"" the OCC announced on Tuesday.  The approval accounts for SoFi Bank, National Association's (SoFiBank, N.A.) acquisition of Golden Pacific Bank, National Association, an FDIC-insured national bank. SoFiBank, N.A., which will have its headquarters in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, will also have to meet certain capital contribution requirements and adhere to an operating agreement, the agency said.  “Today’s decision brings SoFi, a large fintech, inside the federal bank regulatory perimeter, where it will be subject to comprehensive supervision and the full panoply of bank regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act,"" OCC Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu said in a statement. ""This levels the playing field and will ensure that SoFi’s deposit and lending activities are conducted safely and soundly, including limiting the bank’s ability to engage in crypto-asset activities.”  In October 2020, the OCC gave SoFi preliminary approval for establishing a national bank pending a thorough evaluation of all information available.  SoFi has a digital asset trading subsidiary and went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) at an $8.6 billion valuation. SoFi finished Tuesday trading at just over $12 per share, down more than 8%.  In a note following the OCC announcement, Mizuho Securities USA analyst Dan Dolev maintained his buy rating on SoFi. ""While handling crypto as a bank holding company will likely require some disclosure changes, we believe these issues are fully solvable and should not adversely impact SoFi's future product capabilities."" Dolev added: ""Crypto transactions by bank holding companies are permitted. And we estimate that SoFi may have up to 5 years (including extensions) to become compliant.""  SoFi Bank, N.A. will hold $5.3 billion in total assets and $718 million in capital and provide local commercial-focused loans and deposit products that Golden Pacific offers.
