42413506,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9Xaq,1670284352,DeFi Risk-Sharing Protocol Nexus Expects Loss on Maple Credit Pool Investment as FTX Contagion Widens,"Insurance alternative Nexus Mutual is expecting to take a loss on its investment in a credit pool on Maple Finance, a large decentralized lending platform, according to a statement released Monday.  Nexus warned about a potential loss of 2,461 ether (ETH), some $3 million, from Orthogonal Trading’s recent default and said it started to withdraw all funds from the affected wrapped ether credit pool. This represents 1.6% of Nexus' assets, according to the statement.  In August, Nexus deposited 15,463 ETH, worth some $19.3 million at current price, into a wrapped ether credit pool on Maple Finance following community voting. Nexus is a peer-to-peer, risk-sharing protocol offering an alternative to insurance against risks such as DAO hacks and smart contract bugs in decentralized finance (DeFi). It is governed by a community of NXM token holders.  However, more Nexus funds appear to be endangered. Orthogonal Trading’s defaulted debt on Maple’s wrapped ether credit pool amounts to some $5 million (3,900 wETH). On top of that, embattled market maker Auros Global failed to repay a $3.1 million (2,400 wETH) loan and has another $7.5 million (6,000 wETH) in active loans outstanding from the same pool.  The troubled debt represents 56% of the $27.8 million outstanding debt in the wETH credit pool, according to Maple’s credit dashboard. Only $3.1 million in cash deposits are not actively tied up in loans, which limits Nexus’ ability to withdraw funds. Maple has a 10-day waiting period before depositors can withdraw capital.  Nexus Mutual’s warning comes as contagion from the implosion of FTX, once one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, spreads to DeFi lending protocols. Orthogonal Trading received a default notice for a total of $36 million loans on Maple after it allegedly misrepresented its losses from the FTX fallout to creditors. Auros Global said last week it is facing “short-term liquidity issues” and missed payment on a loan from Maple.

42413501,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9XWA,1670283876,Built With Bitcoin Foundation Opens Technology Center in Ghana,"The Built With Bitcoin Foundation (BWB), a nonprofit organization seeking to provide “humanitarian support, powered by Bitcoin,” has built a technology center in Kumasi, Ghana.  The aptly named “Bitcoin Technology Center” (BTC) will focus on finance and technology education, and aims to “foster a safe environment to learn.” The center’s official unveiling takes place Thursday, on the heels of the African Bitcoin Conference, which is being hosted a few hours away in Accra. BWB is hoping to educate and train at least 400 residents within the first year of operation, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  The center’s location is no coincidence. Kumasi is home to one of Ghana’s largest and most prestigious universities – Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) – ranked 2019’s “best university in Ghana and West Africa” by media firm U.S. News & World Report. BWB hopes the region’s reputation for stellar technology-focused education translates into high interest in the Bitcoin Technology Center’s programs.  “If a community already has a school, but it doesn't have the resources needed, how are they ever going to learn how to use Bitcoin,” said Yusuf Nessary, co-founder and director of BWB, in an interview with CoinDesk. “So we thought to ourselves, what if we build a freestanding multi-room, co-op and incubation center, where community members can come any time of the day?”  Read more: South African Non-Profit Bitcoin Ekasi Opens Education Center  The center will offer an introductory Bitcoin course as well as finance, entrepreneurship and computer programming courses. BWB recently collaborated on a similar project – the Bitcoin Ekasi Center – in South Africa. Both projects seek to establish circular bitcoin economies where individuals receive and make payments in bitcoin as they would with traditional fiat currency.  BWB funded the project with support from Ghana’s Edwinase community, Blockchain Foundation Africa, and members of the wider Bitcoin ecosystem. The local communities came together to donate the land, while the structure was built by fellow Ghanians who were compensated in bitcoin.  “It is a peer-to-peer transaction, amongst peers, within the community, with the intention to support … future generations of that community,” Nessary said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/05/built-with-bitcoin-foundation-opens-new-technology-center-in-ghana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70a9f5e7c37450eba475e88accc0d3aae6aa4705-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lending out user deposits, over-leverage, and poor tokenomics are at the root of the current contagion. ""The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."" BlockFi is the latest domino to fall in the FTX (FTT-USD) contagion saga with its recent Chapter 11 filing. How far will this contagion go and is the crypto market dead? The purpose of this article is to cut through the noise and provide an analysis of how this happened and where the industry goes from here. To begin with, the crypto market unraveling tends to validate one’s presuppositions about the industry. The truth is somewhere between “it’s all a scam” and “this is why we need Decentralized Finance (DeFi).” If you purchased $100 of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for every crypto obituary published in the mainstream financial media, you would be wealthy enough to not care about what is written here. However, let’s also not forget that the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem of Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ), with a market capitalization of $34.8 billion and a total value locked of over $20 billion across multiple decentralized product offerings, precipitated the events we see today. Centralized Finance Is Broken Centralized Finance, or CeFi, is the business model of using traditional banking practices with crypto assets. The most common practice involves lending out customer crypto deposits to generate yield for the financial service provider and the depositor. BlockFi, FTX, Voyager (VYGVQ), Celsius (CEL-USD), Babel Finance, and Three Arrows Capital all filed for bankruptcy this year. These collapses highlighted the incestuous relationship between yield bearing CeFi providers, firms that borrowed from them to trade with leverage, and even exchanges that took leverage on a functionally make-believe asset in the case of FTX and its token, FTT. Aside from Three Arrows Capital, it appears that every other bankrupted institution above may have been lending out customer deposits. Any asset that regularly trades at volatility levels above eighty percent should not be traded with leverage or lent out. For reference, the S&P 500’s volatility historically hovers between ten and twenty percent. If this structure was built around real-time priced equity in early-stage startups, the result would have been the same. Unfortunately, forced selling and terrible sentiment leading up to the Chapter 11 proceedings have been a drag on crypto prices. What About Bitcoin and Ethereum? Digital assets were created to not have to trust institutions like BlockFi and individuals like Sam Bankman-Fried. Despite the collapse of the surrounding architecture mentioned above, Bitcoin is still producing blocks every ten minutes. Ethereum-based ( ETH-USD ) smart contracts are still operating in the same manner as when they were deployed. People are still spending $1 million on Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs to party with celebrities at next year’s Apefest. Protocols and self-custodied wallets are working just fine. If one must generate yield, do it on-chain without a counter party. For most, holding the bearer asset or settlement layer should be sufficient. If one does not trust in their ability to self-custody crypto assets, use transparent exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ) or preferably one with proof of reserves like Kraken. Many are throwing the baby out with the bathwater by treating FTX and Bitcoin as the same thing. I consider that a buying opportunity. Does Crypto Even Have Staying Power? This is what you must fundamentally believe to buy BTC and ETH at these levels. To answer the question, let’s separate the technological use case from the investment case. On the technology front, I believe that billions of dollars of trading volume is evidence enough of product-market fit to solve societal needs of decentralized money, decentralized financial architecture, and P2P creative expression through Non Fungible Tokens. I also believe that blockchain will serve as the backend to an immersive, ownable, and interoperable metaverse within the next ten years. On the investment front, a picture is worth a thousand words. Have we entered a new paradigm of monetary and fiscal discipline? I believe the answer is no. The current liquidity crunch is a blip in the history of the Fed balance sheet's never ending expansion, and money printer go brrr is the only play in the Fed’s playbook to stave off economic recessions until Central Bank Digital Currencies allow for targeted stimulus or unless Jerome Powell is okay with spiking the global economy with a great depression-like restart. Owning scarce assets is what matters in this context. No counterparty risk is also a plus. Fed balance sheet (tradingview.com) Conclusion If crypto indeed has staying power, then market overreactions to the downfall of flawed business models built around these assets are buying opportunities. Bitcoin did not budge at the BlockFi bankruptcy announcement and is now, in fact, trading 4.5% higher. I believe that the worst is priced in and now is a time to consider opening or adding to a position. Un-levered, blue chip crypto assets still have a role to play in a diversified portfolio.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4562476-bitcoin-ftx-blockfi-and-whats-next-for-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5192194.jpeg

42413513,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9XiK,1670281189,Crypto Markets Today: FTX Fallout Hits Maple Finance; Bitcoin Declines,"Blockchain-based lending platform Maple Finance severed ties with crypto firm Orthogonal Trading, alleging it was ""misrepresenting its financial position."" The move is yet more fallout from the implosion of the FTX crypto exchange.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The action came after Orthogonal was due to pay back a $10 million USDC stablecoin loan from a credit pool managed by M11 Credit on Dec. 4. Orthogonal has been a significant borrower on Maple, and also was a manager and underwriter of a credit pool on Maple.  M11 Credit has issued a notice of default to Orthogonal for all active loans outstanding from the USDC stablecoin pool on Maple, with $31 million of current liabilities in four loans.  The default notice also extends to Orthogonal's wrapped ether (wETH) loans worth $5 million (3,900 wETH) from Maple's another M11 Credit-managed lending facility, M11 Credit confirmed to CoinDesk.  Maple said in a statement that Orthogonal has been ""operating while effectively insolvent,"" and didn't communicate that it would be unable to service the debt.  A default by Orthogonal could deal another blow to undercollateralized lending protocols grappling with liquidity crunch, and the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's implosion.  Orthogonal's default marks the second time a borrower defaulted on Maple after Babel Finance's failure to service its debt in June. Earlier this fall, crypto firms Blockwater and Invictus Capital defaulted on their loans on rival unsecured lending protocol TrueFi.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Consumer Savings Rate Suggests Continued Calm in Bitcoin Prices  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Many economic indicators now point to relatively mild price action in the short term for crypto markets.  A decline in savings offers compelling evidence of cryptos' likely, continued calm. Inflation growth has exceeded wage increases for nearly two years.  As shown in the below graphic from Compound Advisers, prices continue to increase at a faster pace than incomes. Not surprisingly, this trend has led to sharp increases in U.S. revolving debt balances. In turn, the personal savings rate in the U.S. has fallen to its second-lowest rate in close to 60 years.

In addition, global inflation has also caused most companies to resize their organizational structure. Crypto businesses are now planning for effective cost-management strategies to prevent a collapse. However, the fear in the market for most crypto users is high since trusted firms have collapsed. Related Reading: Metaverse Token Axie Infinity (AXS) Suddenly Pumps 25% – What’s Happening? In light of recent events, Australian cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx has shown 90 of its employees the exit door. It represents a layoff of around 40% of the entire workforce – a significant number. Swyftx CEO Alex Harper said the company is well-positioned to handle the blowout of the FTX storm on the crypto world. He believes the crypto market will continue to decline in 2023. This is the reason behind the massive decrease in the workforce. Layoffs Are Common In Crypto Exchanges Top cryptocurrency exchanges are sizing down their teams to cut costs and prevent wearing out. Other factors have prolonged the current bear market, and this seems to be the only route to stay afloat. Coinbase – US-based crypto giant laid off around 18% of its staff. Huobi followed suit – downsizing its staff by 30%. Popular exchange Gemini laid off 10% of its workforce in June, then recruited over 60 new people in July. Other exchanges that include CryptCorn, BitMEX, and Bybit – reduced their numerical strength. Binance, on the other hand, was one of the few exchanges that expanded operations during the current bearish phase. Who’s Next? Alex Harper, the Swyftx CEO, broke the news of the layoffs in a letter addressed to employees. He referred to the staff as “90 talented friends and employees”. He also distanced Swyftx from any association with the bankrupt exchange FTX. However, he also noted that Swyftx is not immune to the effects of such an event on the crypto market. Harper believes that sizing down a percentage of the workforce will help the organization survive the chilly crypto winter that has claimed many victims.

Also, they will have access to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) for the tenure with additional six months.

According to a Chainlink web post, ""Staking provides Chainlink ecosystem participants with the opportunity to earn rewards for increasing the security guarantees and user assurances of oracle services by backing them with staked LINK tokens.""  Nansen, a blockchain analysis firm, said wallets identified as ""smart money"" have been taking LINK tokens down from crypto exchanges - possibly an indication that users might be planning to stake them.  The price of LINK is up 28% in the past two weeks, from $5.60 to $7.19 at time of writing.  Early access to Chainlink Staking v0.1 opens on Dec. 6 at 12 p.m. ET, while general access is available Dec. 8.  According to a Chainlink blog post, ""Chainlink Staking v0.1 will initally be capped at 25M LINK, with plans to scale up to 75M LINK overtime.""  ""Smart Money"" net flow to exchanges for LINK in the past seven days is down nearly 67,000 tokens (worth $486,000), which means LINK withdrawals exceed deposits, according to Nansen.  Nansen considers a wallet to be ""smart money"" if it is ""historically profitable,"" meaning it meets at least one of several conditions, including: making at least $100,000 by providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocal, SushiSwap and Uniswap, excluding so-called impermanent losses; having at least more than or equal to five times in realized profits on multiple non-fungible token (NFT) collections that were minted in the last 60 months or having made multiple trades on decentralized exchanges in a single transaction that are profitble.  The number of LINK holdings on the Binance exchange has dropped by 7.1 million tokens over the period. The Cryto.com, Kraken, OKX, Coinbase and Gemini exchanges' combined balance of LINK decreased by roughly 951,000 tokens.  Among all wallets, LINK had a large negative outflow from exchanges of roughly $38.9 million in the past seven days.  Investors sometimes transfer coins out of centralized exchanges when they intend to custody their coins themselves for security and long-term holding.  Additionally, 12,731 fresh LINK wallets have been funded in the last 15 days with $261.3 million of inflows, according to Nansen.  Some 50 addresses collected by on-chain researcher Lookonchain received 14.3 million LINK, worth $107.6 million, over the past 12 days from Binance.  One particular smart money whale (0xC54) sent 7,000 LINK tokens to 65 different wallet addresses for a total of 455,000 LINK, worth $3.4 million, according to Lookonchain.

42420863,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVr3,1670274975,Crypto Market Analysis: Consumer Savings Rate Suggests Continued Calm in Bitcoin Prices,"Many economic indicators now point to relatively mild price action in the short term for crypto markets.  The U.S. Federal Reserve’s likely 50 basis point rate hike at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14 would be an encouraging retreat from the more hawkish 75 bps increases that resulted from the FOMC's last four meetings. Inflation has been declining, although 50 bps is hardly dovish enough to return consumers wholeheartedly to riskier investments.  Yet, a decline in savings may offer even more compelling evidence of cryptos’ likely, continued calm.  Inflation growth has exceeded wage increases for nearly two years.  As shown in this graphic from Compound Advisers, prices continue to increase at a faster pace than incomes. Not surprisingly, this trend has led to sharp increases in U.S. revolving debt balances. In turn, the personal savings rate in the U.S. has fallen to its second-lowest rate in close to 60 years.  As retail investors comprise a sizable portion of crypto investors, the continued erosion of buying power will likely weigh upon bitcoin and ether prices. We face a cocktail of higher interest rates, decreased buying power and increased levels of debt.  I’d love to be able to write something other than “bitcoin prices look poised to trade in a range,” but that’s where we are. Over the past week, BTC and ETH prices have stabilized at about $17,000 and $1,300, respectively. Volatility for both (as measured by the Average True Range) has fallen 47% and 45%, respectively.  Momentum for both, as measured by their Relative Strength Index readings, is neutral as well, with both sitting at 50. Volume for both assets have trailed their respective 20-day moving averages, which implies a lack of trading interest.  So for all the noise and uncertainty surrounding crypto markets following the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other industry debacles, crypto prices have remained quiet.  Whale investors to sell?  Part of that quiet is evident on-chain, when looking at the behavior of whale investors – those investors holding at least 1,000 BTC on centralized exchanges.  For example, upticks in whales sending BTC to exchanges between March and June, and October and November this year coincided with 50% and 14% decreases in BTC’s price during those periods.  Recently, whale net positions have flattened.

Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Have Recently Formed A Death Cross As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC Hash Ribbon model has failed for the first time in the crypto’s history. The relevant indicator here is the “mining hashrate,” which measures the total amount of computing power connected to the Bitcoin network right now. When the value of this metric trends up, it means miners are bringing more mining rigs online currently. On the other hand, a decline suggests these chain validators are ditching the network and disconnecting their machines. The Hash Ribbon is a BTC model that’s based on two moving averages of the hashrate metric. A “moving average” (MA) is the mean value of any quantity that, as its name implies, keeps moving with the metric and changes its value accordingly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: MPI Records Highest Value Since April 2022 The benefit of an MA is that it smooths out the curve and removes any temporary fluctuations that have no bearing on the long-term trend. In the context of the Hash Ribbon model, the Bitcoin hashrate MAs of interest are the 30-day and the 60-day versions. Here is a chart that shows the trend in these two ribbons over the last few years: Looks like the two MAs of the metric have gone through a cross recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin 60-day MA hashrate has crossed above the 30-day version recently. When this kind of crossover happens, it means the hashrate has been sharply falling recently as the 30-day average has fallen below the longer, 60-day one. Related Reading: This Historic Bitcoin On-Chain Support Level Is Still Not Lost Historically, crosses like these have been bearish death crosses for the price since they are a signal of miner capitulation. Crosses of the opposite kind, on the contrary, have always had a bullish effect on the price of the coin as they indicate that miners are optimistic on the outcome of BTC since they are expanding their operations. The latest golden cross, however, took place a few months ago, but instead of a price rise, a decrease has followed it. Since the death cross is now already in, it would appear that for the first time in Bitcoin’s history, this bullish crossover has failed to bear any fruits.

42393939,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcSJn,1670274009,The Contagion Fever Breaks: NFTs Dominate Art Basel,"MIAMI — “We were never big wedding people,” said artist Kelly Daniels after marrying health care executive Emir Muhovic during a small ceremony set up at the Scope Art Show in Miami Beach on Dec. 5.  At one of the largest art exhibitions taking place during Art Basel this year, the nuptials looked different than a typical courthouse wedding. The newlyweds, married by artist Jimmy Pierce, minted their wedding as a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT). This includes their vows, marriage license and wedding photos built on the Flow blockchain and supported by NFT powerhouse Dapper Labs.  Pierce, the artist behind Seeds of Happiness, a digital art collection, told CoinDesk that after Daniels and Muhovic reached out to him asking to officiate the wedding, he became ordained in the state of Florida to support the couple in their wishes to get married at his exhibition.  Though it was not the first wedding to incorporate blockchain technology into its programming, the unconventional gathering of about 30 people rounded out a vibrant week of parties, panels and brand activations that focused on the intersection of art and technology. And while many in the space are still defrosting after an extended crypto winter, the wedding highlighted the generally sunny atmosphere in Miami this week, which was focused on long-term building and growth.  “NFTs, blockchain – it’s here forever, and we might as well do it with that frame of mind,” said Muhovic on the decision to enshrine their vows as NFTs. “Just like our marriage!” chimed in Daniels.  Miami’s annual Art Basel festival, now in its 20th year, connects galleries, artists and collectors to create unique artist-led experiences and bolster local art scenes. This year, the event welcomed over 76,000 attendees from 88 countries in the first week of December.  While the festival focuses primarily on fine and contemporary art, NFTs have slowly worked their way into the cultural conversation. Last year’s event showed glimpses of the physical and digital worlds colliding thanks to the hype of 2021 that led to a bull run of NFTs, while this year’s event saw them become more holistically combined, with NFT projects and blockchain companies weaving their way into galleries and events across the city.  The welcoming of NFTs into traditional art spaces comes at a time when the crypto industry has been marred by scandal and uncertainty. Over the past year, crypto ecosystem Terra collapsed, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy protection and one of the largest crypto exchanges, FTX, crumbled, bringing a number of companies down with it. In addition, the price of ether, which powers many NFT projects, is down 60% since the start of this year and NFT trading volume has taken a dive.  Despite this, NFT artists, builders, developers and collectors showed up en masse to support a collaborative vision for Web3.  On Wednesday night, Keith Grossman, who is exiting his role as president at Time Magazine to become president of crypto payments firm Moonpay, hosted a dinner to celebrate Time Pieces, an NFT collection honoring historical moments from the 99-year-old publication’s history.  At the dinner, crypto executives, NFT artists and Web3 thought leaders gathered at the National Hotel to not only to celebrate Grossman’s crypto career pivot, but also to inspire forward thinking about the future of the space.  At the dinner, Miami's mayor, and crypto innovator, Francis Suarez addressed guests and encouraged them to keep creating despite chilly market conditions.  “When we’re creating, there are going to be car crashes. But it’s wonderful to have a network of people who are here supporting you, have incredible knowledge of this nascent technology and are going to pave the way for the future,” Suarez told the crowd of about 100 people.  During the dinner, Dave Krugman, photographer and founder of creative agency Allships, told CoinDesk that 2022’s art week differed from last year in that it emphasized the passion that builders in the space continue to show.  “In a market where everyone can win and everyone can make a lot of money, there's not a lot of conviction there,” said Krugman. “We're starting to wake up to the fact that this next layer of the internet is here to stay, and brands are coming in, despite the market conditions.”  Allships hosted networking brunches over three days in partnership with CoinDesk and blockchain ecosystem Near that brought together creative minds and shapers in the Web3 space. Megan Kaspar, managing director of crypto investment firm Firstlight and founder Web3 fashion house of Red DAO, told CoinDesk that despite current market conditions that cast a shadow over festivities, the volume of Web3-focused events paired with high attendance for those events was a positive sign.  “The morale of the community is really high right now, which is great to see especially with the collapse of FTX and crypto winter and all of the things that our space is going through from the downside perspective. There’s a lot of upside coming,” said Kaspar.  Kaspar hosted a Metaverse Fashion Week brunch in Miami, bringing together the leaders shaping the digital fashion industry such as Nico Fara, founder of The Fashion DAO community; Julien R., head of growth at digital fashion company DRESSX; and Aurelia Ammour, CEO of NFT sneaker company SHOES 53045.  “Last year, when I hosted the event, about half of the people who attended this year showed up,” said Kaspar. “More people are aware of digital fashion and the opportunity it provides not only to the crypto ecosystem, but to the actual fashion industry as a whole. It’s great to see the two worlds merge.”  Shiva Rajaraman, vice president of Product at OpenSea, also shared positive insights into how the NFT market is evolving through market waves, particularly when it comes to discussions on utility and long-term value of the digital assets.  Rajaraman told CoinDesk that while last year’s NFT hype cycle centered on self-expression and community affiliation, the injection of utility into projects is shaping a new narrative that “bleeds into the digital world and the physical world.”  “You have a lot of projects talking about logistics now, and how can I unlock an NFT and get a T-shirt, a bag, access to a real-world event,” said Rajaraman. “People are starting to get more sophisticated about that business model.”  It’s likely we’ll start to see more of these use cases pop up as people begin to explore how to integrate NFTs far beyond their value as just collectible items – including, it appears, as a tool for memorializing weddings.  Amanda Cassatt, CEO of Web3 marketing firm Serotonin, told CoinDesk at NFT Now’s immersive Gateway activation in downtown Miami that the energy at Art Basel further emphasized the importance of firms embracing these technologies as they build out their products.  “It’s time that every brand has their Web3 strategy,” said Cassatt. “I think every company is going to become a Web3 company, and the bear market is the perfect time to build and start working on that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | FLOW,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/05/the-contagion-fever-breaks-nfts-dominate-art-basel,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8547d834e1a315ed81421f258263b8d3779e3fb3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the miner produced 521 bitcoin in November, lower than the 660 it expected to mine, due to a payment variance in the mining pool it was using.  Riot mined only 2% more bitcoin in November than the previous month. Meanwhile, it mined 43% more bitcoins in October versus September.  “Variance in a mining pool can impact results and while this variance should balance out over time, can be volatile in the short term,” Riot CEO Jason Les said in the statement. “This variance led to lower bitcoin production than expected in November, relative to our hashrate,” he added.  A mining pool is like a lottery syndicate, where several miners “pool” their computing power to get a steady stream of bitcoin rewards. Joining a pool of other miners improves the odds significantly of solving a block and winning a reward, although the payout gets split among all members.  Read more: What Are Bitcoin Mining Pools?  Publicly listed miners are usually secretive about the mining pool they use. However, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that Riot was previously using Braiins, formerly known as Slush Pool, for its mining pool.  Most mining pools use several payout methods offering consistent rewards to its pool members. The majority of pools use a method called Full-Pay-Per-Share (FPPS).  Braiins is one of only a few mining pools that uses a mechanism called Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS), which introduces significant variance into its members' rewards. That variance likely contributed to Riot’s lower number of bitcoin rewards, according to the person.  Other payment methods usually ensure miners always get paid, even if the pool doesn’t find a block. However, PPLNS only pays miners after a block has been found by the pool, and then the pool goes back to check for valid shares contributed by each miner before winning a block. The miners then get paid in bitcoin rewards, based on those valid shares contributed by each miner during that time.  To avoid such variance, Riot decided to switch its mining pool, which “offers a more consistent reward mechanism, so that Riot will fully benefit from our rapidly growing hash rate capacity as we work towards our goal of reaching 12.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023,” Les said. Riot didn’t specify to which pool it will be shifting.  Braiins declined to comment on the story.  Miners are already facing a tough crypto winter as bitcoin's declining price and higher energy costs have eaten into profit margins, causing a few miners to file for bankruptcy protection. Predictable and consistent mining rewards, which are miners' main revenue source, are of utmost importance. The margin of error has been increasingly narrow this year amid the current tough conditions.  Riot shares fell about 7% on Monday, while its peer Marathon Digital (MARA) was down more than 12%. Bitcoin was recently down about 1.2% in price.

Bankman-Fried is coming under fire for his attempts at using the media to form his own version of events. That comes as crypto exchange FTX faces bankruptcy proceedings after a CoinDesk report revealed that Alameda Research, an affiliated trading firm that Bankman-Fried also owned, held substantial amounts of FTX’s native token, FTT, on its balance sheet.  A con game  “He wants to position himself as super transparent about everything that happened at FTX and Alameda, and he’s been anything but that,” Murphy said in reference to Bankman-Fried's series of interviews.  “He is a master of deflection, and you see this often with con men who really believe they can convince the world of what they’re saying,” Murphy said.  Despite Bankman-Fried’s attempts at being “transparent,” the disgraced CEO isn’t actually answering reporters’ questions, according to Murphy. Last week, New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin probed Bankman-Fried, albeit with a significant number of “handicaps,” in place.  “Sam Bankman-Fried was not under oath. He wasn’t even in the same room, so you can’t really cross-examine him,” Murphy said, adding that although Sorkin asked a number of questions Murphy would have asked, Bankman-Fried continued to deflect.

The top cryptocurrency, which usually tracks U.S. markets, is bucking this trend as the collapse of troubled exchange FTX, whose native crypto FTX token ( FTT-USD ) also spiraled, has done far more damage to sentiment in the crypto space.

There's no doubt that the fallout from FTX has resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny, which ""may enable greater institutional engagement,"" Shah wrote in a recent note to clients. Also, ""a shift in focus (and capital) from speculative trading to projects with real-world functionality and companies with roadmaps to profitability may accelerate industry maturity,"" he added. Regulatory frameworks for the digital asset industry, which is still not overseen by one singular regulatory regime, ""are critical for mainstream adoption,"" the note read. Many institutional investors have cited a lack of regulatory oversight and even a shortage in coordination among government agencies as big reasons for not entering the emerging space. In essence, FTX's downfall ""has likely refocused attention globally on the need for regulation that 1) creates a transparent legal framework for digital assets; 2) fosters technological innovation; 3) provides consumer and investor protections; and 4) mitigates financial stability risks,"" Shah explained. The value of cryptos were already beaten down well before FTX's collapse, but that event has prompted some to call for further downward pressure. Earlier, Standard Chartered said bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could sink another 70% to $5K next year. Year-to-date, the top 100 digital tokens are off 64%, Shah noted, ""but the cost of ignoring digital assets is high with the top 100 tokens up 2,175% since 2016 YE."" Bear in mind that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the oldest token, is just 14 years old, though hundreds of blockchain-based applications have emerged since then in an effort to disrupt traditional use cases, such as lending, trading and payments. So, ""speculative token trading is widespread, but our view is that it’s the underlying blockchain technology driving this speculation that could be revolutionary,"" the analyst contended.

5183770,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511179,1670263243,"Buyers Rule Over Algorand’s (ALGO) Price Action, Enough To Break Above $0.26?","The Algorand price has been positive over the last 24 hours. Despite minor gains, the altcoin has been moving north. There have been many updates in Algorand’s ecosystem, which might have brought in a slight appreciation in price. As bulls slowly return to the market, investor interest has also shot up accordingly. The technical outlook of ALGO has depicted that the buyers were dominating the market at the time of writing. Recently, Algorand’s developments have made it compatible with Cardano, which has created more liquidity injection into the ecosystem. This development could encourage venture capitalists to inject more liquidity into Algorand, thereby reflecting positively on its price. Algorand price depicts positive predictions, but it must be remembered that ALGO’s ecosystem is developing. ALGO’s price appreciation is a matter of time as more applications get developed on the platform. For ALGO to topple above the $0.26 resistance mark, buyers have to garner further strength. Related Reading: Metaverse Token Axie Infinity (AXS) Suddenly Pumps 25% – What’s Happening? Algorand Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ALGO was auctioning for $0.24 on the one-day chart after it noted a 1.9% appreciation. At the current moment, it can be said that Algorand is consolidating below its immediate resistance of $0.26. A move above the aforementioned price level will ensure that the altcoin can rally to $0.31. Algorand will lose its current support level unless buying strength increases significantly. In such a case, the nearest support floor for the altcoin was $0.22. The amount of Algorand traded in the last session noted a substantial increase, which indicated that buying strength was shooting up. Technical Analysis Buyers’ interest has returned to the market as the altcoin has started to climb on its chart. The Relative Strength Index spent most of the month in the selling zone, but there had been a recovery on the indicator at press time. For ALGO to touch $0.26, the RSI has to travel above the 50-mark. Similarly, although the Algorand price was progressing upward, it was still below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. With slight accumulation, Algorand would topple above the 20-SMA line. Sellers are currently driving the price momentum. Institutional interest has noted a positive change over the past few trading sessions. There was a downtick in the Chaikin Money Flow, which depicts the capital inflows and outflows. Despite the downtick, CMF was still positive. If capital inflows are to remain above the half-line, demand for ALGO cannot waver. Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates price momentum and trend change. MACD formed green signal bars after noting a bullish crossover, which meant buyers could act on it and possibly make gains.

Nexo said it had been in talks with both state and federal regulators in the U.S., but these had come to a ""dead end."" The company did not provide many specifics about these discussions, but said it had shared information with the regulators and tried to ""proactively modify its business"" to respond to these law enforcement agencies' concerns.  Nexo had already off-boarded Earn clients in New York and Vermont at those states' regulators' insistence, a blog post said. It will now suspend access to new users in Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wisconsin, California and Washington. Residents of these states can continue using Nexo's other services.  ""It is now unfortunately clear to us that despite rhetoric to the contrary, the U.S. refuses to provide a path forward for enabling blockchain businesses and we cannot give our customers confidence that regulators are focused on their best interests,"" the blog post said.  The company did not provide a firm timeline for its overall withdrawal from the U.S.  Nexo listed grievances with U.S. regulators throughout the blog post, saying ""although regulators initially encouraged our cooperation and a sustainable path forward appeared viable,"" recent events – hinting at the turmoil caused by FTX's collapse – have created ""an impossible environment"" for the company to continue operating.  ""This was made crystal clear by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) decision this past Thursday insisting it has jurisdiction to investigate our Earn Interest Product, which the [Securities and Exchange Commission[ and state regulators have simultaneously insisted is a security subject to their jurisdictions,"" the blog post said.  It also pointed to enforcement actions brought in September by eight different states, including New York and California, alleging that the company's Earn product violated state securities laws.  At the time, Nexo told CoinDesk that it had already ""ceased the onboarding of new US clients"" for its Earn product.

In a bankruptcy deposition made Nov. 17, restructuring specialist Ray berated poor record-keeping and untrustworthy financial information at FTX, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on Nov. 11.  In an interview released Monday, Bankman-Fried referred to “statements that have been made, that have been put on legal record that I knew to be false.”  “There have been cases where it's been said XYZ did not exist, and I am staring at a copy of XYZ, ” Bankman-Fried added. Bankman-Fried has also previously said that he has had only “limited access to data” since stepping down as CEO.  Bankman-Fried said that the falsehoods could amount to lying or honest mistakes and that Ray and his team hadn't responded to Bankman-Fried’s emails on the issue.  “I think it's pretty hard, if you try and take over a company and refuse to talk with anyone who was involved in running that company, to, in a short period of time, know where any of the relevant data would be,” including company books and documented policies, Bankman-Fried said.  The comment came in response to a question about the new CEO’s comments on poor financial controls.  “I would dispute the claim that there were zero financial controls,” Bankman-Fried said. “I completely agree that there were places in which there were very poor controls and that those places were critical and that that was really bad.”  In his earlier deposition, Ray said he had never in his 40-year career seen “such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information” as he saw when he took over at FTX.  Ray said the company didn't have appropriate books, records or security controls for its digital assets, or even a full list of staff on its payroll.  Trading arm Alameda Research and related businesses didn’t keep complete records of their investments, Ray said, adding that the court shouldn't rely on audited financial statements that he said he had “substantial concerns"" about.

The bitcoin miner produced 521 BTC, up ~12% Y/Y but below its expected production of ~660 BTC due to variance in the mining pool it participates in. However, it was the firm's highest monthly BTC production figure to date. Riot ( RIOT ) had a deployed fleet of 72.4K miners, with a hash rate capacity of 7.7 EH/s as of November 30 - which the firm said was a new record. ""Despite this new level of production, expected production was ~660 BTC given our operating hash rate over the month, assuming normalized performance of the mining pool we participate in. Variance in a mining pool can impact results and while this variance should balance out over time, can be volatile in the short term. This variance led to lower BTC production than expected, relative to our hash rate,"" said Riot ( RIOT ) CEO Jason Les. The company held ~6,897 BTC, produced by its self-mining operations, as of November 30 and sold 450 BTC during the month for ~$8.1M. Les said the firm will transition to another mining pool that offers a more consistent reward mechanism to ensure more predictable results going forward During November, Riot received 10.5K new S19-series miners and increased its deployed fleet by 6.9K S19-series miners, with ~6,912 miners staged for deployment. Once deployed, the firm expects to have 79.3K miners deployed with a hash rate capacity of ~9.7 EH/s. During Q1, Riot ( RIOT ) expects total self-mining hash rate capacity of 12.5 EH/s.

The number one crypto by market cap experienced some of its worst months in history, but the bulls were able to hold the line at around $15,500. Related Reading: Why Chiliz Is Losing Heat Despite World Cup Pomp; CHZ Down Over 30% Now, the macroeconomic outlook is changing and could start supporting further profits for risk-on assets. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $17,200 with 2% and 5% profits in the last 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Bitcoin Market Is Getting Back To Normal Data from crypto derivatives exchange Deribit indicates a shift in market sentiment. Participants are more optimistic about Bitcoin after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and the fall from the grace of its co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. This event pushed Bitcoin to a new yearly low and back to its 2020 levels. As seen in the chart below, the BTC Open Interest Weighted Annualized Basis shows that the prices of options contracts were in backwardation. In other words, options were cheaper than their underlying asset, Bitcoin, following the FTX collapse. The last time BTC saw similar backwardation was in July 2021, during the second capitulation event that triggered a 40% crash in the crypto market. However, the chart shows that in July 2021, market sentiment and backwardation were far from their November 2022 levels. In addition, the chart shows that the heavy selling triggered by recent events is decreasing, and the crypto market is normalizing. Deribit stated: In July 21, the whole curve didn’t invert as the longer-dated contracts still traded at a premium. Since 8 November this year, we however see the whole curve trading below spot. BTC’s Price Short-Term Rally Is More Likely Paired with the above, Deribit claims the BTC 25 put skew, a metric used to gauge market sentiment by looking at the demand for put (sell) options contracts, and their implied volatility is also on the decline. Puts were expensive during the FTX fallout but are returning to their “normal” levels. Deribit said: A drop in 1 Month Skew indicates the shorter-dated out the money calls are getting more expensive relative to the out the money puts. In other words, market participants are buying more calls (buy) contracts. These options have a short-term expiration date. Thus, people might be gearing up for a Christmas or end-of-the-year rally.

42393926,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcRUV,1670254241,Introducing Consensus Magazine: Putting Web3 in Perspective,"As of today, CoinDesk’s digital magazine – formerly known as Layer 2 – will be renamed Consensus Magazine.  Last December we launched Layer 2 as a venue to explore crypto, blockchain and Web3’s big themes: the reinvention of money, the decentralization of the internet, the re-ordering of organizations around trustless collaboration (to name a few). We called it Layer 2 (normally used to describe supplements to a blockchain’s base layer) because we conceived it as a second layer to what we were doing in the newsroom. CoinDesk has long been a leading source of crypto news. Layer 2 aimed to build on the daily headlines, supplying context, explanation, opinion and investigation.  The need for such content has never been more acute. In the last 12 months, we’ve seen crypto and Web3 seep ever more into mainstream conversation. It has penetrated America’s power centers. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are now minted by actors, athletes and musicians, while franchises such as Bored Ape Yacht Club are taken seriously in Hollywood. Central banks are releasing digital currencies, spurred by monetary competition from bitcoin and ether. Wall Street banks are offering custody and trading services, hoping to get a cut of the action. Washington, D.C., which for a long time largely avoided crypto, has finally stepped up to regulate the industry, and take its money.  At the same time, we’ve also witnessed the ugly side of the blockchain revolution. Names including Terra, Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital and, not least of all, FTX have passed into the same notorious lexicon as Lehman, Enron and MF Global. Crypto’s reputation is once more in the toilet in the financial press, especially among skeptics who never gave it a chance anyway. Trillions in value has been lost, probably setting back the cause by several years.  It’s a mixed and complicated picture: a lot of good and too much bad. Crypto is an industry with much promise that’s sullied by frequent controversy, incompetence and malfeasance. (Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX falls squarely in the last category.) But it’s an industry that deserves explaining and considering. Whatever the fallout from FTX, there are still millions of developers, asset holders and observers out there who believe in Web3 and want to understand its implications. Web3 offers solutions for the future even if it’s not always good at enunciating or proving them.  Also, FTX showed why journalism still matters: CoinDesk’s early November story about Alameda’s dodgy balance sheet, which set off the unraveling, is a riposte to all those who said the best reporting and analysis these days comes from vigilantes with anonymous Twitter accounts. At CoinDesk we’re never afraid to uncover unsavory aspects of what increasingly powerful actors are doing.  So why the name change? Because a magazine at its best is a conversation: a place where people can offer and debate ideas. Magazines are powerful when they spark dialogue about what’s happening now and could happen in the future. And that’s Consensus, CoinDesk’s annual event, all over. It’s where the biggest conversations in Web3 happen. Consensus Magazine aims to be the place where some of those conversations begin, whether it’s in features by our writers, in interviews with leading figures or in opinion pieces that tackle the latest scandals and triumphs.  Like Layer 2, Consensus Magazine is partly periodical, partly ongoing analysis. It’s made up of monthly Theme Weeks devoted to crypto and Web3 topics (such as our marquee Most Influential list, which we revealed today) as well as daily commentary. We’re here to explore the big themes in print and on TV (putting them on the stage in Austin, Texas, in April) and to offer commentary you don’t find anywhere else (like describing SBF for what he really is).  We have even more plans for the Consensus Magazine experience using our DESK social token. Stay tuned for more news on that soon.  We hope you enjoy our new look and that you, too, will want to be part of what’s next. None of us knows what the future holds. But we are steadfast in our belief that peer-to-peer, decentralized technologies will be part of it and it’s on all of us to be paying attention.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/introducing-consensus-magazine-putting-web3-in-perspective,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74a5350b5e7f52d24aba1c2bb1051fcb557e7b99-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417066,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLZt,1670253718,Most Influential Artist: Adam Levine,"With his decidedly cuddly style, Adam Levine’s (aka Adamtastic) art may feel more suited to a Pixar cartoon than crypto skeptic Molly White and others who call out serious scams and wrongdoings in the industry. But the artist, 42, found a way to use the “softness” in his work to depict White’s empathy. After all, she’s only calling out the bad guys to help others avoid their traps.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  “With this portrait, I have taken Molly to be the central figure who sees that the world is burning and has so much empathy for everyone in it,” Levine said. He even sees some of himself in White. “We're both, in our own ways, trying to help people,” he said. “I'm not in here trying to scam people – I'm making art for charities, because I believe this technology can help more than just artists; it can help people in the world.”  More: An NFT of this image, created by Adamtastic, was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  I first learned about NFTs [non-fungible tokens] at the end of 2020. I was scrolling through Instagram, and my friend Bryan Brinkman had posted some art. I went down the rabbit hole, and Bryan was generous with his time – we got on lots of long, late phone calls. I took tons of notes and was hooked.  This was before NFTs blew up. It was exciting. It was also during lockdowns. I wound up getting engrossed in all things NFTs, learning about the technology, meeting so many people, which Clubhouse helped facilitate. There were so many of us artists learning at the same time and helping each other out. It felt like a community. I'd be up all hours of the night talking to people, and if one of us learned something, we’d share with the group. We could see the huge potential for what we all hoped would be an art Renaissance in modern times.  What was your first ever piece of NFT art and why did you decide to make it an NFT?  I've been making art my whole life, whether it's illustration, painting, digital, physical, even sewing, crafting. But I really wanted to make things for this space, and not just put up a random piece of art that I'd made. [My first NFT work] was about how I felt growing up with ADD – always a little out of place.  I ended up making two companion pieces in a series called “Fitting In.” The first was “Drifting.” I had always been called “weird” and would retreat into my imagination. This was a love letter to everybody who feels the same way. As a kid, teachers called me out for daydreaming. That was seen as a negative thing, but as I got older, I saw it as more of a superpower.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Molly White and the skeptics?  My first exposure to crypto was positive – through artists and NFTs – even though I know there's bad actors. I did a deep dive on Molly and some other skeptics, and she's not wrong. Her perspective was really eye opening. I wound up going down rabbit holes she had pointed out.  These last [few] weeks really proved out what she's been sounding the alarms about. I feel awful for everybody who has been deceived and taken advantage of. I wanted to approach [Molly’s portrait] from a place of empathy. Initially, I had her as more of a warrior figure, which she very much is, but all of that comes from her good nature of wanting to protect others.  Where do you see yourself going in the NFT art world moving forward?  I want to stick to my mission of spreading joy and uplifting others. There's so many NFT projects that are just trying to make a buck. I'm trying to build communities organically, even if they take longer and they’re smaller. They’ll be built with people who care for other people.  I see this technology as being able to help others. I've had opportunities to donate to charities prior to NFTs, but never at scale. This past year, raising just shy of $100,000, all going to different charities just from making art, showed me that even in a bad market, we can still have an impact.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/most-influential-artist-adam-levine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45712090532397b29d4789ae60fc8a4b2f20c065-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413500,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9XVE,1670253426,FTX Contagion Spreads as Orthogonal Trading Gets Default Notice for $36M Debt on Maple Finance,"Maple Finance, a big blockchain-based lending platform, severed ties with crypto firm Orthogonal Trading, alleging that it was ""misrepresenting its financial position.""  The move came after Orthogonal was due to pay back a $10 million USDC stablecoin loan from a credit pool managed by M11 Credit on Dec. 4. Orthogonal has been a significant borrower on Maple, and also was a manager and underwriter of a credit pool on Maple.  M11 Credit has issued a notice of default to Orthogonal for all active loans outstanding from that particular USDC stablecoin pool on Maple, with $31 million of current liabilities in four loans. The default notice also extends to Orthogonal's wrapped ether (wETH) loans worth of $5 million (3,900 wETH) from another M11 Credit-managed lending facility on Maple, M11 Credit confirmed to CoinDesk.  Maple said in a statement that Orthogonal has been ""operating while effectively insolvent,"" and didn't communicate that it would be unable to service the debt.  ""Misrepresentation like this is in violation of Maple’s agreements, and all appropriate legal avenues to recover funds will be pursued including arbitration or litigation as necessary,"" according to the statement.  An email from CoinDesk requesting comment from Orthogonal wasn't immediately returned.  A default by Orthogonal could deal another blow to undercollateralized lending protocols, grappling with liquidity crunch and the fallout of from the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX crypto exchange.  Orthogonal's lapse marks the second time a borrower defaulted on Maple after Babel Finance's failure to service its debt in June. Earlier this fall, crypto firms Blockwater and Invictus Capital defaulted on their loans on rival unsecured lending protocol TrueFi.  Read more: TrueFi's $4M Bad Debt in Limbo Shows Risk of Crypto Lending Without Collateral  The string of defaults highlights the risks and shortcomings of the business model of unsecured lending on platforms such as Maple. These loans don't require the borrower to pledge any assets against the debt that could be automatically confiscated – or liquidated as collateral – in the event of a default.  Instead, the loan is granted essentially based on a borrower's creditworthiness alone – considering things like financial standing and due diligence performed by the loan's underwriter, usually the manager of the credit pool.  ""Orthogonal's default showcases how uncollateralized loans in [decentralized finance] are still reliant on centralized parties for underwriting, antithetical to the ethos of transparency and decentralization,"" Walter Teng, vice president of digital assets at market research firm Fundstrat, told CoinDesk.  Losses from FTX implosion  M11 Credit wrote Monday in a blog post that it was informed by Orthogonal on Dec. 3 that it ""incurred larger losses than previously disclosed"" due to funds held on FTX, the crypto exchange that imploded last month, and as a result was unable to repay its debt as a borrower.  ""We are extremely shocked and disappointed by the actions of Orthogonal Trading,"" M11 Credit's statement said. ""Purposefully misstating information during the numerous contacts we have had over the last weeks severely impacted our ability to manage our outstanding credit risk.""  M11 Credit is a subsidiary of investment firm Maven 11 Capital, which focuses on investing in blockchain and distributed ledger technology, according to its website.  Bad debt on Maple  Orthogonal has been actively involved in lending and borrowing on Maple. Out of the five separate lending pools on Maple with a total of $112 million of active loans, Orthogonal was a borrower from two of the pools and managed a third.  Orthogonal's $31 million outstanding loans from the M11 Credit USDC lending pool represents some 80% of the $38.5 million active loans in the pool.  On top of that, Orthogonal also has four active loans of 3,900 wETH in total, worth some $5 million, from another M11 Credit-managed credit pool on Maple. These loans take up some 18% of the pool's $28 million of outstanding debt.  Orthogonal also acted as the manager of another Maple credit pool for USDC, which has $30 million of active loans. Since May 2021, it has originated $563 million in loans, including to FTX's corporate sibling trading firm Alameda Research. In November, when Alameda filed for bankruptcy with FTX, Orthogonal pointed out that it had discontinued lending to Alameda earlier this year after identifying key weaknesses during due diligence.  In the statement, Maple said it had issued a notice of termination to Orthogonal in its role as manager of that pool.  Maple Finance and M11 Credit were already dealing with the embattled market maker Auros Global's failed repayment of a loan from the wrapped ether pool, citing ""short-term liquidity issue as a result of the FTX insolvency.""  A five-day grace period for Auros to pay back a $3.1 million wrapped ether loan expires Monday. M11 Credit extended the maturity date twice for two loans totaling to $10 million, which were due in early November.  Generally speaking, when a big borrower defaults on a loan from Maple, the creditors for that pool end up taking a loss.  In July, after Maple liquidated Babel Finance's defaulted $10 million loan, creditors in the pool stomached a $7.9 million loss, which translated to a 3.2% haircut on the $244 million total deposits in the pool.  UPDATE (Dec. 5, 15:50 UTC): Added paragraphs about M11 Credit's statement and Orthogonal's outstanding loans from M11 Credit.  UPDATE (Dec. 5, 19:10 UTC): Adds that Orthogonal also owed $5 million to a wrapped ether credit pool managed by M11 Credit.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/05/maple-finance-severs-ties-with-orthogonal-trading-alleging-it-misrepresented-financial-position,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba676291f0ecf5fa010d0fbefeb8659c009b129e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417054,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLPZ,1670253246,Most Influential Artist: Osinachi,"Nigerian artist Osinachi creates with an unusual medium. You might not guess when looking at his minutely detailed illustrations, but they’re made in Microsoft Word.  “As a kid, my dad introduced me to the computer,” he says, where he discovered early online literary magazines. He used Word to submit writing to these magazines, but when he got bored, he’d explore the program’s drawing tools.  Starting by reproducing logos (like the Nigerian Television Authority) Osinachi, 31, honed his ability to create art with Word, his medium for 17 years now. “There are lots of limitations, but I've learned to bend it to do what I want it to do, or maybe to use these limitations to create other possibilities,” he says. “It's just a case of mastering the software.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  For this year’s Most Influential series, CoinDesk asked Osinachi to create a portrait of Mikhaylo Federov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, who raised $178 million in crypto for that nation’s war effort.  The natively digital artist says he wanted “highlight what Federov’s done to better the lives of war victims” – a topic that Osinachi is well acquainted with from his country.  More: An NFT of this image, created by Osinachi, was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  I heard about “art on the blockchain” in late-2017, but I entered the space in 2018. I was looking for a platform to share my work with a wider audience beyond Instagram and an opportunity to make money from what I do. The trad art world was like, “Your work is beautiful, but it's digital. Is it still art?” Blockchain can offer solutions to that question.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Mikhaylo Federov?  I’ve been thinking about how to make a tribute to courage. I'm talking about people on the frontlines. When you talk about wars, it's not just about trying to make peace, but also trying to help those who have been affected.  I come from a tribe here in Nigeria that faced a very horrible Civil War. I remember stories about invasion. Even in the face of the horrors of war, [Federov] is doing things to make people's lives better.  You can personally relate to your subject in this way?  I can relate to the idea of being invaded. Take the Biafran War, which some people refer to as the Nigerian Civil War. Biafra, mostly made up of Igbo tribes, said they wanted to leave Nigeria and be a country of their own. But Nigeria said no, we're not going to let you go. This led to the invasion of Biafra by the Nigerian forces and the deaths of millions of people – children especially, who died of malnutrition. This is what binds us in terms of our experience. I wasn't there when the Biafran war was fought, but [I heard stories].  Who are your main artistic influences?  I have a trinity when it comes to influences. There's Njideka Akunyili-Crosby. She's Nigerian-American and creates beautiful portraiture that remind me of home. There's nostalgia in what she's creating. She isn't based in Nigeria, so she's reaching down to her memory.  There's Kehinde Wiley, who is also a Nigerian-American and puts Black bodies in dignified positions, making them beautiful and larger than life. Then there's Tschabalala Self, who creates portraiture of women with unconventional body shapes. I see it as a tribute to a woman being beautiful in whatever shape she comes.  Where do you see yourself in the NFT art world moving forward?  There are two things that I want to see not just for me, but for the space at large. One is to see us get closer to realizing the dream of full decentralization. That might not happen until ten or 50 years from now. It’s a journey.  I also want to see more collaborations in the space, especially with players in the traditional art world. We can’t just exist in isolation as artists in the NFT space. The journey to decentralization is best enjoyed when you have company. We can go along with those in the traditional art world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/most-influential-artist-osinachi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2327b62fe7bcfadfa95cb5ffa23c4017589196a8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417057,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLRd,1670252680,Most Influential Artist: Ravi Vora,"Before non-fungible tokens Ravi Vora worked as a commercial photographer, shooting for Apple, Nike and Land Rover. He’s used to helping brands make the trek from old habits to new media – something the subjects of his “Most Influential” piece, Gary Vaynerchuk and Vayner3 President Avery Akkineni, do with brands entering Web3.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Today, Los Angeles-based Vora, 36, has made that journey himself by using more 3D digital art in his work – a shift he made during the coronavirus pandemic when he “couldn’t travel to capture landscapes and portraits with photography,” he explained.  More: An NFT of this image, created by Ravi Vora, was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  That’s also how Vora came by non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, a medium he’s found helps him produce not just individual pieces, but a cohesive body of work connected by the blockchain.  “It gives you the idea that there’s this bigger world being created – like the world of Neil Gaiman,” an award-winning author whose characters inhabit rich, fantastical worlds, he said. “There’s a touch point that drives back to my imaginary universe that all these art pieces live in.”  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  It was pandemic quarantine. Normally I would be traveling the world, but my friends and I were playing games to hang out with each other, and I learned about crypto and NFTs.  I've been a photographer and creative artist for a long time. A lot of my work has been on social, and I wanted to understand how to take ownership of work we post for free, for exposure. When I learned about NFTs, I immediately fell in love with the idea of having provenance tied directly to a piece of work.  What was the first ever piece of NFT art that you made?  I minted a 3D cinematic triptych in January 2021 of this sci-fi diver that was either underwater or in space. You can't really tell – it's abstract. That led me down the cinematic portrait route at the beginning of my NFT journey.  What made you decide to make that piece an NFT?  With my background as a director, storytelling has always been my number one thing. Because this piece lives on the blockchain forever, it felt like I was able to tell a longer story that spans beyond one piece. I can almost tell my own film, or my own serial, that ties back to these pieces. My story as an artist can live on chain.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Gary and Avery?  I've been considering how they’re conduits welcoming people into the space, making [Web3] approachable for brands and people and bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. Thematically, I’m focusing on that middle space between the old world and the new.  How are you showing that in your piece?  I've been concepting with themes of connectivity. I’ll put multiple hands in the frame, which represent the transfer of knowledge. There could be volumetric light emanating from inside the hands or the mind, tying in the idea of openness and approachability.  It's going to be hard not to include Gary’s mimetic smirk in my piece. That was my first thought when the project [was assigned]. But with Avery involved, it becomes a bigger story.  Is there anything about your subjects that inspire you, or that you can relate to?  When social media blew up 10 years ago, I was onboarding brands into how they should approach Instagram and tell their story through social media, which was a different format than using an ad copywriter. It’s about being authentic and working with creatives who already understand the space, which these brands weren’t used to.  What Gary and Avery are doing with Web3 is helping brands get a foothold without making the community that's already [in Web3] feel alienated.  Where do you see yourself going in the NFT art world moving forward?  I like to understand how technology can help us as artists push forward our imaginations and messages. Being a photographer, what's the latest camera? How does that work? How is artificial intelligence going to assist artists? How do we use all this technology to tell an emotionally impactful story?  When I do travel photography, I might go outside my comfort zone. With art, sometimes it's the same thing – a fear of our own reality. With technology, it's even scarier, because we can feel threatened by it, or we can accept it and make it part of our story. We can be afraid of crypto and NFTs, and people can think it's a scam or not authentically owning anything. Or we can look to the future of digital ownership.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/ravi-vora-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b3b0be4fccfff62ddb9d78d6576630b1c9defbb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417053,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLQb,1670252554,Most Influential Artist: Sarah Script,"A calligraphy artist, Sarah Richardson (who works under the name Sarah Script) had been making Instagram videos of her work for roughly seven years before learning about non-fungible tokens (NFT). “When you do calligraphy, you only get one shot to get it right. You have to stick the landing,” she said. “I would film videos for hours of one or two words that would last all of 15 seconds after edits.”  The work can be tedious, but Richardson found it lends itself to the NFT format. “Cementing” her videos on the blockchain has made her feel a sense of ownership that she didn’t get from posting on Instagram. “I would love to see more calligraphy as NFTs,” said the bespectacled Arkansas native, who now lives in Brooklyn, New York, “because I think it certainly has a place.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  In learning about her “Most Influential” subject, Carole House, White House adviser on the Biden administration's executive order on “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets, the 34-year-old Richardson felt moved by the work of another young woman making waves in the crypto world.  “The House, Senate, Supreme Court and other government organizations weren't doing anything [about crypto],” said Richardson, “and here’s Carole House, who’s my age. To see her come in and be this huge part of moving regulations forward was really inspiring.”  More: An NFT of this image, created by Sarah Fontaine Richardson, was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  I learned about NFTs in February 2021 through Clubhouse. Somebody I met in a room there asked me if I had heard about NFTs, and I hadn’t. It was snowing in Arkansas, where I'm from, and when it snows here everything shuts down. I couldn't go anywhere, so I dove into this crazy world of NFTs.  What was your first ever piece of NFT art and why did you decide to make it an NFT?  It was a digital mosaic that I learned to do in a Skillshare Class a month before. I remember thinking, “What is the point of this other than to share it online?” That sounds so negative, but I really enjoyed the tedious nature of making something look like a real-life mosaic, digitally.  I minted it on Mintable, and I didn’t really know what I was doing. It said, “Je t’aime,” and it was a gif, because I thought NFTs had to be moving – you had to incorporate all the elements of digital you could. That sold to a person I was learning about NFTs with in a Clubhouse room the same day. They were learning how to buy NFTs while I was learning how to make them.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Carole House?  I was impressed by how seriously she took national security regarding cryptocurrency. As someone who's been immersed in this space for the last two years, I never took that into account. It got me thinking, and I wanted to emphasize how important that was. In one of the illustrations [I made before the final piece], the direction is herding cats.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  What about House’s work in the crypto/blockchain industry most inspires or interests you?  I like that she's an unsung hero of regulation. She's behind the scenes doing something for the greater good, and not for – in this era of Elon Musk types – taking the limelight for leadership. I like that she's just doing what needs to be done.  Who/what are your main artistic influences? Do they come more from the traditional art world or the NFT art world, both?  In terms of calligraphy, my inspirations are Nina Tran, David Grimes and John DeCollibus. DeCollibus is one of the few living Master Penmen.  In terms of lettering artists, I love Jessica Hische and Louise Fili. In the NFT world, I love Diela Maharanie, who does bright, colorful illustrations and Suzie. I fell in love with her work when she did this series called “Angry Susies.” Something that’s so cute and angry at the same time is funny to me.  Where do you see yourself going in the NFT art world moving forward?  I plan to stay involved and keep my eye on what's going on. A lot of my illustrations reference what's happening in the NFT space. Right now, it's shaky times, so I'm not minting work. My main goals over the next few years are to improve my illustration skills and build out stories. I’m in a children's book writing class right now and trying to take two of my characters from previous collections and put them into a story.

42417064,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLbx,1670252321,Most Influential Artist: Federico Solmi,"Before the coronavirus pandemic, before non-fungible tokens picked up speed, Federico, 49, had a collector who’d come by his studio to discuss his work. “In 2019, he told me my work would be great as crypto art and I should consider NFTs,” Federico says. “I said, ‘What is crypto art?’”  This collector turned out to be one of the most influential in the crypto space (Federico didn’t say who), but he’d picked on something in Federico’s work that would lend itself to the NFT sphere.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  “Since 2003, I was combining digital and gaming technology with drawings and paintings,” Federico, who’s Italian but has been based in New York City since 1999, says. “It was a natural transition for me to start developing work for the crypto space.”  What was the first ever piece of NFT art that you made, and why did you decide to make it an NFT?  My first NFT series was called “The Smokers,” a collection of five NFTs connected to my political body of work. It includes leaders like Donald Trump smoking cigars, wearing all their fake gold medals from the battlefield – it’s a satirical piece.  I fell in love with NFTs because you have 15, 20 seconds to tell a story. You have to be very direct and immediately capture viewers’ attention. When I do work for the gallery, my videos usually last five to ten minutes, so it’s much easier to build a compelling story. NFTs were a great growth for me, to see art that could be much more direct and less narrative.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Vitalik Buterin and the ETH developers working on the merge?  A lot of my work tries to investigate political leaders. With the Vitalik Buterin piece, I wanted to create a huge monument, like how the Romans created monuments of their gods, in which Vitalik is a hero for the new order of finance and the future world. It’s a tribute to a normal person that, through mass media, was elevated to the stature of a gigantic meme.  What were some of the artistic decisions you made to convey that in your piece?  I wanted to make something that was completely unexpected, with Vitalik becoming a statue like the Tin Man from “The Wizard of Oz.” It uses ambiguous images to make it grotesque and funny, to show the ridiculous aspect of elevating a 30-year-old to the status of a god. It’s a very theatrical tribute to a contemporary god.  I treat a contemporary myth like an ancient myth. In a way, I collapse the idea of time, so we live in an imaginary time. The atmosphere of the piece belongs to a post-physical world, so we feel that this sculpture is in a pixelized world.  Who/what are your main artistic influences?  Most of my inspirations are writers. Over the past few years, I was very influenced by Howard Zinn, an American historian, and Noam Chomsky. My goal was always to use art as a vehicle for social commentary. I always found the art world very polite, very careful, and I was looking at how to counter-attack the madness of society, so these writers were always a big part of my inspiration.  Where do you see yourself in the NFT art world moving forward?  In the past few years, I've been very active. I take the work extremely seriously.

42393923,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcRKF,1670251844,3 of the Most Influential Brands in Web3,"Despite the volatility and instability surrounding cryptocurrency in the last few months, more brands than ever are incorporating blockchain technology into their business models. With major names such Starbucks, Walmart, Gucci and the National Football League among the many heavily investing in Web3, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse, it is clear that these technologies are not going away anytime soon.  However, not all Web3 strategies are created equal. While some brands have had great success with their Web3 endeavors, others have flopped. Read on for a look at how three of the most influential brands in Web3 are using blockchain technology to deepen their relationship with their audiences.  What is Web3 and why are brands using it?  Before you can fully grasp the influence of blockchain-based marketing strategies, it is important to have a good understanding of Web3. To put it very simply, Web3 uses cryptocurrency’s core blockchain technology to build a version of the web that is decentralized and supports peer-to-peer interactions rather than relying entirely on centralized third parties like Meta, Google and Amazon for all our web needs.  Ownership and utility are at the heart of Web3. In a Web3 ecosystem, owning tokens or NFTs grants holders the power to make governance decisions and exclusive access to various perks. These principles are appealing to brands because they offer a clear incentive alignment. When consumers have ownership of the brand, they have the incentive to contribute to its success.  Part of the reason Web3 is difficult to grasp for so many is that it is still being built. Currently, companies and brands are slowly integrating Web3 technologies such as digital wallets, tokens, NFTs and virtual worlds into their existing operations and marketing strategies.  Below, let’s explore three brands that have successfully integrated Web3 into their businesses and examine how their strategies can help others looking to enter the space.  1. Reddit  Since July, Reddit has quietly onboarded more than 2.5 million users into Web3 without actually using the words NFT, crypto or Web3. Nevertheless, Reddit’s Vault feature is a blockchain-based digital wallet that allows users to collect digital goods as they browse. What Reddit doesn’t say outright is that those digital goods are actually NFTs, which is what makes this Web3 strategy so influential.  In a world where people tend to be resistant towards change, getting users to adopt new technologies is tough – just look at how long it took the internet to become popular. To make matters worse, decentralized technologies don’t have the best reputation in the mainstream. Terms like “crypto,” “NFT” and even “Web3” sometimes have negative connotations due to some malicious actors who have taken advantage of the budding ecosystem for their own gain.  Despite this negative reputation, cryptocurrency and its underlying technologies have numerous benefits, and many brands are catching on. Reddit realized that the best way to onboard someone to a new technology like Web3 is to do so in a way where the user doesn’t realize they are using something new.  The main takeaway from Reddit’s Web3 launch is that making the onboarding process as smooth and simple as possible is key when working with audiences who are not native to Web3.  2. Nike  While Reddit’s quiet approach to Web3 works for onboarding users who may be resistant to crypto jargon, Nike provides a great example of how legacy brands can take a more straightforward approach to working in Web3.  Nike launched its first NFT collection, CloneX, in 2021 and shortly thereafter acquired RTFKT, a Web3-native company leading the way in sophisticated 3D characters for digital worlds.  Together with RTFKT, Nike has become one of the most successful brands in the Web3 space, dropping more than a dozen NFT collections that have generated $185.26 million in ether (ETH) from primary NFT sales and trading royalties, based on public blockchain data aggregated by Dune.  In November 2022, Nike announced it is taking its Web3 strategy one step further with the launch of a digital marketplace called dotSwoosh. According to swoosh.nike, dotSwoosh is “a new community experience, designed to give you the opportunity to co-create the future of Nike.”  DotSwoosh allows Nike fans to create, store and trade collectibles and virtual wearables. Holders will also have access to virtual events, exclusive content and the ability to preorder upcoming Nike drops. DotSwoosh is currently in beta but is expected to fully launch in January 2023.  With help from the Web3 native company RTFKT, Nike’s Web3 strategy creates a seamlessly blended experience for crypto-curious and Web3 native audiences alike while staying true to its legacy brand roots.  3. Liquid Death  Since the beginning, Liquid Death has had a very targeted marketing strategy with clear branding and positioning. While other water companies talk about purity, nature and taste, Liquid Death talks about murdering thirst and bringing death to plastic. It managed to make something really boring into something edgy and cool. Through provocative ad campaigns, Liquid Death has gained a cult following.  The Liquid Death Web3 strategy caters to this cult following and acts as a perfect continuation of the Liquid Death brand. In March 2022, Liquid Death launched Murder Head Death Club (MHDC), featuring a collection of 6,666 unique NFTs. The NFTs depict the severed heads of dead thirsts and were created by celebrated artist Will Carsola. The MHDC collection sold out in three hours after the launch. At an initial minting fee of 0.0666 ETH, MHDC’s launch generated around 445 ETH in sales for Liquid Death.  MHDC holders have access to an exclusive digital community, real-life experiences, Web3 airdrops and VIP access to all things Liquid Death, including merch, art and deals. In keeping with its brand values of sustainability, Liquid Death says it donates 10% of royalties from the MHDC collection to charities that help eliminate plastic waste and offset 110% of the carbon emissions from the initial mint.  Much of Liquid Death’s success with Web3 can be attributed to the fact that the brand is extremely clear on the interests and passions of its target audience. Liquid Death is a great example of how to stay true to your brand and foster a community with your most loyal customers and fans.

42417052,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLOX,1670250488,The Artist and Technology Behind 36 AI Portraits,"Will Ess produced 36 portraits of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022 in about one week. He accomplished this feat with the help of Pixelmind.ai, a platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to transform photographs into stylish portraits with mood, color and even some (artificial) intention.  Pixelmind.ai takes about 20 to 30 minutes to “understand” what a person looks like by analyzing a photo. In most cases, AI will help create about 100 versions of each portrait. From that starting point, Ess explored different artistic styles and vibes to ensure the final image matched the story and the person on the list.  ""[We use] a variety of styles with the idea toward making each profile picture fit the profile,” said Adam B. Levine, CEO of 330AI, the company that launched Pixelmind.ai. “So if it's like a darker story then we want a darker direction; if it's a story that's about something great happening, then we went there.” In addition to running 330AI, Levine was previously the managing editor of CoinDesk podcasts and still hosts CoinDesk’s Markets Daily Crypto Roundup podcast.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  AI is a fast-changing technology, especially for image generators. Back in July, artists used Pixelmind.ai to produce images in five minutes. Then in August, with the introduction to the market of an optimized deep-learning text-to-image technology called stable diffusion, the amount of time it took to create an image dropped to about five seconds and the quality of the image had a two-times to four-times improvement.  “Just keeping up with the changes in technology is the hardest part of my job because every week it seems like there's something new that we need to consider and that just doesn't stop,"" said Ess. ""Artists and people with a good understanding of art history can really get the most out of it,"" he added.  For Ess and Levine, utilizing AI is more than producing images. ""On a fundamental level, this is about the reinvention of the creative process,"" Levine said.  A serial entrepreneur, Levine has big plans for AI. He is in the process of merging 330AI with Blockade Games, a Web3 game company. Levine aims to bring the time- and effort-saving advantages of AI into the world of game creation, reducing many complicated and time-consuming executions so that people can instead focus on ideas.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/adam-levine-will-ess-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a71d25a3f606bfa5e37b961c6a447394b5f7c79-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In fact, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could tank another ~70% to $5K in 2023, Eric Robertsen, the bank's global head of research, wrote in a recent note. The token changed hands at $17.22K as of 9:27 a.m. ET. The note outlined a series of possible scenarios for next year that could see interest rates plunging as the global economy increasingly comes under pressure, as well as more cryptocurrency-related bankruptcies resulting in further loss in investor confidence. Robertsen pointed out that the possible drop in demand for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), commonly referred to as ""digital gold,"" could thus result in a 30% surge in the spot price of gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), which traded at $1,792 per ounce at the time of writing. The wider crypto ecosystem has been stung by another major blow in what was already a challenging year: the recent fallout from crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ). The ripple effects of that abrupt collapse have been going strong as crypto lender BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week.

Led by analyst Manan Gosalia, the team from the Wall Street bank downgraded its rating on Silvergate's shares to underweight from equal weight, but kept its price target at $24. The stock was lower by 3% to $25.69 in premarket trading, adding to a decline of more than 50% since the beginning of November.  Silvergate is faced with significant uncertainty about deposit flows in the near term, the analysts said, estimating that Silvergate's digital deposits are down 60% so far in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. As clients withdraw their deposits, the bank faces pressure on its net interest margins and net interest income because it needs to fund outflows with securities sales and more costly wholesale borrowing.  The demise of FTX could also drive litigation and headline risk across the crypto ecosystem, the note added.  Morgan Stanley’s 2023 earnings-per-share estimate for Silvergate is $1.58, far below the average estimate of $4.19.

The country’s 2018 Virtual Financial Assets (VFAs) Act requires service providers to be authorized and to publish white papers of investor information before they issue a digital token. That goes further than the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is set to apply in Malta and across the bloc in 2024.  “The authority considers that it would be prudent that certain VFAs, which display clear characteristics of uniqueness and non-fungibility, also be excluded from the VFA framework,” the regulator said in a ""consultation"" paper. During a period of consultation, interested parties can provide feedback to proposed rule changes. The consultation period will end on Jan. 6.  NFTs, a digital record of ownership of an asset like artwork or real estate, had limited use for investment or payment purposes, the Maltese regulator said. Under the final draft of MiCA, NFT service providers won’t have to register as long as their assets are assessed as being genuinely non-fungible.

42413495,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9XQY,1670248800,Waves Blockchain Founder Explores New DAO Model to Improve Crypto Governance,"Sasha Ivanov, the founder of the Waves blockchain, says he has a way of tackling some of the governance shortcomings apparent in managing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), including the risk of manipulation and voter apathy.  DAOs form the backbone for numerous decentralized applications (dapps), such as Uniswap, Compound and Aave, in which token holders propose and vote on changes or updates that affect a project’s future.  Existing DAOs based on simple token governance models and weight-based voting systems grant voting power proportional to the number of governance tokens a holder has. That leaves the DAOs open to exploitation by well-capitalized manipulators who can also take advantage of non-accountable and apathetic voters.  “Simple token governance seems attractive on paper, but has proven ultimately to be inadequate,” Ivanov said in a statement on Monday. “Without sufficient accountability built into governance models, bad actors and those who wish to disrupt the decision-making process have no deterrent and will keep on gamifying the system.”  Instead, Ivanov developed ""Power Protocol,"" a set of rules and incentives to encourage community participation. The protocol is designed to set and then measure key performance indicators (KPIs) and offer financial rewards and penalties to facilitate accountable, transparent and efficient community collaboration. The first DAO to use the Power Protocol was Waves’ Power DAO.  These KPIs, if fulfilled, result in rewards for participating communities. Conversely, if they aren't met, a community can be penalized as a portion of its staked governance tokens is destroyed. This may help disincentivize predatory behavior from large token holders who may vote favorably on proposals solely to gain token rewards.  Power Protocol can be implemented in third-party DAOs. By limiting individual users’ total voting power, the model can successfully mitigate the risk of potential damage from bad actors and increase efficiency of any DAO, be it financial, charitable, private or governmental.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | UNI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/05/waves-blockchain-founder-explores-new-dao-model-to-improve-crypto-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c955034c62beabe1532e8d5616f071331cf7d68-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Institutions with large holdings in traditional markets - where stresses can therefore have wider ramifications - have tended to steer clear of cryptocurrencies. Crypto failures can dent investor sentiment and cause bouts of volatility, but we see diminishing routes for serious systemic contagion to more fully regulated financial markets. By Scott Woodcock, Senior Research Analyst The FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapse is a blow to the idea of finance industry disruption and a potential source of volatility, but we think systemic contagion into broader financial markets is unlikely. Today’s CIO Weekly Perspectives comes from guest contributor Scott Woodcock. In June 2007, Bear Stearns was forced to bail out several of its hedge funds. They had been buying what were then relatively obscure, highly leveraged credit securities that were exposed to subprime mortgages; 16 months later, the Global Financial Crisis was engulfing the entire world. More recently, reporting on the collapse of the FTX Cryptocurrency Exchange and its related entities suggests that as much as $10 billion of customer funds were inappropriately removed from the exchange. At least $1 billion is apparently still unaccounted for. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which was already down 60% from its peak, has fallen another 30% since FTX went under. Reckless risk-taking and misappropriating customer funds are very different things. Nonetheless, the widespread crypto distress in the wake of FTX’s sudden collapse has some asking, could this meltdown be the sector’s “subprime moment,” potentially leading to a cascade of selling in the broader financial markets? Liquidity Crunch The failure of FTX, which filed for bankruptcy protection on November 11, has raised serious questions about the transparency, regulation and ethics of the $1 trillion cryptocurrency market. Nominally, FTX operated as an exchange on which customers could trade and hold cryptocurrencies. But when press reports questioned its solvency, customers started withdrawing funds from the exchange in high volumes, and an inadequate pool of liquid assets left the company unable to meet the redemptions. Exchanges typically segregate unmargined customers assets, so they should not experience this sort of liquidity crunch. However, it appears that FTX inappropriately used customer assets as collateral to finance the operations of Alameda Research, the firm’s proprietary trading and investment business. When customers tried to sell those assets, the result was effectively a run on a shadow bank. The incident has raised fears about other large cryptocurrency exchanges, many of which operate offshore, like FTX, in jurisdictions that do not have stringent requirements around segregation and safeguarding of customer funds. Failures One reason we do not believe FTX will prove to be the Bear Stearns of a crypto-induced market crash is that it is far from the industry’s first big failure. The industry’s Bear Stearns moment arguably happened back in May, when the TerraUSD ( UST-USD ) algorithmic “stablecoin,” which was supposed to exhibit a 1:1 relationship with the U.S. dollar but was not fully backed by liquid assets, effectively “broke the buck.” The Terra/Luna ( LUNC-USD ) ecosystem had a market capitalization close to $50 billion at the time, and the event led to the unwinding of a significant amount of leverage in the crypto universe and the failure of some of the weakest players in the industry. The silver lining is that this clear-out limited the damage wrought by later, large failures such as that of FTX. The Terra/Luna collapse also lent impetus to this year’s general crypto sell-off. According to CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of all recorded cryptocurrencies has fallen from almost $3 trillion in November last year to around $800 billion today. That means there are five listed companies with market capitalizations bigger than the entire cryptocurrency universe. The largest, Apple ( AAPL ), has a market cap three times larger than the crypto market. Even at $3 trillion, the crypto market was small compared with the $110 trillion-plus market capitalization of global listed equities. Systemic Furthermore, institutions with large holdings in traditional markets - where stresses can therefore have wider ramifications - have tended to steer clear of cryptocurrencies. While some institutional investors had become interested in offering crypto products to their customers, the combination of regulatory concerns and volatility caused them to proceed slowly. According to the Fidelity Digital Assets Survey 2022 , while almost half of high-net worth investors have adopted some exposure within the last two years, fewer than 7% of pension plans, endowments and foundations have done so. Even in the hedge fund world, outside of crypto specialists, only 10% of managers had made investments. A May 2022 paper from the Bank for International Settlements similarly found very low banking sector exposure to crypto. Evaluating risks posed by digital assets, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Stability Oversight Council warned in its October 3 report that interconnections between crypto assets and the traditional financial system had been increasing, and that further connections would raise the risk of contagion, but it also observed that, so far, these connections are “relatively limited.” It’s worth noting that the most recent systemic crisis in financial markets originated with supposedly staid and boring U.K. government bonds, not cryptocurrencies - because a relatively small number of U.K. pension funds hold such a large concentration of those government bonds. Contagion In summary, the crypto universe remains relatively small in comparison to other risk assets like equities, with limited overlap for contagion into traditional markets. The financial and regulatory fallout from the FTX failure is likely to keep it that way for longer, in our view. For example, FTX had planned an aggressive entrance into the cryptocurrency derivatives market and appeared to be eyeing a longer-term move into traditional asset classes such as equities, thereby mounting a disruptive challenge to incumbent exchange operators such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) and Intercontinental Exchange ((ICE)). Unsurprisingly, its regulatory application has now been withdrawn. While decentralized finance enthusiasts are likely to continue their search for disruptors, the heady days of startups taking on the likes of CME Group or Visa - and thinking they can do so without inviting burdensome regulatory scrutiny - are probably over. In this context, crypto failures can certainly dent investor sentiment and cause bouts of volatility, but we see diminishing routes for serious systemic contagion to more fully regulated financial markets.

42417056,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLSf,1670247824,Most Influential Artist: Dave Krugman,"Photographer Dave Krugman’s first minted non-fungible token (NFT) has a rich analog history. It’s a high-resolution film scan that the artist shot on his grandfather’s old Hasselblad 503CX, a variation of the camera used to shoot the Apollo moon landings.  “There is a long legacy of photography in my family – my father and grandfather both were photographers as hobbyists,” Krugman says. “Since I consider the art we mint to blockchain the legacy of our creative careers, it felt right to lead with [that] work.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Krugman still describes his early photography NFTs as the “keystone” of his blockchain art ecosystem, which is filled with close-ups of raindrops on pavement, haunting cityscapes, and arresting car portraits. He just got to spend time with the subject of his “Most Influential” portrait, Art Blocks founder and CEO Erick Calderon, at NFT art events in both Texas and Mexico, seizing the opportunity to photograph someone he considers a great artistic influence.  “His leadership in generative art has had a profound impact on me,” Krugman says of Calderon. “I view photography as a study of the generative nature of the universe. The laws of physics are the source code, the photographers freeze instances of it unfolding.”  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  I first learned about NFTs when my friend J. N. Silva brought them up to me in spring 2020. At first, it went over my head. But as people were forced into increasingly digital spaces due to Covid lockdowns, it dawned on me that much of our social signaling is happening in digital spaces. This technology could catch on as a way to enable digital objecthood. If so, markets would form, especially around art, since so much of our consumption of art is happening in online communities.  What were some of the artistic decisions you made when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Erick Calderon?  When I make a portrait of someone, I'm capturing the person in a specific context and the relationship I've formed with them. To photograph Erick at Bright Moments in CDMX when his work was just minted and after spending the prior week with him in Marfa for his Art Blocks open house – everything just aligned perfectly to immortalize this moment in time.  I don't typically plan deeply when making portraits like these – I simply seek to capture someone's true energy in an environment where they feel at home. I think, together, we achieved that here.  What about Calderon's work in the crypto/blockchain industry most inspires you?  Erick Calderon, or Snow Fro, is my biggest inspiration on the artist side of this space. This was someone who saw the future way before others did, acted on his convictions, and changed the world. But more importantly, his humility, support of others, genuine excitement, and boundless enthusiasm is most inspiring to me. Through Erick, I've been introduced to an astounding community of artists, and it’s changed my perspective forever.  Where do you see yourself in the NFT art world moving forward?  NFTs are just a technology. It’s the tool that lets us have digital objects. What we do with those objects is literally limitless. The best use cases of the technology haven't even been dreamed of yet. We are at the beginning of a vast world being born in the digital substrate that our social spaces exist in.  My main goal with this tech is to find ways that artists can sustain their creative careers, gain leverage, and make less compromises with their time and craft. It's the artists that make the world a beautiful place to be, physically and digitally. This space is building a bridge between these two worlds in fascinating ways.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/dave-krugman-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2ae28ab2069940b05242324b76fa02d01c4e899-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Each December since 2014, CoinDesk has taken stock of the year to date to find the themes, stories and people that made the biggest impact on crypto, blockchain and Web3. This gives us a chance to recognize the good as well as the bad.  Though it may seem like the cryptoverse suffered an entire year of calamity and failures, it has been only a tumultuous six months. Most of the first half of 2022 was pretty stable – for crypto – still buoyed by a strong 2021, growing mainstream interest and optimism.  As the collapse of the FTX empire is still fresh and unraveling, the failures and likely crimes exposed this year are what we will likely remember most. The crypto industry has lost $2 trillion in value – including countless people’s savings – since the price of bitcoin peaked just over one year ago.  Nonetheless, long-term positive trends continued: the tide of mainstream interests is still moving into the cryptosphere; regulatory efforts have gained momentum and urgency; and creators are still seeking and finding their way on-chain and virtually, experimenting with non-fungible tokens, the metaverse and Web3.  For the past several weeks, the CoinDesk staff has been taking in the fullness of the year’s events and debating the emerging themes and impacts. In October, we asked for the public’s input on our preliminary thoughts and sought nominations. These ideas and names informed our final selection.  To be clear, the Most Influential 2022 is a list, not a ranking. While we acknowledge some of our influencers had an outsize impact this year – and give them more prominence on the list – at some point ranking achievements is unrealistic. And inevitably, not everyone will agree with our choices. Many of our influencers – as befits the crypto bear market we’re in – are bad actors (but influential nonetheless). We make no claim that this is a list of the most admirable or admired.  If you have other ideas, please have your say on Twitter and tag @CoinDesk.  Whatever you feel about our Most Influential 2022 choices, please do admire the outstanding portraits we commissioned of them. For the fourth consecutive year, CoinDesk worked with artists to make portraits and interpret the impact of our 50 influencers. Taking this one step further, this year we collaborated with Coinbase NFT to mint and auction 14 of the Most Influential 2022 portraits as NFTs, which allowed us to add a utility layer to include valuable perks to winning bidders including tickets to Consensus 2023. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to One Earth, a nonprofit combating climate change.  And now....  More: NFTs of the works depicted above sold at auction on Coinbase NFT.

42417063,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLWn,1670247760,Most Influential Artist: Bryan Brinkman,"Animator Bryan Brinkman Zooms in from Dubai, where he’s part of a delegation of non-fungible token artists, collectors, and platform executives. “There's people from SuperRare, Nifty Gateway and we're all spreading the word of NFTs here,” Brinkman, 37, says. “They're treating us like diplomats.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Normally based in New York, Brinkman finds time to talk about his NFT work between dinner with a sheikh and a visit to the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Wearing a Mickey Mouse-covered shirt by the comic artist Jeffrey Brown, he describes artistic influences like Don Hertzfeldt and Bill Plympton. They taught Brinkman that “It didn't matter if you drew like Disney, you could still tell compelling stories that made people feel” – a practice he’s brought into the NFT space.  More: An NFT of this work was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  I first discovered NFTs in December 2019, because an artist that I'm a fan of, Killer Acid, was selling his work on SuperRare. I had been spending years turning my digital art into physical pieces for galleries, then I discovered that you could just sell digital work as is. I applied to SuperRare the next month, got on, and fell down a deep rabbit hole.  What the first piece of NFT art you created?  The first piece I minted on SuperRare was called “Explode.” It’s a short, looping animation of colorful clouds exploding. I created it to show what I wanted to bring to the space, which was traditional animation and colorful imagery. I also wanted this entering-with-a-bang aspect … this explosion of motion and colors.  Why did you decide to make that piece an NFT?  When I first joined the space, I got really into thinking about how you could get the most out of the limited file size allowed. For that piece, I thought, how can I create something that someone can look at for a minute and still feel like they're experiencing it?  That piece also stripped away all my previous work and started fresh. You see the colors and clouds play a role in almost all my NFT pieces that come after. I wanted to reduce everything to a beginning and build from there.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Razzlekhan and Lichtenstein?  Almost every video I could find of Razzlekhan was like a car accident. Her content was so cringy. But underlying it was her being a part of a massive scheme. The fact that she was creating all this content while knowingly having stolen all this money, and putting herself out there in such a public way, I found extremely fascinating.  I tried to embody that in-your-face energy and show the opulence that she expresses, whether it's her extremely expensive cat or her quest for attention on social media. I'm trying to include that imagery even though it’s a facade to a degree. But who knows? We haven't really heard from her since it all happened. There's still a very big mystery to her in my mind.  How about Lichtenstein?  He's even more of a mystery. He seems so subdued and quiet. In my piece, I have him in the background. Whether he was the mastermind behind the project or not, once the story broke, he became an afterthought, a background supporter. He was a subject in her videos, but he was never the main character.  What lessons have you personally taken from their story?  What draws me into their story is the mystery. How could these people, who on the outside seem aloof and goofy, be behind one of the biggest heists? There's a disconnect that still puzzles me. Why would you steal all this money, then draw so much attention to yourself?  Since Razzlekhan and Lichtenstein, we've seen the space have so many other bad actors that lost billions of dollars. Razzlekhan almost seems like a distant memory – the beginning of this year’s decent into fraud and deception.  Where do you see yourself going in the NFT art world moving forward?  My goal when I joined the space was to experiment with all the media it provides. Since then, I've done everything from animation to generative and programmable art. I look at what the next wave of technology will be, and I'm excited to keep pushing in these new directions.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/bryan-brinkman-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4990583bd05e628c01712762901572eefc1786b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417062,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLYr,1670247704,Most Influential Artist: Trevor and Violet Jones,"Trevor and Violet Jones have been together for eight years. They work out of the same studio in Edinburgh, Scotland, and learned about crypto art at the same time – early.  “I had my Crypto Disruption exhibition in 2018,” Trevor says, a collection of oil paintings with subjects like John McAfee that featured augmented reality. Some people bought the works online directly from Trevor, which surprised him. He was used to buyers entrusting commercial galleries with their transactions, not individual painters.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Still, he didn’t hear about non-fungible tokens until Manchester’s CoinFest conference in April 2019. “Everything he learns, I learn,” says Violet. Trevor dropped his first NFT in 2019, and she followed shortly after in January 2020.  More: An NFT of this work was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  This “Most Influential” piece is their first collaboration, and it went … OK? The couple tells CoinDesk how they managed to compromise and tackle such a serious subject as Alexey Pertsev, the developer arrested for his role in creating the sanctioned crypto “mixer,” Tornado Cash. “We’re not making a statement,” Violet says of their piece. “We’re just putting it out there for interpretation.”  What was your first piece of NFT art, and why did you make it an NFT?  Violet: I'm an oil painter now, but my background is in film. I thought in a digital space, maybe I should start with a film. Everybody was trying to find their feet back then. There wasn't an obvious recipe for how to make NFTs. When I decided to start with film, it was a huge challenge, because back then there was no sound. It was only GIF format, which was about 10 megabytes. I got inspired by Hemingway’s story in a sentence. I thought, I bet I can make a sentence of a film with a gif.  Trevor: Hers was probably the very first NFT film.  V: The challenge was how to tell a story in a loop that is going to have the beginning, middle and end. It’s called “Master Chef,” a horror-type film, and I sold it.  T: Mine was “ETH Girl” with Alotta Money. I’d been working on a series of Picasso-inspired paintings infused with crypto themes and iconography. I still wasn’t thinking about NFTs, but by the end of 2018, I started talking to Alotta, and he asked if I wanted to collaborate. He animated the painting, which we dropped in December. That was a record-making NFT sale at the time, for 70 ETH, or about $10,000. That really opened the eyes of artists in the space who realized there is an opportunity to make a living from selling NFTs.  How did you two decide to collaborate on this “Most Influential” piece?  V: To my surprise – because Trevor’s done collaborations with everybody apart from me – Trevor suggested it. He's been enjoying my recent series of paintings.  T: I thought it was a good opportunity because we’ve never collaborated on a painting.  V: We criticize each other's paintings constantly.  T: I know there's a lot of collectors out there who will be intrigued by this, because we have different collectors and some who buy both our works. I just thought it would be a good idea, and now I’m regretting every minute of it. [They laugh.]  V: There were some disagreements.  What disagreements?  V: I’m a portrait painter.  T: But CoinDesk said they didn’t just want a portrait painting. I started thinking about how we could make an abstract painting with symbolic references to tell Alexey’s story.  V: I was like, I want a face, I need a face.  T: We fought a lot about that.  V: Then we compromised. Now there’s half a face.  T: I didn't have a choice. I either had to agree or get divorced.  How did you decide on the composition?  V: We read Alexey’s story and wrote down all the important elements.  T: Then we used an artificial intelligence program called DALL-E to help with the composition. The text prompts that we punched into DALL-E were “young man with glasses, portrait, 3-D rendered, abstract, chaos, prison, tornado, handcuffs, North Korean flag, Russian flag, Web3, red, white, and blue” (because the Netherlands is where he was arrested). DALL-E generated more than 110 images.  Is there anything about Alexey’s work or experience in the crypto/blockchain industry that you can relate to?  V: The moment open-source coding becomes a threat to any countries or establishments means there is some control taken away and given to the people. I'm not sure if it translates, but bypassing the traditional institutions and doing NFTs would be for us something like that – taking control over our work and skipping the middlemen. That’s a stretch, because nobody's going to arrest us for our art.  T: Another very far-reaching link is when I introduced technology into my paintings, like QR codes and augmented reality in 2013. The more I became fascinated with technology, the more the legacy art world rejected me. When you're innovating, there’s always the potential of pissing somebody off.  Where do you see yourself going in the NFT art world moving forward?  T: We're not going anywhere.  V: Definitely. We see ourselves staying in the space, building, contributing. We’d both like to have a show with Christie's, but there might be something bigger, better, because this space changes so fast. All we can say for sure is we're staying, and we'll keep creating.  T: An artist who is worried about the ups and downs of the market and uses that as an excuse to affect their work or leave this space, they’re not really in this space. When I got in at the end of 2017, it was the last crypto crash bloodbath. I didn't even realize what a bloodbath it was – I just kept working through it, hoping to sell something, and I was very happy with how things turned out. Now we're back in a shitty market, but there's still so much happening and so many great artists to work with. There’s no reason to be anywhere else but here.  Do you think you'll collaborate again on a painting?  V: Oh definitely!

Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  He’s working on a billboard for the show as he catches up with CoinDesk about his portrait of Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, who recently almost bailed out the fallen crypto exchange FTX. The situation’s given Headlam a dynamic subject to work with, someone who’s involved in a bad news story but isn’t the bad guy. He’s looking to longtime influences like pop artist Andy Warhol and filmmaker Tim Burton to help craft his piece, resulting in an artistic style that straddles the real and the imaginary.  More: An NFT of the animated work the above still was taken from was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  At the tail end of 2020 I heard whispers, but no one was really expecting it to do anything. But 2021 came around, and we saw more success stories within the artist community. One was Fewocious, who I’d been following for a while. He's always been good at marketing, but then something really shifted. It got everybody's attention – mine, too.  At the time, I was creating a lot of digital work out of my Baltimore apartment, where rent was $600. I needed a new way to monetize my work, since my drawings were just Instagram and Twitter posts. I did as much research as I could over a few months, then somebody gave me $200 to start minting on OpenSea.  Who gave you $200 to start minting on OpenSea?  I'm a little embarrassed to say it, but it's this YouTuber, very controversial, named Sam Hyde. He’d won this auction I did on my Instagram, where I took the last $23 in my wallet, framed it, and wrote on the frame, “This is the last $23 in my wallet.” I auctioned it off and it sold for $86. [Sam] thought it was a good idea and said, “Get into this NFT thing. I'm going to give you $200.”  What was the first-ever piece of NFT art you minted?  I was uploading stuff that I already made, including a black and white drawing that just says the word “Cope,” which I use a lot in my art. It’s like a brand.  Why did you decide to make that piece into an NFT?  I had some foresight that I would be expanding on “Cope” with this burgeoning technology. If I want to start off with something, that’s probably my best foot forward – it's something I believe in, kind of my lifestyle.  What were some of your main considerations when making CZ’s “Most Influential” portrait?  I wanted to emphasize duality, something that echoes, “I'm a nice guy. But if you interfere, it won't be so nice.” It’s simple, but also has humor injected into it, like, “I'm very good at what I do, and I'm laughing at you.”  I wanted to poke fun at the situation [of CZ almost bailing out FTX], because on one hand, I acknowledge it was borderline altruistic, but was it really? Or was he acting out of personal gain? That’s most businessmen in this situation, so I tried not to make him so much of a hero but acknowledge that what he had done was disruptive – the talks of buying FTX, and then that not happening, and then the social response and dynamic.  What did you do in your piece to reflect that?  I'm an Andy Warhol fan. His portraiture work is very flat, but the subject’s personality is on display. Using multiples, variation of facial features, and distortion is my visual language. My color palette is very contrasting, and oftentimes very explosive, like Warhol’s. Doing that with this piece, my intention is to make it stand out, but also make it almost cartoonish – the borderline between real life and this fantasy cartoon world.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | BNB,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/alex-headlam-aleqth-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc71e965e8118100ff9dfbd0f365f26887d742d5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Based in Brazil, the 25-year-old studied software engineering in college and worked as a programmer before getting into art.

From programming to art, “I made that jump, too.”  More: An NFT of this work was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  I first learned about NFTs around June, July 2020. When I first heard about artists selling work for crypto, I thought, “That's definitely a scam.” I'm in Brazil, where scams are extremely common, so I stayed away from it. Then in September 2020, I saw a bunch of my artists friends jumping on board, including professional artists working with big brands, so I properly started studying NFTs. Since I have a programmer background, as soon as I understood blockchain and the smart contract infrastructure on Ethereum, I thought, “I'm convinced.”  What was your first-ever piece of NFT art, and what made it feel right for the NFT medium?  It’s called “The Dealer.” I minted it on KnownOrigin in November 2020. As soon as I understood that you're creating a record that's going to stay on the blockchain forever, I thought my first NFT should be something that captures my feelings at the time. “The Dealer” plays with the concept of my first interaction with crypto, that it was obscure and almost forbidden.  Your “Most Influential” portrait is of Yat Siu – what about his career/life most inspired your piece?  It’s not actually a portrait. It's more an artwork that represents him. I dove deep into his background and tried to interpret his career more subtly. He works in the gaming industry and co-founded Animoca Brands, which does mobile gaming. But one thing that caught my attention was that his entire family, as far as I researched, studied music. [Siu] went to a proper music university. I created [an image] called “The Maestro,” which ties his music background to his position as a leader in the gaming and blockchain industry.  What about your artistic style do you feel is a fit for capturing Siu?  Probably the colors, because he does a lot of work with gaming and is really involved in The Sandbox metaverse. A lot of metaverse art uses red, blue, and purple, which are my main colors. I naturally gravitate towards them because I'm colorblind. I work well with red and blue because they're really contrast-y. I don't see the purple very well – it was a consequence of mixing red and blue in a 3-D medium. Most of the time, I see the purple as blue. Sometimes it's pink.  Who/what are your main artistic influences?  My two main influences are a musician and a visual artist. The musician is Porter Robinson. I started getting more interested in music and art because of his music back around 2014. Because of Porter, I ended up getting to know the work of Beeple. Before NFTs, Beeple was already a notorious digital artist. He pushed me to get into 3-D digital art.  I managed to have a full circle moment when I met him later here in Brazil. As soon as I met him in person, he pushed me to get into “everydays,” making one artwork every single day. He was the most encouraging person ever.  Where do you see yourself going in the NFT art world moving forward?  It's common for people to ask me what I want to do with NFTs, and to me, the answer is not what I want to do with NFTs – it’s what I want to do as an artist. Right now, I'm trying to tie my background as a software engineer to my current work as an artist to make generative art – art that’s made with code.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/fesp-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d83a143517f6f80e1de24b1eedc54adf29115c14-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417067,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLcz,1670247514,Most Influential Artist: Yosnier,"When CoinDesk caught up with Yosnier, a 23-year-old artist based in Tampa, Florida, in November about his image of the embattled FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, he hadn’t started it yet. To be fair, he’d been assigned a massively influential subject, and not influential in a good way – the man had just lost billions of dollars’ worth of crypto, the extent of his wrongdoings still under intensive investigation.  “It’s anxiety inducing,” Yosnier says. “I'm still conceptualizing.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  His focus, though, fits with the themes of SBF’s story. “Most of my work has to do with growth, personal experiences and vulnerability,” Yosnier says. He doesn’t want to come across as sympathizing with a guy who lost numerous people’s life savings, and he knows people who’ve lost everything via FTX. Their fall is just as important for Yosnier to communicate in the piece as SBF’s.  Unlike most of the artists who’ve made work for this year’s “Most Influential” list, Yosnier wasn’t “in the art community” before getting into non-fungible tokens. “My beginning as an artist and my NFT beginning coincide,” he says. His Tarot reminiscent designs elicit ideas of an uncertain future – like the one his subject is headed towards.  More: An NFT of this work was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  I first learned about NFTs around August/September 2020. It was around the time I started putting my work on Twitter. I learned about it from one of my mutuals, who posted about minting on Rarible, so I asked him about it. He sent me an info link on NFTs – I’d already known about crypto and Ethereum.  What was the first piece of yours that you made into an NFT?  It was my piece called “Solána.” I don't want to call it fan art, but I guess it was fan art of the singer SZA from the “Good Days” music video. It was my most popular piece for a while, so I thought to submit it as my genesis piece on SuperRare.  What are your main considerations when thinking about how to create a portrait of a person who's so influential, especially right now, and not in a positive way?  I'm [collecting] accounts from friends and people I know who were personally affected by [FTX’s collapse], which is obviously a bunch of people. I’m not necessarily trying to understand [SBF], but rather understand the space and where we're all currently at with what's been going on. I want to depict that as best as I can.  What artistic decisions do you think you'll make to portray that?  I want to do something based around a fall from grace, like the story of Icarus [who in Greek mythology fell to Earth and died after flying too close to the sun]. I wanted to do something that attests to that and includes some elements that depict the unity we all have, not necessarily against [SBF], but in the crypto space at this time.  Can you give me a preview of how you think you're going to do that?  I had an idea of depicting him falling, like actually falling, from “grace.” I'm still trying to figure out how to best portray that because I don't want to make him seem like a martyr. That would be crazy. I’m still waiting to see what feels right and how the FTX story develops.  Obviously, this is about more than [SBF]. To make a portrait that's just him would be kind of tone deaf because his actions have affected so many.  Where do you see yourself in the NFT art world moving forward?  I don’t have a specific goal with the NFT space in that it's ever-changing and moving at such a rapid pace. It's hard to gauge where I want to be. I definitely want to be an artist that inspires others and delves deeper within themselves. I want to keep stressing vulnerability through my art because I still feel like we need that, now more than ever.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/yosnier-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e765a2b5751b6cf2e660febf0b80bc236346619-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

His art, now regularly comprised of “different elements from [his] practice” – ranging from traditional painting to artificial intelligence – felt appropriate for capturing Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s minister of finance and corporate affairs for this year’s Most Influential list.  “In many respects, the style and materials used fit the portrait perfectly, as they convey [a combination of] technologies and brick-and-mortar traditional values,” Harman says, both of which are deeply imbued in Sitharaman’s work.  More: An NFT of this work was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  By early 2019, I had started getting interested in blockchain technologies. It felt like a new, decentralized art world was on the horizon. The notion that your digital art could be tokenized and authenticated on the blockchain and collected without the [traditional] gatekeepers sparked my interest considerably.  What was your first piece of NFT art?  My first NFT was a digitally painted portrait titled “Double Presenter” from an ongoing series called Android Plaza. They are a collection of glitched portraits where the digital information is broken up, leaving the viewer to interpret the space between abstraction and figuration.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Nirmala Sitharaman?  There was much to consider, mainly how to steer away from a more conventional figurative portrait and include elements of digital painting, AI, and footage. The composition is cut into two sections.  For the first, a more traditional painting, I envisaged a mural – like a wall on the backstreets of Delhi. With AI, I rendered a wall with motifs like the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, where Nirmala studied, alongside the lotus, the national flower of India, and a graffitied map of the country. These elements complement two, large painted portraits that capture the energy and strength of Nirmala, while an Indian woman with the national flag looks towards the wall mural.  In the second section, I wanted to capture the energy of India as one of the tech and economic capitals of the world. This is represented through abstract moving visuals that reflect elements of the financial and tech industry.  What about Sitharaman’s work in the crypto/blockchain industry most inspires or interests you?  Nirmala recently stated that India was developing standard operating procedures for cryptocurrency during its G-20 presidency next year, adding that all countries want the technology to survive but not be misutilized. As a blockchain/crypto artist, I believe in this incredible technology. I’m also aware of how the arena has become a canvas for speculative projects, and the fiasco with FTX shows how precarious it can be if you have bad actors. Hopefully, moving forward, the worldwide crypto community will ensure that disgraceful scenarios like this don’t tarnish the hard work going into all the legitimate projects.  Where do you see yourself in the NFT art world moving forward?  I envisage continuing to explore the array of technologies at my disposal, focusing on the collaboration with AI and building on some of the successful projects I’ve created. The expectation is substantial because artists are going to have to compete with not only well-funded VCs promoting gimmicky PFP projects, but also larger corporate behemoths and brands that are entering the market.

42417061,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpLXp,1670247411,Most Influential Artist: Oveck,"More than a decade ago, multimedia artist Oveck “fell in love with photography” while retouching images for a photo studio in New York City, where he lives. In 2020, after an infection damaged an eye, he took up oil painting. “Still today my right-side vision is obstructed, which makes lines distorted and a bit blurry,” he says.  Nevertheless, he parlayed his varied body of work, combining photographic images and digital painting, into non-fungible token success, with his first blockchain-based art piece combining his old and new media to signify a “new beginning” for the 44-year-old artist.  As of late November, Oveck was making his way from Buenos Aires to Antarctica on an expedition he’ll document photographically for a Copenhagen-based travel company.

A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  How and when did you first learn about NFTs?  The first time I heard about them was back in late 2020, but I wasn’t paying much attention. All I knew was that technology and art were involved, and as an artist for many years, those two things didn’t sound like they matched.  Then a couple of friends started getting big into the NFT space, like Dave Krugman. They spoke to me about it, and before we even dropped anything we started collecting pieces from different artists. One of the first pieces I collected was by Josh Pierce. I loved it so much, I wanted to do this, as well – not only collecting but also dropping.  What was the first piece of NFT art you made?  I wanted to get into the NFT space with a different approach than what I've done before by interlacing photography with digital art. I took one of my photos and I started painting over it on my iPad. I minted that on Foundation in early 2021, when Foundation was invitation-only. I think the piece sold within the month for two ETH, which was then somewhere around $2,500.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of Yuga Labs?  I just learned about the project last week, so I haven't had the chance to finish it. But I've been involved in the NFT space for two years, and I've seen how Yuga Labs got a huge following. When I learned that the CEO was a woman, that made me feel a lot better, since there aren’t a lot in the NFT space. A woman being behind one of the most successful Web3 businesses gave me inspiration to create.  What might you do in the piece to highlight the fact that Yuga’s CEO Nicole Muniz is a woman?  I’m going to highlight strength and women’s empowerment in general. It’s hard to go into details right now. I'm an instantaneous artist. I like to go with the flow of what I'm creating, so I'll see where it goes.  It’s not just Muniz that you're depicting, but all of Yuga Labs. What about their work in the blockchain space do you personally find the most interesting or inspiring?  They were able to create a cult-like following. They [remind me] of Radiohead, one of those bands whose music makes people want to follow them. There’s a natural feeling that you follow. I feel the same energy around Yuga Labs.  Who/what are your main artistic influences?  Many different artists and photographers have influenced me. Amanda Demme is a portrait photographer who’s been around 20 years. Garry Winogrand, a street photographer, and Ansel Adams, as far as landscapes, are inspiring.

Already involved in Web3, “mainly buying and selling NFTs,” he doodled a skull wearing a hoodie that said “GM” on it, the NFT community greeting that means “good morning.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  “I randomly decided to make it into an NFT and mint it in October last year on Foundation,” OSF says. Though he had no formal art training, the 33-year-old did have a history in digital art communities like DeviantArt, where amateur artists can post work and connect with each other. He never thought it would lead to a career, but “I like to do things that people don't expect me to do,” he says, which includes selling two of his NFTs to Snoop Dogg.  More: An NFT of this work was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  People may not view him as a “real artist” because he was a finance guy for 10 years, but for OSF that’s the fun part. “I always like to challenge myself.” His “Most Influential” subjects – Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon, Celsius Network founder and CEO Alex Mashinsky, Three Arrows Capital co-founder and CEO Su Zhu and Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich – may not be the biggest challenge, however, because he comes from their world – finance. These four scammers, who lost investors millions in crypto and therefore earned their collective title as the “Four Horsemen of the Cryptocalypse,” took advantage by appearing, in OSF’s words, “too big to fail,” an almost ironic comparison for its roots in the traditional financial system.  What about your skull doodle made it feel suited to the NFT format?  I'd spent seven or eight months with NFTs and was already feeling quite disillusioned with my day job. It was boring, and I was so fascinated with NFTs. That piece for me was the turning point where I remember thinking, “Am I really going to quit my job and do this stuff full time?”  That doodle coincided with the day that I decided to make that switch, at least mentally. I didn't end up leaving my job until two months later, but that was when I decided to take a leap of faith.  What were some of your main considerations when creating your “Most Influential” portrait of the “Four Horsemen of the Cryptocalypse”?  I wanted to depict their carelessness and neglect. You have some very smart people here who've built huge businesses or made a lot of money, but what ended up taking over is greed or lack of risk management. I understand it – I've seen that happen before as a trader. In this piece, I asked, how do I portray the chain reactions of these guys singlehandedly bringing down this whole ecosystem through their neglect?  What were some of the key artistic decisions you made to convey that?  I wanted to implement red quite a lot. The piece is animated and starts off with blues and greens to signify things are normal. As the frames lapse, the piece starts to turn red, with candlestick charts going down. A lot of my pieces are based on the bad things that happen in crypto, where people lose money or get “rekt.” I've used a similar creative approach here.  I also set the frame-rate of the piece at a much faster pace than I usually do. In pieces where the framerate is slightly slower, it feels chilled out. This piece has a feeling of intensity and things happening very quickly in a short time span. It's kind of uncomfortable to look at.  Are there any lessons you learned from the “four horsemen’s” stories?  Three Arrows Capital, which was run by Su Zhu, or even Terraform Labs by Do Kwon, were huge entities within crypto – almost “too big to fail.” These are the smartest guys in the room, who built up these empires from nothing. There was this idea that they must be right. There's no way they’ll trip up.  The main lesson from this - and what happened with FTX after – is that it doesn't really matter how successful anyone is in the space or how smart anyone is or seems. Anyone can be reduced to zero in a few days or even a few hours.

The play-to-earn game’s token, AXS, has surged 20% over the past 24 hours. AXS’ jump comes along with an increase in sales volume over the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Axie also announced Monday that it has selected a team of 700 community members to help build out the future of Axie Infinity. The Sandbox’s SAND token has also posted a large gain, up 7% on the day.  Genesis creditor groups’ loans total $1.8 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. In addition to the previously reported group of Gemini customers owed $900 million through its Gemini’s Earn program, which is tied to Genesis, a second group of assorted Genesis creditors, with loans also amounting to $900 million, is being represented by law firm Proskauer Rose, a second source told CoinDesk. Genesis and CoinDesk are both owned by crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group.  Crypto exchange Bybit is the latest company to announce layoffs amid the crypto winter. The exchange will implement another round of job cuts as it tries to refocus its operations amid a ""deepening bear market,"" CEO Ben Zhou announced on Sunday in a Twitter post. The layoffs will affect 30% of staff. Bybit previously announced layoffs in June. Australian crypto exchange Swyftx also announced on Monday it has cut 90 jobs, citing the crypto downturn.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows CHZ, the native cryptocurrency of Chiliz blockchain that powers the largest sports fan token creator platform Socios.com, has declined over 35% since the beginning of the FIFA World Cup on Nov. 20.  The pullback is typical of a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" trade.  CHZ rallied sharply in the lead-up to the World Cup, defying broader market weakness as soccer fans poured money into the fan tokens.

5175057,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511161,1670247096,Why Chiliz Is Losing Heat Despite World Cup Pomp; CHZ Down Over 30%,"Since the beginning of the 2022 2FIFA World Cup, the value of Chiliz native token has plummeted. Due to the discovery of various issues, the sporting event has been met with some controversies. Not to mention that just a week before the World Cup’s start, the collapse of the infamous FTX exchange shook the crypto world. But then, this is not the main point here. Despite some promising advances off-chain, Chiliz continues to struggle. The token is down more than 30% in the last two weeks. There is a lot of bearish evidence in the technicals and stats. If the price drops below $0.1451, short selling becomes an option. This added strain to the already overburdened Chiliz ecosystem, which has had trouble drawing in investors and sports fans despite the testnet release of its Chiliz 2.0 update. However, CoinGecko reported a 1.3% price increase just lately. Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Surge As Hash Rate Records New ATH – How About LTC Price? When Will CHZ Get Its Zing Back? On a green candlestick, the current price of CHZ is $0.1677. An oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) value may help to clarify the recent increase in the token’s price. However, the market is currently embroiled in a battle between bulls and bears, with prices remaining within the $0.3085-$0.1451 range that prevailed prior to the FTX brouhaha. The market remains slightly mired in the distribution phase, with support and resistance being momentarily breached and reclaimed. This has been true since the month of August. The situation may be deteriorating as CryptoQuant observes an increase in exchange reserves for the coin. According to Messari, the volatility of the asset has been 2.13, indicating that it has been quite shaky. Having settled at -1.23, the returns relative to this volatility likewise exhibit extremely bearish characteristics. Will There Be A Reversal? Nonetheless, the MACD indicator indicates that a reversal is imminent. This may suggest a reversal due to the RSI being oversold. However, because exchange reserves are so high, any positive reversal would be met with a tremendous negative force. A certain bearish breach of the $0.1451 support could cause the current market structure of distribution to collapse. A breach of this support might send the price to the 78.60 Fibonacci level. A breakdown below this level could send the price to $0.0791. As the market recovers from the correction triggered by the FTX crash, CHZ should be able to ride this wave and emerge in a better shape.

Such is the story of FatManTerra in 2022, who put Do Kwon’s Terraform Labs under a microscope until it ignited into a flaming mess, precipitating crypto winter.  FatManTerra isn’t doxxed; in internet parlance this means having your true identity uncovered – or revealing it yourself – and in interviews such as with Laura Shin on her ”Unchained” podcast he used a voice changer in addition to keeping his camera off.  But for someone who’s just a dude in his room, as he said in an interview with Fortune, he sure gets the attention of crypto stakeholders. FatManTerra got his start on the Terra Research Forum, a discussion board for all things related to the Terra protocol (which powers the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD). Then he opened an account on Twitter with the same handle. While at first FatManTerra’s tweets were lost in the ether, acknowledged but not turned into market-moving action, his continued criticisms eventually got the attention of whistleblowers, who began to share more evidence with him. A perpetual-motion machine started. More and more scoops began coming in, and the criticisms of Terra’s financial engineering grew louder.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  And then it all collapsed. The financial engineering Do Kwon created could not withstand the beginning of the bear market, and in early May the wheels came off the $60 billion UST/LUNA ecosystem.  Since then, FatManTerra has been a close monitor of Do Kwon, amplifying research on how he and associates drained the protocol and Luna Foundation Guard of funds as they knew the house of cards was collapsing. Law enforcement can move slowly, and might not have the expertise in on-chain research. FatManTerra found it in a place it can be easily seen.  Among the powerful people in FatManTerra’s audience were Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who is said to have started an investigation based on FatManTerra’s tweets. Now Zhao regularly responds to his tweets, though FatManTerra criticized Binance and Binance.US in a May tweet thread for keeping the details of the relationship opaque.  Though the mantle of Public Enemy Number One has passed onto Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of crypto exchange FTX, Do Kwon engineered the man-made disaster that precipitated the crypto bear market in May. It’s been an exhausting several months of vigilance.  “Once Do Kwon is brought to justice and there is some sort of satisfying resolution to all of this, I’m definitely going to be posting much less and focus on real-life stuff,” FatManTerra told Fortune. “I need to return to the real world.”  That may take some time longer, however.

It might have a lot to do with the fact that, just before he resigned as Boris Johnson’s finance minister in July, Sunak had declared his intention to turn the country into a global hub for crypto – and laid out some key initiatives in pursuit of that goal.  The U.K. Treasury, with Sunak at the helm, ushered in Britain’s post-Brexit financial strategy earlier this year, which includes measures to bring crypto stabilized against sovereign currencies (collectively known as stablecoins) into the scope of local payments regulations. The Financial Services and Markets bill is now moving through Parliament, and was recently injected with rules to regulate crypto broadly as financial instruments. The proposed regulations could solidify the U.K.'s crypto agenda in the wake of the European Union’s own sweeping Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework targeting digital assets, service providers and stablecoin issuers.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Under his leadership, the Treasury set in motion a public consultation on crypto taxes. He also ordered the country’s coin maker, the Royal Mint, to issue a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT), although nothing has materialized from the initiative yet.  Sunak’s sudden exit from government back in July left the local crypto lobby mourning the loss of a politician they had spent a great deal of time communicating with on matters of the industry. But Ian Taylor, head of lobby group CryptoUK, told CoinDesk at the time that Sunak’s resignation only meant he will be back in some other form.  In a turn of events not even Taylor could have predicted – and having little to do with crypto – Sunak is now the head of the U.K.’s government.  As the new prime minister, Sunak certainly has bigger fish to fry, having inherited an economy shaken down by the COVID-19 pandemic, a war and the rapid unraveling of his predecessor Liz Truss’ ill-conceived fiscal plan.  And then, just one week after accepting his official appointment from King Charles III, the crypto juggernaut FTX collapsed, pulling down with it an already battered crypto market. When asked if the debacle has swayed the Conservative government’s plans for a crypto hub, Sunak’s finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, cautiously said the government wants London and the U.K. to be a “global hub for innovation in financial services.”  “But we want to do so in a way that makes sure that we don’t do things that undermine financial stability, and of course we’ll work with regulators to make sure we get that balance right … including all cryptocurrencies,” Hunt said.

Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, faced 11th-hour obstacles for their stablecoin legislation that proved too high to clear.  While the 2022 window slammed on their effort, the work they already accomplished has pushed the tricky issue of stablecoin oversight much closer to reality. Top stablecoin issuers including Circle Internet Financial have been trying to meet what they think the standards will be for the reserve funds before the rules are even set. U.S. lawmakers generally agree that a stablecoin bill will require full, one-to-one backing with liquid assets such as cash and U.S. Treasury bills.

42393932,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcRzH,1670246752,Guiding the Chinese Central Bank Digital Currency the World Admires and Fears,"In such a momentous year for crypto, it’s easy to forget what last month was like, let alone last year. But cast your mind back to 2021, when one of the most compelling stories was the astonishing – perhaps intimidating – progress of China’s digital currency and crypto alternative, the e-CNY.  No other major economic power had started as early (2014) or pushed the design of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as far. Think tanks and finance experts, even current and former U.S. government officials, warned that if China got too far ahead of the rest of the world, it would control the interoperability, privacy, security and other facets of CBDC design.  Now think back to the runup to the Beijing Olympics. Major economies suspected China would use this massive global event to debut its e-CNY to attendees from all over the world, and felt tremendous pressure to prevent falling behind in the CBDC race.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  According to the Atlantic Council, 105 countries, representing over 95% of global GDP, are exploring a CBDC. For that significant representation, we have China to thank.  “In the same way [China has] done with 5G technology, they can be a major exporter of CBDC infrastructure,” former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover'' in late February. “It's going to be CBDC-in-a-box provided to you by the People's Bank of China.”  More ominously, he described rogue nations using non-Western CBDC to evade sanctions like the ones the U.S. and European Union imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, just a week after the close of the Beijing Olympics.  “CBDCs are absolutely being seen as a form of statecraft by countries that have been subjected to Western sanctions in the past and wish to have a way to avoid that in the future,” Giancarlo said.  Perhaps as a result of the anti-climactic – in terms of e-CNY progress – pandemic-stunted Olympics, media coverage of e-CNY is no longer coming at a breakneck pace. But China continues to push the envelope. Trials of e-CNY have been taking place for the past two years with the pace quickening in 2022 as the trial extended to four major provinces, including Guangdong, the most populous. PBOC data also shows that e-CNY reached the milestone of 100 billion yuan (US$13.9 billion) worth of transactions by this October. At the start of the year, the Chinese had opened 261 million e-CNY wallets, according to the latest PBOC data.  In such an atmosphere, determining who to credit for China’s CBDC development can be difficult because of the nation’s famously opaque government. However, there is Mu Changchun, who has worked as the director general of the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) since 2019 and has become, at least in interviews, the face of China’s CBDC. Established in 2016, the institute is dedicated in part to launching the e-CNY.  Mu has the job title, but by all accounts he serves at the pleasure of President Xi Jingping. As Xi consolidated his power in the latter half of 2022, two other key players in the PBOC with ties to the e-CNY project appear to have been cast aside.  Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the PBOC who often spoke publicly about e-CNY progress over the last couple years, was abruptly held for questioning in a corruption probe in early November, and his name no longer appears as an executive of the bank. Yi Gang, governor of the PBOC, is likely to step down early next year; his name was dropped from the list of full or alternate members of the Central Committee, the country's most senior officials and political elites.  Right now, Mu seems to be the only megaphone delivering news of the progress of CBDC in China. ""I have a rough idea that (there are) several, or a couple of million RMB (renminbi) of payments every day…,"" Mu told a webinar audience of the Atlantic Council that coincided with the Beijing Winter Olympics. He has spoken about e-CNY in various global meetings, including a closed-door event in July by the International Monetary Fund.  The big question is whether Fan's departure and Yi's expected exit will affect the development of e-CNY. It appears for now, however, that China will continue to push its lead in the global CBDC race, and central banks the world over will try not to fall too behind.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/mu-changchun-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a3aa06c89bf24dee931a1df45f466f7c5aaa308-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420903,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtnjh,1670246691,"Left Behind by the Merge, but Still Fighting","After years in the making, the Ethereum blockchain completed The Merge on Sept. 15, a landmark transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. One consequence? Ethereum’s mining industry, which research firm Messari said was worth nearly $19 billion in 2021, was left behind. Ethereum miner Chandler Guo predicted only 10% of PoW miners would likely survive following the historic upgrade. “Some people [miners] have free electricity and can [continue] to work on that,” Guo said, referring to the PoW fork. “The other 90%, bankrupt,” he told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program back in September.  Calculating the number of miners is next to impossible, but from the 10,287 nodes, or computers, running on the day of the Merge, there were likely hundreds, if not thousands. Guo reminds us that whenever there are winners – and the Merge by all accounts is a huge positive for blockchain and crypto – there are also losers. He put a human, and compelling, face on this group of people who saw their livelihoods ruined, their income decimated and their egos bruised. Few would have realized there were people cast aside as collateral damage were it not for Guo, who kept fighting.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  The week of the Merge, from Sept. 12 to Sept. 19, Ethereum miners sold over 16,000 ETH as they appeared to move to other chains, according to Blockchain data assembled by OKLink. The sell-off reduced the miners' combined balance to about 245,000 ETH, or roughly $390 million, during that period.  For months, Guo pushed to keep Ethereum as a PoW system, tweeting in July he would fork Ethereum “again,” after previously advocating for Ethereum Classic. “This time the fork, it’s much more difficult because I need to organize a lot of people [miners] to join this fork,” Guo told CoinDesk TV in August. But the fork didn't initially work out as many Ethereum miner proponents probably hoped it would, with the native ethereumPoW (ETHW) token dropping 70% on technical glitches after the Merge was completed. At the time, Guo rated the PoW fork debut a ""mediocre"" 5 out of 10, saying he expected that could change over time as more miners became involved. Since the Merge, the EthereumPoW ecosystem has “released the 2nd batch of the eco dapps and services” on Nov. 6, according to a tweet from @EthereumPoW.  Given the global push for decreasing carbon dioxide and reducing energy use, Guo’s efforts are not likely to succeed. There has been little support for his plan, especially as the United Nations’ Climate Change Conference in November reminded us that we have less than 10 years to change course or face dire consequences no one wants to imagine, like the dying of planet Earth. But humans being complicated beings, the part of us that roots for the underdogs want Guo to pull off the improbable and find a happy ending for his story.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sienna Park,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/chandler-guo-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58f96275122e1115380786478d84cabf96849dbf-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420901,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtnhd,1670246623,The OG Streetwear Designer Fighting for NFT Creator Royalties,"The Hundreds, co-founded by Bobby “Bobby Hundreds” Kim and Ben “Ben Hundreds” Shenassafar in 2003, was built when a sneaker message board called NikeTalk reigned supreme; when online communities gathered in chat rooms to share news on releases of the newest Air Jordans, discuss product design and socialize with like-minded creators. Sounds familiar? It was the precursor to the crypto Discords of today.  Then the streetwear brand proved the old-fashioned power of customer loyalty and community when it took its first step into Web3 with the launch of an Ethereum non-fungible token (NFT) collection, Adam Bomb Squad, in 2021. The collection of 25,000 unique NFTs was sold out in under 40 minutes. To date, its total sales is valued at 22,000 ether (ETH), or over $25 million, and has generated over $73 million worth of secondary trades, according to data from CryptoSlam.  Building on this success, The Hundreds spent considerable energy and expense expanding its foothold in Web3.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  This summer, a video of an NFT protest trended on Twitter. It showed an “angry” mob holding signs that read “God hates NFTs,” “Crypto is a sin,” “Vitalik is the antichrist,” marching the streets of SoHo in New York City at the start of the annual NFT.NYC conference. That’s just when the first flurries of crypto winter snow started to fall.  While some on social media believed it was a real protest against NFTs, longtime fans of The Hundreds knew it was a classic guerilla marketing strategy. Once again, the OG was showing Web3 how old-fashioned marketing is done.  So it was a shock in November when Bobby Hundreds canceled the NFT drop on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace in terms of trading volume, in protest of the NFT trading platform’s stance on creator royalties.  Many NFT creators set a secondary-sale royalty on their work, typically a 5% to 10% fee paid by the reseller. Since August, NFT marketplaces X2Y2, Magic Eden and LooksRare clawed away market share by deciding to no longer obligate buyers to pay royalties or contribute to creators. OpenSea took the middle road in this ongoing debate.  “Abandoning creator royalties throws the entire mission of Web3/NFTs off,” said Kim in a Twitter thread.  He has been one of the most outspoken Web3 creators to push back on OpenSea. Instead, The Hundreds moved the November launch of its new NFT collection Badam Bomb Squad to its own website.  To Kim, NFTs today have a lot to learn from the several decades of culture built around streetwear: Whereas streetwear had a good decade to build its artistic appreciation and cultural foundation before reselling stole the narrative, NFTs came up the opposite way – its investment value dominated the narrative before newcomers noticed its potential as a cultural artifact.  What’s more important than marketing strategies to build the cultural foundation for NFTs? The creators. That’s why, in taking a stance against 0% royalties, Kim says, “the artists are always in control.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/bobby-hundreds-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b5f13e9f321686fc498d60ede2655ac04265577-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420895,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtndV,1670246551,Blending the World’s Most Successful Loyalty Program With Web3,"With about 60 million memberships worldwide, Starbucks Rewards is the most successful loyalty program in retail, driving about 50% of its business. It is fair to say each time a customer gets a free latte with their Starbucks stars or orders a drink on the app, the credit should go to Adam Brotman.  Starbucks' then-chief digital officer, Brotman led the design of the mobile order and pay system and built its rewards program, which launched in 2009. Then he left Starbucks in 2018 for a brief stint as president, chief experience officer and co-CEO of retailer J.Crew.  Brotman fell down the crypto ""rabbit hole"" in Jan. 2021, when he studied blockchain technology and everything Web3 with venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur Andy Sack. That was when he stumbled on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which he described as a ""terrific, innovative tool for brands.""  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  NFTs “can be a storytelling mechanism because of the metadata you can put in it that can be branded. It can have a rarity curve that gives you all of the surface areas for storytelling and brand building. But because it's collectible there is a digital asset that can also form a sense of identity, you can get community and you can also get utility out of it,"" Brotman told CoinDesk. In Aug. 2021, Brotman and Sack co-founded Forum3, a Web3 loyalty startup to advise retailers.  By this time, Starbucks’ founder Howard Schultz, who has come back twice to lead Starbucks, was at the helm again as interim CEO. He was curious about the Web3 loyalty concept and upon discussing with Brotman became convinced it would be a powerful way to innovate on Starbucks’ customer engagement and loyalty.  This September, Starbucks officially announced the concept of Starbucks Odyssey, a rewards program allowing customers to purchase and earn digital collectible stamps – aka NFTs – that offer benefits and immersive experiences. The company opened a waiting list to gauge interest. In early November Brotman said he and Starbucks are ""pretty excited about"" the number, but declined to disclose what it was.  ""They wanted to have a separate brand but also a brand and a name that would evoke the idea of the romance and fun of going on journeys and collecting stamps in your passport and whatnot. So a lot of the nomenclature for Starbucks Odyssey is built around the game itself and the experience itself, which is an extension of the rewards program,"" Brotman said.  Now, Brotman and his team are working closely with Starbucks on the Starbucks Odyssey, which is expected to launch this month. With Starbucks as only Forum3’s third client, Brotman hopes to work with hundreds of brands over the next year. Even though the public's passion for NFTs has cooled, for Brotman the speculative nature of the asset was never his main interest.  ""I'm just as excited now as I was then [the first time he knew about NFTs] because it was always about the combination of collectability and brand engagement that got me excited. So that excitement hasn't changed at all,"" Brotman said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/adam-brotman-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd95032958290a4def661b764937cf331616b3ee-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Just two years later, after pivoting to sell his work as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, he has amassed $50 million in lifetime sales.  In April, FEWOCiOUS released his “Paint” generative art collection, featuring images of paint drops with a backdrop of the sky. As a part of his effort to build out his “digital universe” called FewoWorld, he sold $20 million of these NFTs over the course of 24 hours. According to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, the 7,000-unit collection currently has a 2,450 ETH trading volume, or $2,980,058, with a floor price of 0.4 ETH, or $487.

42420910,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtnor,1670246159,Miladys NFT Community Is the Counterculture to Cancel Culture,"If Bored Ape Yacht Club was the commercially groundbreaking Madonna of NFTs, Milady Maker was the technology's G.G. Allin or Seth Putnam – offending pieties, confounding critics and testing artistic boundaries. (Google those names at your risk.)  Briefly ubiquitous on Twitter in the spring, the Milady avatars, resembling bobblehead anime characters, looked cute and innocent at first glance – though their dilated pupils and raised eyebrows hinted at something off-kilter.  If you only look at the stats, Miladys, minted by a mysterious art collective called the Remilia Corporation, don’t seem all that influential. The floor price, or lowest price in the collection of 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFT), peaked in mid-April at 1.69 ether (ETH), worth about $5,000 at the time, according to data site NFT Price Floor. At their height later that month, the cheapest Bored Apes traded for about 137 ETH, then roughly $380,000.  But that’s looking at the phenomenon through a pinhole.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Miladys mattered not for any money the collectors made trading them but for what they represented: A counterculture to cancel culture, a sigil for the Extremely Online, an elaborate in-joke among outsiders. They invite conversations about whether the sins of the creator should be laid upon the creation, and whether words posted online can really be as harmful as sticks and stones.  As the uncanny childlike profile pics swarmed social media, Twitter detectives and mainstream journalists homed in on Miladys’ association with edgy, esoteric internet subcultures and right-leaning New York hipsters, particularly the collection’s creator, known variously as Charlotte Fang, Charlie Fang, or Charlemagne. In May, Remilia’s self-proclaimed CEO outed himself as the provocateur behind Miya, a Twitter account whose posts ranged from offensive to inscrutable. In the same post, Fang apologized for “poisoning the vibe” with his “toxic baggage” and said he would leave the project.  While Fang has stated the slurs and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories he posted were just trolly performance art and that he did not hold such views, there were more disturbing allegations that he sent messages to teenagers encouraging them to kill themselves. Those claims were never conclusively proven, and community members rebutted them in great detail on Twitter and a lengthy mid-November Substack post.  Read more: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About ‘Miladys’ but Were Afraid to Ask  Unlike the wealthy NFT collectors who flexed their pricey Bored Apes or CryptoPunks on their Twitter profiles during the boom, Milady owners did not appear to be motivated by status. Fang even encouraged people to use the art without buying the tokens. “if you cant afford it just right click save one who cares,” he tweeted.  Rather, for the largely pseudonymous accounts that display them, a Milady PFP is a license for online mischief and unfettered expression. “You can make statements that don’t represent yourself. You can like every post. You can post two hundred times a day, as many of the members of the Milady community did at the project’s peak,” wrote Ginerva Davis in a critical profile of Fang in Palladium Magazine.  So while the controversy over Fang’s antics tanked the floor price (temporarily), Miladys live on, subversively posting in dark corners of the internet, beyond the comprehension of social media’s hall monitors.

42420899,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtngb,1670246078,The Organizer of the Freedom Convoy Who Got Its Crypto Assets Seized,"To some, the name Tamara Lich invokes visions of semi-trailer trucks blaring their horns and large crowds of protestors chanting, “Freedom!”  To others, especially those in crypto, Lich is a defendant in a class-action lawsuit that represents a defining moment in Canada’s crypto history: the first time private citizens successfully petitioned a judge to grant a Mareva injunction and thereby “freeze” cryptocurrency wallets (although so far, the injunction seems to have been only partially successful).  So what’s a Mareva injunction? The name “Mareva” comes from the original 1975 English case: Mareva Compania Naviera SA v. International Bulkcarriers SA. In Canada (which has a separate and independent legal system from the United Kingdom), if a purported fraud victim, or plaintiff, sues an alleged fraudster, or defendant, the plaintiff can request the court proactively freeze the defendant’s assets before the trial. This prevents the defendant from disposing of the assets to avoid paying the plaintiff in the event of an unfavorable civil judgment.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Lich became a Mareva defendant, and the face of the so-called Canada “Freedom Convoy,” due to her role in organizing and raising funds for the month-long protests that sought to pressure politicians to remove Canada’s COVID-19 mandates.  She didn’t act alone, but as one of the more popular figures (if not the most popular) among the protests’ organizers, she became the face of the protest movement. Embittered downtown Ottawa residents (where the protests took place from Jan. 22 to Feb. 23, 2022) named her (and 79 other defendants) in a class-action lawsuit seeking over C$306 million (currently US$228 million) in “compensation for damages inflicted upon those who live, carry on business, or work in the [Ottawa] downtown core.”  Court documents show Lich was “the organizer of the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser on the crowdsourced fundraising platforms GoFundMe and GiveSendGo.” According to The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, the convoy raised over $24 million, most of which was returned to donors after GoFundMe raised concerns about the nature of the protests. GiveSendGo followed suit after being forced to halt the campaign via a court order initiated by the Ontario provincial government.  Read more: Court Orders Freeze of Canadian 'Freedom Convoy' Crypto Fundraising  During the final days of the demonstrations, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in the country’s history. This gave the federal government additional powers to help quell the protests, such as the ability to freeze bank accounts linked to the Freedom Convoy and its supporters.  With traditional funding mechanisms shuttered, Lich and team turned to crypto. On-chain datashows the Convoy raised about 20 bitcoin (BTC), worth roughly $1.1 million at the time.  Then the class action plaintiffs came across “considerable evidence about the plans to distribute the funds as soon as possible, in part to benefit the individual protestors, but also, to avoid any enforcement activity,” court documents state. That’s when the Mareva injunction was requested and granted.  The injunction seems to have been partially successful, and a combination of crypto and cash totaling over $6 million was eventually transferred to a third-party escrow account and frozen until the conclusion of the class action, which is still ongoing as of this publication.  Read more: 'Frozen' Bitcoin Tied to Canadian Protests Lands at Coinbase, Crypto.Com  The key word there is ""partially."" According to an article by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), police only managed to seize about 6 BTC out of the 20 BTC raised. Nevertheless, authorities seem confident they can track down and seize the remaining bitcoin, which seems to have been moved to ""hundreds of smaller wallets.""  According to the article, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) claims ""it has the capability to seize and recover digital currency assets, pointing to past cases where the Crown successfully prosecuted crypto criminals.""  Read more: Canada's Trudeau Enacts Emergencies Act, and Crypto Is Included  One key lesson Lich and her counterparts have taught us (albeit inadvertently) is that crypto is no longer some obscure asset immune to regulatory enforcement. The crypto community was reminded of this when the U.S. Treasury Department banned American citizens from using decentralized crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash in August.  The second lesson is that, at least in Canada, not only can courts seize crypto as part of regulatory enforcement, but also as part of private litigation.  UPDATE (Dec. 9, 21:30 UTC): The court granted the Mareva injunction but the story has been clarified to show that it was only successful in seizing a portion of the money. In addition, the authorities seized money, rather than freezing accounts.

The firm said on Monday that the board of both companies approved the move.  The stablecoin issuer had announced plans to go public in July 2021, with a valuation of $4.5 billion. The valuation was later doubled when the firms amended their terms in February.  In a Twitter post, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said his firm didn't complete the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ""qualification in time.""

42407194,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJWek,1670245694,All Aboard! Chartering the Mainstream Party Boat to the Island of Web3,"An NFT of this image was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  Avery Akkineni can read the room. She knows the fall of FTX will have consequences, and that it might scare off brands that were otherwise crypto curious. When it comes to the brands that were on the sidelines and mulling a Web3 play, says Akkineni, the FTX news “has probably set us back six to 12 to 18 months.”  But this is only part of the story. Akkineni is the president of Vayner3, the Web3 arm of Gary Vaynerchuk’s VaynerMedia. She spent the past two years onboarding mainstream companies into crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT), working with brands that range from KFC to Crocs to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. And while some companies remain skittish – and might even view Web3 as a “CFO killer” – Akkineni says that much of Corporate America still has a crypto appetite.  “From everything that I see and feel in my day to day, there’s so much inbound enterprise interest from companies who want to learn, and want to think critically about what’s happening in this new world,” says Akkineni. She points to Spotify, Reddit, Instagram, DraftKings and Salesforce as examples of mainstream companies forging ahead with Web3 initiatives – even in the frost of crypto winter. “There’s so much building going on, and there’s so much interest from enterprises,” she says, even if the bearish climate means that the “activation of some of those strategies will be delayed.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Akkineni might seem an unlikely ambassador of Web3 adoption. She doesn’t come from the worlds of crypto, art, finance or any of the usual NFT on-ramps. She spent her early career in digital marketing, including a six-year stint at Google, which is where she met a charismatic figure giving a motivational speech – Gary Vaynerchuk. She was impressed. She was intrigued by how Vaynerchuk was “leveraging social media to build brands in a way that I wasn’t seeing from other agency partners.”  She was so impressed that she eventually left Google (not the safest choice) and joined VaynerMedia in 2018. Her first mission was to open the firms’ offices in the Asia-Pacific region. So she went on a hiring spree and opened shops in Bangkok, Tokyo, Sydney and Singapore.  Working in Asia had a trade-off. During the depths of COVID-19, Akkineni sat cooped up in her Singapore apartment for months. She stared at screens. She Zoomed. And she thought more about how the world was becoming more digitally immersive.  Vaynerchuk had similar thoughts, and he began to dabble in NFTs. He encouraged his core team, including Akkineni, to look into this wild new space. They saw passionate, highly engaged, animated behavior in the social-media subcultures of NFTs – on Discords and Clubhouse and Twitter, As Akkineni says, “it’s the small subcultures, in our experience, which often drive mainstream adoption.”  So Akkineni started experimenting in the NFT space, buying random projects and artwork to get a sense of the consumer perspective. “The fundamental question that was propelling me to research all of this was, ‘What’s in it for the consumer?’ Because brands follow consumers. Where attention goes, brands follow.”  Meanwhile, Vaynerchuk became seemingly omnipresent in NFT-land, often wearing a hoodie and baseball cap, popping up in Clubhouse after Clubhouse. He gobbled up NFTs and grew a sizable collection, sometimes giving high-profile endorsements to projects like World of Women. (Vaynerchuk also warned that “98% of NFT projects that came out in 2021 will likely end up being bad investments for many that bought them.”)  He launched “VeeFriends,” the NFT project that would later include perks like FaceTimes with Vaynerchuk, entrepreneur coaching and admission to “VeeCon” – a May 2022 convention that featured Web3 and Web3-adjacent notables including Beeple, Mila Kunis and Snoop Dogg. (The 10,255 VeeFriends NFTs have a floor price of $1,206, as of this writing, suggesting a market cap of $74 million.)  And early in 2022, Vaynerchuk made one of the pithiest, most compelling pitches yet for the true value of NFTs. This is perhaps his most important contribution to the space – convincing mainstream (and deep-pocketed) audiences that NFTs are legit. “I think NFTs are grossly misunderstood,"" he told CNBC. “People thought that Andy Warhols and Jackson Pollocks should not have value. People thought that sports cards should not have value. People thought that sneakers should not have value.”  Mainstream brands listened to this kind of advice. Vaynerchuk has the credibility. “PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch have been clients of VaynerMedia for many years,” says Akkineni, who became president of VaynerNFT in 2021, and says the firm has now worked with nearly 50 Fortune 500 companies. “With that comes a level of trust.”  This is what helped Akkineni and team, for example, encourage Budweiser to purchase the Ethereum Name Service domain Beer.eth for $95,000, as well as spending $25,000 on an NFT from artist Tom Sachs, and making this its Twitter profile picture. (Budweiser no longer has the rocket-themed NFT as its profile picture – perhaps a sign of the times – but Akkineni said she considers the purchase of Beer.eth a watershed moment for the Web3 space, as it was the first time a Fortune 500 company bought an ENS domain.) “Budweiser is taking its first steps into the NFT universe,” an Anheuser-Busch InBev spokesperson told CoinDesk at the time, and it was Akkineni driving the behind-the-scenes work.  That work would continue throughout 2022, even if the firm needed to pivot. “We’re constantly reinventing ourselves and evolving,” says Akkineni. “What worked a year ago doesn’t work now … and what works today won’t work tomorrow.”  She now leads a team of 60 that’s spread across offices in New York and Miami. Part of the “reinvention” was changing the name of VaynerNFT to Vayner3 (as in Web3), and focusing on a more holistic consulting approach. The scope now includes education, long-term strategy, and developing the infrastructure to support future rollouts. “The biggest demand and the biggest value-add that we’re providing is really strategic services,” says Akkineni. “The phase that most companies are in is being thoughtful, and strategic, and learning, and deciding if they’re going to make a move.” She says that 7-Eleven, for example, is a partner they are working with to develop Web3 strategy, but they haven’t executed anything yet because “it’s not the time.”  The vibes have changed. During the peak of the NFT hype cycle, Akkineni says that brands were eager to trumpet their crypto experiments and rack up the publicity. “A year ago, everybody wanted to PR everything. Now, people are a little bit like, ‘Let’s see what gets picked up. Let’s see what people like,’” she says, adding that they are taking a more conservative approach, as opposed to “shouting from the rooftops.”  While the brands are not shouting, says Akkineni, they’re curious. Some see Web3 as an insurance policy to make sure they don’t miss a future trend. “Companies who really missed the boat on Web2 and social media are wanting to leapfrog themselves into Web3,"" says Akkineni.  It might take a little more time, but ultimately, Akkineni predicts that in 2023, “we’re going to see some enterprises take bigger, more intentional, more strategic swings.”  Even in the chill of crypto winter.

At press time, AXS was at $8.14, still recording a price pump of about 20% over the last 24 hours. Over the last seven days, it’s up 25%. Today’s gain is accompanied by a massive surge in trading volume, which has grown to $295 million over the past 24 hours, up 750% from the day before. Currently, Axie Infinity (AXS) has risen to the 52nd largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of nearly $812 million.

AXS’ all-time high stand at $164.90 and was reached in November 2021. This represents a whopping 95% loss in value. A look at the 1-day chart reveals that Axie Infinity has still not been able to break out of its downtrend channel. For this, a break above $9.00 would be required. If it fails, AXS would continue to move in bearish territory despite the recent pump. Fundamentals Of Axie Infinity Look Weak Meanwhile, the fundamentals for Axie Infinity continue to look less than rosy. According to the data platform CryptoSlam, the sales volume of Axie Infinity has shrunk massively since the peak on November 3, 2021 at $40.8 million. Since May, volume has been bobbing around below $500,000, though it was still close to $100,000 at the end of October. Yesterday, December 4, it was only $19,500. On Its Way To Decentralization So what is driving the AXS pump? One reason could be the impending decentralization of the project. The team published a blog post today. In it, they shared that a group of over 700 invested and influential community members have come together to shape the future of Axie Infinity. The Lunacian: Axie Contributor Initiative Kickoff! https://t.co/Yjs9njT5Rv — Axie Infinity | #AxieOrigins (@AxieInfinity) December 5, 2022 The team said it wants to actively work toward an end state. In this state, “invested” community members are responsible for making decisions about resourcing the Axie Infinity ecosystem. Currently, the project is still in the initial decentralization phase. However, important progress has been made recently as part of a step-by-step strategy, the blog post states. As progress is made on the decentralization continuum, actions like council formation, resource allocation, on-chain voting, and treasury activation will be unlocked. The ultimate goal is to give the collective the responsibility to advance self-organization. To this end, a collective of established community members of Axie Infinity, the “town builders,” was formed back in May.

After being elected town builders by the founding town builder team, the first 700 community members were selected today to participate in the first pilot “season” of Axie Contributors.

A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  In March 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden raised the hopes of the entire U.S. crypto industry by signing an executive order that directed federal entities under his watch to develop plans to better regulate crypto, looking not only at potential risks but also at the sector’s possible benefits.  While Biden, as the leader of the free world, is the name and face of the order, the task of actually writing the expansive document fell to a virtual army of unsung heroes. One of the authors, Carole House, is the former White House director of cybersecurity and secure digital innovation at the National Security Council.  The order – and by extension, the agency and department responses – has so far stopped short of answering some of the crypto industry’s biggest questions. Despite that, it was widely praised when it was published. Industry lobbyists and other participants, lawyers and policymakers around the world said the order could lead to “clear regulatory guidance,” noting the call for reports and study rather than new rules. Fears that the order was the first step toward a heavy regulatory crackdown were abated.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  The executive order has led to the first attempt at creating a unified governmental approach to crypto.  “Ensuring responsible innovation and evolution of the digital asset ecosystem is essential to our national security, financial stability, economic competitiveness and continued global leadership,” a White House official said in March. “You all know that cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth in recent years, reaching $3 trillion dollars in market cap last November. Without oversight, the explosive growth in cryptocurrency use would pose risks to Americans and to the stability of our businesses, our financial system and our national security.”  House said repeatedly that drafting the document was a team effort, with input from not just herself and fellow White House officials, but also representatives from different agencies and even some non-government participants.  “It outlined six key policy objectives that the president pointed to as key priorities for the administration and the government to be focusing on, and then some concrete steps and actions for the government to take a look at, and further examine some of the specific risks and measures that needed to be put in place,” House told CoinDesk.  The White House did not return requests for comment.  Developing a plan  The executive order stemmed from a previous comprehensive government effort, House said.  The first coordinated U.S. government regulatory effort was tied to its counter-ransomware campaign, she said.  Ransomware was a major global issue throughout 2021, particularly in the U.S., when food processing plants and fuel facilities were attacked.  In response, the White House created a task force to address ransomware attacks, convening international meetings, sanctioning exchanges supporting ransomware payments and offering to pay for information about attackers with crypto.  “That's pretty consistent with the way that a lot of policy-making ends up happening,” House said. Policymakers may be focused on a specific kind of risk or type of activity but would move on to a broader area. “In the wake of continuing to see illicit finance risks, as well as seeing more broadly the innovative potential of the underlying technologies, [and] also the critical need for making sure that the appropriate protections are put in place … really drove the recognition that there needed to be a whole of government approach related to digital assets.”  The order's authors included officials from the White House, various federal agencies, independent regulators and other members of the National Security Council, she said. Industry representatives, academics and advocacy groups were also consulted to identify the key policy areas and the related objectives.  Having this widespread input was important.  The first coordinated U.S. government regulatory effort was tied to its counter-ransomware campaign.  “Establishing the policy objectives for the first time ever, from the highest possible levels in government, from President Biden, knowing that [this entire interagency effort] is his direction, and the industry seeing that signal, has been really influential for agencies to be thinking about what they can do to help to promote that responsible development, whether through a mix of carrots and sticks, those incentives and enforcement measures, because it is a combination of all those things,” House said.  This culminated in a “whole of government approach,” as the order itself references numerous times, House said.  “Every agency that was represented in the interagency policy committee that was stood up inside of the executive order would be a stakeholder and was a part of that development process.”  House, who left public service earlier this summer and is now at a venture capital firm, has been involved with cryptocurrency-related issues for years. Prior to her role on the National Security Council, she worked on cryptocurrency issues at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury Department’s money laundering watchdog.  “I was the lead for cryptocurrency policy there for several years,” she said. During her time with the Biden Administration she worked directly with Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger. As far back as mid-2021 House was warning crypto developers to build tools for their products that would protect their customers and comply with the various laws governing tech and finance.  Outside the government, she’s also a senior adjunct fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank, where she covers crypto and other cyber issues. “I’m definitely staying in that policy space … I’ve certainly got a broader remit in my current role but I’m excited to stay a part of both the cyber and cryptocurrency policy communities.”  House describing her work on the executive order as “the greatest honor of [her] career.”  Slow burn  Six months in, the impact of the order is evident. It hasn’t led to any new laws or clarified some of the chief questions within the industry, but it has made the federal government’s views on crypto much clearer. To date, four parts of the Executive Branch have published nine different reports addressing everything from illicit finance concerns to energy policy around crypto mining to the technical aspects of a central bank digital currency.  “I'm so proud of the entire interagency, for coming together and just creating this first ever comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets,” House said. “There's some incredibly innovative content and things that we've never seen before, certainly under any U.S. approach, and that I really don't see under many, if any, international approaches.”  Much of the executive order focuses money laundering risks, terrorist financing risk or financial stability risk.  The analysis of risks goes all the way down to the personal. Part of the order directs an analysis on the potential of crypto to address financial inclusion concerns.  In a statement, Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang said the Treasury Department had already begun drafting reports focused on issues like the future of money and identifying risks.  “These reports identified many of the risks that we’ve seen play out in the crypto market instability and failures of the past few weeks. It is vital that policymakers move swiftly to utilize existing authorities and fill in the gaps that have been identified by putting in place sound regulatory frameworks to protect consumers and financial stability,” she said.  Of course, in December 2022 the industry is in a very different place than it was in March, marked by failures, bankruptcies and millions of dollars worth of crypto likely lost by investors. The successive failures of Terra's UST stablecoin, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, BlockFi and FTX, and the broader collapse of the crypto market, which has lost $1 trillion in overall market capitalization since the order was first issued (and over $2 trillion over the past 13 months) touched on multiple issues regulators were already paying attention to, from stablecoins to lenders to exchanges.  Regulators are already evaluating whether existing or new laws would prevent the next Terra or Celsius.  “A lot of this was foreseeable, and it's extremely unfortunate so many people have been hurt in these circumstances,” House said. “But ultimately, … there are the things that some members of the sector don't want to hear, which is that there has to be more effective regulation, in some cases, enforcement in other cases, and just implementation and compliance in others.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/carole-house-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef715c0923a5ee9a5bb43a693868e038228d823b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420897,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtneX,1670244981,The Bitcoiner Who Stood Up to Toxicity,"Nic Carter, the venture capitalist, has been a fan of tungsten for years. He’s discussed the elemental metal in podcasts, has talked up its “incredible density” and even claims to have given out 1-inch tungsten cubes as holiday gifts. In 2019, he created a handy guide as to why it was “the best metal,” noting its electrical conductivity, malleability and resistance to oxidation.  Carter’s fascination with the silvery, smooth alloy has certainly inspired others. Last December, crypto traders briefly caused a run on tungsten cubes and a minor price spike in metals markets. But the Castle Island Ventures co-founder would not call himself a tungsten supremacist. He’s also long talked up the benefits of gold, for instance.  Yes, a man can love two metals. In fact, Carter taught many this year that a man does not even have to be blindly faithful to a single blockchain! This came as a bit of a shock to the so-called bitcoin maximalists, who believe there is one true cryptocurrency and who had once, mistakenly as it turns out, counted Carter among their ranks.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Backing up: In June, Carter took to Twitter to say his fund was “[e]xcited to be backing @dynamic_xyz!,” as a venture capitalist is wont to do. It didn’t take long for Maxis to realize that Dynamic was a startup building a product for wallets on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, not Bitcoin, and to begin criticizing Carter.  Nic Carter, 30, a dual-citizen of the U.K. and U.S., who grew up in the Washington, D.C., area, has spent the majority of his professional life in the crypto industry. He founded the premier data firm Coin Metrics out of graduate school and was Fidelity Digital Assets’ first crypto analyst.  By the time Carter, who has almost 350,000 followers on Twitter, founded his venture firm, which has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to funding crypto startups and raised three funds, he had begun to build a reputation as a bitcoiner. On Medium, Carter wrote long pieces covering arcane and philosophical issues about bitcoin. A particularly successful piece made predictions about what 2017 initial coin offerings (ICO) would fail (he wasn’t far off).  But bitcoin wasn’t Carter’s only area of interest. One idea Carter was early to endorse, proof of reserves – the idea that crypto service providers could cryptographically show they hold the coins they’re supposed to – has become a major topic of conversation this year following the collapse of FTX.  Read more: David Z. Morris – Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists  “From the very start, I’ve been a pluralist when it comes to blockchains. Today, the only ‘base layer’ asset that I like from an investment perspective is Bitcoin, because I think its monetary and governance qualities are supreme, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been interested in other trends in the blockchain space,” Carter wrote in a blog post this summer, following his flameout with Maxis.  Carter, a regular CoinDesk contributor, is far from the only bitcoiner who has taken aim at the quasi-religion that has formed around the asset. Recent months have seen long-time bitcoin advocates and investors Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall rail against the tribalism and monoculture that started forming around Bitcoin around the time of the “Blocksize Wars” in 2017.  And then there’s the Bitcoin OGs including Erik Voorhees, Roger Ver and Jesse Powell who have embraced pluralism in crypto. Carter, for his part, has not become an uncritical advocate of “Web3,” but recognizes that some core technologies like non-fungible tokens or decentralized identity could be broadly useful one day.  The schism between crypto and Bitcoin is rarely about actual tech. Over the years, maximalists have convinced themselves that bitcoin was digital cash, an inflation hedge and destined to become the global reserve currency. As each “narrative” is disproven, like the ignominious stock-to-flow model or halvening thesis, the views among a tiny sector only grow more extreme.  These maximalists gladly called themselves “toxic.” Indeed, their worldview has become so twisted that some try to justify Bitcoin – a stateless monetary network – by claiming it’s the only “legal” cryptocurrency, and calling for federal regulators to shut down other crypto projects. Others have taken to promoting dangerous lifestyles like raw meat diets.  Carter wrote he was “genuinely embarrassed to be associated” with the increasingly radical culture around bitcoin.

42420909,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtnll,1670244891,The ‘Good Cop and Bad Cop’ of US Crypto Regulations,"If U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler is often perceived as the “bad cop” of the crypto industry, Rostin Behnam – chairman of sister regulatory agency the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – has long been seen as the “good cop.”  Since his appointment as chair of the SEC in 2021, Gensler has taken a tough stance on regulating the crypto industry, seemingly preferring to regulate via enforcement actions and keeping mum about things – including which cryptocurrencies are considered to be securities by his agency – that could help industry players comply with regulations.  While Gensler’s stance as a regulator has drawn the ire of many industry executives, Behnam has often been held up as his foil. Unlike Gensler, Behnam frequently speaks at crypto conferences, talks openly about his interest in blockchain technology and financial innovation, and has appeared to be interested in an open dialogue with industry leaders to develop regulatory guardrails for crypto.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Gensler and Behnam’s different approaches to regulation has resulted in a tug-of-war between the two agencies over which one will ultimately be responsible for regulating the industry. The CFTC currently appears to be winning that war: Both of the major crypto bills introduced this year expand the CFTC’s powers to regulate the crypto spot market.  Gensler, for his part, has held that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies are securities and that existing securities laws offer enough clarity to regulate crypto – no new laws are needed.  While many in the industry have cheered on the CFTC in its turf battle with the SEC, the CFTC’s recent spate of enforcement actions have led some to question whether Behnam is really the regulatory savior they were hoping for.  Behnam has made it clear that he never wanted to be crypto’s savior. Speaking at a panel in New York in October, Behnam said that he gets “very irritated when folks start to talk about the CFTC as a more favorable regulator,” adding that his agency’s “greatest accomplishment” was its track record of crypto-related enforcement actions.  While most of the CFTC’s 82 crypto-related enforcement actions in 2022 have been against outright scams and Ponzi schemes, some – including its recent charges against the pseudonymous members of Ooki DAO – have resulted in criticism (including from a sitting CFTC commissioner) that the CFTC, like the SEC, is attempting to regulate via enforcement.  Behnam has pushed for his agency to get expanded authority as well as a budget boost to allow the CFTC to bring more cases and do more investigative work, rather than rely on tips and whistleblowers to root out fraud.  The CFTC’s expanded authority, if granted, doesn’t mean the SEC is going anywhere when it comes to regulating crypto. Both Gensler and Behnam have been vocal about the need for both agencies to work together to oversee the industry.  “I have no doubt that the vast majority of the tokens that exist in the digital asset ecosystem are security tokens,” Behnam said at a New York University Law School event earlier this year.  However, as the CFTC continues to crack down on crypto, Behnam and Gensler’s “good cop, bad cop” routine might become outdated in 2023 – for many in the industry, it might feel more like “bad cop, worse cop.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/rostin-behnam-gary-gensler-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5bbfe276702d77463bc910ed10614593beebfeb-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After being “doxxed” as Satoshi to the media in December 2015 – widely speculated to be a publicity stunt arranged by Wright and his associates – Wright kicked off a series of moves the following year intended to convince the public of his claims, including a private “signing session” with former Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen and a public blog post (the so-called “Sartre post”) purporting to use Satoshi’s private keys to sign a message.  Both of these efforts were picked apart by cryptography experts and judged to be hoaxes intended to deceive the public.  The criticism, however, did not stop Wright from continuing to claim he is Satoshi. Wright went on to create a new fork of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV), and developed a new method of convincing the world of his Satoshiness: attempting to sue anyone who says otherwise into financial oblivion.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  This year, one of the people on the receiving end of Wright’s wealth and legal might was Magnus Granath, a Norwegian citizen better known by his online alias, Hodlonaut.  After Hodlonaut posted a series of tweets in March 2019 calling Wright a “fraud” and a “scammer” and labeling him a “Faketoshi,” Wright sicced his legal team on the public school teacher, demanding he delete the tweets and declare Wright to be Satoshi.  When Hodlonaut did not comply, Wright offered a bounty on his identity, doxxed him and filed a defamation lawsuit against him in the U.K. Granath filed his own lawsuit in his native Norway, asking a Norwegian judge to declare that his tweets were protected by the freedom of speech and preventing Wright from suing for damages in connection with the tweets.  The resulting trial in Oslo was crypto’s own version of David vs. Goliath: Hodlonaut’s two lawyers – paid largely through crowdfunding efforts – faced off against Wright’s international team of nine, and emerged victorious.  During his roughly three hours of testimony, Hodlonaut was composed and steadfast in his assertions that Wright was not Satoshi.  “There was a consensus, and there still is a consensus,” he told the judge, “that Craig Wright is a fraud.”  Hodlonaut told the court how Wright’s lawyers told him the suit could be dropped if only he agreed to delete his tweets – and tweet a pre-written statement saying he acknowledged Wright as Satoshi.  “I can’t do that, I’m not willing to do that, because it is a lie,” Hodlonaut said of the settlement terms. “I’m not willing to be in any way part of continuing something that I believe to be a fraud.”  On Oct. 20, Norwegian District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen ruled in favor of Granath, declaring that he “had sufficient factual grounds to claim that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempt to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.”  Hodlonaut’s legal victory is the latest in an ever-growing pile of verdicts that find that Wright has lied in court and presented falsified and manipulated evidence.  Though Wright’s lawyers appealed the verdict in November, Hodlonaut’s willingness to stand up to a crypto bully who has time and time again used legal threats to silence his critics (as well as sue bitcoin developers and websites hosting the Bitcoin white paper) has struck a substantial blow and perhaps strengthened the resolve of others who have been silenced.  However, Hodlonaut’s victory in Oslo has not stopped Wright from continuing to use the bully cudgel of the courts against his critics – and not everyone is willing or able to stand up to him like Hodlonaut.  In filing his appeal in Oslo, Crypto’s Goliath may have stood back up, and only time will tell whether Hodlonaut will prevail a second time. But in fighting back, Hodlonaut is fighting for something precious to many in the crypto community – free speech – so he has a massive crowd cheering him on.",NEGATIVE,BSV,BTC | REGULATION | BSV,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/magnus-granath-craig-wright-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88f5de55b504cb9fccda347ec150884b5687ebe2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cobie had received a direct message about a suspicious, late-night transaction moving funds out of the frozen FTX exchange. Several thousand viewers were watching the “Up Only” livestream, co-hosted by Brian Krogsgard (aka Ledger Status), which was popular from the day it launched during the better days of 2021.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Cobie, who has long, sandy-blond hair and speaks with an English lilt, shared information related to the attack in real time. It was a remarkable view into his information gathering, vetting and distributing process. A fixture of Crypto Twitter since 2013, the year he says he got interested in bitcoin, Cobie has become a practiced hand at calling out scams and unknotting convoluted crypto transactions.  This April, for instance, Cobie sent out a series of tweets showing the signs of insider trading at major crypto exchange Coinbase. The exchange then followed up with an investigation that eventually implicated its former product manager, Ishan Wahi, who has since pleaded not guilty to insider trading charges and is next scheduled to appear in federal court on March 22, 2023.  But that’s not the only time Cobie has used his considerable influence for good. Over the summer, after Crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong (aka BitBoy) filed a lawsuit against another YouTuber who had called out Armstrong’s questionable practice of shilling shifty projects, Cobie rallied together a legal fund for the defendant – sending in $100,000 of his own money. BitBoy later dropped the case.  With over 700,000 Twitter followers, Cobie’s has become one of the most-watched accounts. He shares useful news, validates worthwhile projects and calls out shifty behavior. His podcast regularly features crypto royalty such as Vitalik Buterin and Zooko Wilcox. While his income and crypto holdings are unknown, Cobie has gone independent as an “influencer” after working at U.K. neobank Monzo and touring as a semi-pro musician.  And while he’s known as much for cracking jokes on Twitter, Cobie has also cultivated respect as a writer. In his SubStack this year, he covered serious topics ranging from broken tokenomics models to problems of decentralized voting.  Cobie started off this year with a small rebrand, deciding to forgo his longstanding Twitter handle, CryptoCobain, and avatar, a picture of Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain with BTC-stylized glasses. He said the real Cobain, who committed suicide in 1994, would have appreciated the earlier, punkier days of Bitcoin, but crypto has changed.  Cobie struck a similarly reflective note the night FTX was hacked. After a year of bankruptcy announcements, hacks, lawsuits, depressed markets, it seemed there was little else good left in the industry. At the end of a three-hour broadcast, Cobie and Ledger realized the FTX-sponsored “Up Only” likely needed a new backer. It could’ve been their last show.  “What a stupid f**king industry,” Cobie said. But there he was the next morning, tweeting.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | WALLET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/jordan-fish-aka-cobie-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/905ae48a3711815acabb027a58b7d7edd389ca9f-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  Throughout the year, India’s central bank has repeatedly shown its hostility for cryptocurrencies by favoring efforts at complete prohibition. One person, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sithararman, has kept parliamentary debate on that possibility at bay by not introducing any draft legislation.  “Cryptocurrencies are by definition borderless,” she wrote to Parliament, explaining that no regulation or ban could be effective without “significant international collaboration.""  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Despite keeping the legality of crypto in limbo, Sitharaman was the chief architect of the Finance Bill of 2022, which included stiff taxes on crypto that resulted in the ecosystem entering a period of pain.  “I don’t wait till regulation comes into place for taxing people who are earning profits,” she famously said when asked how a nation can tax something that it doesn’t acknowledge is legal yet.  No official data has been made public on the size of the Indian crypto market; estimates range from 20 million investors to 115 million, the latter figure from a survey by crypto exchange Kucoin in June.  India’s crypto downturn after enacting the 30% tax on profits and the more controversial 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) was brutal. Within 10 days of the April 1 imposition of the 30% tax, trading volumes nosedived more than 50% on some exchanges. This was exacerbated by rising inflation, Russia’s war on Ukraine, global crypto contagion and investigations against at least 10 crypto exchanges (the exact number is unknown).  Recently, however, as crypto investors around the globe reeled from the sudden collapse of crypto derivatives exchange FTX, the Indian press was praising Sitharaman for the taxes’ damping effect on crypto exposure, saying: “Indian investors have been largely spared from the crypto meltdown.”  In this chaotic crypto economy, Sitharaman is gaining power to lead the worldwide debate on crypto regulation. Starting in December, India will hold the presidency of the Group of 20 nations for a year and host the G-20 summit in 2023. Whoever holds the presidency gets to set key priorities, and Sitharaman has already already indicated that framing crypto regulation will be an international priority during India’s term.  In 2022, she imposed harsh crypto taxes in India.

But as proven by the latest crypto meltdown, Powell has driven the market narrative more often than not in 2022.  Four-decade-high inflation has been the focus of economic policy leaders around the globe this year. That has been particularly true of Powell and his colleagues at the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that has raised interest rates at a rapid pace since March, from near-zero levels to the current 3.5% to 4%.  The economic uncertainty is one of many reasons crypto assets have suffered heavy losses this year. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest crypto by market capitalization, is down 65% year to date. On average, bitcoin moved 4% on days where the Fed raised interest rates.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  The total value of crypto assets is 62% lower than at the beginning of the year, when the asset class was valued at $2.2 trillion.  “Jerome Powell belongs on any list of cryptocurrency influencers given his position as chairman of the Federal Reserve,” said Howard Greenberg, educator at Prosper Trading Academy. “All financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, are impacted by the Fed's rate hikes.”  The fact that cryptocurrencies are thus affected causes chagrin for the crypto industry’s biggest advocates. Bitcoin, because of its capped total, is supposed to be immune to inflation and any Federal Reserve action.  For the first half of this year, before the crypto industry took a big hit from the failure of a number of crypto companies, including lender Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital and most recently, FTX, bitcoin was directly correlated with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 stock indexes, which are both strongly affected by inflation. According to traders, this was because institutional investors were increasingly buying bitcoin and trading it as they would stocks.  Though the correlation has since weakened, macroeconomic uncertainty is likely persist into next year. Fed officials have signaled further rate hikes are coming in 2023.

Back in 2017, Fink said bitcoin was an “index of money laundering.” But in the summer of 2022, BlackRock, with $10 trillion under management, made two forays into bitcoin, further cementing the asset’s establishment as a mainstream investment.

The bipartisan duo championed the crypto industry during the bull market, and right before the market crashed in June 2022 introduced a long-awaited bill – the Responsible Financial Innovation Act – that aims to establish comprehensive regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry.  The bill, if passed, would favor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the industry watchdog, and would make purchases under $200 tax-free – potentially paving the way for crypto to be used more like digital cash than digital gold.  Lummis and Gillibrand are also working on another bill with Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) on stablecoin regulations that could be introduced as early as this year. The bill would compete with alternative bipartisan legislation being drafted in the House Financial Services Committee.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Lummis in particular has been a long-time fan of bitcoin. She told CoinDesk she first bought bitcoin in 2013, when the price was around $320, and has never sold it. Public records indicate the senator holds between $100,000 and $350,000 worth of the cryptocurrency.  Lummis has made it her personal mission to educate her fellow senators about crypto, spinning up the Financial Innovation Caucus with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona) earlier this year to bring in speakers to educate lawmakers at the staff level.  Though Gillibrand has been less outspoken about crypto than Lummis, Fortune declared her constituent state of New York the “center of crypto startups,” with $6.5 billion invested at the beginning of this year. She has signed onto other pieces of crypto-friendly legislation as well, including the other major effort in the Senate to regulate the crypto industry – senators. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman’s (R-Ark.) Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA).  Gillibrand and Lummis’ support for the crypto industry has earned them many supporters (and donors). Among them is now-disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who donated $40 million to Democratic candidates ahead of the November midterm elections. (Ryan Salame, co-CEO with Bankman-Fried of FTX Digital Markets, was a major Republican donor – a fact that has been lost in many of the reports on FTX’s political contributions.)  Gillibrand was a recipient of at least $16,600 from Bankman-Fried, and has tried to wash her hands of him by promising to donate the money to charity.  Lummis has also cited FTX’s collapse as evidence that more regulation is needed, and has said she plans to push ahead with the Responsible FInancial Innovation Act.  “Transparent and fair exchange regulation … is essential to ensuring customers are protected while still promoting responsible innovation,” Lummis said.  The collapse of FTX has also prompted many of Lummis and Gillibrand’s fellow senators, including long-time crypto skeptics including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), to call for urgent regulations to prevent further contamination and future collapses.

The company is famed for its proprietary “hotspots,” which are wireless devices powered by the Helium Blockchain. Users mine Helium’s native token, HNT, as an incentive for expanding and strengthening wireless coverage for devices.  Haleem co-founded Helium Systems in June 2013 with Shawn Fanning and Sean Carey, and he also serves as chairman. According to Haleem, Helium Systems resulted from many conversations with Napster founder Fanning after the two met in 2005. They wanted to recreate Napster’s peer-to-peer model with wireless networks but without the pesky legal problems of copyright law.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Hosts receive HNT whenever their hotspots provide coverage and transfer device data. In February 2022, the Helium cryptocurrency had a market cap of over $2.5 billion and close to 600,000 Helium Systems hotspots.  Stretching reality  One of the broad themes in crypto this year has been insufficient due diligence. Three Arrows Capital and, most recently, FTX, both fell because of misplaced trust and insufficient hard questions being asked.  The Helium peer-to-peer wireless network protocol, which promised users payouts if they ran nodes, claimed its technology was used by the likes of mobility companies Lime and Salesforce. Neither of these companies are Helium clients.  A partnership with Dish Network also was not true. Helium claimed its hotspots would be incorporated into Dish’s growing 5G network to help provide coverage where it wasn’t yet economical to build a full tower. But Dish denied it had any involvement.  Does anyone use the network?  Like many other crypto projects, Helium’s network has been rife with scams. It is unclear how much of the network’s activity is legitimate, and how much involves people setting up devices to exchange junk data to and from their Helium hotspot and earn tokens in the process.  Earlier this year Fortune reported that the value of legitimate data transfers on the network appeared to be in the thousands of dollars, not the millions that Helium said hotspot owners were collecting.  With the bear market, the Helium HNT token’s price has plummeted. As CoinDesk reported, the largest owners of Helium hotspots are only earning a few dollars a day despite spending thousands on equipment.  While Helium has received praise for its usefulness, it resembles other projects that seemed pragmatic but failed to find a sizable following. Helium has yet to prove itself beyond theory while creating the illusion of greatness. Haleem’s exaggerations about Helium’s partnerships will offer yet another artifact from 2022 of the flippancy that cost crypto investors heavily and hammered the industry’s reputation.",NEGATIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | HNT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/amir-haleem-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b878fb432c56c25e176f3e1c43fa9c7e1cf02eac-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420902,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtnif,1670244045,The Punk Fighting for an Open Metaverse,"Punk6529 is living the future, today. At least, the future as the pseudonymous non-fungible token collector imagines it to be – where everyone has a digital avatar that slips into the metaverse as easily as a bird flies through the air.  “Here I am running around as a cartoon Punk, very seamlessly participating in communities and societies like I live in the physical world,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. Just “participating” in the metaverse is selling himself short, considering the work Punk6529 does advocating for, writing about and building this new digital frontier.  This year, Punk6529, who takes his name from an eponymous CryptoPunk NFT, unveiled his own NFT fund, NFT museum and started work on what he calls the Open Metaverse, a blueprint for an online city. However, most would probably know him by his often-long Twitter threads spelling out the need for crypto, sent out to his nearly half-million followers.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  “We must ensure we take the pathway towards an open, interoperable future now,” he said. If that sounds like something a cypherpunk would say, Punk6529 wouldn’t disagree. In addition to being among the most savvy NFT collectors, he has built a reputation as a leading futurist, having spoken with Raoul Pal, Laura Shin and other luminaries on podcasts (often using a voice modulator).  Like many other early bitcoin adopters, Punk6529 has a background in tech and finance that informs his views on those subjects today and the importance of crypto. He believes the world is on a “path dependence” to “persistent digital objects” or, in other words, is increasingly going digital.  “Whatever ends up being the standard platform or API [for the metaverse] is going to end up being very important in a decade. If it’s a Facebook API or Apple API, it's going to be the same type of scenario that exists today,” he said. Although Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the metaverse his company is building will be interoperable, there’s reason to doubt that.  To this end, Punk6529 has been self-funding a number of projects in an attempt to onboard people into a crypto-based metaverse. In April, he launched the free-to-roam museum district of his Open Metaverse, containing what he called “the most high-end art NFTs ever displayed in one place.” His stated goal is to get “​​100,000,000 people to use an NFT.”  It’s a digital environment that can be scaled up, and that other people can build in, without anyone controlling it. Although Punk6529 has called this an “investment in the public,” he also believes that NFTs can one day be an “$80 trillion” category, if all “intangible goods” move onto the blockchain.  Punk6529 currently owns over 850 NFTs, according to his OpenSea bio. But that isn’t counting his museum wallet with hundreds more. Prices have since decreased, but Punk’s known holdings were valued as high as $20 million this year.  Not much is known about Punk6529’s IRL alter ego other than the small details he chooses to reveal. He apparently lived in downtown New York City, not far from Tompkins Square Park, for years, and used to consider himself a bitcoin maximalist. Although he wants to keep his metaverse avatar separate, he admits the glasses, the hoodie and the scruffy beard sported by CryptoPunk 6529 aren’t far off.  “There’s a reason I didn’t choose a Mohawk Punk with a gold chain,” he said. “This is nerd-ville central.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/punk6529-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a737de3ff513e1fe88d923f3dfa0b14c11d22cd-1745x982.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The past half year in crypto has been one of bankruptcies, layoffs and steep losses. But two supremely powerful players stood in stark contrast to the wreckage. One was Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, and the other was his competitor, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ. With FTX’s dramatic collapse, now we are down to one.  There’s no question that CZ played a significant role in FTX’s demise. But before we get to that, it’s important to note that before this latest drama, Binance was already the world’s largest exchange by trade volume. CZ leads Binance on his own terms, refusing to be labeled as belonging to any one specific country. He is both everywhere and nowhere. Back in 2018, I asked CZ where he was based. “People still have this really strong concept of where your company is, and where you are,” he told me at the time. “A company is a concept. An organization is a concept.”  When I asked where he called home, he said, “I don’t really have any answer to that. Earth?”  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  These words might sound unorthodox in the world of traditional finance but we’re talking about crypto, and one could say that CZ’s attitude captures the spirit of a global and decentralized form of money. So does his rejection of fiat currencies and the traditional banking system – in June he told CNBC, “I don’t have dollars, everything is in crypto,” and at Consensus earlier this year he told me that he has a bank account “but I don’t use it at all.”  Not all governments are fans of Binance’s approach. But even as the exchange encountered friction from various regulators, its crypto-world influence continued to grow. Earlier this year, as other companies were laying off employees, CZ was flexing Binance’s plans to hire. CZ has nearly 8 million followers on Twitter and devoted fans all over the world. Binance recently invested $500 million in Twitter, ensuring the exchange has a seat at the table during the reign of Elon Musk. Despite CZ’s own lack of interest in using a bank account, Binance is reportedly looking into buying banks.  But it was with FTX’s downfall that CZ really consolidated his power. Following the publication of Ian Allison's fateful CoinDesk article showing that FTX sister company Alameda’s balance sheet was largely made up of FTX-issued token FTT, CZ publicly announced Binance would sell its FTT holdings. Soon after that, Binance announced its intent to buy FTX, then pulled out after taking a closer look at FTX’s situation and deciding it was beyond repair. This contributed to a widespread loss of faith in FTX as concerned investors rushed to withdraw their money. The fall was swift: On Nov. 9, CZ said that an FTX acquisition is “not a win for us.” Two days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.  This initially looked like a brilliant chess move on the part of CZ, as his actions contributed to the deathblow of his former competitor. But as the story developed it became clear this was much bigger than a rivalry between exchanges. More alarming information about FTX surfaced – including reports that FTX was using its customers’ money to pay for risky bets at its sister company, Alameda. Sam apparently cashed out $300 million of his investors’ money. Now, much of FTX’s funds is missing and creditors don’t know if or when they will see their money again.  In other words, regardless of what CZ’s actual intentions may have been, he ended up on the right side of history.  I would argue that Binance’s influence became more controversial after FTX fell. Because that’s when CZ began assuming Bankman-Fried’s previous role of crypto industry “savior.” FTX was not as big as Binance, but it punched above its weight. Over the past year, SBF became known as a kind of white knight, attempting to bail out distressed companies like Voyager Digital and BlockFi. Now that FTX is out of the game, Binance has stepped up to the plate. Binance committed $1 billion in BUSD (Binance’s stablecoin) for a recovery fund that aims to buy distressed assets and support the industry. Then Binance committed $1 billion more, also in BUSD. There are other contributors to the fund, such as Aptos Lab and Jump Crypto, but CZ is very much the face of it. “Binance’s Billionaire CEO Casts Himself as Crypto’s New Savior,” read a recent Bloomberg headline.  If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it is. “Crypto’s Last Man Standing,” read an Economist headline about SBF in an article from July of this year, describing him at the “center of attempts to rescue beleaguered crypto firms.” These are, of course, media headlines, not the actual words of SBF or CZ, but there is still no question that CZ is widely perceived in a similar savior role that SBF played. Binance US is even bidding for Voyager, the same crypto lender that FTX tried to acquire. SBF famously strived to gain power and influence in Washington, D.C.; now, Binance US is forming a political action committee, or PAC.  This role of crypto savior is problematic for several reasons. First, it goes against the core ideals of crypto, which is supposed to be trustless, decentralized and resistant to a single point of failure. But there are practical consequences as well. Because FTX was doing business with so many companies, its implosion triggered a domino effect. BlockFi, one of the companies that FTX tried to rescue, just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Other companies, including CoinDesk sister company Genesis Trading and Gemini, have suffered from contagion. There is likely more to come. The fall of such a well-known and once well-liked figure as SBF has also dealt a major black eye to the crypto industry, which already struggles to gain trust from regulators and much of the public.  SBF’s downfall, of course, was due to his own actions. But his outsized influence certainly exacerbated the wreckage. Now, if something were to happen to Binance the fallout would potentially be even more devastating. Who would be left to come to the rescue of the world’s largest exchange? Perhaps CZ truly does want to use his power to rescue an industry in which he clearly believes. But what recent history has taught us is that crypto should not place too much hope in any one savior, regardless of who that savior might be.",NEUTRAL,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB | FTT,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/changpeng-zhao-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39dbe536756f177ad24602c03e4dfe0adeb2dfb8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420918,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtp4H,1670243790,Setting a Standard for Global Regulation of Crypto,"In October, the European Union finalized the text of its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework – but not without a significant push from European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, who is responsible for financial services, financial stability and the Capital Markets Union.  The sweeping rules that would apply to crypto service providers and digital asset issuers looking to operate in the 27 member states of the trade bloc were introduced in 2020 by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm responsible for proposing new legislation. As the senior-most EU official for financial services, McGuinness deftly pushed the framework through the bloc’s complex legislative process before finalization. German lawmaker Stefan Berger saw the progression of the bill (procedurally and in terms of content) through the European Parliament.  “The EU is one of the first major jurisdictions worldwide to design a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCA will protect consumers, market integrity and financial stability. It will bring crypto-asset exchanges, wallet providers or issuers of crypto-assets under EU supervision,” the Commission said in an email to CoinDesk.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  MiCA was originally inspired by the now-defunct Libra (later Diem) project by Facebook (now Meta) that sought to create a stablecoin – which is a digital currency stabilized against the value of other assets – that regulators feared could threaten nations’ sovereignty. But as it moved through the EU’s legislative process, the bill took on new life. It is now hailed as a standard-setting rulebook for crypto regulations on a global scale.  McGuinness called for a global agreement for regulating crypto with the aim of protecting investors earlier this year. In October, she called on the U.S. to create its own crypto rules.  She has also said she wants to ensure ""no product remains unregulated."" Although MiCA covers most crypto assets, it left some ambiguity on how to treat non-fungible tokens (NFT), something the Commission says it would address in follow-up regulation to MiCA should lawmakers request it.  When concerns arose about crypto being used to evade sanctions in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, McGuinness urged EU lawmakers to speed up and finalize MiCA.  “What I want, and what I can tell you, [is] that MiCA rules will be the right tool to address the concerns on consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability. This is something that is so urgent given recent developments,” McGuinness said at the time.  The dramatic collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX in November has sent shockwaves through the entire industry, and regulators have mobilized with fresh vigor to clamp down on the space. Commenting on the crash, McGuinness said the notion that crypto can exist without regulation is “a science fiction idea.”  “Because money, if it's not regulated properly, as we know, can do horrible damage,” McGuinness said while speaking at a forum on Nov. 24.  The EU, thanks to MiCA, remains quite at ease in the wake of the FTX debacle, at least according to Berger, who says the strict standards set by the framework could have prevented such a collapse.  “If FTX had MiCA regulation, the present day would be completely different. So, for me, it's obvious the [MiCA rules work] as a bulwark against developments [that] led to this Lehman moment – and FTX was a Lehman moment – for the crypto world,” Berger said during a conference in November.  Berger, who steered the bill through attempts by lawmakers to add provisions that could have effectively banned energy-intensive crypto the bitcoin in the EU, was also instrumental in MiCA’s finalization this year.  Until the framework comes into effect in 2024, there’s really no saying how it would block such instances in practice, especially with companies like FTX that were set up in the Bahamas – well outside the EU’s jurisdiction.  EU lawmakers are set to vote on MiCA in February 2023.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/mairead-mcguinness-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e32d2cff675180595e4ce1a6e549bdca7b3d4002-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Seriously, if you thought the cringe factor of Paris Hilton’s Bored Ape endorsement couldn’t be surpassed, you’ve never seen a scruffy Matt Damon strolling through an exhibition hall rattling off Roman platitudes.  Damon’s Crypto.com ad is the embodiment of crypto-bro hubris and the crypto industry’s short-lived love affair with mainstream-media hype.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  And it didn’t age well. As it turns out, investing in crypto when bitcoin’s price topped $60,000 doesn’t make you an astronaut or mountain climber as Damon’s rousing adventure-themed pitch implies. It probably just makes you poor … or, well, poorer than you once were.  In fact, an Intercept writer calculated just how much money investors would have lost the first year if they had followed Damon’s advice. The TL;DR? A lot. Like a 70% loss.  But while haters have sanctified Damon’s Crypto.com endorsement as one of the worst celebrity crypto promotions in the industry's short history, the performance is far from the only celebrity crypto shill to make us cringe. Some will pay for their sins, literally.  In October, Kim Kardashian made headlines for incurring a million-dollar Securities and Exchange Commission fine for shilling EthereumMax. Like appetite-suppressant lollipops, biotin gummy bears and laxative teas, the token was something you never would have known about, or wanted to know about, unless a Kardashian's name was attached to it.

42420922,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtp9R,1670243662,Look Who's Taking a Crash Course in Crypto Bankruptcy,"As contagion continues to spread across the crypto industry, taking down exchanges and hedge funds alike, 2023 is shaping up to be the year of crypto bankruptcies.  Judge Martin Glenn, chief judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), may have 16 years of experience as a bankruptcy judge, but in 2022 he got a crash course in the particulars of crypto bankruptcies.  Judge Glenn is overseeing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for insolvent crypto lender Celsius Network, while another judge in his court, Michael Wiles, is simultaneously handling Voyager Digital’s bankruptcy.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Though Celsius is headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey, the company chose to file for bankruptcy protection in New York, claiming that the majority of its assets were located in New York City.  But Rick Hyman, a New York-based partner in Crowell & Moring’s corporate and financial services groups, told CoinDesk that it’s actually quite common for companies based outside of New York state to file for bankruptcy in New York City.  New York City's status as a global financial center, as well as the SDNY’s reputation for conducting efficient bankruptcy proceedings and for having expertise in the financial industry, has made it a top choice for complex bankruptcies, including the Lehman Brothers case and the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, both in 2008.  “[Celsius] may have determined that it would be favorable to have the same court, although not the same judge, [as Voyager] addresses the many novel issues that are certain to arise in these high-profile cases,” Hyman said.  Though much about crypto bankruptcies is similar to traditional finance industry bankruptcies, there remains a steep learning curve, and questions – including whether Celsius users should be paid back in crypto or in the fiat value of their accounts – have yet to be settled.  One major issue Judge Glenn has struggled with is the need to protect user privacy and the specific risks – including doxxing, harassment and hacking – that Celsius users could face if their personal information, such as their names and wallet addresses, were made public.  When Glenn ignored concerns about making user data public and issued a ruling compelling Celsius to release the data (minus email and home addresses), it didn’t take long for internet sleuths to make use of the treasure trove of personal information. A website was launched that made the data publicly searchable by name.  Shortly after the data was made public, Judge Glenn agreed to appoint a consumer privacy ombudsman to oversee the case.  Customer privacy is just one of the unique challenges that courts will face as they oversee crypto bankruptcies in the future. Judge Glenn is paving the way for other judges and other bankruptcy courts – something that will likely be much needed in the wake of FTX’s collapse.  Though FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware, contagion has spread far and wide, including in New York.

Under the leadership of CEO Ryan Wyatt, Polygon’s BD team has managed to land partnerships with seemingly every major brand that is entering the Web3 space, including Nike, Starbucks, Reddit, Meta and Robinhood. Prior to joining Polygon in February earlier this year, Ryan served as Youtube’s head of gaming where he built the division from the ground up over seven years. At Polygon Studios, Ryan quickly assembled an experienced business development team that have held senior level roles at some of the world’s biggest companies including Amazon, Oracle, Apple and Electronic Arts.  Given all of their partnerships with top retail brands, Polygon’s BD team is starting to drive mainstream adoption of Web3, something that many Web3 protocols have aimed to do but have so far failed to achieve.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  As of this week Polygon has 196 million unique wallet addresses compared to Ethereum’s 214 million. Since Oct. 4, when CoinDesk reported that Polygon briefly overtook Ethereum in terms of daily active wallet addresses, Polygon has been able to grow their number of unique wallet addresses at a much faster rate than Ethereum, with Polygon adding 24 million wallet addresses in that time compared to the 8 million addresses added to Ethereum. And that is post-Merge.  This growth could be attributed to numerous key partnerships getting announced in the past few months, including Reddit launching NFTs on Polygon and Robinhood selecting Polygon as the network of choice for launching a beta version of their Web3 wallet. Polygon has also recently announced significant partnerships with Nike and Starbucks that, once launched, will likely continue their growth trajectory of onboarding millions into Web3.  Nike’s .Swoosh project is a Web3-enabled platform that will utilize the Polygon blockchain in order to create a new, inclusive digital community that will allow members to learn about, collect and eventually help co-create virtual objects such as shoes or jerseys. Currently in beta, people can register for a waitlist to join .Swoosh. Nike plans to launch the first digital collection in 2023.  Starbucks Odyssey integrates NFTs with the world’s most successful loyalty program, Starbucks Rewards, which counts 60 million members globally. Members will have the ability to earn and buy digital collectible stamps that will unlock access to new, immersive coffee experiences. The stamps or NFTs will be on the Polygon blockchain. Starbucks has opened a waitlist, and the Odyssey is expected to launch by the end of the year.

42407202,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJX5C,1670243600,Empire of the Bored Apes,"More: An NFT of this image was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  In the 18 months since its launch of the wildly successful non-fungible token (NFT) project Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Yuga Labs has taught the nascent Web3 industry how to build a community around an NFT project and maintain that momentum despite market volatility.  Now it’s clear that Yuga Labs had much bigger ambitions to become a multi-tiered enterprise inspired by the creative thinking of animation studios like Pixar, by acquiring a handful of other character-driven NFT collections and creating virtual worlds where people can interact with them. To bring about this vision, Yuga raised $450 million in March led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), attaining a $4 billion valuation along the way.  “We see ourselves as like a creative-first company,” Solano said. “Our DNA is thinking of the things we want to do, then figure out the creative stories that we want to tell, and then we figure out how we're going to do them and work back from there.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  What’s astonishing about Yuga’s growth is how fast it has been. It was only back in February 2021 that four friends – Greg Solano, aka “Gargamel;” Wylie Aronow, aka “Gordon Goner;” Kerem Atalay, aka “Emperor Tomato Ketchup;” and Zeshan Ali, aka “No Sass” – set out to “join the club” of crypto by co-founding Yuga Labs when the idea of growing an online community around NFT profile pictures (PFP) was still relatively nascent.  Aronow and Solano met in college and bonded over their shared interests in literature and gaming. What set the BAYC apart from other PFP collections, is the men’s ability to spin a narrative tale around the characters.  “That’s when we came up with Bored Ape Yacht Club. The idea was that it was this place for degenerates to go, right? Because that’s who we were,” Aronow and Solano told Jeff Wilser in September 2021.  Over the past year, the company has injected capital into growing its portfolio of brands:  Its genesis BAYC project  An evolutionary NFT project called Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC)  A companion project called Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC)  CryptoPunks, a legacy NFT project that it acquired from Larva Labs in March  Meebits, another NFT project that it acquired in the deal for CryptoPunks  Its Otherside metaverse project, which is currently in its testing phase  In November, Yuga Labs announced the acquisition of Beeple’s Web3 ecosystem WENEW and its flagship NFT project, 10KTF.  The stream of steady product launches and high-value acquisitions has positioned Yuga Labs as one of the top NFT brands, with its product lineup consistently ranking among the top collections on top NFT marketplace OpenSea. Still, some have pushed back against the company as the “first NFT monopoly” in a space that is supposed to champion decentralization and individual ownership.  “I think the idea of a monopoly comes from people who don’t understand the impact we’ve had on the space in the form of decentralization,” Solano said in an email.  The company has also increased its staff from 11 to 110 people, formalizing its leadership team by bringing on CEO Nicole Muniz, a childhood friend of Aronow’s who founded and managed a creative agency, as well as adding a chief gaming officer, vice president of product and vice president of communications.  Solano said he and Aronow has led the creative vision of Yuga since the early days, including all aspects of the creative and strategic processes, while Muniz has been key in building out the infrastructure of the company and helping it scale.  I sat down with Aronow and Solano at the Institute of Contemporary Art during Art Basel Miami, where they were celebrating the installation of the newly-donated CryptoPunk #305, the third NFT to enter the museum’s collection. While the event attracted leaders and influencers from the crypto and fine arts spaces, the founders appeared still to be navigating the “overnight celebrity” status they earned after their identities were leaked in a controversial piece by BuzzFeed News in February.  The two 30-somethings are proud and maybe even surprised their passion project has exploded into such a cultural phenomenon, with celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Justin Bieber, Steph Curry, Eminem and Madonna, and thousands of other collectors proudly sporting as their profile pictures the cartoon apes, which were designed under their creative direction by a team of freelance illustrators including All Seeing Seneca, Migwashere, Thomas Dagley, and two others that prefer to remain anonymous.  Yuga Labs was arguably the first NFT project to integrate previously niche concepts such as using a flat price model, adding long-term utility, offering surprise airdrops, publishing a project road map and giving its holders full intellectual IP rights, allowing them to use the likeness of their characters for commercial purposes. This has paved the way for dozens of community-created projects and counting – including a California burger joint called Bored and Hungry, a beverage company called Ape Water and a music group called KINGSHIP made up entirely of Ape avatars.  “From Day One of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, the community has been empowered and encouraged to commercialize their NFTs. It’s core to why we’ve seen such rapid growth,” Aronow said in an email. “This approach, while initially perceived as risky, has proved to be key to the company’s success.” Indeed, enabling BAYC owners to earn money from their PFPs may also be key to the community’s loyalty.  At the Web Summit conference in Lisbon in November, Muniz emphasized brand’s ability to turn previously passive consumers into owners of their own content. In recent months, this shift has been observed through an increase in NFT trademark filings and a growing number of IP licensing structures used across NFT projects.  Yuga’s rapid growth and community building efforts over the last year are in service to a much greater vision, the development of its ambitious Otherside metaverse project. As the co-founder describes it, Otherside will be an interoperable, gamified world-building platform that will turn NFTs into playable characters. “We see it as the platform for our communities and many other communities to come together,” Solano said.  Otherside, which blends mechanics from massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPG) and Web3-enabled virtual worlds, sold 55,000 Otherdeed NFTs linked to virtual land ownership in April, raking in about $320 million. In July, Yuga organized its first tech demo for thousands of Otherdeed holders, which it dubbed its “First Trip,” giving the community a glimpse into the future where virtual identities are intertwined and owning an NFT is your key to unlocking the metaverse.  “We see Otherside as the intersection of a lot of these ideas,” Solano said. “It’s where we see the next evolution of the space going towards.”  “We wanted to create a truly co-developed, egalitarian metaverse that was fun,” Aronow added.

But the company he heads has emerged as one of the largest power players in crypto.  The well-established – though secretive – proprietary trading giant Jump Trading officially announced its crypto arm in September via a blog post authored by Kariya. The post confirmed what the industry had known or suspected, that the 23-year-old traditional finance (TradFi) firm has been buying, selling and funding crypto projects for years. Kariya called the project “six years in the making,” having started as an intern at Jump’s research lab at the University of Illinois.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Even before its official reveal and branding as Jump Crypto, the company had emerged as a big player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, participating in governance forums and actively building much of DeFi’s key infrastructure. In a presentation at the Avalanche conference in Barcelona in April, Kariya revealed Jump Crypto had about 140 employees, with 100 of those being developers.  Perhaps Jump Crypto’s biggest bet has been on a cross-chain future, dedicating heavy resources towards building Wormhole, a network of cross-chain bridges. (“A blockchain bridge is a tool that lets you transfer assets from one blockchain to another, solving one of the main pain points within blockchains – a lack of interoperability,” wrote Robert Stevens in CoinDesk.) The firm even executed what some observers called DeFi’s first bailout in February, immediately plugging a $320 million hole in Wormhole-held funds siphoned during a hack. Today, Wormhole spans 18 different chains and counting.  Jump Crypto’s venture capital arm has been equally active piling money into promising layer 1 blockchains. In September, Jump backed Mysten Labs, the team behind the Sui blockchain, in a $2 billion Series B raise. In July, Jump co-led a Series A round for Aptos Labs, the team behind Aptos, a buzzy new blockchain that some industry insiders hyped as the next Solana.  However, Jump Crypto’s entanglements with the failed FTX crypto exchange may have tarnished the firm’s reputation. Jump Crypto bet big on the Solana ecosystem, which saw the price of SOL and other related tokens plummet in the wake of FTX’s spectacular collapse.  “Jump Crypto is not shutting down,” the company said in a tweet that was subsequently retweeted by Kariya. “We believe we’re one of the most well-capitalized and liquid firms in crypto.”  The company announced on Nov. 30 it committed $25 million in BUSD to Binance’s industry recovery fund.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | APT | SUI,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/kanav-kariya-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d6f3b80cf5f30bf6e79f282e36bac5252b3b14a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Their vision was to build an empire atop Saber’s stablecoin-swapping software by attracting partners, developers and crypto capital into their coder collective, Ship Capital. For a while it worked: At its height Saber held billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL), becoming the biggest fish in Solana and a critical layer for nearly a dozen other interlocking protocols. It even pushed up the price of Solana’s SOL token. Saber’s success turned the Macalinao brothers into developer celebrities renowned for their golden touch.

Time also supported crypto firm Galaxy Digital in releasing its first NFT collection, releasing a 3,000-unit collection inspired by the firm’s logo in October.  Outside of Time, Grossman has taken Web3 to other facets of his life.

In July, the ex-Coinbase chief technology officer and former Andreessen Horowitz partner published “The Network State: How to Start a New Country,” a crystallization of ideas he’s been kicking around for almost a decade. The book audaciously claims that like-minded people scattered across the globe can form new societies first by building communities on the internet and eventually coalescing in real life – though not necessarily in a single place.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  “A key concept is to go cloud first, land last – but not land never – by starting with an online community and then materializing it into the physical world,” Srinivasan writes.  Cryptocurrencies, borderless by nature, would power the economies of these countries-to-be. Once prospective citizens know and trust each other – early on, those already in close proximity could hold in-person meetups – they could crowdfund the acquisition or construction of apartments, houses or towns in which to live together. These discontiguous outposts would be stitched together into a “network archipelago” using “mixed reality,” a combination of virtual reality, augmented reality (e.g., glasses that superimpose text or graphics over what’s in front of your nose) and face-to-face interactions. Digital IDs would confer citizenship and a census would be taken (how else?) on-chain. Ultimately, a network state would seek diplomatic recognition from the analog-world governments Srinivasan depicts as sclerotic.  Some readers may be thinking, “What is this man smoking?” But there are at least two projects, Praxis Society and Afropolitan, trying to make this apparent sci-fi dream into a reality. (Srinivasan is an investor in both.)  Read more: Balaji Srinivasan, the Man Who Called COVID (2020)  In 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic put much of the world on lockdown, Afropolitan formed an online community of 200,000 people in less than six months, according to co-founder Chika Uwazie. (They initially convened on Clubhouse, the voice-based social network that was briefly popular before Twitter Spaces ate its lunch.) The group raised “millions of dollars” in bitcoin and fiat currency from members of the diaspora of Nigerians living in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, Uwazie said during a presentation in October at CoinDesk’s I.D.E.A.S. conference in New York. (The group supplemented that with a $2.1 million pre-seed round this year from Srinivasan and other angel investors.)  A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Afropolitan aspires to build “a pan-African network state to help 1 billion Africans live their most abundant lives,” something it says the world’s nation-states have failed to do. But during her talk, Uwazie tailored her message to the investor crowd.  Unlike a social network, which needs millions of users to turn a profit, a network state could produce a return to investors with only a few hundred thousand members, Uwazie claimed. Revenue would come from “physical and e-resident taxes,” according to one of her slides.  “The network state is its own emerging asset,” she said. “It actually could be quite profitable.”  If nothing else, Srinivasan’s book is sparking conversations. As of mid-November, “The Network State” ranked third among Amazon’s bestsellers in the general technology and reference category, fourth in political philosophy ebooks and 16th in political philosophy books overall.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/pinning-the-idea-of-network-states-on-the-map,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc2cf9847dff6f03ecbafec718a6568b2376be59-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reddit described the new CPO role in part as leading and facilitating the creation of tools and features that bring community and a sense of belonging to Reddit, and Google, where Pali was former vice president of product and design at Google Cloud, was a different kind of consumer internet.  Bhat’s experience was with developer tools at Google, and Reddit is a community of niche communities, called subreddits, that focus on narrowly but deeply on hundreds of thousands of topics.  Bhat was hired anyway and already has proven he gets Reddit pretty well.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  In October, less than a year after he took the job, Bhat announced that 2.5 million users have opened Reddit Vault Wallets since July, when Reddit launched its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.

In late October, Spooky Season, created by Reddit user poieeeyee as a part of the Collectible Avatars Creator Program, had a trading volume of 538 ether (ETH) over several hours, just behind the blue chip NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club at 642 ETH at that time. Reddit NFTs have brought in over $11 million to date, according to data from blockchain data platform Dune Analytics.  Reddit’s NFT success is even more remarkable given that it has taken place during crypto winter. The NFT market overall has dropped 97% in total sales volume from its January 2022 peak. Reddit's success highlights the potential for NFTs, outperforming NFT initiatives from social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, according to a report by Coinbase.

In that sense, somewhat ironically, she’s often the person most associated with the mostly pseudonymous, largely informal project.  Founded by 14 acquaintances in a Telegram channel in 2019, eGirl Capital members are unknown even to each other. Beylin says she has yet to meet most of her eGirl co-investors. She doesn’t even know many of their birth names. That’s to say, she knows them as the rest of the world does, as a cartoon cat in a raincoat or King Leonidas with BTC-symbol eyes from the movie “300.”  “It’s challenging to build up a reputation,” Beylin said about her peers in a 2021 interview. Crypto takes its embrace of pseudonymity as a point of pride. If money is going digital, why wouldn’t personalities?  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Over the years, eGirl has become one of the most closely watched investment collectives. Its thesis is investing in core infrastructure that may only be useful in the future, like Ethereum layer 2s or “DeFi primitives,” Beylin said.  This includes supremely exciting technologies such as the primary decentralized ETH staking protocol Lido, the open-storage project Arweave and the innovative blockchain scaling development team behind Zksync.  Beylin, a graduate of Canada's Ivey Business School of the University of Western Ontario, located in London, Ontario, wasn’t trained as a venture capitalist. She got her start out of college doing consulting work for payments and banking companies before being introduced to Ethereum and Crypto Twitter by her brother.  Realizing that crypto solved many of the issues she was passionate about, Beylin jumped into the deep end. She joined OmiseGO, the team behind what is sometimes called Ethereum’s first scaling system, the OMG Network, and has worked with the rollup-friendly Plasma Group.  She also advised MolochDAO, an early experiment with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Like many early ETH users, Beylin has done a stint with the Ethereum Foundation.  Although not “technically minded,” she said, Beylin has spent most of her time investing in or helping build support around “core crypto technologies.” For the past three years she’s worked for The Graph Foundation, part of the team developing the eponymous protocol.  The Graph aims to become “the Google of Web3” by building out infrastructure to open-source data and make APIs more accessible. This will help developers more easily build dapps (decentralized applications), and provide the world with indexed blockchain information.  As director of the The Graph foundation, Beylin has helped disperse over $135 million in grants to community members and developers building on the protocol and helped her team close a $50 million capital raise led by Tiger Global.

That’s not to say there is no law in the crypto markets – there are many government agencies both in the U.S. and elsewhere tasked with overseeing the industry and hunting down crypto criminals.

NFT artists and auction sites hoped the long-anticipated Ethereum Merge would kick the market back into action. But the data after the Sept. 15 event ended up being disappointing.  Looking back on the NFT markets since the end of white-hot 2021, however, there was a cause for excitement: generative art as a medium for creating art NFTs has been on the rise, and artist Tyler Hobbs has been a force in keeping this NFT art form relevant. Generative art utilizes an algorithm to randomly create a piece of digital art. Each artist carefully crafts the code behind their work, and the beauty is in seeing what visual effects are unleashed. The rise of NFTs has prompted generative artists to put their work on-chain.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  In September, Hobbs sold mint passes for his generative art collection QQL, raising $17 million before anyone knew what the minted piece would look like. According to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, the collection currently has a 111 ETH trading volume, or $135,138, with a floor price of 15 ETH, or $18,262.  QQL wasn’t Hobbs’ first large success with generative art NFTs. In October 2021, he released Fidenza, a generative art collection, which, according to OpenSea, has amassed a 54,253 ETH, or $66,050,857, in trading volume and has a current floor price of 95 ETH, or $115,659.  Of course, that was when NFTs were the hottest thing in crypto and the art market in general. What makes Hobbs’ work exciting is that despite the NFT market slump since the beginning of 2022, buyers are still flocking to his work. In September, one wallet purchased eight Fidenzas, nearly $900,000 of Hobbes’ work.  “Projects like Fidenza and QQL are really new works that couldn't have happened prior to the blockchain and prior to NFTs,” Hobbs told CoinDesk. “NFT's have been fantastic for digital media, but there happens to be, you know, this real synchronicity with generative artwork that has allowed them to really flourish together.”  While Hobbs released Fidenza during the NFT hype of 2021 and QQL in the chilling crypto winter of 2022, both collections’ performance data illustrates how his generative art transcends market conditions, and may continue to set the pace in the future.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/tyler-hobbs-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12c7c18c5059716a9a180c4336a2886890657de4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  While the crypto-verse was roiling from the latest market fallout, Mykhailo Fedorov had more pressing concerns. The 31-year-old former head of a marketing agency is the Ukrainian minister of digital transformation, with a mandate to push the nation toward a digital future.  With missiles whizzing in the sky above the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, power blackouts and internet outages, the work of the Ministry of Digital Transformation has become exponentially harder since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Since the fighting began, Fedorov’s accomplishments include rebuilding thousands of mobile communications station destroyed by Russians, getting Starlink satellite terminals directly from Elon Musk (by tweeting at him), bringing PayPal to Ukraine, spearheading the launch of a new venture fund to support local startups and making crypto instrumental in the country’s fight for its future.  This year, Ukraine made history by successfully launching the world’s biggest cryptocurrency fundraiser. Over $178 million in crypto donations has been collected by various Ukrainian funds since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the analytics firm Crystal Blockchain, which last updated the figure on Sept. 30, 2022.  The Ministry of Digital Transformation, or Mintsyfra, as it’s informally called by Ukrainians (“tsyfra” meaning “digit” in Ukrainian), led this effort. The money was spent on weapons and ammunition for the army, as well as humanitarian aid for civilians, according to the ministry.  Read more: Ukraine Bought Weapons, Drones With Crypto Donations  Texting with the government  Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister of digital transformation of Ukraine, was in his car with his family, driving out of Kyiv on the second day of the war when he got a call from his boss, Fedorov.  Fedorov suggested launching a fundraiser in crypto, in addition to fiat, as the country desperately needed money to deal with the unfolding catastrophe. Navigating his car through the dense traffic as “the entire Ukraine was on the move,” Bornyakov called Michael Chobanyan, founder of Ukraine’s first crypto exchange, Kuna, the deputy minister told CoinDesk.  “Back in those days, we didn’t have any expectations,” Fedorov told CoinDesk in an interview via email. “There was basically no time for thinking about whether it could work or fail. We just did what we could.”  What Fedorov knew back then was the fiat system was not working for Ukraine. On the second day of the war, Ukraine’s central bank introduced harsh limits on foreign currency transfers in and out of Ukraine to stop the run on the national currency.  “As a result, donations from abroad using traditional methods faced problems. So we needed a tool to quickly perform those transactions. And crypto was our first choice for that. Until the main aid arrived, crypto served as a bridge to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the people of Ukraine,” Fedorov said.  On that day, as Bornyakov arrived at the undisclosed destination outside of the besieged capital where the ministry relocated, wallets for donations were set up. The next day, the official wallet addresses for donations, managed by Kuna, were posted by the Ukrainian government Twitter account.  That’s how Ukraine became the first nation to open a cryptocurrency fundraiser during a war. During just the first two weeks of invasion, donors sent about $100 million worth of crypto to Ukrainian funds. That figure might look modest compared to hundreds of millions raised in fiat at the same time, but it was an important contribution that allowed Ukraine to buy 213 drones, $5 million worth of various weapons and multiple other supplies for the army, Fedorov disclosed in August.  To purchase these goods, Ukraine needed to exchange the crypto donations into U.S. dollars, but many foreign crypto exchanges were reluctant to deal with anything related to the war, said Sergii Vasylchuk, founder of staking service Everstake. The one exchange that agreed was FTX, at that time one of the largest, and seemingly successful, crypto exchanges.  The FTX shadow  Now, after the spectacular collapse of FTX, the connection with the Ukrainian government has become the basis of a conspiracy theory involving the U.S. Democratic Party and used to sow further political divisions here. It goes something like this: By using FTX as the crypto exchange for its wartime fundraising, Ukraine “invested” in FTX, and the exchange, led then by Democratic Party mega-donor Sam Bankman-Fried, was used by the Democrats to launder money under the guise of U.S. aid to Ukraine. This theory defies logic.  Bornyakov refuted the theory in a November tweet, explaining that Ukraine used FTX for cashing out crypto donations back in March but never “invested” in it. He reiterated that in an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: Where the Coins Go: Inside Ukraine’s $135M Wartime Fundraise  The FTX link is a liability now, of course. But back in March, it was a lifeline: “I didn’t need to run around and look for places to sell crypto [donations] for fiat. When people asked me, I could simply point at FTX,” Bornyakov said.  When the invasion began, so many people wanted to help and so many local initiatives emerged that some donors got confused and didn’t know where to send their money or whom to trust, Vasylchuk said. So when the ministry started its own fundraising and verified campaigns of some non-governmental funds, it gave donors clarity as well as peace of mind.  “Mintsyfra became this source of truth, which was trusted by everyone,” Vasylchuk said.  Digital state  People Coindesk spoke to say that Fedorov understands the power of blockchain technology pretty well. However, it’s not personally his top interest and priority. Fedorov’s proudest achievement is tangential to crypto: It’s Diia, a smartphone app allowing Ukrainians to obtain digital copies of all their government documents and to request a range of government services electronically, through a single interface.  The ministry, founded in 2019, was Fedorov ‘s brainchild, Bornyakov said. Former digital strategy adviser for president Volodymyr Zelensky’s election campaign, Fedorov wanted to create “a ministry that would work like an IT company,” his deputy recalled.  A former startup founder, Bornyakov did not have a high opinion of civil servants but was pleasantly surprised with the new minister’s open and straightforward style.  “He said: We will have lawyers, we will have all this state machine and it will help you focus on what you’re doing,” Bornyakov said. The youngest minister in Ukraine’s government, Fedorov promised to “liquidate all this bureaucratic bullshit” when he started his career. According to Bornyakov, that worked.  It took Mintsyfra much less time that anyone expected to develop Diia, which now, during wartime, has proven its value, helping refugees have peace of mind about the accessibility of their official documents, Vasylchuk said.  The war accelerated development of additional features and now, Ukrainians can also receive their financial aid from the government through Diia, as well as donate to the army and report on the movements of enemy’s troops and hardware, Fedorov told CoinDesk.  He added that he and his team find crypto “quite exciting” with promising applications for the future of Ukraine.

42420921,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtp8P,1670242938,"Fired, but Not Canceled","Brantly Millegan is tickled that the increasingly popular Ethereum Name Service (ENS) still uses marketing terms he created. “The idea of, like, it's your ‘Web3 username.’ That was my idea,” he said. Millegan, who was fired from most of his leadership roles related to the ENS protocol, recently spoke to CoinDesk, giving his first interview since the controversy.  In fact, Millegan is still deeply entwined in the protocol – though many would prefer he wasn’t – after a five-year-old tweet resurfaced in February showing Millegan’s distasteful views on homosexuality, trans rights and abortion. Millegan, a church-going Catholic with seven kids, has repeatedly doubled down on his previous statements.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Crypto is not without its controversies, though the theoretically apolitical industry that creates tools to preserve individual digital rights and empower online communities has largely sidestepped the so-called culture wars. Millegan’s story demonstrates how censorship-resistant and self-governing Web3 platforms change the way communities may hold people to account.  Before he was “canceled,” as he sees it, Millegan had four jobs related to ENS.  He was director of operations on the core team developing the ENS protocol through a contract with the Singapore-based nonprofit True Names Limited. He was also director of the ENS Foundation, a separate entity based in the Cayman Islands that legally represents ENS DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the protocol.  Millegan was also one of the top on-chain DAO representatives, primarily through a process of delegation where DAO participants stake their tokens with larger holders to vote on their behalf. Finally, he co-founded a DAO working group, which has since been dissolved.  Many considered Millegan the public face of ENS. On Twitter, where he sports a CryptoPunk avatar with a blue headband, Millegan was a relentless advocate for ENS. He wrote blogs and hosted Twitter Spaces. He was often the first to share news of ENS developments. So it’s not surprising so many delegated their ENS tokens to him (and still do).  Hours after the offending tweet resurfaced, Millegan was fired from all the positions he could be fired from. His contract with True Names Limited was terminated. Then, in a situation unique to Web3, a public vote was opened to determine whether he should maintain roles he held democratically. He won with a five-point majority of the vote.  That Millegan was fired as a True Names director but still sits as ENS DAO’s second-largest delegater is problematic for some and something to be celebrated by others. The situation proves crypto can empower the unpopular, heterodox or marginalized. But it raises uncomfortable questions about inclusivity in Web3, and whose views are worth protecting.  “Many of you were hurt by Brantly’s comments over the past 24 hours, and we strongly believe that ENS should be an inclusive community. Going forward we’ll continue to do everything we can to ensure that remains the case,” True Names Director Nick Johnson said in a tweet at the time. Millegan’s exclusionary and discriminatory statements also presented potential legal problems for the company, legal experts have said.  Millegan said this month that he was disappointed in how the situation played out. “It wasn't nice that people I was friends with, you know, people I called colleagues for multiple years – I was just kind of instantly dropped in less than 24 hours. It was not very nice, with very drastic consequences for my life,” he said. “This whole thing kind of put a marker on me.”  But Millegan said even today his primary concern is the long-term viability of ENS. Despite boycotts, ENS has grown exponentially this year with several million people joining the protocol. The service has become a core piece of the Ethereum stack. Even Ukraine’s government created an .eth name for donations.  “ENS is not a company. It's not a product. It's a protocol,” Millegan said. “It is critical that it remains as much as possible non-ideological and neutral. I think everyone would agree on that.”  Indeed, ENS may be the world’s best chance at having a decentralized identity system. It enables people to turn alphanumeric blockchain addresses into human-readable names. It also allows anyone to create a resilient identity, giving them the ability to be who they want online without risk of being deleted.  While Millegan’s views may be personally abhorrent, the fact he is still able to contribute to the protocol may be the best way to show how ENS empowers vulnerable populations.  “The crypto parts of the system actually didn't fail me. I still have my tokens. I still have my crypto – no one took that away,” Millegan said.",NEUTRAL,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | ENS,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/brantly-millegan-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3c3a305e5ec895a5bdf11d917104acb45592bd5-576x324.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's $40 billion crypto empire shocked the world with its speed and scale. In less than a week, the company he founded, FTX, fell from its perch as a Top 5 cryptocurrency exchange and into the throes of bankruptcy court and the glare of federal agencies. A viral tweet from a former crypto executive read: “The insanity of Theranos, speed of Lehman and scale of Enron.”  A CoinDesk story about Bankman-Fried’s market-making firm Alameda Research would eventually lead to a series of events that exposed the depth of the crypto titan’s deception. When customer outflows hit FTX, Bankman-Fried tweeted that assets were “fine” when, in fact, they were not fine. One day later, FTX suspended all customer withdrawals. (That tweet has since been deleted.) There is also a reported $8 billion hole in FTX’s books, but even liquidators can’t nail down the figure because the company lacked an accounting department and did not keep proper records. Bankruptcy filings show $4.1 billion was loaned from Alameda Research to Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives personally via suspicious related-party transactions.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  In both good times and bad, Sam Bankman-Fried was the face of the cryptocurrency industry this year. Nobody exuded greater “main-character energy,” commanding the attention of mainstream news outlets and crypto Twitter degens alike.  Here’s a sampling of Bankman-Fried’s biggest flexes this past year, before it all came crashing down:  Raising a $400 million Series C round at a $32 billion valuation from investors including Temasek, Tiger Global and Softbank; FTX US, a separate arm of the exchange, also raised a $400 million Series A at a $8 billion valuation  Bailing out struggling crypto lender BlockFi by providing a $400 million credit line in exchange for an option to purchase the company  Outbidding competitor exchange Binance to purchase the assets of another struggling crypto lender, Voyager Digital  Purchasing a 30% stake in Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital  Testifying before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee on crypto legislation  Donating millions of dollars to U.S. political campaigns during the 2022 midterms elections, including a record $10 million in support of a losing Oregon congressional primary campaign  Pledging to donate up to $1 billion in the 2024 presidential election, before backtracking on that promise  Signing Warren Buffett’s billionaire Giving Pledge  Purchasing a 7.6% stake in Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and sparking FTX acquisition rumors of the retail trading platform  Texting with billionaire Elon Musk on a potential investment in social media platform Twitter  Gracing the covers of Forbes and Fortune magazines and billboards across the United States  Appearing in a TikTok post with superstar quarterback Tom Brady and posing in a fashion campaign with Brady’s then-wife, supermodel Gisele Bundchen  Putting on a three-day crypto conference in the Bahamas  Paying for a commercial featuring comedian Larry David during Super Bowl LVI  In some respects, Bankman-Fried is still the face of crypto, but not for the reasons he’d like to be. Instead of rubbing shoulders with celebrities like Tom Brady, he’s now under the microscope of John Ray Jay III, the new CEO of FTX and a bankruptcy lawyer that picked up the pieces of corporate disasters like Enron. Celebrity author Michael Lewis is also in SBF’s orbit, auctioning off the movie rights to his yet-to-be-written book about the now-disgraced founder.  Bankman-Fried might still be making trips to Capitol Hill. He’s expected to testify before congressional committees on how his exchange failed and lost billions of dollars in customer deposits. He’s still made himself available to the public – speaking at conferences, texting with reporters and tweeting erratically.  His influence is also measured by the other companies that have been brought down by FTX’s collapse. Lending firm BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after halting customer withdrawals. Another institutional crypto lender, Genesis Trading (a CoinDesk sister company), said it would no longer be able to honor customer withdrawals after the lender revealed it had $175 million in funds stuck on the FTX exchange. Voyager Digital is reopening its bankruptcy bidding process in search of a new white-knight buyer.  Bankman-Fried was the face of crypto in Congress, on Wall Street and in pop culture. FTX is now in the midst of a long and public bankruptcy trial likely to drag on for years. Even after the fall of his empire, we still can’t take our eyes off of him.

The headlines are brutal. They’re funny. They almost look fake. Just a few examples: “’Women-led’ NFT project, ‘Fame Lady Squad,’ turns out to be a bunch of dudes”; “Crypto.com wants back the $7.2 million they accidentally sent a customer last year”; “Bill Murray's NFT charity auction nets $185,000, which is then immediately stolen”; “CoinDesk reports that Decentraland has just 38 daily active users.”  The headlines come from Web3IsGoingJustGreat, a blog that chronicles the many scams, hacks, hiccups, rug pulls, missteps and cringe of crypto and blockchain. “There are these enormous promises being made by people in the industry, of how Web3 is the future of finance and will solve every little problem” says Molly White, the 29-year-old software engineer and longtime Wikipedia editor who created and runs the site. She argues that Web3 boosters promise the future but ignore the present, that they’re “writing checks they can’t cash, and in the meantime a lot of people are taking the fall.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  White is hardly the first crypto critic. Bitcoin is “fool’s gold and anybody buying it is ultimately a fool,” said longtime crypto antagonist Peter Schiff. Non-fungible tokens are “100% based on greater fool theory,” said Bill Gates. Bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared,” said Warren Buffett. The space is a “house of cards crypto cesspool,” tweeted the economist Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini, who added a poop emoji.  Most of these critiques boil down to “it’s all a Ponzi scheme” or “it’s all going to zero.” But the space has evolved and so have its critics. “The skeptical space has changed quite a bit,” says Cas Piancey, co-host of the “Crypto Critics’ Corner” podcast. Piancey says that he and his co-host Bennett Tomlin see the space “mostly as a scam” but that “we are open to the idea that there’s something valuable there. How valuable, we don’t know.”  White, Piancey and the actor-turned-investigator Ben McKenzie are part of a new generation of crypto skeptics. More nuanced. Hyper specific. Fluent in the tech and the memes and the vibes.  From an intellectual perspective, sure, White finds much of the space interesting. She’s a software engineer, after all – she geeks out on tech. “One thing I think is important is to separate the interesting from the possible use cases,” she says. “There’s a lot of stuff that’s really interesting.” From an academic perspective, for example, she’s fascinated by the innovation with ZK (zero-knowledge) proofs, but “that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be world changing, or that the positive aspects of it will outweigh the negatives.”  Just over a year ago almost no one in the crypto space had heard of Molly White. Now she’s serving on White House crypto panels, giving a speech (“Is Web3 bulls**t?”) to a packed crowd at Web Summit, shares commentary in mainstream news outlets (from The Verge to Vox, to Fast Company). As the Washington Post put it in a glowing profile, she’s “fast becoming the cryptocurrency world’s biggest critic.”  And now with the meltdown of FTX, the icy panic of crypto winter and the latest drumbeat of crypto is dead, Molly White and the skeptics are having their moment.  It all started with a unicycle.  i. Moving the world forward  In 2006, 13-year-old White enjoyed riding unicycles. She now describes it as one of her “really weird hobbies;” others would include creating Twitter Bots – like one that automatically added the word “cyber” to random nouns in headlines, making it sound like an uninformed tech journalist.  White, like any normal online-savvy teen, looked up the Wikipedia page on unicycles. She found the page lacking. So unlike every other 13-year-old, she edited the page and fleshed it out. That was fun. What other pages could she edit? Soon she edited articles for bands like Disturbed, Evanescence and other emo rock.  Soon she faced a problem that every writer dreads. “I kind of ran out of things to write about pretty quickly,” she says with a laugh. Emo-rock knowledge would only take her so far. How else could she contribute? “I realized there was this whole group of people who weren’t just editing the things they liked, but maintaining the website as a whole.” They copy edited. They cleaned up entries. They even fought Wiki-vandalism, like when political extremist groups would attack pages with spam and fake edits.  What started as a lark turned into a passion. “As time went on I realized how important it is to have high-quality information available to people for free,” says White. You didn’t need to spend hundreds of dollars for an Encyclopedia Britannica. You didn’t need to live near a library. All you needed was the internet. “This feels so critical to sort of moving the world forward,” she says.  White became a Wikipedia site administrator in 2010, while still in high school. She spent six years (non-consecutive) on the site’s arbitration committee – effectively Wikipedia’s Supreme Court. She kept editing Wikipedia while working as a software engineer for HubSpot. Eventually, she left the charm of unicycles for editing the grislier pages on incels, the far right and gender-based extremist groups.  “Those guys do not appreciate my work, and are very vocal about it,” she says, again with a soft laugh. But with extremist groups there’s very little that’s funny. She says one “particularly persistent sort of stalker type” published her address, tried to publish her family’s address, sent her information to the Proud Boys extremist group and even threatened to send someone to her apartment posing as a hopeful renter, who would then take videos from inside her home – just “crazy, unhinged stuff.”  She kept editing the pages. In total White has edited 100,000 Wikipedia articles, although she’s quick to point out this estimate is hard to quantify and “not really meaningful” because sometimes a simple click of “revert to prior version” can count as an edit.  Whether it’s 100,000 articles or 10,000, all of the years editing Wikipedia taught her a few things. She learned to appreciate open-source communities and how to evaluate media with skepticism, honing what she calls good “[crap] detection skills.” And in late 2021, White came across a term that needed a Wikipedia article. A term that had no clear definition. A term that was widely used but perhaps not widely understood: Web3.  ii. Just bonkers  Editing the page for Web3 was not White’s first exposure to crypto. In the early 2010s, when still a teenager, she learned about bitcoin – then in its infancy – and even explained it to her family. She found much of it appealing. “It had a great online community, and a strong group of privacy advocates,” she says now. She didn’t consider buying any because “I wasn’t trying to buy drugs online, and that was the big use case.” As a teenager she didn’t happen to have random stacks of money sitting around for crypto speculation. But she remembers thinking, “Okay, cool, I love the idea of [bitcoin] funding whistleblowers.”  Fast forward to 2021. White took another look at crypto and was startled by what she found. “I thought, how did we get from bitcoin funding dissidents to celebrities buying Bored Apes? What just happened?”  So she would research what happened. White did what she has done for her entire adult life – she tried to track down sources, investigate and gain command of the subject. Except Web3 sources were tough to find. She scrolled through an endless stream of press releases that, as she describes it, were all about “this huge potential for Web3 and how you should definitely pay attention to it” but “never would say what Web3 actually was. You couldn’t just get a two-sentence description.”  White’s first tweet that mentioned Web3 came on Nov. 10, 2021: “wrote a whole wikipedia article on web3 last night and i still don't think i know what it is.” So she kept investigating, kept reading, kept marveling at the absurdity – the projects she thinks of as “just bonkers,” where “people were doing the weirdest stuff with blockchain.”  Take, for example, a blockchain project called “Realms of Ruin,” where a group of bestselling Young Adult fiction authors would create an imaginary universe – they’d establish the setting and characters – and fans would write fiction to contribute to this world. The fans could mint these stories as NFTs, and buy and trade NFT character artwork.  There were many questions about the project. Who will own the intellectual property of these kids’ stories? Are the fans being paid for their work? “I remember seeing that and being like, “They’re trying to get kids to buy NFTs,’ says White. It seemed crazy. Most fans of YA, almost by definition, are young adults. They’re not 18. The whole idea struck her as poorly thought out, and likely a cash grab. Realms of Ruin was not long for the world – within five hours of going public the project was scrapped. (Part of this was because of an outcry over NFTs’ environmental impact; CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon offers an alternate take.)  White acknowledges that the intentions of the project could be innocent, but argues that good intentions are not enough. For her, that’s a global theme in crypto. “I think there are a lot of people who are running these crypto projects who genuinely believe in what they’re trying to do, and have good intentions around empowering artists,” says White. “But I also think that it’s really important to pay attention to the impact, as well as the intention.” In the case of Realms of Ruin, she says, you have to make sure that “you’re not just ripping off these kids.”  The more White explored the space, the more projects she found that seemed misguided, goofy, grifty, predatory or somehow likely to cause harm. And it felt like there was no one publication or website that captured all of the collateral damage in one place. Most mainstream and crypto publications, says White, tend to mostly cover the “good” side of the crypto coin.  Enter Web3isgoinggreat. She started the site as one of her many “dumb hobby projects” that she does for kicks, like the time in college when, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, whenever she read articles about Hillary Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, her mind would first see this as Clinton and Kanye, as in Kanye West. This amused her. So she wrote a script that changed Kaine to Kanye, a joke that has aged either poorly or gloriously.  White didn’t think Web3isgoinggreat would get much traffic. But the site quickly found eyeballs and traction from HackerNews and “Buttcoin,” a crypto skeptic subreddit. People began to notice.  The site is funny and droll, almost a throwback to early Gawker and the 2008-ish era of blogs. At first she tried to write it in her neutral Wikipedia-editor voice, but the jokes just came too easily. “Some of the stuff is so stupid,” she says, “and you just can’t help but laugh.”  White has a film critic’s gift for spotting a target and dryly, without mercy, ripping it to pieces. “An up-and-coming crypto scam – er, project – has managed to dunk on crypto bros better than any satirist i've seen so far, with one of the most painful-to-watch youtube videos i've seen in a while. join me in hell as we watch this together,” she tweeted on Jan. 4, 2022, beginning a thread that gleefully mocked the project “Crypto Land.”  The thread went viral. It put her on the crypto radar – as did Web3isgoinggreat’s cameo in Dan Olson’s “Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs” two-hour video, which now has 9 million views and counting. Her site (and her tweets) became must-read media for many in the space.  A self-described introvert, at first White was reluctant to speak to journalists, appear on podcasts or speak at conventions. In 2022, when the White House asked her to be part of a panel on cryptocurrency, her first reaction was, “What? I’m a software engineer who just makes jokes about crypto in her spare time.”  Eventually, she began saying yes. She said yes to giving a lecture at Stanford on Abuse on the Blockchain. Yes to appearing on podcasts. Yes to the White House. (This stemmed from President Biden’s Executive Order to research crypto; White was asked to give a statement to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which she published here.) 2022 would be the year of yes.  The reason for White’s change of heart? She had a realization. “It felt like so many people in crypto were speaking so confidently about things that they know nothing about,” she says. “Well, I know at least as much about this as they do.”  iii. The temperance movement  If a critic says, “Crypto is all a Ponzi scheme” or “crypto is all a scam,” this is relatively easy to refute. One counterexample is enough to do the trick. Oh, so crypto is all a scam? Tell that to the Ukrainian troops who received immediate global fundraising thanks to crypto.  What makes the critiques of White, Piancey, and the other skeptics so effective is they acknowledge the occasional use cases, they understand the tech, they have taken the time to research the space and, after all of their analysis, they believe, on balance – in the real world of today (as opposed to the Web3-powered utopia of tomorrow) – the bad outweighs the good.  “The experiment of bitcoin is really cool,” says Cas Piancey. “There’s nothing to argue about that. I love the idea of a non-nationalized currency.” And Piancey says there can be the occasional use for cryptocurrency, such as a Chinese dissident receiving funds that are censorship resistant. Yet, how common is this? “That’s a niche use case,” says Piancey, “but the reality is that it’s not something that’s going to dominate the world.”  This is a similar worldview to one held by Jacob Silverman, a longtime tech reporter and fellow crypto skeptic. “I’m not on a mission to burn it all down. I don’t have an activist mission,” says Silverman. In August 2021, Silverman received a random direct message from the actor Ben McKenzie (of “The OC” fame), asking if he wanted to talk about crypto. “He jokes now that he slid into my DMs,” says Silverman.  They met for beers and burgers. They clicked. They talked about the problems with crypto, they swapped ideas, they traveled to conferences together, they did research, and then they sold the book “Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud,” slated for a July 2023 release. In a description that crypto bulls will find chilling or dismiss as FUD, the book promises an exposé that “points in shock to the climactic final days of cryptocurrency now upon us.” (Especially in the wake of FTX, McKenzie has taken a flamethrower to Crypto Twitter. “If you think FTX is the worst/biggest fraud in crypto, I have bad news for you,” he tweeted. Good luck to the players remaining at the table.”)  FTX is now an easy (if perfectly appropriate) target. And although White and I happen to speak during the implosion of FTX, for an example of Web3 going sideways she points to something less obvious: Axie Infinity. On the surface, sure, there’s the $620 million hack, which might have involved the North Korean government. But look deeper. “The project itself is a good example of how crypto incentives are often really twisted,” she says. Axie Infinity was the poster child of the “play-to-earn” game, which White admits is an attractive concept – you gobble up crypto rewards for doing something you already enjoy. This is a fine theory. (It’s a theory I’ve written about, repeatedly.)  Then Axie took a darker turn when people tried to squeeze as much alpha as possible from the project, effectively loaning capital to groups of low-wage workers in places like the Philippines and Venezuela. (The cartoon blobs could cost $300 or more.) So in White’s view the loaners of capital, more or less, became landlords exploiting people – often in poor working conditions – who were grinding out the game. “This is certainly a far cry from the idea of a fun game you play after work, and also making a few bucks,” says White. She suspects that even without a hack the game would have cratered because “the whole economical model is completely unsustainable. There was no actual value being created by [people] battling Pokemon.”  Okay, so maybe NFT play-to-earn isn’t her jam, but what about NFTs in general? Can’t they have merit? Don’t they empower artists? (I’ve long viewed this as a win for crypto.) White is happy to see creators monetize their work, but argues that this has very little to do with blockchain, decentralization or breakthroughs in technology. “The revolution here is not the tech,” she says. “The real change is the speculative bubble that emerged around it.” From this perspective, artists are “empowered” because a cadre of millionaires became billionaires and the froth has trickled down.  NFT advocates have a comeback: But there is a technological breakthrough. Now, thanks to blockchain, for the first time, people can truly prove ownership of digital assets. This allows for digital scarcity. This fundamentally changes the online game.  White has a quick comeback to the comeback: “The technologically interesting thing [about NFTs] is not the cryptocurrency, it’s the cryptography,” she says. “That’s something that we can do for decades.” In one of many essays, she laid out the technological steps – using something called PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption – for an artist to sell unique digital goods without using blockchain. The tech has been there all along. No artists have been using this tech, says White, because there has “never been a speculative market.” When the hype around NFTs dies down, she suspects the markets will dry up.  Part of White’s exasperation is that many in the space view blockchain as a solution for every problem, and seem ignorant of all the work that had come before crypto. Take decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). “A lot of them are saying that, for the first time, now we’re going to be an online self-governing community, unlike everything else on the internet,” White says with a laugh. “Well, no. That’s not really true.” She found this particularly amusing given her 15 years with Wikipedia, a highly functioning (if imperfect) online, decentralized, self-governing community.  Don’t get her started on the Web3 projects that try to make a “better Wikipedia,” but with crypto. “Those projects have hilariously failed in several different instances,” she says. To her it smacks of hubris. While the idea was to pay people with tokens to edit – seems reasonable – this creates what White argues is a flawed incentive model. One incentive is to create high-quality information. Another incentive is to make as many edits as possible so you can rack up more tokens. “Those two things are not aligned,” she says.  Sure, maybe you can cleverly tweak the incentives towards some kind of voting model, but even that will eventually get gamed, says White, in a kind of “I’ll vote for your spam edit if you vote for my spam edit.” In yet another viral Twitter thread, she excoriated “Golden,” a prominent Wikipedia-but-with-crypto project, noting that “70% of the article on ‘Dog’ is dedicated to the Shiba Inu,” and that “there is no article on carrots, the vegetable. There are, however, articles about many different companies and cryptocurrencies with that name.”  The crypto community, of course, has a classic defense for most of these arguments. It’s still early. Blockchain is in the early 1990s days of the internet. “I got so tired of that argument,” White says, and has two rebuttals: “One is that it’s premised on the argument that blockchains are equivalent to the internet in some way, that they’re similarly revolutionary.” The internet was clearly transformative to nearly every slice of culture; why should we presume that Web3 will have the same sweeping impact, and therefore allow the same leisurely timeline?  Her second response: It’s flawed to apply the developmental time frame from an early tech to a later generation tech. Take computers and the internet. It took decades to develop the transistors, CPUs and hardware that would lead to modern computers. By some accounts, the invention of the computer dates back to the 1830s and Charles Babbage, a British mathematician, who devised plans for an “Analytical Engine.”  Progress begets progress. The internet developed faster than the computer because no one had to reinvent laptops. Blockchain should develop even faster. “Every technology basically develops exponentially quicker than the one before it,” she says, and expands the argument in an essay “It’s not still the early days.” Or as Silverman puts it, “Crypto has been around for 13 years, almost as long as the iPhone.”  Whether you agree with Molly White or not – and I, personally, confess to more optimism for the space – you can benefit from exposure to her arguments. Debate is healthy. And skepticism is a core ingredient for intellectual honesty. Skepticism is good for the individual and, I would argue, good for the industry at large.  “You need skeptics,” says Piancey. “You need people to head-check you.” He estimates that the majority of his podcast’s subscribers are bullish on crypto, and they’re listening to understand and appreciate the other side.  We’ve been hearing, for years, that “crypto is the future.” That might still be true. But ultimately, says White, we need to “temper these really optimistic visions of the future with how the technology is functioning today.”  And in 2022, whether people liked it or not, the skeptics delivered that temperance.",NEGATIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/molly-white-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36604f6396e998f822fbb4d0762f9760dd392374-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In his own words: “We don’t play to beat each other, we play to become better for ourselves and to help one another in the collaborative spirit of Web3, as we share in the network effect that we are building together.”  His ethos around collaboration and empowerment is evident through his company’s large-scale investments in crypto, play-to-earn gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse, with a portfolio of over 380 Web3 projects like Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, OpenSea and Dapper Labs. As the behemoth firm has continued to grow over the last year, raising its valuation to $5.9 billion, Siu has served as the front-facing visionary behind strategic movements like acquiring Australian game developer Grease Monkey for an undisclosed amount and buying Australian digital marketing agency BeMedia to grow its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.

On Erick Calderon’s LinkedIn page, he is still listed as the president of La Nova Tile Importers, a “family owned and operated porcelain and ceramic tile and slab importer.” In many ways Calderon is still in the business of tiles, but these days the expression of creativity is code, not clay, and the designs are not in kitchens or offices but in crypto wallets and hanging in virtual galleries in the metaverse.  In 2022, Calderon’s company, Art Blocks, firmly established blockchain-based generative art as a significant and important new creative movement. With traditional and new collectors accounting for over $172 million in primary sales so far this year, and with showings in some of the top auction houses and galleries in the world, generative art is having a serious moment. Additionally, many of the top Art Blocks projects have defied the macro trend of non-fungible tokens (NFT) underperforming and declining in cost. Art Blocks drops in 2022 have been some of the best investments in the NFT ecosystem, while profile picture (PFP) projects including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Doodles and Moonbirds have seen their floor prices drop from recent highs.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Erick “Snowfro” Calderon has put in the hours to make Art Blocks work. Calderon began coding at the age of seven and has had entrepreneurial aspirations since college. His artist handle, Snowfro, was originally given to him by a college friend based both on his signature hair style and because he was starting a Snow Cone enterprise at the University of Texas that became SnowFro Refreshments. While working in his tile business, Calderon started getting into the blockchain, first with Bitcoin and then with Ethereum, where he started teaching himself to write smart contracts.  In 2017, after seeing a post on Reddit about a new project called CryptoPunks, he started to mint Punks – a lot of Punks. As he explored all of the rarity traits behind the pixelated 24-inch-by-24-inch pixel portraits and how smart contracts enabled both the creator as well as the person minting the work to have participation in their output, the idea for Art Blocks was born.  For those new to non-fungible tokens (NFT) you should know that Art Blocks, the company Calderon founded and where he serves as CEO, is a pretty big deal. Total sales on Art Blocks artwork have been more than $1.4 billion on primary and secondary markets, and it has been at the epicenter of the recent generative art movement. Generative art is produced by an algorithm. While the shapes, style and palette are determined by the artists, the outputs have randomness built in; unpredictability is what makes each version unique.  While generative art has been around for decades, the Art Blocks platform allows creative coders to have a place to mint and sell their creations directly to collectors and the audience has grown significantly since it launched two years ago.  Snowfro is one of the most popular artists on the Art Blocks platform. To buy one of his 9,700 unique Chromie Squiggles at current prices would cost around $15,000 for a common one. In September 2021 a collector paid almost $3 million for Chromie Squiggle #4697, which has very rare traits. Not a bad return on investment for the collector who initially minted the piece for 0.035 ETH, about $23 at the time. Snowfro is not the only artist from Art Blocks whose work sold for giant sums. Dmitri Cherniak’s Ringers #109 sold for $7 million inOctober while a number of Tyler Hobbs’ Fidenza series fetched more than seven figures.  When asked why generative art has found such a fan base among the crypto crowd, Calderon is both humble and a bit surprised, “I didn’t expect it to be so native, it was such a niche thing. It was hard to envision this product market fit or this distribution mechanism that we’re seeing where an artist can sell something to 1,000 people in five minutes and they are all unique. I didn’t expect that level of demand.” Calderon said, “It wasn’t until 100,000 smart contract tokens were minted that I was like, oh yeah, it might be the most compatible form of art on the blockchain.”  Much of the NFT conversation in 2022 has centered around artist royalties and whether platforms should allow buyers to avoid them, Art Blocks and Calderon are firmly on the side of the artist. “It’s been really wonderful to see this distribution mechanism for artists to be found,” he said. “We have a community of artists that are thriving and get to quit their jobs and pursue art full time, and you have these collectors that sell art and can profit based on the quality of their eye.” Art Blocks has earned over $82 million in royalties for artists to date, second only to Yuga Labs.  What excites Calderon going into 2023? He hopes to continue the mission of creating a marketplace where artists and collectors can connect. “No guarantees what the future holds,” Calderon said, “but it seems that art can be a little more untethered from the typical crypto macro. It was beautiful to see that we have already been untethered from the crypto macro and what led us there was having a very firm vision of what we want which is to sell art, support artists and engage collectors in a way that this technology enables and enables very very well.”  In addition, Art Blocks has introduced Art Blocks Engine, essentially a white-labeled back-end that allows creators, partners and brands to use NFTs as a way to connect deeper with their communities.

42407191,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJWUp,1670242608,‘We Are All F****d’: The Developers of Tornado Cash and the Future of Crypto,"“I never thought it could be as terrible as it is now. Virtually every aspect of my life is broken or destroyed.”  After three months in a Dutch jail, web developer Alexey Pertsev still doesn’t fully know what he’s accused of doing. Those who ordered his arrest in August had published little more than a press release by way of explanation.  “To me, it's more like they don't have to explain anything, they're just doing me a favor” in showing him legal documents for his case, Pertsev said of his Kafkaesque ordeal, in a statement given to CoinDesk early in November. “It doesn’t look like I’m here by any law.”  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Together with Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, Pertsev is caught up in the case of Tornado Cash: a maelstrom that, in 2022, blew crypto apart, raising questions about its founding principles of privacy, freedom and open-source collaboration.  Unstoppable  The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) may not have realized what it was getting into when, two days before Pertsev’s arrest, it sanctioned the Tornado protocol, the most widely used currency mixer on the Ethereum blockchain, citing the laundering of billions of dollars.  Immune from control by any one developer, Tornado is “unstoppable,” Semenov, who founded the protocol with Storm, told CoinDesk in a January interview. That didn’t stop regulators from trying.  Tornado lets users tip money into a central pool, later drawing it out using a zero-knowledge proof – a sort of receipt offering access to funds without revealing extraneous details. That anonymity can be used for good or ill. OFAC says Tornado was used by North Korea-sponsored hackers, the Lazarus Group. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he sent anonymous funds to aid Ukraine using it.  OFAC wanted to act against a tool that, it says, has been used to launder criminal money and fund weapons of mass destruction in North Korea – a country that’s hardly a poster child for crypto’s libertarian ideals. But regulators, tired of playing and losing at wallet whack-a-mole, caused significant collateral damage when they tried to take on the whole system.  Americans using the protocol lost access to funds and to other crypto applications and, though not personally sanctioned in the Aug. 8 measures, Semenov was soon tweeting he’d lost his account on Github, the site where open-source developers post their work. He asked if writing code was now illegal and later spoke of a “chilling effect” that made it taboo to talk about privacy at all.  Unprecedented  Sanctions normally target people like Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, or terrorists like Al-Qaeda; now it was blocking Americans from using a piece of software. Previous shutdowns, such as Blender.io in May, focused on those controlling a centralized mixer, but in 2020 Semenov and Storm destroyed their keys so Tornado works automatically. If nobody’s in charge, there’s nobody to blame.  OFAC, which declined to be interviewed by CoinDesk, has said it has the power to sanction a wide range of entities like associations, groups and other organizations, including Tornado Cash. For Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at think tank Coin Center, the unprecedented measure is “conceptually incoherent.”  “Sanctions are a tool for behavioral change,” Van Valkenburgh said. “Software in the abstract cannot change its behavior, it's just there.”  Coin Center is now suing OFAC for infringing the constitutional right to make private political donations, and Van Valkenburgh points to the many other absurdities the case has raised.  In one stunt this summer, celebrities including Shaquille O’Neal and Jimmy Fallon were sent funds from Tornado; the law says they are tainted by something they were powerless to prevent. Protocols can’t raise a legal petition – though that’s the normal route to get sanctions lifted. At one point, cryptography professors weren’t even sure if they were allowed to share code with students.  Cautionary  In the Netherlands, there were more than Github accounts under threat. Pertsev’s detention drew an outcry from the crypto world; Edward Snowden recently contrasted the detention “for the ‘crime’ of building privacy tools to protect you” with the kid glove regulatory service afforded to executives at failed crypto exchange FTX.  At a November hearing, the issue was painted by the Netherlands government as a clear case of money laundering. Far from being decentralized and automatic, Pertsev, Semenov and Storm ran the ecosystem like a business, the public prosecutor said. Pertsev’s lawyers, meanwhile, say the courts just don’t understand crypto, and are confusing Tornado with a centralized bitcoin mixer.  Maybe that level of education will improve as judges pore over the details of how Tornado’s supposedly decentralized governance structure worked. In the meantime, there has been a great personal cost.  “Imagine not seeing your loved one for months or years,” Pertsev told CoinDesk. To attend their weekly, one-hour supervised visit, his wife Xenia Malik must drive three hours in a borrowed car after his own was seized by the police, he said.  “I have never seen her cry so often,” he said, in a written statement given to CoinDesk by Malik.  Pertsev’s requests for bail, and to spend Christmas at home, were rejected on the basis that he could interfere with the investigation or try to flee – though he says he has little interest in returning to Russia, where he could face the draft.  As to the idea he could perpetrate his crime again if released, he said, “I was not even informed of what crime,” in remarks made before his hearing.  At an August demonstration against the arrest, developers said they are worried they’ll now be held liable for bad actors using their code. “Privacy is normal, it's not a crime,” protest organizer Eleonore Blanc told CoinDesk. Being free of centralized institutions is the whole point of crypto.  Malik told CoinDesk she’s heartened by the reaction from the crypto crowd. “This support is very important for us ... it is very nice to realize that we are surrounded by such a large number of cool people.”  But that may prove little solace if her life is effectively stolen from her for months, if not years.  “People have the right to privacy … people can write open-source [code] and not be afraid that they will be put in jail and their whole life will be destroyed,” Malik said in a written statement. “I hope we get justice no matter how long it takes.”  Painful  This isn’t the first time regulators tried to fix crypto using a rusty and ill-equipped toolbox, but it’s in everyone’s interest to figure out how to make blockchain fit with privacy, a puzzle raised in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper and still unsolved.  Either regulators continue to learn by doing, with all the pain that can cause, or the crypto community learns to stand up and be counted and show them how to do it better.  “This is a wake-up call to that community that they need to recognize and protect the open source community that they rest on top of,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of online rights organization the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a phone interview. “They should not take it as a given that code development and innovation are just going to magically continue, as a kind of free resource. They will have to invest in protecting it.”  In January, Semenov compared Tornado to the fights for online privacy in the early history of the web, leading to innovations like https secure encryption. Semenov declined to be interviewed for this article. But, in a message sent to CoinDesk, his colleague was more forthright about the risks the situation posed to the crypto community as a whole.  ""We are all f****d if nothing is changed,"" Storm said.  UPDATE (Feb. 2, 2023, 17:41 UTC): Main story image, an artist's interpretive rendering of Pertsev, replaced with photo from courthouse.

42407197,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJWlM,1670242523,The Four Horsemen of the Cryptocalypse,"An NFT of this image was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  What a difference a few weeks makes.  Every year, CoinDesk plans its Most Influential list starting as early as August. Back then it seemed obvious who belonged in the rogue’s gallery of the 2022 crypto collapse (crippling an industry is, after all, a kind of influence, too). The four CEOs behind Terraform Labs, Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital built flawed products, enticed retail investors to take huge undisclosed risks and borrowed heavily to lever themselves up to nosebleed heights. Then each of them blew up spectacularly.  Now, of course, we’re dealing with a seemingly even darker figure: Sam Bankman-Fried, who not only did all of the above but also lent funds to himself and his inner circle, tracked billions in assets on a pile of crumpled napkins and strategically posed as a beneficent public-minded messiah while doing it. (That’s why he gets a story all to himself.)  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  In comparison, someone like LUNA creator Do Kwon could now seem almost innocuous. And the Four Horsemen, being the Machiavellian narcissists they seemingly are, have indeed seized the opportunity of Bankman-Fried’s unmasking to try and mend their own reputations. Kwon and Su Zhu in particular have stuck their heads up from various non-extradition spider holes to humanize themselves on chummy podcasts and argue that everything was SBF’s fault, really.  So maybe it’s a good time to remind ourselves: Do Kwon, Su Zhu (with co-founder Kyle Davies), Alex Mashinsky and Stephen Ehrlich are hardly better than Sam Bankman-Fried. All of them acted out of ego, ignorance and reckless disregard for the people who trusted them with their money. None of them were actually as smart as they thought they were. Each is responsible for huge losses inflicted on more honest (if lazily trusting) players across the cryptosphere. All of them enriched themselves personally as they strode away from the destruction wrought by their failures.  And none of them deserve the redemption arcs they’re seeking.  Who killed crypto?  As we gaze over the ruined landscape of the crypto market at the end of 2022, with assets down by more than two-thirds since one year ago, it’s impossible not to ask: Whose fault is this?  The biggest, most fraudulent and most interlinked failures are easy to list. Do Kwon’s Terra ecosystem was the first keystone to crumble, in turn helping reveal weaknesses at Three Arrows, Celsius and Voyager.  Terra was also, by some measures, the largest failure. Terra’s stablecoin terraUSD (UST) began to lose its peg on May 7, 2022, and the death spiral that followed was an inevitable consequence of its flawed design.  At their height, Terra’s LUNA token and UST were valued at $60 billion, though that included a lot of illusory implied value. It’s still not entirely clear how much real money from investors was vaporized, but the amount is likely in the tens of billions.  And a lot of the fake value was on the books at entities such as Three Arrows, which had about $200 million worth of LUNA on its balance sheet right alongside UST and bitcoin (BTC). Three Arrows, in turn, had received large loans from entities that aggregated retail investor funds, including about $75 million from Celsius.  But trusting Three Arrows was simply one misstep among many at Celsius, which also lost as much as $350 million in customer funds through an apparently hapless active-trading program. The lending platform began to wobble as crypto markets declined over the course of early 2022. On June 12, Mashinsky issued his notorious demand that investor Mike Dudas find “even one person who has a problem withdrawing from Celsius.”  The platform stopped withdrawals the very next day, and filed for bankruptcy on July 13.  Three Arrows came next (though as we now know, far from last) with their disclosure of huge losses on June 17 and a bankruptcy filing on July 1. In addition to its big LUNA position, Three Arrows was also wounded by losing positions in Lido staked ETH (stETH) and the GBTC Bitcoin trust run by Grayscale (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group).  Voyager followed just behind, suspending customer withdrawals and trading on July 1, then filing for Chapter 11 on July 5. Three Arrows was the most dramatic proximate cause for its failure – Voyager had loaned 3AC an absolutely gobsmacking $670 million.  Far worse, this and other Voyager loans were, as CEO Steve Ehrlich had blithely put it in an investor call just weeks before the collapse, collateralized only in “a very small portion.” But Ehrlich assured listeners everything was fine because “the people we lend to are some of the biggest names in the industry.” “Other people trust them” is not the level of financial due diligence that should be expected of any lender – particularly one that fraudulently claimed its customer deposits were insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., of which Voyager was accused by the FDIC.  These failures and many others were linked both by a variety of loans that couldn’t be recalled and more nuanced interconnections – a case study in financial contagion.  Many smaller services acted as little more than front ends for Terra’s Anchor program, making it easier for less-crypto-savvy users to get a bit of that sweet 20% yield – and then lose 100% of their principal. Zhu and Davies’ Three Arrows was managing a reported $10 billion at the time of its collapse, a tally revealed to have been pumped up by extensive loans from entities including Blockchain.com, Genesis Trading (another Digital Currency Group company) and Voyager.  Celsius, whether by luck or foresight, managed to withdraw more than $500 million worth of assets from Terra’s Anchor system before the collapse. But Celsius was also speculating with customer funds across a seemingly huge variety of DeFi platforms and assets, and the LUNA crash drove down prices across most of that ecosystem. So even if it wasn’t a direct hit, LUNA’s blast radius still badly wounded the lending platform.  Celsius is believed to have had about $11.8 billion in deposits in May 2022, the month before its collapse. Unlike Three Arrows, though, much of that amount was deposited by individuals who trusted Mashinsky’s frequent, sneering insistence that Celsius was just like a bank, only better. Mashinsky’s rhetoric exemplified the crypto-carpetbagger’s impulse to simply parrot simpleminded slogans, while in fact contradicting one of the space’s fundamental appeals: self-custody.  Voyager had attracted fewer assets, holding about $5.8 billion in deposits at its peak. That could hold a perverse lesson, because Steve Ehrlich’s relatively restrained personal style was seemingly outperformed by Mashinsky, Kwon and Su’s Donald Trump-like declarations and belittling of critics. Voyager pursued other ruthless and damaging marketing approaches, though, such as openly lying about FDIC insurance on user accounts and running a very generous promotion with Mark Cuban’s Dallas Mavericks basketball team that wound up costing fans a bundle. So while Voyager was the smallest of the big blowups, there was still plenty of pain to go around.  Those are relatively simple measures – dates and numbers. They suggest, very broadly, that Terra was the first and biggest of the dark horses past the post, making it a flashpoint for contagion. Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows were smaller by some measures, and came later, suggesting their failure was downstream from Terra’s.  But the causality of the crypto collapse is ultimately a lot more complicated than any straightforward timeline, or even a comparison of balance sheets. Because finance is a form of time travel.  Great expectations lead to great contagions  Do Kwon’s Terra system collapsed two weeks after CoinDesk highlighted fundamental flaws in the design of the UST “algorithmic stablecoin” (I use air quotes because there’s actually no such thing). As soon as the token began to waver from its dollar peg in early May, it was all over but the shouting.  The system had grown to such dangerous proportions for two basic reasons. First and foremost, the above-market returns promised by Terra’s Anchor system enticed many to buy the UST token for deposit there: Just a few weeks before the unwind, 72% of all UST was deposited in Anchor, meaning the 20% APR in Anchor was a major prop for the market value of both UST and the systemwide LUNA token.  It has since become clear, however, that Anchor’s returns were not actually being generated by interest on loans, but instead largely came from other sources. Those sources included venture capital investments and tokens assigned to Do Kwon’s Terraform Labs and related entities, as well as revenue generated by retail buyers of LUNA and UST. That arguably made Anchor and Terra an obfuscated Ponzi scheme.  At the same time, Do Kwon’s arrogant, venomous public persona helped keep his supporters lined up against anyone who questioned whether UST could really be magically worth $1 simply thanks to fancy math. But even as Kwon called critical analysts “retarded,” he had allegedly engaged external market makers to help prop up UST day to day. Whatever rationalization Kwon held in his own mind, UST was never actually self-balancing.  But Kwon wasn’t alone in aggressively touting his creation. A shocking number of supposed professionals across the cryptosphere invested in or speculated with his financial perpetual motion machine (including, a recent report suggests, the team at Alameda Research). Investors in turn trumpeted their faith to the public, lending the system credibility and effectively baiting individual investors to deposit into Anchor or buy LUNA. That included, most stunningly, the formerly reputable Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital, who proudly showed off a huge LUNA tattoo.  This is what I mean about things being more complicated than a simple timeline. Sure, Terra was the match that helped burn down Three Arrows and Celsius. But would Terra and Anchor have grown so big, or attracted so many direct retail deposits, without the apparent cosign of supposed experts like Novogratz? Or, for that matter, without the deposits Celsius itself parked there?  Do Kwon was an incredibly loud, bullying defender of his own incredibly bad ideas. But much like his biotech analogue Elizabeth Holmes, it was big-money investors who poured jet fuel onto his flaming ineptitude, creating a cataclysm.  Strong opinions, mostly wrong  “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.” – Proverbs 16:18  One of the things making the current downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX so unnerving is that he refrained, at least publicly, from the kind of philosophical grandstanding that is so often a red flag for bad actors. By contrast, the Four Horsemen often wore their dangerous mindsets and flawed assumptions on their sleeves.  Three Arrows CEO Su Zhu was a bit more measured and informed in his arrogance than Kwon and Mashinsky – but arguably more extreme. Zhu frequently promoted his “supercycle theory,” which posited that bitcoin in particular would continue climbing in value indefinitely. One thing Zhu seemingly missed is the role of the coronavirus pandemic in bidding up crypto, tech stocks and a variety of other financial assets in early 2020.  Three Arrows were hardly alone in this, of course – just ask anyone who lost their shirt on hot pandemic stocks like Peloton or Snapchat. But Three Arrows was so self-assured it forgot to do the “hedge” part of running a hedge fund. In fact, it did quite the opposite, levering up with all of those loans, drastically increasing the fallout when its positions went the wrong way.  Three Arrows’ downfall exemplifies the dangerous cocktail of hubris and finance. It also epitomizes a perverse and increasingly crowded pipeline from highly respected institutions into the fraudster hall of fame: Zhu and Davies first met at the hyper-elite Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, before both moving on to Columbia University. Do Kwon was a graduate of Stanford.  One is tempted to wonder exactly what’s being learned on America’s most hallowed campuses.  The finance curse  Another common thread ties together our Four Horsemen: What they were doing was not really about cryptocurrency technology, but about using finance to profit from public interest in that technology.  Zhu and Davies began Three Arrows as conventional foreign exchange traders, years before they began trading crypto. Mashinsky built what was basically an unregulated but otherwise conventional bank, hoping to profit from crypto trading and speculation. Steve Ehrlich’s past experience was running E-Trade’s professional brokerage services.  Do Kwon is the arguable exception, having built an actual blockchain. But Terra didn’t bring any new decentralization technology to the table, only financial engineering flim-flam and the same artificially inflated yields that drove growth at Celsius and Voyager. (Sam Bankman-Fried was also a creature of the finance world, emerging from the trading firm Jane Street. He frequently admitted, including on an infamous “Odd Lots” episode, that he barely cared about the substance of crypto technology – only the profits to be reaped from trading it.)  It may sound strange to level criticism at speculators and finance in an industry that’s all about reinventing money. But there’s a difference between the novelty of peer-to-peer payments and smart contracts, and the all-too-mundane impulse to gamble on the future growth of a novel technology.  In a stellar profile of Zhu and Davies in New York Magazine, my former Fortune colleague Jenn Wieczner wrote, “They built social-media cred by playing the part of billionaire financial geniuses, translated that to actual financial credit, then put billions of dollars in borrowed money to work in speculative investments they could cheerlead to success with their large, influential platforms.”  You can probably think of a few other billionaires that could easily be described, from disgraced “SPAC King” Chamath Palihapitiya to no less than Elon Musk. The rise and fall of the Horsemen, then, may say less about crypto than about much broader trends at the intersection of speculative investing and social media.  What it does say about crypto is that much of the price appreciation of the 2020-2021 bull market was an illusion, based on rehypothecation and degenerate long bets at an unprecedented scale. Those who believe in the promise of crypto technology will likely spend years digging out of a pessimistic winter before the reputational damage done by speculators wears off.

A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.  When the history of blockchain is written, one of its most defining moments will be the years-long process culminating in September, when Ethereum developers pulled off a massive upgrade to its protocol known as “the Merge.”  Switching the core of Ethereum’s blockchain mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) without any downtime was no small undertaking. It involved at least two years of testing and over 100 bi-weekly calls to maintain the $30 billion ecosystem that houses non-fungible tokens, crypto exchanges and other decentralized applications. Developers likened the task to swapping out a car’s gas engine for an electric one while speeding down the highway.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder, visionary and spiritual leader of the Ethereum ecosystem. He wrote the original white paper for Ethereum in 2014, in which he laid out the steps the blockchain would tackle in the years ahead, including the Merge.  Buterin had six years of Bitcoin’s existence to observe and improve upon. By transitioning from proof-of-work – Bitcoin’s mechanism that used miners expending enormous computing power, and therefore enormous energy, to add transactions to the digital ledger – to proof-of-stake, which instead uses validators to approve blocks to the blockchain, Ethereum would reduce its carbon footprint by 99.9%. It would also increase the security of the blockchain and allow developers to introduce scalable upgrades to the blockchain in the future.  While the vision and the basic blueprint was Buterin’s, what made the Merge an exceptionally difficult undertaking was that the Ethereum developers prioritized keeping the chain live during the switch.  “There's a much easier way to do the Merge: We shut down for three days, do the thing and flip the switch back on and it restarts,” said Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation (EF). “We probably would have saved maybe somewhere between a quarter and a third of the work. So getting this switch to happen, basically seamlessly in a way that was like incentive compatible with miners, was pretty wild.”  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain  The Merge could not have been accomplished without dozens of teams of developers, researchers and volunteers, both at Ethereum core and its clients. A client is a software that is used by the nodes operating the blockchain. The EF, a Swiss nonprofit dedicated to the building of Ethereum, coordinated the many client teams (at least nine of them with about 10-20 people per team) that built the testing, tooling and the actual proof-of-stake Beacon Chain into which the proof-of-work version of Ethereum merged. The massive undertaking involved multiple test nets, which are development versions of the blockchain to verify the soundness of the tasks. Many incremental steps had to be taken before the Merge could go ahead.  Amidst all of these contributors, here are a few key developers who took this eight-year-old idea of Buterin’s and willed it to happen, successfully pulling off the massive upgrade that took place on Sept. 15:  Tim Beiko  Beiko has been the protocol support lead at the EF since January 2021. He often leads the agenda on Ethereum’s All Core Developers Calls, a bi-weekly meetup of the network’s main engineers, and was in charge of coordinating the client teams who work with EF.  When he’s not coordinating and directing traffic for dozens of teams, Beiko decompresses by tending to and hiking with his dog, Dodam, named after a Hong Kong restaurant specializing in Korean fried chicken.  Ben Edgington  An occasional pastor (he preaches Sunday sermons at a Baptist Church from time to time), Edgington is the lead product owner at Teku, an Ethereum client built by R&D firm ConsenSys. Edgington built out the Teku product team, where he worked closely with the ConsenSys Besu team, Ethereum’s execution client.  Parithosh Jayanthi  Jayanthi has been a devops engineer at EF since December 2020, after discovering on Twitter the EF was seeking to fill the position. An avid fan of fusion music, Jayanthi pioneered the testing of the Beacon Chain and helped coordinate shadow forks, which were crucial tests that helped debug any issues that arose.  Mikhail Kalinin  Kalinin has a passion for detail and history, as evidenced by his hobby of reconstructing costumes from the 13th, 14th and 16th centuries. He is a lead researcher at ConsenSys who many developers have described as a significant driving force behind the Merge; without him, there might be no Merge. He was instrumental in designing the actual mechanism and wrote the specifications for implementing the Merge.  Marius Van Der Wijden  Even in his free time, Van Der Wijden likes to build. He enjoys Factorio, the crowdfunded video game where he builds massive virtual factories. In his day job as a software developer at EF, during the runup to the Merge Van Der Wijden wrote guides for the Consensus Layer clients so they could use their software with Geth, a client of Ethereum. He also created tools that were used during shadow forks to create bad blocks that would identify issues in some clients.  Hsiao-Wei Wang  Wang has been a researcher at EF since 2017, where she worked on sharding, a method that should help address network congestion and high gas fees by spreading transactions across databases, or “shards.” Eventually she was pulled into working on the Merge, and specifically worked on Consensus Layer specifications.  Back in August 2021, Wang famously created a meme to visually express the Merge both in concept and progress over time. A white bear (proof-of-work Ethereum) and a black bear (proof-of-stake Beacon Chain) do the Dragon Ball Z Fusion Dance, moving closer and closer until they morph into a black-and-white panda. The meme went viral and was even turned into NFT, the revenue from which she devoted in part to nonprofit animal welfare organizations.  Sajida Zouarhi  Zouarhi joined ConsenSys as a research engineer in 2017 and then became a product lead for Besu, an execution client of Ethereum, seeing the Merge build through June when most of the heavy lifting was completed. Her main priorities included working with core developers and laying out what the priorities were for the Besu client team.  A keen fan of “Star Wars” and especially the red-and-black-faced Sith warrior and schemer Darth Maul, whom she enjoys cosplaying, Zouarhi currently is a product manager at Blocknative, where she is working on Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).

Ethereum switching over from PoW to PoS was like the entire country of Finland shutting down its power grid, according to the Digiconomist. The direct impact of the event also led to a world reduction in energy consumption by 0.2%.  With the Merge accomplished, Buterin has shared a roadmap for Ethereum to next address a host of issues including security, privacy, censorship, scalability issues and more, such as sharding.  The Ethereum developers said they hope they have inspired other blockchains, such as Dogecoin, to switch to PoS. PoW chains have come under more scrutiny from regulators due to their environmental impacts. Edgington shared that the European Union “is already talking about turning off PoW, due to the energy crisis.”  “It is fair for them to have waited for Ethereum and be like, ‘this thing works.’ And now that it does, I honestly don't believe that there's a reason” they shouldn’t move over, said Beiko to CoinDesk.  To make that process easier, developers have shared their Merge resources with the rest of the world. “If someone wants to go through the Merge, they can just take that and reuse the testing infrastructure,” said Jayanthi.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/vitalik-buterin-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6633d60329b815d6ea70c042c79167878f96a3ce-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411059,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVNJ,1670242382,Zcash Doesn’t Need Your Trust,"When Zcash, the privacy-preserving protocol, forked off from Bitcoin in 2016, it was the first large-scale commercial use of zero-knowledge proofs. Since then, the team developing Zcash has continued to innovate – pushing the boundaries of computer science and cryptography.  This year has been no different. In an interview with CoinDesk, Zooko Wilcox, CEO of the company leading Zcash development, the Electric Coin Company (ECC), discussed the protocol’s much-anticipated NU5 upgrade that went live in May.  Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  The upgrade did many things – it came with a shiny new wallet and software development kit – but above all radically improved privacy across the network while reducing the amount of trust anyone needs to have in Wilcox, ECC or Zcash itself to transact anonymously.  And it couldn’t have come at a better time. In August, the U.S. Treasury Department levied unprecedented sanctions against the crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash, effectively barring U.S. users from concealing their blockchain history on Ethereum.  “This was the year the crypto industry woke up to the fact that fully transparent protocols are vulnerable. They're capturable. They're attackable. And this is what we've always believed; like, this is why we started Zcash,” Wilcox told CoinDesk.  Zcash’s 2022 overhaul saw the introduction of a new type of zero-knowledge proof system called Halo (zero-knowledge refers to a system where someone can prove they know information without revealing that information). Developed by ECC engineer Sean Bowe, Halo is said to be the first “trustless and recursive” ZKP. These are “technical terms,” Wilcox said, while removing his retainer – but it’s a big deal.  Today, almost all encrypted apps and protocols are built on top of something called a “trusted setup,” a special type of procedure where private keys are generated, including Zcash. Obviously, “trust” runs antithetical to what crypto is trying to achieve – if someone gets hold of a protocol’s key, they can compromise the entire system.  This was always the critical vulnerability at the heart of Zcash, even though the protocol’s key ceremony is legendary in cryptography circles for the lengths its six participants, spread across the globe, took to maximize security.  (As it turns out, human rights activist Edward Snowden was one of the few people involved in Zcash’s weekend-long creation, privacy advocate Naomi Brockwell reported first in CoinDesk.)  “Our previous generation of zero-knowledge proofs is pretty much the gold standard throughout the industry. A lot of the science and source code we developed has been copied and reused by almost everyone,” Wilcox said. However, no matter how trustworthy Zooko or Snowden were perceived to be, they were still partial key holders and therefore centralized points of failure that had to be eliminated.  It’s likely that Halo’s new “trustless setup” will also be widely adopted and set a new bar for encryption. The practice also solves the issue that in the distant future, some people might lose faith that some key ceremony was not compromised. Now, anyone can just crunch the math to know the system is computationally secure, without having to take Wilcox’s word for it.  “We see Zcash as a fundamental, permanent part of humanity's legacy and toolkit,” Wilcox said.  In addition to removing a gigantic attack surface on Zcash, Halo’s implementation also makes the system highly scalable by the introduction of a new kind of z-SNARK (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) called a Plonk. (ECC’s blog said the innovation here is by “allowing any amount of computational effort and data to produce a short proof that can be checked quickly.)  In the months since the upgrade was deployed, a number of projects have started using Plonk-based privacy apps – from ZK EVMs (Ethereum virtual machines) to Filecoin’s decentralized storage system and even a machine learning AI program.  Considering the “Cambrian explosion” of ZK implementations in the past half decade, and the fact the ZK-proofs were mostly an arcane, academic topic since the 1980s until recently, Zooko said he thinks the crypto industry’s continued experimentation “goes sort of unacknowledged.”  “The cryptocurrency phenomenon has unlocked an economic sustainability for all kinds of technological development,” he said, referring to token-based crowdfunding. “It's really underappreciated how the economic effect of decentralized and diverse and permissionless innovation being able to get funded without having to depend on the legacy gatekeepers and controllers.”  As it turns out, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took aim at Zcash this year for its controversial funding model and “premine” – alleging the project may be a security. This caused many of the few exchanges, like Huobi, that had listed ZEC to drop it and other privacy coins. In fact, concerns over centralized control by Zooko and ECC over Zcash have long plagued the project.  Zooko seems zen on that point. In our interview, he admitted to settling into the idea that he’s the face of the blockchain that resembles his name. “Having a recognizable spokesperson is pretty necessary,” he said. “But I think people are really oversimplifying and wrong if they think that Zcash depends on that.”",POSITIVE,ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | ZEC | ZK,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/05/zooko-wilcox-most-influential-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27d957c90d184862ade1bab309461a3317e0d49c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Regulatory frameworks for the crypto industry are critical for mainstream adoption, the report said, and a coordinated global effort is required to discourage regulatory arbitrage and to safeguard consumers and investors.  FTX’s collapse has refocused attention on the need for regulation that “creates a transparent legal framework for digital assets; fosters technological innovation; provides consumer and investor protections and mitigates financial stability risks,” the note said.  The bank noted that the top 100 crypto tokens have fallen 64% year to date, but pointed out they are still up 2,175% since the end of 2016. The cost of ignoring digital assets is high, it said.  The development of blockchains that are smart contract-enabled and applications with real-world use has accelerated this year, the report said. Speculative trading may be widespread, but it's the “underlying blockchain technology driving this speculation that could be revolutionary.”  Bank of America said that “retail and institutional disengagement” could further pressure crypto prices, but noted that digital-asset prices fell 22% between Nov. 2 and Nov. 10 before rising 6% through Nov. 25, which shows that investors may be moving on and are focused on blockchain technology’s long-term disruption potential.

First, he pointed out that Bitcoin’s MVRV value is extremely low, almost identical to previous market bottoms. Next, the price of hash has not increased since the golden cross was supposed to be achieved, hence the hash ribbon has failed. Is BTC’s price about to stage a comeback? If not, is there more suffering in store? Related Reading: ‘Digital Garbage?’ EU Throws $400,000-Metaverse Party That Only Attracted 6 People Bitcoin Price: Inconsistent Numbers The price of bitcoin (BTC) is now displaying highly inconsistent trends. As the RSI rises on the daily time frame, it appears to keep its strong bearish momentum. The expanding Bollinger band supports the bullish outlook for the future. But the current BTC price candle, which is presently trading at $17,315.01, has met a resistance that has not been breached since the price fall on November 11. In addition, a rising triangle pattern contributes to a fairly restricted trading range. Chart: TradingView The token’s RSI is overbought, indicating that bearishness persists on shorter durations. Although the EMA ribbon appears to be sustaining an upward trend, a bearish crossover could occur within the next few hours or days. As a potential trend reversal looms, BTC investors and traders should closely monitor the present market scenario. Following the recent price fluctuations, the MFI indicates a likely upcoming decline. If the bearish reversal occurs, a decline to $16,970 is conceivable. Strong bearish momentum can drive the price closer to $16,660 or higher. Mixed Opinions About Bitcoin Bitcoin clearly has bullish characteristics. Bitcoin price has been up about 5% in the last week, and some analysts expect it will tally more increases in the coming days. However, as miners and merchants continue to incur losses and reserve levels remain high, Bitcoin’s path remains challenged. The next consumper price index (CPI) numbers that will be revealed on December 13 will determine whether or not macroeconomics will boost the price of Bitcoin.

In recent days, Musk had declared war on the spam bots on Twitter. In doing so, the algorithm and the Twitter team may have been a bit too harsh. Musk Stands By For The DOGE Community Dogecoin founder Billy Markus wrote on Twitter that more than a dozen Dogecoin Twitter accounts were suspended last weekend, even though they were mainly just tweeting DOGE memes. Markus wrote that these accounts were unjustly suspended: A whole bunch of accounts of people who, as far as I know, generally don’t do anything but tweet memes and positivity are being suspended. Pretty weird man. Twitter CEO Elon Musk, who through a representative is part of the Dogecoin Foundation’s five-member advisory team alongside Markus and Vitalik Buterin, responded to the tweet within three hours. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rises: Over 60% Of Holders Continue To Profit Despite FTX Nightmare Musk wrote that his Twitter team had been a bit too aggressive with the suspension of spam bot accounts. “Team was a bit too intense with spam/bot suspensions.

5165780,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511120,1670227565,Litecoin Continues To Surge As Hash Rate Records New ATH – How About LTC Price?,"Litecoin (LTC) was among the few bright spots for the crypto market which had to endure the negative effects of the collapse of the FTX exchange platform. In the midst of one of the worst implosions that the space has ever witnessed, LTC momentarily became vulnerable, plummeting all the way down to $49.58. But the cryptocurrency stood its ground, though, while the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum were sent crashing to various monthly lows and eventually commenced its own rally to close November on a high note. As a result, Litecoin exited last month with an index price of $76.52 and registered an impressive jump of 24% within a 30-day period. The altcoin is also performing well during the first days of December. At the time of this writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, the digital coin is changing hands at $83.11, with an uptick of 10.8% in the last seven days. Related Reading: TRON Unfazed By Decreasing Volumes, Tallies $1 Billion In USDT Inflow Litecoin Has A Healthy Blockchain But Holders Failed To Make Profit Aside from the sustained surge in trading price, LTC is also witnessing positive developments in other areas. For instance, according to data shared by CoinWarz, the asset’s mining hash rate has once again hit another all-time high, peaking at 613.81 TH/s. Within four months, the Litecoin blockchain has recovered from the decline it experienced back in July, rallying by 64%. Image: Cryptotelegram Moreover, as of December 3, the DeFi network has established its highest difficulty level since going online, recording a block height of 2,379,925. The average difficulty of Litecoin blockchain translates to a value of 19.52 million according to Messari. Meanwhile, profitability was one gray area for the altcoin, as most of its holders were unable to make profit from their investment during the previous month. As of November 30, LTC had a 30-day moving average of -149,000 for its Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL). In addition, during the same time, Litecoin had a -28% Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This indicated that despite the crypto experiencing price growth, in November, some of its investors still held at a loss. Price Decline Could Happen For LTC Within Next Few Days Although LTC managed to block the effects of the crypto market meltdown that was triggered by the FTX implosion, there is a possibility that the asset may experience price correction soon. According to the forecast of online cryptocurrency information provider Coincodex, this could happen within the next five days with LTC losing almost 8% of its value to change hands at $76.33. Moreover, 30 days from now, the crypto is expected to recover a bit and trade at $80.75, although this value is also lower than the current one it has.

42414819,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBLSee,1670226681,Bitcoin Lags as Unwinding of 'Fed Trade' Lifts US Stocks Above 200-Day Average,"Unless you have been on another planet, you probably know that, since the start of 2022, selling risk assets like U.S. stocks and bitcoin (BTC) and buying the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen (JPY) have been some of the most popular macro bets.  Investors have been reassessing their commitment to these so-called hawkish Federal Reserve trades in recent weeks and piling back into risk assets, except bitcoin, thanks to the peak inflation narrative and the central bank hinting at moderation in liquidity tightening from December.  The S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, has gained 16% in less than two months to trade above the widely-tracked 200-day moving average for the first time since early April. The USD/JPY pair, often called a turbo bet on the Fed policy and U.S. rates, has dropped 11% to its 200-day moving average. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has also dropped below its 200-day average.  The U.S. government bond yields have come off sharply from the yearly highs, validating the peak inflation narrative and the resulting risk revival in equity and currency markets.  Bitcoin, however, appears to have decoupled from macroeconomic developments and traditional markets. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $17,340 or traded at a discount of 22% to its 200-day moving average.  This shows that the FTX insolvency couldn't have come at a worse time for bitcoin and the broader crypto market.  ""Historically, (U.S.) stocks and crypto have a strong relationship with each other. Without FTX implosion, bitcoin might have been trading at $29,000 by now – instead of $17,200 (or 69% higher),"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said.  ""If the market can move on from FTX, those prices could still be achieved,"" Thielen said.  Bitcoin slipped to a two-year low of $15,480 last month.  The dollar index peaked and turned lower at the end of September, having risen nearly 20% in the first nine months of the year. Following the bearish turnaround in the greenback, the S&P 500 found a bottom in mid-October.  Waning impact of FTX's insolvency  Bitcoin's recent market activity suggests the worst from FTX's insolvency may be behind us. The leading cryptocurrency rose 4% last week, even though prominent crypto lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy protection.  ""There are signs that the overhang of bad news in recent weeks is having a less pronounced impact on crypto performance, even if the full context of the uncertainty hasn't been completely priced in,"" Coinbase Institutional's weekly note said, while drawing attention to the recent moderation in the negative sentiment in the options market.  Bitcoin's one-month call-put skew, which measures the premium investors pay for out-of-the-money (OTM) calls versus OTM puts, has bounced to -9% from -29% seen on Nov. 13.  Put options offer protection against price slides, while calls offer insurance against bull runs.  The recovery suggests that the height of the fear cycle has faded. Therefore, crypto investors may now focus on the improved macro backdrop and the risk reset in traditional markets.  One question is whether the latest risk revival in traditional markets will be long-lasting, given that the U.S. economy is heading toward a recession. The situation identified by consecutive quarterly contractions in the growth rate does not sound conducive to risk assets.  However, a recession could turn out to be a blessing in disguise, according to an analysis by macro trader Geo Chen.  ""The Fed is over-tightening into a recession that has likely already started, and this will likely result in a downtrend in inflation that will be more persistent than many expect,"" Chen said in a Substack post published on Nov. 22.  ""The biggest driver of asset prices this year has been yields and inflation, so a downtrend in yields should be a tailwind for asset prices and make next year look like the mirror image of this year,"" Chen added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/05/bitcoin-lags-as-unwinding-of-fed-trades-lifts-us-stocks-above-200-day-average,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b31fcab3529f987150cd7cccecd953474d575f68-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin clung to its most recent perch comfortably above $17K as investors continue to hope for a more dovish U.S. central bank.  Insights: DeFi total value locked continued its recent rebound over the weekend.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 875.87 +12.8 ▲ 1.5% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,273 +313.7 ▲ 1.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,292 +36.1 ▲ 2.9% S&P 500 daily close  4,071.70 −4.9 ▼ 0.1% Gold  $1,819 +23.4 ▲ 1.3% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.51% ▼ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Holds Steady Over $17K  By James Rubin  Is $17,000 the new $16,000 for Bitcoin?  Will a recent uptick in investor optimism about the economy outweigh worries about the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's collapse?  Crypto markets remained noncommittal over the weekend.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading near $17,300, an almost 2% gain over the past 24 hours and consistent with its performance for the past five days.  BTC climbed above $17,000 on Wednesday and has held fast above this support following dovish remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who indicated a day later that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would likely raise interest rates 50 basis points (bps) instead of continuing its current diet of 75 bps increases. Powell noted encouraging signs that inflation and the still vibrant job market were slowing.  In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote that ""the market"" had ""responded positively to Powell's speech, although he added that ""we may want to see bitcoin consolidating above $17K and possibly testing $20K before we expect a sustained recovery.""  ""On the downside, $16K is a key support, losing which we are likely to see bitcoin trending lower,"" DiPasquale wrote.  Ether remained steadfast near $1,300, up about 3%. On Dec. 1, CoinDesk market analyst Glenn Williams noted that ether's price had outperformed bitcoin over the previous 10 days, increasing 15.4% versus BTC's 7.7% rise. Williams wrote that a so-called crossover of the ETH/BTC 10-day moving average above the 100-day moving average is often a bullish sign, although he added that the recent sample size is still too small to come to a conclusion.  Other major cryptos were largely in the green with SOL, the token of the smart contracts Solana blockchain platform, rising more than 4%, and ATOM, the token of the decentralized blockchain network, Cosmos, recently up more than 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, jumped almost 1.5%.  U.S. stock indexes traded roughly sideways on Friday after an encouraging week that saw the S&P 500 climb above its 200-day moving average for the first time since the spring. The S&P, which has a strong component, fell 0.1% on Friday but was up 1.5% for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq inched down 0.2% on Friday.  Investors will be eyeing the U.S. Commerce Department's Monday release of durable goods orders for November, with initial projections for a second consecutive 1% gain month-over-month. On Friday, the University of Michigan's widely watched consumer sentiment index is expected to tick up a few fractions of a percentage point in its preliminary December reading from the the previous month.  In a weekly note to investors, First Republic Bank noted a slowdown in manufacturing, ""showing broader economic growth is moderating,"" but also highlighted improvements in the supply chain that had lowered costs, calling the reductions ""encouraging news on the inflation front.""  Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried continued his recent tour of semi-confessional interviews, with the former FTX CEO telling The Wall Street Journal: ""I ask myself a lot how I made a series of mistakes that just don't seem dumb, they seem like the type of mistakes I could see myself having ridiculed someone else for having making.""  BitBull's DiPasquale wrote that he will be watching the impact of upcoming FTX hearings related to its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. along with the outcome of the December FOMC meeting. ""Any dovish comments then could see the market moving higher,"" he wrote of the latter.

They have watched bitcoin hover at $17,000 support after wrestling with $16,000 for large portions of November. Will it tip lower or higher in the weeks ahead?  Overlooked in the focus on pricing is the slow, steady recovery in the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Data from DeFi Llama, a DeFi aggregator for TVL, shows that TVL is trickling back to the 10 biggest DeFi protocols on Ethereum as asset prices rise.  The increase follows the implosion of TVL in Solana-based protocols in mid-November because of a lack of confidence in a platform that’s perceived as being closely tied to Sam Bankman-Fried, and due to falling asset prices.  Lido has seen its TVL increase by 3.69% during the last week, Curve is up 3%, and Compound Finance’s TVL is up by about 4.6%. Derivatives Decentralized Exchange GMX has seen its TVL rise by 6%.  The high correlation between the rise of TVL in major DeFi protocols and climbing token prices is a good thing, signaling that there’s still continued trust in DeFi, and that assets aren’t being withdrawn. Nansen data shows that protocols such as Curve.fi and dYdx have continued inflows of stablecoins during the past week.  The market’s continued confidence in DeFi is impressive, given ongoing concerns about security. Just last week another DeFi protocol, Ankr, was exploited because of shoddy code found by an attacker. Granted, Binance had frozen a significant amount of the stolen assets – but these major DeFi hacks seem to be a bimonthly occurrence.  Investors, nevertheless, appear willing to overlook such events, and instead, seem more focused on DeFi’s potential.
