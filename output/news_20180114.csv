42380243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaOT,1515928504,Don't Use a Blockchain Unless You Really Need One,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and a former editor-in-chief of American Banker.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Last month I had the plum assignment of interviewing Naval Ravikant for CoinDesk's Most Influential in Blockchain 2017 series. During our conversation, the AngelList co-founder shared an insight that I just couldn't fit into the profile, but it was pretty mind-blowing, so I'm going to lay it on you here.  Stepping back, for the last few years I've watched the cryptocurrency community's efforts to disrupt finance and, in parallel, the self-sovereign identity movement's attempt to decentralize control of personal data.  By studying the former, I've learned the importance of censorship-resistance – the inability of a third party to veto a transaction between peers. From the latter I've become familiar with the concept of data portability: the notion that consumers should be able to easily and securely transfer their records from one service to another – be it a bank, a doctor's office or a social media platform – the way they can port their mobile number when they get a new phone.  What Ravikant helped me to grok is that these two ideas are tightly related – and so the fact that both digital currency and digital identity projects are employing distributed ledgers is more than coincidence or fashion.  Because you don't use a blockchain unless you really need it.  Despite some of the hype, blockchains are ""incredibly inefficient,"" Ravikant said. ""It's worth paying the cost when you need the decentralization, but it's not when you don't.""  Walled gardens  Most CoinDesk readers are probably familiar with the usefulness of decentralization in a monetary context (and if you're not, take a look at recent articles about cryptocurrency adoption in Iran, Venezuela, Russia and, ahem, the alt-right). The neutrality, censorship-resistance and openness of a permissionless network mean it will attract the odious along with the oppressed, and the software doesn't decide which is which.  But why is decentralization worthwhile in the data use case?  ""Today, every piece of content and media you have is living somewhere owned by somebody,"" Ravikant explained. ""Your data is inside Facebook, your photos are inside a Google silo or an Apple silo.""  Then the conversation took a turn that I have to admit made me roll my eyes at first.  ""If someone creates a new Pokemon card game or a Magic the Gathering card game"" online, he continued (cue my eye-roll), the characters are ""living and owned by a certain company in a certain format. You can't just go and reuse those assets.""  This is why CryptoKitties, the app running atop ethereum that allows users to buy, collect, sell and ""breed"" unique digital pets, is more than just a goof. Although it's not a fully decentralized app, Ravikant said, it offers a glimmer of hope for such an innovation.  ""Those assets are on the blockchain and you own that kitty and anyone can show up and remix that asset,"" Ravikant said. ""They could put your CryptoKitty into a different kind of game,"" say a fighting game.  Yeah, I still thought, so what? But then Ravikant zoomed out the lens and talked about the broad implications of this seemingly trivial example.  ""Assets that normally would have been in a silo are, in a sense, censorship-resistant to developers,"" Ravikant said. ""New developers come along and as long as you, the user, agree to share your content, they can reuse your content to give you new applications.""  Hence the potential of a distributed database. ""Imagine if every mobile app shared the same database underneath, or had access to the same data, what they could do,"" Ravikant said.  And then he tied it all together.  ""All your data today is censored in terms of what boundaries it can cross and what applications it can live in,"" he said. ""These silos are a form of censorship.""  Whoa.  Better off centralized?  To be sure, Ravikant has skin in the game here (or, if you prefer to think of it this way, he's talking his book) – he was an early investor in Blockstack, a startup trying to build a new decentralized internet where users control their data. Blockstack also used CoinList, the platform Ravikant founded and spun out from AngelList, to conduct its token sale last year.  And unlike digital cash, identity is not yet a clear-cut, proven use case for blockchains. You can read some skeptical takes on the matter from some of the smartest members of the identerati here, here and here.  Some even question the need for decentralization in this context.  ""Large services that control large portions of a market gain power over individuals, but large businesses tend to stay in business longer and have more resources in case users have problems,"" noted a reporthttps://kantarainitiative.org/wp-content/plugins/email-before-download/?dl=c9b5727bc239145c8ddcd1da04bda018 last year from the blockchain and smart contracts discussion group of the Kantara Initiative, an identity trade group.  ""Further, there is a long tradition of innovation in client-side applications and centralized services meant to be employed by individuals for the purpose of their own empowerment,"" the report continued, citing PGP encryption and ad blockers as examples.  Then again, how many people do you know outside of tech circles who use PGP, or even know what it is? Heck, how many techies you know use it?  Perhaps this is revealed preference, and most people just don't care about autonomy – but wouldn't they, if they took a second to think it through?  Clearly, the cause of empowering individuals in a digital world has a long way to go, and now is hardly the time for complacency. Which is why Ravikant's vision is so captivating.  ""We're going to see a giant remixing of the internet as all the data becomes unshackled from the silo that it's in,"" he told me. In the future, he concluded, ""any data you own ... will be under your control and you'll be able to pass it into any app.""  I sure hope so.

42380254,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MadZ,1515924913,Blockchain and the Rise of Transaction Technology,"Magda Borowik is the special envoy for fintech to the Ministry of Digital Affairs of the Republic of Poland and the director of technology research at FinTech Poland.    The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      The last couple of years were owned by the 'fintech' buzzword.  From startups to investors to government programs, fintech was everywhere. But within the last year, ""regtech"" and ""govtech"" have joined the conversation. Very often, you can spot the three in a thought-provoking proximity.  But, do they have something in common?  I believe they all can be described as transaction technologies that enable the secure transfer of value online – be it monetary or non-monetary value. Alternative financial technology, the use of modern computing, and also, technology as a means for building trust, all are tools that are needed by every government.  It's no surprise then that applications are popping up in many areas – regulators and supervisors using DLT or cognitive computing, governments providing electronic payments for public services or social security. In Poland, strides have been made to harness emerging tech for digital identity, in such a way that it can be provided by the state along with banks and other institutions of trust.  Importantly, our national scheme of electronic identification is based on federated model, which means citizen's identity is not only served by the state – banks, insurers and telecom providers are able to contribute, too.  This is an important distinction as transaction technologies are defined by the use of a special type of data, data that documents an exchange, agreement or value transfer between parties.  It's a bit of information describing an event that includes the time and numerical value, and that specifies an agreement or value exchange of commercial or legal significance. Very often it relates to personal data and falls into the scope of banking secrecy.  A natural fit  In a digital dimension, all relations are transactions. Like it or not, that’s the way it is.  Administrations transact with citizens to provide them with trusted public services. They transact with businesses and governments, too. Sometimes citizens transact with government through business. Within strategic sectors, like energy or utility business, transacting is key.  In an increasingly data-focused economy, transacting data can even be said to be a special type of virtualized critical infrastructure. This is why states and businesses need to focus on assuring trusted data structures.  Blockchains and distributed ledgers, then, can be considered a tool for ensuring data integrity, immutability and trust. It does not mean we need to port everything to blockchain. But it can mean provide an additional, transaction layer to existing data structures, a robust audit trail on what happens on our critical infrastructure.  In this way, the possible role of distributed ledgers within digital state infrastructure too often goes unrecognized.  They can be a tool for licenses, rights and entitlements management. What the modern state mostly does is endorse, manage and verify ledgers of social relations; be it property titles register, ledgers of social security entitlements or identity ledgers – of who is a citizen and who can therefore participate in political dealings.  It’s a huge, important and largely under-appreciated and even overlooked function that state fulfills. Based on a social contract, the state is a large trusted entity.  How much we trust the state today is questionable, but the invention of distributed ledgers introduces a way of building a new type of institutional trust – trust in the computer code an institution operates, instead of relying only on trust in its human representatives. Human-to-machine is a new type of trust, which complements the one we traditionally put in people.  In order to progress with digitization, we need to ensure new type of digital trust, where appropriate investments are of highest priority.  Harnessing the potential  So, if distributed ledgers can act as a trust machine, what then?  The first step would be to audit our existing data resources – identifying, cleaning and structuring them in order to achieve organization. Then, a trusted transaction layer may be put on top. This means there won’t be an easy jump onto distributed ledgers for state-owned big data lakes.  Ensuring the integrity and immutability of random, inconsistent data makes no sense.  Still, within the scope of emerging transaction technologies, digitization can benefit from distributed ledgers in many aspects. Trusted data structures, arising from handling data with decentralized consensus mechanisms, can bring in additional value to many horizontal challenges, like e-commerce and legislative processes (where document version control and oversight is critical).  Ultimately, value transfer protocols and distributed ledgers may enable the functional digitization of public services, transforming the service stack together, not just rewriting each physical element to a digital twin. Particularly, if we consider value transfer protocols as digital public services, their use by the state becomes a bit more obvious.  In the coming months, governments around the globe will become more and more aware of the meaning of transaction technologies and the role they play in digitization. Having policies enabling experimentation with emerging transaction technologies will be key.  At the Ministry of Digital Affairs, Republic of Poland, we recently published a new industrial digitization strategy, in which transaction technologies are one of three key areas for growth.  Understanding requires experimenting, and experimenting is an act of humility – to acknowledge that there is no way of knowing without trying new things, making your hands dirty.  Understanding that truth is a first step, but it is important. I wish all government policymakers to act on it, in order to get well prepared for the future to come – sooner than later.
