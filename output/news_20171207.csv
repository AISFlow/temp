In a video update streamed live on Facebook, CEO and co-founder Marko Kobal provided an update to yesterday's dramatic announcement that the company, founded in 2014, had incurred a hack and subsequent theft. The news followed growing reports of emptied wallets, as well as an extended downtime period for the service's website.  According to Kobal, the attack began in the early hours of Dec. 6 after an employee's computer had been compromised. Kobal, who said that the team is working with law enforcement, explained that ""we're still conducting forensic analysis"" to determine how it happened.  Over the course of several hours, Kobal said, those behind the theft gained access to their systems, and that at 3:34 am CET began to siphon off funds from the company's accounts. As reported yesterday, a wallet address circulated by users showed approximately 4,736.42 BTC being held – an amount worth approximately $78.3 million according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  As of press time, the funds are still being held in the address in question.  Kobal went on to say he couldn't provide additional details, though he added that the attack appears to be ""incredibly coordinated and highly sophisticated attack."" He said the company would release additional details on possible recovery methods in the future.  ""We are doing everything we can right now. However, this will take time,"" Kobal said.

According to a press releasehttp://www.selec.org/p667/29+May+2017  dated May 19 from the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC), a regional organization comprised of 12 member states including Bulgaria, a total of 213,519 bitcoins were seized that month. Twenty-three Bulgarian nationals were arrested during the operation, and officials said at the time that the arrests and subsequent asset seizures followed an investigation into an alleged customs fraud scam.  As of press time, the amount seized is worth approximately $3.3 billion, at a price of roughly $15,524, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Authorities commented at the time:  ""The offenders choose the bitcoin way of investing/saving the money, because it is rather difficult to be tracked and followed.""  They further alleged that those involved developed a virus which was used to hack into Bulgarian Customs computers, allowing the perpetrators to skip paying fees when transporting goods into the country. The virus was uploaded to government machines by bribed agents, according to the release.  In all, the alleged perpetrators avoided paying some 10 million leva (Bulgaria's national currency), worth roughly $6 million.  What remains unclear at this time is what the Bulgarian government is doing with the seized bitcoins.  According to a report from Bivol.bg from Nov. 28, the Bulgarian government declined to release further details, citing an ongoing criminal investigation.  Notable in the May 19 release is a notation that, at the time it was published, a single bitcoin was worth $2,354. The release stated that the total amount seized was worth $500 million – less than one-sixth of its current value today.

Playkey, based in Russia, has built a network of servers that allow machines to offload much of the computing to the cloud, so slower machines can run high-quality games. To recruit even more devices to the network, the company has closed a $10.5 million initial coin offering, in the form of 23,665 ether and 221 bitcoins. It raised an additional $3.9 million in a presale, according to a spokesperson.  The proceeds will be put ""toward developing Playkey’s decentralized blockchain based P2P model as well as expanding into the American and Asian markets,” CEO Egor Gurjev said in a press release. He added:  ""Raising over $10 million in a couple of months was a challenge, but it was also proof of the quality of our product and our company’s performance.""  Playkey created a fixed supply of 100,000,000 ERC20 tokens called ""PKT,"" 60 percent of which were available for sale. Uncharted Capital, Allrise and G2H2 Capital each bought more than $1 million in tokens, according to the release.  People and companies that own gaming-ready processing systems will be able to put them on the Playkey network and earn tokens for running the processing for gamers' play, allowing gamers to keep their existing devices while playing games with much higher recommended minimum processing power.  Playkey is not the first company in this niche. In 2014, gaming giant Square Enix launched Shinra, which also off-loaded processing to the cloud, but the project was discontinued in 2016.  Playkey's existing service runs on a network of 120 Nvidia grid-powered servers. By decentralizing, the company will be able to get more servers onto its network, supporting more players in more parts of the world.  Chief Technology Officer Alexey Lykov said in the release, “At first the tokens will be used to pay for playtime on the service, but eventually they will also be used to make in-game purchases.""  The platform currently supports games such as Grand Theft Auto: V, Bioshock: Infinite, Skyrim and EVE: Online, according to Techcrunch.

42428232,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6ehh,1512668109,Apple Patent Filing Hints at Blockchain Use,"A new patent application from U.S. electronics giant Apple points to the potential use of blockchain within a prospective system for creating and verifying timestamps.  In an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, Apple details a program able to certify timestamps by combining aspects of blockchain technology with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) tools.  The use case in question involves tying a piece of information to a particular transaction on a blockchain, establishing the state of that data at a particular point in time. Should that information be changed, additional transactions can be created that detail changes to the data.  Apple's application describes three possible methods for establishing timestamps, with one of these scenarios centering around a blockchain platform.  The program would generate a block containing a timestamp, with every subsequent block being added as miners verify each transaction conducted on the chain. This system is part of what Apple is calling a ""multi-check architecture,"" meaning that another system would confirm the timestamp after the block is generated but before it is added to the chain.  According to the application, Apple would consider using a blockchain due to the decentralized security features it offers.  As the document notes:  “If any party attempts to alter a node some time earlier in the blockchain, each hash puzzle solution for block subsequent to the altered block becomes broken or incorrect. Each participant can see that such a broken blockchain does not agree with their own copy of the blockchain. The broken blockchain is thus not recognized by the nodes.”  The benefit of using a decentralized ledger to store timestamps is two-fold, according to the application. Not only can the proper time be maintained permanently, it states, but the network is also protected from corruption if a single node is compromised by malicious actors.

In some cases, the differences amount to more than $2,000 in value, particularly among some of the most voluminous exchanges.  On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, for example, the price of bitcoin is trading above $18,259.00 as of press time. This value represents a significant premium over the price currently being reported on Bitfinex, where bitcoin is trading at $15,592.  At the same time, it's a considerable amount less than the prevailing price on Bithumb, South Korea's most voluminous exchange, and local exchanges Coinone and Korbit, all of which are seeing prices above $19,000 (denominated in the won, the country's national currency).  Additional data from CoinMarketCap highlights the price disparities, though it seems that a number of the top-10 exchanges are seeing prices below $16,000, including Bitstamp, Gemini and HitBTC.  Coinbase isn't alone in seeing bitcoin prices above $16,000. Japan-based bitFlyer is reporting bitcoin prices at $16,719.40 as of press time, while BitMEX is trading at roughly $17,200.  The varying prices come as bitcoin's value surges to new highs.

In an open letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Futures Industry Association (FIA) chief executive Walt Lukken said members of the organization are worried about their exposure to bitcoin's price swings as a result of these contracts. The group boasts more than 15,000 members and counts some of Wall Street's biggest institutions among its ranks.  ""The recent volatility in these markets has underscored the importance of setting these levels and processes appropriately and conservatively,"" Lukken wrote.  Members of the FIA guarantee customers' trades and contribute to guarantee funds set up to cover instances where a company is unable to pay out its contracts.  In the letter, Lukken said FIA members are concerned that they will have to pay for any outstanding contracts caused by price changes in bitcoin, rather than the groups which are actually selling the futures products.  He wrote:  ""A public discussion should have been had on whether a separate guarantee fund for this product was appropriate or whether exchanges put additional capital in front of the clearing member guarantee fund.""  Lukken continued to note that, while CME and CBOE technically followed legal procedures detailing self-certified contracts, they should have taken a more extended approach due to bitcoin futures not being a standard product.  A public discussion would have allowed FIA members to conduct tests of their own in anticipation of insuring these contracts, he argued.  ""We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based,"" he wrote, also asking whether the companies offering the products can protect their customers from ""manipulation, fraud, and operational risk.""

IOTA exploded earlier this week, likely due to a newly announced partnership with Microsoft, Samsung and others for the launch of a data marketplace for the internet of things.  The cryptocurrency, which was trading below $1 around 10 days ago, jumped more than 450 percent to hit a new lifetime high of $5.55 yesterday. That move erased previous record highs near $1.10 set on Aug. 17, and caused IOTA to jump up to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization on the CoinMarketCap rankings.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is at $3.50. Also as per CoinMarketCap, IOTA has depreciated by 26.17 percent in the last 24 hours. While the decline may look staggering, when compared to the 450 percent rally, the 33 percent drop feels nothing more than a good old technical correction.  Furthermore, the price chart analysis points to $2.50 as the new base for the cryptocurrency.  IOTA chart  The above chart shows:  IOTA tested the support of the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally ($3.12).  The relative strength index shows overbought conditions, and is close to breaching the rising trend line to the downside.  The stochastic has turned lower from the overbought territory.  The 5-MA and 10-MA are curled in favor of the bulls.  View  IOTA prices may test $2.55 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in the next 24–48 hours (as the RSI and stochastic have turned lower from the overbought territory), but the support may hold, courtesy of the upward sloping 10-MA (seen sloping upwards towards the $2.50–$2.60 region tomorrow).  Clearly, the base has shifted higher to $2.50 levels and it appears the rally is here to stay. Going forwards, a solid rebound from near $2.50 levels could translate into a rally to fresh record highs above $5.55 levels.

42428241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6erh,1512653427,Cat Fight? Ethereum Users Clash Over CryptoKitties,"Ethereum users are calling for a solution to the protocol's CryptoKitties invasion.  As profiled by CoinDesk, the cat-trading game had grown so popular earlier this week that it was clogging the ethereum network, slowing down transaction times. Now, however, congestion is reaching unprecedented levels, with a record-breaking 30,000 transactions stuck and waiting to be processed at press time.  ""Can we please increase the gas limit?"" pleaded one user on a Reddit thread, itself a chorus of agreement on the issue.  ""Is the blockchain completely frozen?"" asked another user.  Indeed, despite facilitating nearly $7 million-worth of ether trades and winning new users to the platform, the game is attracting a level of vitriol: ""Fuck cats. When will they solve this problem? I have been waiting for 20 hours now,"" said another user on ethereum's Gitter channel.  That's not to say there aren't ways to relieve the issue, and, so far, arguably the most likely solution is increasing the network's ""gas limit"" – a metric that puts a cap on the number of transactions and smart contracts that can happen across the network.  Christian Reitwiessner, an Ethereum Foundation engineer and the co-founder of scaling protocol, Truebit, is one developer who agrees this approach might be an easy solution.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The miners raising the block gas limit is the only short-term solution against our new feline overlords for now.""  Not so easy?  Yet, while that's good news for beleaguered users who haven't been shy about their frustrations, it turns out that the change could have unpleasant side effects, making some developers more hesitant to embrace the concept as the best path to a quick fix.  Helping the cause is that there's already precedent for the approach.  For example, this wouldn't be the first time ethereum has become overcrowded and the network has fallen back on making adjustments to the gas limit. In the past, miners (the stakeholders that have control over setting this cap) have followed developer recommendations to do so.  Earlier this year, popular initial coin offerings (ICOs) led to a glut of transactions on the network and developers encouraged miners to raise the gas limit by about 33 percent.  But according to Ethereum Foundation developer Nick Johnson, increasing the gas limit again ""isn't likely to be practical"" today.  Johnson told CoinDesk that raising the gas limit could also boost the so-called ""uncle"" rate, where blocks are added to the blockchain temporarily but later rejected. Currently, the uncle rate on ethereum is around 30 percent of blocks, and he believes a further increase could be to the detriment of security, since users could interact based on transactions that will later be rejected.  The operator of ethereum's largest mining pool, Ethpool, drew the same conclusion.  ""Increasing the gas limit will likely make the current situation even worse,"" a spokesperson for the pool said on social media, adding:  ""Without substantial improvements ... I don't think increasing the gas limit further is feasible right now.""  The arguments are uncannily reminiscent of the debates raging over bitcoin scaling. Similar to the way many bitcoin users and businesses have argued for a block size increase, ethereum users are requesting a gas limit increase so as not to ruin the user experience of quick, inexpensive transactions.  Meanwhile, developers of bitcoin, and now ethereum, argue other long-term scaling solutions are best, but could take some time.  Short-term solutions  Indicating the complexity of the situation, CryptoKitties' head of community, Benny Giang, hasn't yet taken a stance on the gas issue, saying the firm trusts miners to ""do what's best for the network.""  ""We obviously don't want them to do anything that will compromise the value of the network,"" Giang added.  That said, developers haven't told miners to increase the gas limit yet, and instead, they're brainstorming other short-term solutions.  Johnson suggested that ""performance improvements"" might help reduce the uncle rate, even if the gas limit were raised. However, he added that those measures would require clients develop and release new software, which could take time.  Others argued that users could always increase the fees added to their transactions, which would push them through faster. But already, it costs $1 to initiate a transaction to make simple things happen within the CryptoKitties game, and users are likely to be turned off by higher costs.  Still, while this is all up for discussion, it's possible a temporary solution could come by on its own.  Believing CryptoKitties can't sustain its current level of interest forever, Reitwiessner said he believes the best route might be to accept it as a short-term issue.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There has to be a point where the cat supply can satisfy the cat demand (I can't believe I'm writing these words), and this will probably crash the cat prices and thus, also the interest in the game.""

42428250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6f9h,1512648904,"$15,000: Is There a Limit to Bitcoin's Meteoric Rally?","Bitcoin's stellar run continues with prices leaping one major psychological hurdle after another.  At 11:00 UTC today, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value reached a new lifetime high of $15,058, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). In the last 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated by more than $2,000. As per CoinMarketCap, gains are close to 19 percent over the same period.  Prices have since dropped back slightly and stand at $14,562 at press time  The primary theory about the astonishing rally being put forward by investors on social media is that bitcoin is pricing in the entry of big institutional money via the introduction of the first BTC futures products.  Both CBOE Global Markets and CME Group are set to launch the new futures contracts on Dec. 10 and Dec. 17, respectively. With the notable shift in the industry, bitcoin may remain well bid at least until Sunday's listing of BTC futures on the CBOE.  That said, the technical chart studies show BTC could face immediate resistance at around $16,194.  Chart 1 (Fibonacci)  The above chart shows:  The 127.2 percent Fibonacci extension of the rally from the November low stands at $16,194 levels. The next big resistance is lined up at $18,261 (161.8 percent Fibonacci extension) and $18,399.50 (261.8 percent Fibonacci extension of the rally from the September low).  On the downside, support is seen at $12,476.51 (161.8 percent Fibonacci extension of the rally from the September low).  5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are sloping upwards, suggesting any corrective pullback is likely to be short-lived.  The RSI and stochastic indicate overbought conditions.  Bitcoin could easily extend the rally to $16,194 levels in the next few hours. But, while the investor community is mostly happy to see the cryptocurrency heading for the moon, as indicated by comments on social media, there is growing discomfort with the pace of the ascent.  Still, today, the recipe for a notable technical correction is absent. History shows that bitcoin usually suffers big sell-offs following confirmation of a bearish RSI divergence. Yet, the charts show no such development so far.  Chart 2 (RSI, stochastic)  In the past  , bitcoin has suffered pullbacks when the RSI and stochastic turned lower from the overbought territory (see circles on chart). Currently, both indicators show overbought conditions, yet are still rising.  View  Bitcoin could extend gains to $16,194 and possibly even further.  A pullback to $11,000 cannot be ruled out, but dips below the upward sloping 10-day MA of $11,500 are likely to be short-lived.  As of now, a significant correction is unlikely and could be seen only on confirmation of a bearish price-RSI divergence and/or if RSI and stochastic move lower from the overbought territory.

Speaking to CNBC, Greenspan compared bitcoin to that of an early American form of money called ""Continental currency"" that came into use in 1775 and had become worthless by 1782. The paper-based legal tender was used at the time of the American Revolution and was not backed by a commodity such as gold.  Noting that bitcoin will likely suffer similar fate, Greenspan said that a ""significant share"" of Continental currency was still used to create ""real goods and services,"" even though it had no ultimate worth.  He continued:  ""Bitcoin is really a fascinating example of how human beings create value, and is not always rational ... It is not a rational currency in that case.""  Greenspan's comments come as the value of a bitcoin is soaring beyond most expectations, having gained thousands of dollars in value in the last two days. At press time, a bitcoin is worth over $15,000, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.

It was in April 2016 that Steam, operated by game developer Valve, confirmed a long-rumored move by accepting bitcoin through a partnership with payment processing BitPay. At the time, the decision to take bitcoin was positioned as a way to serve emerging markets where payment options like credit cards may not be widely available.  Now, as of Dec. 6, the company will no longer accept payments in the cryptocurrency due to a mixture of high fees and volatility in the price of bitcoin. Specifically, the company pointed to elevated payment costs in recent months for its customers, who can use the Steam platform to purchase and play a variety of games.  The company explained:  ""For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of bitcoin itself drops dramatically.""  The post outlined how, in some cases, customers would send funds only to come up short due to the U.S. dollar conversion. When asked to send an additional transaction to cover the difference, that user would then be hit with another fee.  As a result, the bitcoin payment option has become ""untenable"" for Steam, with the company promising to ""continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.""  At the same time, Steam suggested that it could move to accept the cryptocurrency in the future.  ""We may re-evaluate whether bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date,"" the post explained.

42428230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6eZh,1512630017,Blythe Masters: ASX Blockchain Embrace 'Precedent Setting',"Would ASX upgrade?  After months of waiting, the markets finally have an answer, as the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), the nation's largest domestic stock exchange, has officially revealed it will upgrade its post-trade settlement system, CHESS, using a blockchain platform designed by startup Digital Asset.  Long considered one of the front-runners in the race to prove blockchain tech's benefits for global financial infrastructures, the startup headed by former head of global commodities at JPMorgan Blythe Masters had already raised $110 million from a diverse set of industry leaders to prove out the use case.  But despite months and years of trials, what remained to be seen was whether the promise of moving a major global securities exchange to a shared, distributed ledger was worth the cost. And if ASX is to be believed, that's precisely the case, with the company calling the costs ""marginal.""  That hurdle now behind, what happens next could be the large-scale migration of financial infrastructures to a distributed ledger, according to Masters.  In interview with CoinDesk, Masters said the decision not only proves the technology but proves it's ready for the most daunting enterprise challenges.  ""It's absolutely a precedent-setting event,"" she said, adding:  ""It's the first time that distributed ledger technology has been given a validation by a major systemically important market infrastructure whose standards from an enterprise point of view are as exacting as they can be.""  Background and future  Yet it's perhaps all the more impressive as the effort to replace ASX’s Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS for short, began long before blockchain was even on the company's radar.  In fact, ASX had already set out to upgrade its aging system by the time it first met with Digital Asset in 2015, according to ASX CEO Dominic Stevens, speaking at the press event last night. But with the advent of distributed ledger technology, the potential to not only upgrade the system but create entirely new services became a serious point of interest to the exchange.  By using a similar payment messaging system as is currently in place, but anonymized and accounted for on a distributed ledger, a wide range financial products that rely on automated settling can now be created, Stevens said.  To enable that functionality, ASX partnered with Digital Asset and even become one of its early investors, and in remarks yesterday, Stevens indicated the company is increasing its commitment to the startup.  In a move that stands to help offset some of ASX’s own expenses if the technology is widely adopted, the exchange is opting to take up its pro-rata right to participate in Digital Asset's recent Series B financing.  According to a statement provided to CoinDesk, the total amount raised by Digital Asset to date after that investment is now over $115 million, making the additional fund worth about $5 million based on the previously reported numbers.  Toward implementation  Going forward, the CHESS platform will be upgraded to serve what Stevens called ASX’s $1.5 trillion-$2 trillion securities business, with a possible implementation on the exchange’s $2 trillion cash debt market at some point in the future (though he added that was not currently being discussed).  Still, any move is likely to create a shake-up elsewhere in finance, as other stock exchanges haven’t exactly been lying in wait with their own blockchain research.  Nasdaq, for example, has taken a leading role in moving private stocks to a blockchain, TMX Group has launched a beta for trading natural gas and many other exchanges have experimented to a lesser degree innovating on the edges of their operations.  However, before any of that can happen, ASX needs to further prepare the Digital Asset platform for live trades. To do that, the exchange plans to engage in what Stevens described as ""deep consultation"" with its stakeholders over the next four months in an effort to built a toolkit of ""potential advancements"" in settlement services enabled by distributed ledger technology.  By March 2018, the exchange intends to present the full scope of the project as a result of this discussion, a more exact timeline and final launch plans to the public.  Speaking at the press event, Steven said:  ""Updating a system like this is a big undertaking, it only happens once every 15 or 20 years so we need to make sure it’s future-proofed.""

42428240,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6eth,1512615638,Bank of America Wins Patent for Crypto Exchange System,"Bank of America may be looking into cryptocurrency exchange services for its corporate clients – or at least keeping its options open should they become interested.  In a patent awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, the second-largest bank in the U.S. outlined a potential cryptocurrency exchange system that would convert one digital currency into another. Further, this system would be automated, establishing the exchange rate between the two currencies based on external data feeds.  The patent describes a potential three-part system, where the first part would be a customer’s account and the other two would be accounts owned by the business running the system. The user would store their chosen cryptocurrency through the customer account.  The second account, referred to as a ""float account,"" would act as a holding area for the cryptocurrency the customer is selling, while the third account, also a float account, would contain the equivalent amount of the cryptocurrency the customer is converting their funds to.  That third account would then deposit the converted funds back into the original customer account for withdrawal.  The proposed system would collect data from external information sources on cryptocurrency exchange rates, and use this data to establish its own optimal rate.  The patent notes this service would be for enterprise-level customers, meaning that if the bank pursues this project, it would be offered to businesses.  According to the patent:  ""Enterprises may handle a large number of financial transactions on a daily basis. As technology advances, financial transactions involving cryptocurrency have become more common. For some enterprises, it may be desirable to exchange currencies and cryptocurrencies.""  The proposed system could also evaluate transactions for potential illicit trades, calculating a risk score based on the amount of cryptocurrency being transferred and any other information available, according to the patent.  Transactions which look illegal would not be allowed to process, the patent says.  Bank of America has been looking into cryptocurrencies for years, filing another patent in 2014 to create a cryptocurrency-powered wire transfer system.  That system would allow users to transfer funds by converting the sender's local currency into a cryptocurrency, sending it to a foreign exchange, and then converting it to the destination country's currency.

The second-best performing asset during the trading period (trailing only the largely unknown crypto asset TRON), bitcoin's strong upward move caps 24 hours in which its price climbed by over 20 percent across global exchanges, rising $2,000 in the process according to CoinMarketCap.  Data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) shows the price of bitcoin was just under $12,000 at 1:00 UTC on Wednesday, before climbing to $14,000 today. With the run-up, however, bitcoin has set a new all-time high of $14,097 on the BPI.  Speaking to the development, crypto hedge fund manager Alex Sunnarborg, of Tetras Capital, reported the likely culprit is a fear-of-missing-out now ensnaring both long-time market observers as well as new investors as the cryptocurrency prepares for its debut in futures products next week.  ""People who had bitcoin and went into alts are going back into bitcoin,"" he remarked.  And there were some big losses in cryptocurrencies that provide weight to Sunnarborg's comments. During the night-time trading session, BitShares, Siacoin, Einsteinium, MaidSafeCoin and MonaCoin all saw near-10 percent losses, and of the top 20 assets, according to CoinMarketCap, just three had posted 24-hour gains.  Still, that's not to say the market wasn't up on the day. Data shows the total value of all cryptocurrenices is now nearing $400 billion, up from just under $10 billion at the start of 2017.
