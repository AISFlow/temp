Not Risking It Concerns about the Russo-Ukrainian war continue. The U.S. inflation struggles at a four-decade high and Fed rate hike fears prevail. The uncertainty extends to the world economy as a recession is expected instead of a recovery. The IMF&apos;s managing director Kristalina Georgieva called it &apos;a crisis on top of a crisis.&apos; &apos;The war is a supply shock that reduces economic output and raises prices. Indeed, we forecast inflation will accelerate to 5.5 percent in advanced economies and to 9.3 percent in emerging European economies excluding Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. &apos; The IMF stated last week. Reuters recently quoted Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann, who talked in a note about the factors that have &apos;lent buoyancy to gold in recent days,&apos; mentioning the &apos;strong buying interest on the part of ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) investors&apos; and news about the Ukraine war. &apos;Russia appears to be preparing to launch a major offensive in the east of the country - that is generating considerable demand for gold as a safe haven,&apos; the analyst said.

Unlike Hashflow, most prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platforms use automated market makers (AMM) to facilitate trades, but larger AMM trades can lead to high slippage, which is when the price of a token changes while a swap is in progress.  With Hashflow, “you're basically requesting a quote from someone who has done price discovery off-chain, so as a result, you're able to essentially get better prices,” Hashflow founder Varun Kumar told CoinDesk.  Hashflow will enable native-to-native swaps, meaning users will not rely on problem-prone cross-chain bridges and won’t receive “wrapped” versions of tokens when they swap across chains.  Hashflow’s cross-chain trading feature is currently in Alpha mode and will support swaps involving Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Arbitrum and Polygon at launch.",POSITIVE,BNB,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ARB | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/27/defi-trading-platform-hashflow-introduces-bridgeless-cross-chain-swaps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2072f6cc580a3fd7c3ec5c7496e2468c225f85bb-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Should you add more as the new bull run starts? Key technical points: The APE price action forms a symmetrical triangle pattern. The price trades under all the crucial EMAs. The 24-hour trading volume of Apecoin is $1.60 Million, reflecting a fall of 20%. Past Performance of APE The APE coin price shows a remarkable rise of 40% in the last week resulting in a rising converging wedge in the 4-hour chart. Within the rising pattern, a rounding bottom breakout is observed with a neckline at $19.35. Hence, a price jump to the resistance trendline is highly likely in the upcoming sessions. Source-Tradingview APE Technical Analysis The increase in trading volume supports the APE price jump, indicating a solid underlying bullishness. Moreover, the breakout of the resistance trendline will boost the bull run above the $20 mark. The rising trend of the crucial EMAs maintains a bullish alignment increasing the chances of an uptrend continuation.

50238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=489035,1651100442,"Bitcoin Futures Basis Nears One-Year Lows, How Will This Affect BTC?","In late March/early April, the bitcoin futures basis had mounted an impressive recovery that pushed sentiment back into the positive. This had come after months of a declining futures basis, so this recovery was a welcome development in the market. This would prove to be short-lived, however, as the futures basis had taken a sharp nosedive in mid-April. Now, it is falling towards one-year lows, leaving in its wake a trail of wary investors. Nearing One-Year Lows Bitcoin&apos;s drop back into the $30,000 has had a profound impact on the futures basis. As investor sentiment had turned largely negative, the basis had lost the majority of the gains it had made at the end of March. The decline did not stop there though as the basis has now broken towards one-year lows. Related Reading | Bitcoin 401k?

It had come after major liquidations had pushed retail traders to try to recover losses by shorting the market. The futures basis had fallen this low again on February 18th this year.

42374823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2uRh,1651099142,First Mover Asia: Indian Crypto Exchanges' Trading Volume Continues to Dive Following New Tax Law; Cryptos Higher,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Major cryptos took a turn upward but whether prices continue in the same direction is questionable.  Insights: Trading volumes on leading Indian crypto exchanges have plunged since the introduction of new taxes.  Technician's take: BTC remains in a tight trading range, with a loss of upside momentum.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39,207 +2.2%  Ether (ETH): $2,887 +1.9%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +4.9% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH +2.7% Currency Bitcoin BTC +2.0% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE −1.9% Currency Polygon MATIC −0.5% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP −0.4% Currency  Bitcoin, ether take a short turn for the better  Once more, without conviction.  After five days of wayward performances, bitcoin finally took a turn upward, but analysts questioned whether the latest rally would have any staying power amid a predictably disappointing start to quarterly earnings, monetary hawkishness and macroeconomic precariousness.  Bitcoin appears to be ""falling out of the window, but latching onto the windowsill,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just over $39,200, up over 2% over the last 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $2,880, a more than 1.9% gain over the same period. Trading volume and volatility remained at low levels as investors continued to grapple with the toxic combination of rising prices and uncertainty.  Other major cryptos were mostly in the green, albeit not by much, although a big improvement over the previous day when a number of them plunged. On Wednesday, ATOM was among the brightest spots, rising more than 5% at one point. The increase came after Evmos, the EVM-Compatible Cosmos Chain, said that it was relaunching with new tools for users looking to claim airdropped tokens.  Crypto prices dovetailed with major equity markets, which broke a recent losing streak to post small gains. Gold, a traditional safe-haven investment fell over 1% amid the at-least temporary move to riskier assets.  Quarterly earnings among many big brands continued to disappoint. Facebook parent Meta (FB) fell short on its projections for revenue and earnings per share for its first quarter, and the social media giant posted a nearly $3 billion loss on its augmented/virtual reality unit. Meta shares have fallen over 40% since January.  Bad news continued to flow from Ukraine, where the Russian military bludgeoned major Ukraine cities and cut off gas exports to former Soviet Union satellites Poland and Bulgaria, threatening to widen the conflict.  Still, some crypto observers were optimistic about a more permanent rebound in digital asset markets.  ""If you zoom out, there's some good, positive factors and tailwinds hitting the industry,"" Chris Perkins, president of CoinFund, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""We're seeing that crypto markets have been resilient among some other payments in the tech sector. We're seeing strong trends from a policy perspective. We're seeing the left and right coming together and agreeing that we need to have really strong, principle-based policy.""  Perkins added: ""I talk to traditional investment managers all the time. When I left finance, they were all trying to get [into crypto], but now they're trying to get in even faster.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,183 +0.2%  DJIA: 33,301 -0.1%  Nasdaq: 12,488 -.01%  Gold: 1,885 -1.1%  Insights  Tough times for Indian exchanges  Indian crypto exchanges have seen trading volumes slump some 60% since new regulations around the rising sector kicked into force earlier this month, as per local reports and data from tracking tools.  WazirX and CoinDCX, two Mumbai-based exchanges, recorded volumes of just over $27 million in the past 24 hours. For WazirX, this is a steep haircut from average daily trading volumes of above $90 million before the new regulations took effect. Volumes on ZebPay, among the country’s oldest exchanges, hover around $12 million.  India, which has taken something of an anti-crypto stance, levied a 30% tax on profits from crypto transactions on April 1 and said it won’t allow offsetting gains with losses from other crypto transactions. Local crypto volumes dropped almost immediately afterward.  For several crypto investors, a 30% tax represents a steep cut into profits. In a country where the average monthly wage is just $437, every penny paid in taxes is a hefty blow to budding investors.  Indians have taken to social media to express their displeasure. The #reducecryptotax hashtag on Twitter has been trending in the country among crypto circles, with some stating hefty taxes can even lead to an exodus of talent.  “For lot of us, blockchain or #bitcoin is Plan B,” Sathvik Vishwanath, founder of local exchange Unocoin, tweeted on Wednesday. “The industry is giving opportunities in India like developed countries give. Govt should not curtail this through unfair taxes. #reducecryptotax.”  Meanwhile, some expect the drop in volumes to be short term.  ""AAX exchange has seen an outflow of active Indian users within the past weeks, as well,” Anton Gulin, regional director of AAX crypto exchange, told CoinDesk in an email earlier this month. “However, I believe that the tax rate may be revised to attract more taxpayers, as this is the ultimate goal for any government.”  Technician's take  Bitcoin Bounces From $37K Support; Resistance at $40K-$43K  Bitcoin (BTC) held support at $37,500 following a 5% decline over the past week.  Selling pressure appears to be stabilizing over the short term, although upside momentum could slow around the $40,000-$43,000 resistance zone.  BTC was trading around $39,000 at press time and is up by 2% over the past 24 hours. Buyers will need to keep prices elevated above $40,000 in order to sustain the recovery phase.  Still, there has been a slight loss of upside momentum over the past few days, which means BTC will likely remain in a tight trading range until a breakout or breakdown is confirmed. For now, most technical indicators are neutral.

The price of Ethereum is up 2.5% in early trading and appears to be heading back to $3,018.55, recouping Tuesday&apos;s losses. Ethereum May Recover The price of Ethereum was stung by dismal earnings from Alphabet, Wall Street&apos;s favorite tech stock, with Youtube losing market share to Tik Tok. Investors quickly rebalanced and reevaluated the situation, eventually shrugging off the news this morning because earnings are still strong, and no substantial reports on future losses were released. As a result of the spillover fall from Alphabet&apos;s disappointment, the price of Ethereum is ripe for the taking, trading in the ASIA PAC open at a juicy discount just below $2,800.00.

Will bulls surpass the resistance, or will the prices fall under market correction? Key technical points: The SHIB price action forms a symmetrical triangle pattern. The price trades under all the crucial EMAs. The 24-hour trading volume of Shiba Inu is $689 Million, reflecting a fall of 25%. Past Performance of SHIB The bear market triggered the 15% correction over the past two weeks and helped stabilize the coin near the dynamic trendline of support. However, a potential reversal of this support would push up the SHIB price 12.5 percent higher, bringing it to the overhang resistance. Source-Tradingview SHIB Technical Analysis With each reversal, the SHIB price range narrows, which indicates that the triangle&apos;s breakout is getting close. However, a symmetrical triangle has an opportunity for a dual side breakout which means that traders need to be patient for the perfect signal. The falling trend of the crucial EMAs starting after the flattish move increases the chances of a death cross.

Speaking at the FT Digital Asset Summit, David Raw, FCA co-director of consumer and retail policy, said that while the U.K. Treasury was enamored with “the exciting opportunities"" of attracting crypto firms, his agency was focused on the risks. ""I think perhaps traditionally or perhaps a little too much the FCA has been on the other side,"" he said. ""Anything about corporate risks and market integrity risks to financial stability risks.""  ""I think what we need to do [is] develop a balanced regulatory approach,"" Raw added.  The U.K. Treasury recently announced it wants the country to be a crypto hub, and promised the release of a policy package with the help of the FCA, the Bank of England and the Payments Systems Regulator.  The U.K.'s crypto sector is booming and, in terms of crypto job advertisements, ranks second after the U.S., according to a 2022 report based on data from job site Glassdoor. As of March 10, there were 954 jobs advertised in the crypto field in the U.K., while the U.S. had 3,893 jobs for hire in that sector.

42411797,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5fu,1651094170,What Are PFP NFTs?,"If you’ve read or seen the term PFP NFTs, you might have thought someone’s cat walked across the keyboard. But no, that alphabet soup has a meaning: We are talking about profile picture (PFP) non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The abbreviation refers to the popular use of these NFTs as literal profile pictures on social media sites like Twitter. You may have seen celebrities showcase their Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT as their profile picture, for instance. But social media profile pics are just part of a larger ecosystem based on digital image-based NFTs.  How PFP NFTs started  The idea of NFTs representing digital avatars was inspired by a project called CryptoPunks, created by duo Matt Hall and John Watkinson in 2017. Their company, Larva Labs, created thousands of randomly generated pixel art images of stylized people (Punks) and marketed unique crypto tokens to denote their ownership. The Punks seemed to have fun personalities to which the owners could relate. The supply and the designs of the Punks are fixed forever; some designs are duplicates, others appear many times across the collection. The most valuable and rare are truly unique.  Hall and Watkinson created Ethereum tokens to denote ownership of the CryptoPunks. These were the early versions of NFTs. Initially, they were just standard ERC-20 tokens with some adjustments. For instance, the creators made it impossible to trade fractions of the tokens. CryptoPunks and similar projects have since helped pave the way for a standardized NFT token called ERC-721, suited to the functions that make NFTs different from other crypto tokens.  The success of CryptoPunks gave rise to a series of other projects inspired by it. Hall and Watkinson went on to create Meebits. These were 3D characters, varyingly unique and tradable just like the CryptoPunks.  The floor price of the CryptoPunks was around 62 ETH in April 2022 or over $180,000, according CoinGecko, meaning that’s the cheapest you can buy any individual NFT from the collection. Meebits prices pale by comparison, but you still can’t get your hands on one for less than around 6 ETH (around $18,000 as of writing).  Read More: CryptoPunks, CryptoCats and CryptoKitties: Then and Now  Twitter verification for PFP NFTs  The connection between digital image NFTs and social media profile pictures was solidified when Twitter (TWTR) started offering to verify whether users owned the NFTs associated with their profile pictures.  As of January 2022, you could set your Twitter profile picture to your CryptoPunk or other NFT and get a special hexagonal border to show its authenticity. Someone else could copy-and-paste the image if they wanted, but they would not get the border. As of writing, this is still limited to subscribers to Twitter Blue and is powered by OpenSea.  Opinion: Why NFT Profile Pics Matter to Investors – and Regulators  The arrival of the Bored Apes  The most successful PFP NFTs so far arrived in April 2021. It was the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection, created by Yuga Labs.  BAYC drew a lot from projects like CryptoPunks. There are 10,000, with each digital image containing unique qualities and elements of rarity. The images are humanoid apes that seem to have fun personalities.  The innovation that BAYC brought was to bundle various perks in with the ownership of the NFTs. For example, owners sometimes get rewarded with other NFTs for free. They each received a dog NFT at one point: the Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). Then they got a ""serum,"" which they could use to mint their own Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT with variable traits. To add to that, BAYC ownership confers access to an exclusive Discord server. Yuga describes this idea as “the ‘club’ model.” The perks are not just about owning a token. They mean membership of a community.  Read More: How NFT Social Clubs Work  Among the biggest perks BAYC owners get are the commercial rights over their images. They can do anything they want with them, including creating their own content with them and making money from that content or merchandise.  Venture capital firm and Yuga investor Samsung Next says that by handing over commercial rights in this way, Yuga has “disrupted traditional media content models.” Conventional media brands have worked hard to stop their customers from using their content for their own commercial ends. Yuga has taken a leap of faith in taking away all those restrictions in the interest of making their own brand that much more exciting and appealing.  At the time of writing, roughly a year after the project launched, the cheapest BAYC NFT could be yours for no less than 139 ether (ETH), according to CoinGecko. That’s more than $400,000. One of the reasons for the sky-high prices is the celebrity association. Eminem, Jimmy Fallon and Madonna hold BAYC NFTs, to name just a few.  Read More: What's the Story Behind Bored Ape Yacht Club Creator Yuga Labs?  The new kids on the block haven’t lost sight of their heritage. In March 2022, Yuga Labs bought the intellectual property of CryptoPunks and Meebits and announced that it would transfer the commercial rights to the owners of the tokens. That would bring the older collections closer in line with the new club model. “We’re excited to see what they do with IP rights,” Yuga said.  Hundreds of PFP NFT projects now exist, including female-driven projects like World of Women, utility-driven PFPs like Moonbirds and many more to choose from if you’re interested in finding just the right profile pic to express yourself online.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-pfp-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b544ba3ff0d0ce5717b1c59e11165ee648b90e5b-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the problem ended years ago, the topic has continued to be discussed by experts and analysts now and then. Analysts say that there are several factors credited for causing the 2008 recession. Among them include loose lending standards, securitization, and deregulation of the financial space. However, barely a year after the recession, a new financial system, the crypto space, was born with the launch of bitcoin. Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts claim that the crypto space can bring solutions to financial problems. In fact, in the past, the crypto space has proven resilient even in cases of financial struggles. For instance, in 2020, when the Covid 19 pandemic started, the financial world faced some problems. However, a few months later, the Crypto space continued to surge.

42407299,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdHh,1651092599,Bitcoin Payments: The Beginning of Something Extraordinary,"Like the Internet before it, Bitcoin is built for a world in transition from centralized and tribal to decentralized and global.  As a monetary system, the Bitcoin layer 1 (or base) blockchain provides global interoperability, transparency and settlement finality without intermediaries or central authority. In more than a decade, the network has demonstrated unparalleled security and reliability, with proven immutability, 99%+ uptime and zero hacks.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Payments Week."" Julie Landrum runs international strategy and growth at OpenNode.  However, it takes time for the decentralized network to reach consensus about new transactions and add them to the blockchain. As a result, base blockchain transaction speeds and throughput are not sufficient to support global payments.  In late 2017, an upgrade to Bitcoin’s protocol paved the way for development of the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s leading second-level scaling system. The Lightning Network uses off-chain payment channels to route and execute bilateral transactions at higher throughput and minimal cost. Transactions are only recorded on-chain once a payment channel closes.  The interoperability inherent in Bitcoin and Lighting open protocols provide accessibility and universal compatibility that has sparked unmatched network effects. In the Lightning Network’s growing ecosystem, hundreds of thousands of transactions can process per second at almost no cost. Payments benefit from instant and final settlement, zero fraud, zero chargebacks and the security of Bitcoin’s base chain.  See also: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?  Built on decentralized, peer-to-peer, open source foundations, the Lightning Network enables Bitcoin payments at scale.  Bitcoin and Lightning facilitate low-cost, instant and final transfer of value  Traditional payment processing costs are imposed by dominant providers, and systemic flaws expose businesses and people to chargebacks and fraud. Businesses across the world forgo significant revenue to be able to accept payments. We are all too familiar with bank wire fees, issues and delays. In 2021, the tax on global commerce and money movement topped $1.9 trillion, according to McKinsey.  Losses related to fraud and the cost of fraud protection are also material. Card fraud alone is expected to reach about $40 billion per year for the next decade, according to the Nilson Report. In the same report, Nilson also calls out the problem of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) available for sale on the dark web. Native to the internet and designed for the future of transactions, Bitcoin payments are a transfer value – not personal information – at lowest cost.  Bitcoin payments radically simplify processing and improve user experience because they eliminate the intermediaries, complexities and delays inherent in the structure of traditional payments. Unlike centralized payments dominated by few powerful players, Bitcoin payments are accessible, borderless and require only an internet connection and software to work.  Free from the limitations of geography, walled gardens and antiquated technology, Bitcoin and Lightning protocol-level innovations deliver efficiency and foster participation, offering lower processing costs to a thriving global ecosystem.  The Lightning Network establishes Bitcoin as the global standard for payments  Bitcoin is a base settlement layer reset made possible by revolutionary technology, and the Lightning Network enables Bitcoin payments to scale. Simple APIs offered by managed payment providers power Bitcoin payment rails for both new and traditional businesses, processors, exchanges, digital wallets, software providers, platforms, ATMs, point-of-service (POS) devices and more.  See also: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  Competitive exchange markets for on- and off-ramps to every major world currency are in place. These fiat bridges make it possible for users to completely control and even negate exposure to bitcoin’s (BTC) price volatility.  As with other paradigm shifts, bitcoin and Bitcoin blockchain-powered payments adoption will not come without education, and growth will not be without resistance. But Bitcoin’s foundations are stable, secure and maturing; its value proposition is strengthening. Trust and acceptance are broadening beyond enthusiasts and early adopters, and the backing of respected visionaries and forward-thinking institutions is helping the cause.  Bitcoin is truly the beginning of something extraordinary and will empower businesses, platforms and people everywhere to benefit from better payments for better money.

Meta announced that it would be breaking out results for the division to show the performance and investments in a group that it considers key to the next generation of online social experiences.  FRL generated revenue of $695 million in the first quarter, a small fraction of the $27.2 billion generated in the quarter from Meta’s family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Analysts were expecting revenue of $683 million for the ""metaverse"" division.  For 2021, Facebook reported a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion for FRL.  Meta previously estimated FRL would reduce its overall operating profit by about $10 billion in 2021 and said it was committed to spending even more on the division for the next several years.  Overall, Meta’s adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $2.72 beat analysts' average estimate of $2.56, according to FactSet, while its overall revenue of $27.9 billion fell short of estimates of $28.3 billion. Meta also outperformed user growth expectations for the quarter.  Meta's shares rose almost 15% to $201.14 in after-hours trading on Wednesday on the results.  Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company's metaverse arm is on a long-term timeline, currently ""laying the groundwork for a very successful 2030s,"" according to the earnings call.

42421632,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojLJ,1651091401,Why the Crypto Executive Order Is a Historical Milestone,"The past year has seen a flurry of cryptocurrency regulation-related activity, particularly from banking regulators. On March 9, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the executive order called “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets” amid the explosive growth in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency adoption. Just three weeks ago, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made her first-ever public speech addressing digital assets.  The beginning of a regulatory framework for digital assets now seems to be coalescing. But what would such a framework entail? What aspects of the digital asset ecosystem will the regulation affect?  Michael Shing is the director of risk management of XREX, a blockchain and fintech company. He is focused on emerging cryptocurrency regulation and risk assessments of crypto firms.  The executive order has set the gears in motion for building a comprehensive and far-reaching crypto regulatory framework. This article highlights the key developments leading up to and following the order that help us anticipate the approach and areas of focus for emerging crypto regulation.  Nearly all participants in the crypto ecosystem will be affected by regulation in some manner, large or small. Anticipating possible next steps in the near future and developing a game plan on how to prepare will be especially crucial for companies and builders in crypto.  Road to regulation  Consider some of the significant regulatory events from recent months. In November, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) jointly announced the completion of “policy sprint” initiatives on crypto assets. Those “sprints” identified and assessed key risks surrounding crypto assets and provided a gap assessment of existing banking regulations and guidance that needed additional clarification.  This is crucial because the web of regulatory agencies tasked with maintaining the health of the financial system is a complicated one. With different bodies governing different financial entities and activities, it is critical for regulators to have a unified view of what a new digital asset landscape looks like and identify the areas subjected to governance.  Digital dollars in the form of stablecoins and a central bank digital currency (CBDC) have also garnered significant attention from regulators and legislators. Also in November, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report on stablecoins that demonstrated a firm understanding of the current stablecoin market, highlighted the inherent risks and gaps within current regulation and, most importantly, recommended legislative action to ensure a comprehensive regulatory framework. The report also spurred constructive discussion at both Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee hearings.  Read more: The Downside of Programmable Money  The executive order signed by Biden outlines a whole-of-government approach by calling on numerous government agencies to collaborate on research, regulatory and legislative recommendations in order to achieve several policy objectives related to digital assets.  The order marks both a historic moment on the path to broader adoption and enhanced regulation of cryptocurrency. It is also largely symbolic in its purpose of tying together regulatory work that has been ongoing. The many government agencies are not starting from scratch and have been hard at work. The executive order, however, may be just the adrenaline shot regulators needed to get to the finish line.  Regulators watching closely  The recent timeline for crypto regulation shows substantive progress and demonstrates that regulatory knowledge of crypto is deeper than what the public may perceive. Regulators have consistently signaled both their understanding and interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), which is at the leading edge of crypto financial innovation. Under the policy objective of mitigating illicit finance, the executive order states that “growth in decentralized financial ecosystems, peer-to-peer payment activity and obscured blockchain ledgers without controls to mitigate illicit finance could also present additional market and national security risks in the future.”  Further, in remarks to the Blockchain Association in September, Acting Comptroller of the OCC Michael Hsu likened crypto and DeFi to credit default swaps (CDS) in the early 2000s. Hsu warned, “We saw innovations that brought genuine improvements to clients and risk managers, but we also saw innovations that would imperil the firms that promoted them and amplify the 2008 crisis. I see similarities with emerging risks in the crypto and DeFi space today.”  What’s next?  The principal policy objectives of the executive order are providing consumer and investor protection, ensuring financial stability, mitigating illicit activities, reinforcing U.S. leadership in the global financial system, fostering responsible development of digital assets and exploring a CBDC.  The order prescribes several deadlines ranging from 90 to 210 days and beyond for the completion of several reports on digital assets. The law firm of Davis Polk has published a helpful graphic outlining the list of action items as well as the associated agencies that play a role.  Apart from deadlines for reports, the executive order doesn't actually preclude legislative or regulatory actions from taking place much sooner than the timeline prescribed. In fact, cryptocurrency already has the full attention of lawmakers. According to Forbes, Congress has introduced 35 bills related to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.  Just recently, U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) unveiled a draft stablecoin bill and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced a Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance bill, aimed at combating the use of digital assets to evade sanctions placed on Russian entities.  Read more: Elizabeth Warren and the Mysticism of the Crypto-Skeptics  Legislative action is a prerequisite for a comprehensive, effective framework to regulate digital assets and cryptocurrency. Once laws are enacted, however, government agencies may need time to translate those laws into coherent regulations. To put into perspective the enormity of financial regulatory reform, in the six years following the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, regulatory agencies completed only 70% of the total rulemaking requirements set forth by Dodd-Frank, as reported by Davis Polk.  Conclusion  There is still great uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of impending crypto regulations with a wide range of possible outcomes. Will oversight be distributed among existing regulatory agencies? Will there be a new agency under the Treasury Department to encompass comprehensive and consolidated supervision? (Recall that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was founded after Dodd-Frank was enacted to consolidate the responsibilities of many regulators.)  One thing is certain: U.S. regulators will build on existing knowledge and expertise to both leverage existing regulatory frameworks and to design new ones for the most innovative corners of the digital asset space. As a global leader in financial services innovations and regulations, the U.S. must take a clear and reasonable approach so that the crypto industry has both the necessary guardrails to protect its users and the open road to build financial services the future requires.  As Yellen said in her speech, “Regulation should be based on risks and activities, not specific technologies” and “regulation should be tech neutral.” I believe Yellen is emphasizing that whether it is distributed ledgers or another emerging technology, customers and investors should receive the benefit of prudent regulation no matter where the financial activity resides. Furthermore, illicit activity should always be prevented no matter where it occurs.  The best-in-class crypto companies should have existing risk and compliance programs to handle illicit finance and cybersecurity risks. Staffing experienced professionals in customer due diligence and anti-money laundering is considered table stakes. Crypto firms will need to enhance their risk and compliance chops to address emerging regulations commensurate with their evolving slate of product offerings. For example, qualified stablecoin issuers may need in-house expertise in financial risks common to the banking sector to meet potential regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. DeFi protocols may need to meet greater scrutiny in their disclosure of risks and financial terms to meet investor protection requirements.  Regulations will increase the table stakes for all players in the crypto ecosystem, increase consequences for mismanagement and set an appropriate barrier to entry. The net result will be less customer harm, less illicit and fraudulent activity and greater trust in the crypto ecosystem, which we, as responsible players share the same value, would be glad to see happen.

Sentiment among traders remains neutral to bearish, albeit less so compared with earlier this week. For example, despite the recent pullback in price, dogecoin (DOGE), a speculative dog-themed meme coin, is up 5% over the past week, compared with a 5% decline in BTC over the same period.  Analysts noticed signs of buyer demand around $38,000 in bitcoin, although it remains to be seen if the cryptocurrency can break above its short-term downtrend. For now, bitcoin appears to be ""falling out of the window, but latching onto the windowsill,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Overall, choppy trading across cryptos and stocks indicates uncertainty among traders, especially as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks linger.  Just launched!

A surge in trading activity typically occurs around price peaks, similar to April and November of last year, which preceded significant sell-offs in price.  This time, however, trading volume has been relatively low, which means some buyers have remained on the sidelines.  Bitcoin's choppy price range has also kept volatility anchored to its lowest level in a year. Further, option traders expect less turbulence going forward, which could point to a more gradual sell-off in BTC's price until buyers return with conviction.  ""Many investors traded on volatility in April, and most took long positions,"" Deribit, a crypto derivatives exchange, wrote in a blog post. ""However, volatility has not returned to its high level as expected, and investors are still waiting for volatility to rise.""  ""For investors who bought volatility earlier, there seems to be a long way to go from making profits,"" Deribit wrote.

42407313,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdlS,1651090805,Can Crypto Deliver on Private Transactions in Cashless World?,"Editor's note: As part of CoinDesk’s Payments Week, we asked a number of engineers, executives and experts to weigh in on the substantial issues raised by the crypto industry.  As Eswar Prasad noted in his recently published book on the future of money – cash is quickly being replaced in the developed and developing world. Since 2018, for instance, China has seen mobile payments make up at least 80% of the total payments market share across its economy. The trendline is slower, but similar, in parts of Europe and the Americas.  But there are certain affordances that only cash and coins provide – namely, privacy. In this roundtable discussion, our experts wonder whether crypto can deliver on private transactions for a world where cash is dead.  Consumer choice means consumers must choose  Yes, absolutely, crypto payments can provide a similar level of privacy to cash – if certain conditions are met. One way or another, cryptographically based digital money will replace cash in consumer transactions. This is a foregone conclusion.  First, cryptocurrencies must be as easy to use as identifier-linked, noncash instruments (like debit cards) or their phone app equivalents. This ease-of-use includes time to transaction finality and being universally accepted. Currently, cryptocurrencies are not able to meet these fundamental requirements.  Second, crypto must be at least as private as paper banknotes (bearing in mind that banknotes can be traced via their serial numbers). Techniques like eCash in the 1990s were created to provide this level of privacy. (They allow an encrypted number to be modified “through” the encryption so as to assign monetary value to it, such that when the encryption is removed, it retains the modification and can be spent anonymously.)  Third, crypto must – obviously – be resistant to “double spending.” Payees need to be able to check instantly at time of payment that the currency they’re using has not been already spent elsewhere. This can be done privately without any more personal or financial details being revealed to them.  And last, crypto should likewise resist aggregation by criminal or terrorist organizations. Remedies like daily limits on consumer withdrawal amounts will not resolve the issue. One way to tackle this would be to make a digital currency cease to be fully private after it is spent the first time.  See also: Internet Privacy Is an Inalienable Right | David Chaum  Right now, central banks around the world are scrambling to create their own digital currencies (CBDCs) that will meet these requirements. Their surveys show that privacy has emerged as a top concern among citizens and bankers. One or more stablecoins may emerge that can also meet the requirements. It’s up to us – the community – to ensure that the right instruments are adopted.  – David Chaum, legendary computer scientist and creator of xx network  Monero, bearer instruments and resistance  The war on cash looks like the war on private cryptocurrencies. Governments have been slowly reducing cash’s usefulness over the last few decades with increased reporting. I fully expect them to do this more directly with cryptocurrencies, which are ultimately bearer assets. The easiest way to regulate this is through regulating exchanges, but they can also expand the definition of what requires registration.  If cash was invented today, I think governments would freak out. They prefer bank transfers where, in theory, a third-party is involved in and can be held accountable for every transaction. Cryptocurrencies reminded people that digital transfers can be bearer assets as well without a centralized intermediary, and they can even have strong privacy properties. This change is still sinking in years later.  Ultimately, the resiliency of bearer assets will depend on people’s willingness to use them. If private digital payments are only used by a small minority, then private digital payments will also be “dead.” So privacy-preserving crypto use must be widespread and circular.  Sadly, Monero is the only major name in the game of privacy. Monero had 693,425 transactions in March 2022 that hid the sender, receiver and amount. Comparatively, only 2,154 bitcoin transactions were mixed using the popular privacy tool for Bitcoin, Samourai, in that same period.  See also: Monero: The Privacy Coin Explained  The demand for private cryptocurrencies is significant, or should be. Further, I predict countries will ultimately fail to curtail the use of private digital assets despite trying to limit their use (sometimes through authoritarian means).  However, this freedom will require resistance from people who care.  – Justin Ehrenhofer, vice president of operations at Cake Wallet  Privacy will be an option for crypto, but not the default  Most cryptocurrencies in the future are likely to be transacted on open ledgers. Better key management solutions and wallets will allow end consumers to manage their public-facing addresses with more care. This will promote rotating public addresses frequently, thereby fostering privacy, while also keeping a consumer’s keys safe.  When users need privacy, they can engage smart contract mixers that can obfuscate the contents of their transaction. Nevertheless, these privacy solutions come at a small financial cost every time someone engages. Further, while I do believe cryptocurrency technologies will largely be the rails for the future of global currency, it may be very difficult to handle high amounts of transaction volume at low latency if smart contracts for privacy must be involved.  The reality is many of the greatest innovations that will occur in Web 3 (as in every industry) are creative beyond what we can currently imagine. In arenas where many may doubt the ability for a new technology to thrive, technology continues to move forward. Cash may always have a place for transactions in different regions of the world, but seamless electronic payments are where society is heading.  – Joshua Tobkin, CEO and co-founder of SupraOracles  Solved problem?  Yes, it absolutely can. Cryptocurrency demolishes the false dichotomy between relatively decentralized, private physical payments and centralized, monitored electronic payments. Of course, this does require privacy-protecting technologies like anonymous payment channels or privacy coins – not just transparent on-chain transactions – but those are mostly solved problems.  See also: What If We Get Online Privacy Right? A Glimpse of 2035  The hard problem is making a cryptocurrency that people would actually use as money rather than a speculative asset. Bitcoin's too volatile, and stablecoins are too tied to fiat to be a real alternative.  – Eric Tung, founder of Themelio  Conversion layers create honeypots  Right now, the simple answer is no – crypto cannot deliver on similar privacy to cash. There are currently too many issues that prevent crypto transactions from replacing the fiat transactions of the current payments landscape. Notably, the fluctuation in the prices of cryptocurrencies makes it unlikely they can be a “main” payment option for most. In addition, any merchant transacting in crypto will need to convert crypto into fiat, relying on an over-the-counter (OTC) service to access liquidity. This means that anyone accepting crypto will either have to be, or partner with, a local regulated exchange that can tap into larger trading volumes – and most exchanges with sufficient liquidity are enacting know-your-customer (KYC) provisions. Further, these payment layers add hidden fees for consumers and create more spots where data could leak.  – Korapat Arunanondchi, project co-lead at EvryNet  Privacy technology is expanding across blockchains  Most commonly you’ll hear about the public ledger when it comes to blockchains, where everyone, in theory, can see transactions. A few solutions work to create truly private transactions, like Zcash – one of the first privacy coins. The creation of zk-Snarks, a “zero-knowledge proof,” in the cryptography world enables completely private transactions. This technology is being expanded to most programmable blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana.  See also: Ethereum's Rollups Aren't All Built the Same  – ​​Kyle Zappitell, CEO of Neon  Crypto must deliver on privacy!  Crypto not only can deliver on private transactions for a world where cash is dead – it must! Crypto is the only chance we have left for a cash equivalent digital payment option that preserves privacy between sender and receiver. Without this option, society gives up yet another right to privacy. With proper tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, the transaction can be selectively revealed later on if an audit is required for compliance. But that shouldn't mean that all transactions should be visible to everyone! We now have the technology to make transactional privacy safe and secure.  – ​​Warren Paul Anderson, vice president of product at Discreet Labs  More from Payments Week:  PayPal’s Blockchain Chief on the Future of Crypto in Payments  Blockchains offer unique advantages, but these must be combined with a user experience that feels similar to the one consumers know today, writes Senior Vice President Jose Fernandez da Ponte.

Rather, it just means that there are no protections for either the consumer or the merchant and that its use as a payment is completely discretionary.  Other jurisdictions are still mulling what steps to take. The approaches vary: Some smaller nations such as Zimbabwe have few qualms about making brash pronouncements casting doubts on bitcoin’s legality, while larger institutions, such as the European Commission, are preparing a sweeping set of rules and laws to regulate digital assets.  In the United States, the issue is complicated further by the fractured regulatory map – who would do the legislating, the federal government or individual states?  A related question in other countries, to which there is not yet a clear answer, is who should be responsible for oversight? Should central banks keep an eye on cryptocurrencies or financial regulators? In some countries, they are one and the same, but in most developed nations, they are separate institutions with distinct remits.  Another divisive issue is whether bitcoin should be regulated on a national or international basis? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) fears uncoordinated regulation may pose a risk to financial stability, but in some countries, even national watchdogs have opposing approaches.  There needs to be a further distinction between regulation of the cryptocurrency itself (is it a commodity or a currency? is it legal tender?) and cryptocurrency businesses (are they money transmitters? do they need licenses?). In a few countries, the considerations are tied together – in most others, they have been dealt with separately.  Below is a summary of pronouncements made by certain countries. This list was last updated in April 2022.  Australia  The Australian government has been supportive of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies and has one of the highest crypto adoption rates globally.  In 2017, it declared that cryptocurrencies were legal and that they would be treated as assets subjected to a capital gains tax. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) requires exchanges operating in the country to register their businesses, maintain records and verify their users. To combat money laundering and terrorism financing, unregistered exchanges will face charges and monetary penalties in the future.  The government announced plans at the end of 2021 to overhaul laws related to the country’s payments systems, including a “world-leading” regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital asset companies. Plans for the nation’s own central bank digital currency were also included.  Argentina  Cryptocurrencies are popular in Argentina where economic woes and high inflation have crippled the local peso currency, but as of March 2002, the country hadn’t drawn up many regulations. The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) together with the Securities Commission (CNV) expressed that cryptocurrencies and bitcoin aren't legal tenders because they aren’t issued by a central bank.  The statement mentioned several risks, but didn’t deem cryptocurrencies and bitcoin illegal.  Argentines are permitted to buy up to only $200 a month in dollars through official channels, with an additional tax of 65% above the official limit. Exchanges are also subject to a tax on sales and purchases.  Bangladesh  In 2015, Bangladesh expressly declared that using cryptocurrencies was a “punishable offense.” Authorities have been on the hunt for illegal bitcoin traders in the country.  Bolivia  In 2014, the central bank of Bolivia officially banned the use of any currency or tokens not issued by the government, making cryptocurrencies and bitcoin illegal even though blockchain advocates are pushing back.  Canada  Canada was one of the first countries to draw up what could be considered “bitcoin legislation.” The government has specified that bitcoin isn’t legal tender but is legal, acknowledging that cryptocurrencies can work as a medium of exchange. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA,), the country’s tax authority, has deemed bitcoin a digital commodity. Thus transactions are taxable, depending on the type of activity.  Cryptocurrency businesses are considered money service businesses and are bound to comply with strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-client (KYC) requirements. Canada regulates bitcoin under securities laws that are based on provinces given the lack of a federal securities regulator such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. For example, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, the world’s first physically settled exchange-traded fund for bitcoin, was approved by the Ontario Securities Commission in February 2021 and extended to other territorial jurisdictions under the country’s passport system.

The National Assembly passed a bill that established a legal and regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, and also made bitcoin a legal tender in the country alongside the existing national fiat currency, the CFA franc.  Read more: Central African Republic Adopts Bitcoin as Legal Tender  China  While China’s leadership touted blockchain technology as a critical innovation, the country has a long history of cracking down on cryptocurrencies. Despite prior bans on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and on banks transacting cryptocurrencies, China grew to become one of the largest markets for digital assets until 2021.  Chinese authorities, however, began to ramp up the enforcement of prior regulations in 2021. The central bank (the People’s Bank of China) together with state governments launched an overarching purge on every part of the crypto industry in 2021. New rules made cryptocurrency trading and transactions, including ones involving in bitcoin, illegal, banned local and foreign exchanges operating in the country and shut down bitcoin mining facilities  Read more: China Crypto Bans: A Complete History  Parallel to that, the government sped up the development of its own central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) – the eCNY. Some 140 million people had opened digital wallets for the new currency from November 2021 until March 2022.  Ecuador  In 2014, the National Assembly banned bitcoin and decentralized digital currencies while the central bank stated that the online trading of cryptocurrencies isn’t forbidden. Still, bitcoin isn't a legal tender or an authorized payment method for goods and services.  Egypt  In January 2018, the Grand Mufti of Egypt declared that cryptocurrency trading was forbidden under Islamic religious law because of risks associated with the activity. The Central Bank of Egypt issued a statement in September 2020 prohibiting individuals, banks and other financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrencies, practically making bitcoin illegal.  El Salvador  El Salvador was the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as an official currency. The country's legislature passed the Bitcoin Law in June 2021 and came into effect three months later, making bitcoin a legal tender. Under the law, goods, services and even taxes can be paid using bitcoin, and every merchant must accept it as a legal form of payment.  Read more: It's Official: El Salvador's Legislature Votes to Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender  Europe  As of March 2022, cryptocurrencies including bitcoin were being regulated at the country level in the European Union. The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has proposed a sweeping set of rules and laws to regulate digital assets and crypto businesses. The so-called Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) bill sets out a comprehensive regulatory framework for all 27 member countries that will govern crypto issuers, users and service providers, covering everything from cryptocurrencies and tokens to stablecoins. A decisive vote on the bill was expected at the end of 2022 at the earliest.  As of this writing, crypto service providers were set to be subject to strict rules of the EU’s sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD6) that in part aims to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and terrorist financing by bolstering fraud detection efforts.  The European Central Bank stated bitcoin isn’t a currency but a crypto asset, and so refrained from regulating it. Some members of the European Parliament mulled over banning the energy-intensive proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining – the consensus mechanism that Bitcoin uses to mint new coins and validate transactions – but the proposal was scrapped after receiving backlash.  India  It is easy to lose track of whether cryptocurrencies are legal or illegal in India following a flurry of bans and withdrawals. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning in July 2018 that barred banks, lenders and financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrencies. India’s Supreme Court, however, overturned the prohibition and the RBI revoked its ban.  The government has since provided some clarity with its new crypto legislation in 2022. The law designates cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as “virtual digital assets,” making them illegal as a method of payment but allowing users to trade and invest in them as assets. Exchanges must comply with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws, and issue disclaimers with their advertisements. The legislation also specified how to pay taxes on crypto profits.  Iran  Iran’s economy has been crippled by Western sanctions and high inflation, driving many to adopt or mine cryptocurrencies to preserve wealth. While authorities aren’t hostile toward crypto, they look for greater control as former President Hassan Rouhani urged for a comprehensive legal framework.  Citizens aren’t banned from trading and holding cryptocurrencies, but regulators warned them about the risks involved. The central bank said in April 2021 that banks and licensed money changers can use cryptocurrency mined by authorized Iranian miners to pay for imported goods, at the same time banning the trading of crypto coming from abroad.  The government recognized bitcoin mining as a legal activity if the facility acquired a license. Miners, however, were ordered to shut down for months in 2021 as the nation experienced electricity shortages and the government cracked down on miners operating without a license.  Japan  Japan’s Financial Services Agency was one of the first national watchdogs to declare bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legally accepted forms of payment and characterized them as property. Those provisions, however, don’t mean bitcoin is legal tender.  Japanese virtual asset services providers must comply with anti-money laundering standards and share data with regulators under the “travel rule” by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – an intergovernmental organization that coordinates the financial policy of its 39 member countries.  Regulators also tightened their grip on stablecoin issuers by treating them like banks.  Kazakhstan  Kazakhstan became one of the world’s biggest centers for bitcoin mining as the government offered tax incentives and cheap energy, while many miners relocated to Kazakhstan after China cracked down on mining. Authorities turned more hostile toward miners as power shortages plagued the electricity grid in late 2021, cracking down on illegal operations, limiting power consumption and calling for heavier taxes.  The country is still a hotbed for bitcoin, and it amended its financial laws with regulations on “digital assets’ in 2020, but as of March 2022, it hadn’t ratified a comprehensive framework for cryptocurrencies.

Crypto mining is subject to a 15% tax. Authorities in Kyrgyzstan also proposed a set of bills to provide a framework to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country.  Malaysia  Cryptocurrency transactions aren’t banned in Malaysia but are subject to a tax, according to the e-commerce guidelines of the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia. Crypto exchanges must comply with anti-money laundering and counter financing terrorism regulations.  In September 2021, Malaysia’s central bank tested its central bank-issued digital currency platform for cross-border payments with a number of partner countries, including Australia, Bangladesh and Singapore.  Malta  In June 2018, the European island-nation passed a series of blockchain-friendly laws, including one that details the registration requirements of cryptocurrency exchanges. Earlier in 2020, the Malta Financial Services Authority published a document addressing issues related to offerings of security tokens to tighten its grasp on crypto businesses that exploited the country’s lax anti-money laundering rules.  Mexico  Mexican financial authorities specified that cryptocurrencies aren’t considered legal tender or currencies, and in 2021, Finance Minister Arturo Herrera reiterated that cryptocurrencies are banned from the financial system. On the other hand, crypto was being adopted at a breakneck speed in Mexico. Companies are allowed to offer crypto services as long as they register and comply with reporting requirements. Also, as of March 2022, the Central Bank of Mexico (Banxico) also planned to issue its CBDB to advance financial inclusion in the country.  Morocco  Cryptocurrencies are banned in Morocco, and the nation’s foreign exchange authority declared that the use of cryptocurrencies violated foreign exchange regulations and would be met with penalties. In spite of the ban, peer-to-peer bitcoin purchases thrive in the country and the central bank was considering launching a digital currency.  Read more: Centralized Exchange (CEX) vs. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): What’s the Difference?  Namibia  Namibia is one of the few countries to have expressly declared that purchases with bitcoin are “illegal.”  Nigeria  Officially, Nigerian banks and other financial institutions are prohibited from handling virtual currencies, according to a warning from the central bank. The local crypto community, however, has found ways to circumvent those laws, causing adoption to boom in Nigeria despite the banking ban. The central bank launched its own virtual currency, the eNaira, in October 2021.  Pakistan  In April 2018, Pakistan’s central bank issued a statement barring financial companies from dealing with virtual currencies. In April 2019, the federal government introduced new regulations and licensing schemes for crypto firms. Authorities, however, prepared a tougher stance toward digital assets that could include banning cryptocurrencies.  Russia  In February 2022, Russia’s government proposed a regulation to license exchanges and tax large transactions to legitimize cryptocurrencies dispelling fears of a possible ban. The Ministry of Finance prepared a bill to restrict trading to licensed platforms and certified wallets.  Previously, the central bank considered outlawing bitcoin mining and crypto trading while pushing for creating a digital ruble.  Singapore  Hailed as a crypto haven of the world, Singapore has embraced an innovative approach toward cryptocurrency and blockchain, thanks to the leadership of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  In January 2020, the MAS announced a new regulatory framework to cover all Singapore-based crypto businesses and exchanges under anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules. After a six-month grace period of license exemption, crypto companies have to acquire a license to operate. The country's central bank warned that crypto is “highly risky and not suitable for the general public"" and issued guidelines to limit crypto advertisements.  South Africa  In 2017, the South Africa Reserve Bank implemented a “sandbox approach,” testing draft bitcoin and cryptocurrency regulations with a selected handful of startups.  In April 2020, the Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group proposed to increase oversight of crypto activities and mandate businesses to register with AML watchdog the Financial Intelligence Centre. After a series of scams, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) said it was preparing a regulatory framework for crypto to protect the public and planned to unveil those rules in early 2022. According to the tax authority, crypto assets are subject to the general tax law.  South Korea  Cryptocurrencies are popular in South Korea, and it is legal for citizens to own, sell and buy them. The national assembly passed a bill to tax virtual asset transactions in 2021. Enforcement of the new tax regime was delayed by one year to 2023.  Crypto service providers must partner with a local bank, register with the Korean financial regulators for a license and comply with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules to operate in the country.  Thailand  Thailand regulates cryptocurrencies including bitcoin as investment assets and revenue from crypto trading or mining can be reported as capital gains on income taxes. Thai authorities, however, are seeking to curb the use of crypto as a method of payment. In 2021, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission warned against decentralized finance, banned NFTs and meme coins.  Read more: What Is DeFi?  Turkey  Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have gained popularity as many citizens see them as a hedge against the Turkish lira’s plunge. In April 2021, Turkey’s central bank banned the use of crypto for payments, but as of March 2022, it was still legal to hold bitcoin in the country.  The government is developing cryptocurrency regulations, but there is no intention to prohibit them.  United States of America  The U.S. is plagued by a fragmented regulatory system, with legislators at both the state and the federal level responsible for layered jurisdictions and a complex separation of powers.  Some states are more advanced than others in cryptocurrency oversight. New York, for instance, unveiled the controversial BitLicensehttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses in 2015, granting bitcoin businesses the official go-ahead to operate in the state, but the requirements are so onerous that many companies and exchanges don’t provide their services to New Yorkers rather than comply.  States such as Wyoming and Texas stepped in with accommodating regulations to lure in new businesses. Wyoming passed several laws in 2019, including ones that treat cryptocurrencies as a legal medium of exchange and gave licenses to crypto-banks such as Kraken and Avanti. The Texas Virtual Currency Act, passed in June 2021, defined cryptocurrencies as a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value” and state-chartered banks can offer crypto services. Colorado exempted cryptocurrencies from state securities regulation and planned to accept tax payments in crypto by the summer 2022.  Florida, especially its biggest city Miami, poses as a bitcoin heaven, but as of March 2022, state-level regulation had yet to catch up with ambitions. The state’s financial regulator warned that those who sell cryptocurrencies, whether they be a business or an individual, fall under money transmitter regulations and need to be licensed.  At the federal level, several agencies were contending to regulate some part of the growing digital asset industry. The SEC, Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) all have issued guidelines and made rule-making efforts on how different sections of the crypto industry should comply with existing regulations. These were largely uncoordinated efforts and a comprehensive regulatory framework for all states had yet to come as of this writing.  The SEC has focused on the use of blockchain assets as securities, such as whether certain bitcoin investment funds should be sold to the public and whether certain offerings constitute fraud. In October 2021, the SEC approved the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows investors to indirectly participate in the bitcoin market.  The CFTC has a bigger potential footprint in bitcoin regulation, given its designation of the cryptocurrency as a “commodity.” While it had yet to draw up comprehensive bitcoin regulations as of March 2022, its efforts focused on monitoring the futures market. The agency had also filed charges in several bitcoin-related schemes, which underlines its intent to exercise jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies whenever it suspects there may be fraud.  United Kingdom  Cryptocurrencies are considered as “property” in the U.K, meaning citizens are allowed to buy and sell the coins, and are subject to taxes depending on their income from trading or staking. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued its guidance on crypto assets in July 2019, clarifying which tokens would fall under its jurisdiction. It decided that bitcoin was outside of its regulatory remit.  Exchanges are regulated and have to be registered with the FCA. As of January 2021, they were also banned from offering crypto derivatives such as exchange-traded notes to retail consumers. The government later announced plans to curb misleading crypto advertisements to protect consumers.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bill into law that allows the central bank to issue digital currency.  Zimbabwe  Late in 2017, a senior official from Zimbabwe’s central bank stated that bitcoin wasn’t “actually legal.” The country’s reserve bank issued a statement to warn against trading cryptocurrencies, saying that they weren’t legal tender and not guaranteed by the government.

42421640,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojOP,1651089017,Here Is How to Improve DeFi Governance Using Ideas from Computational Voting Theory,"As the decentralized finance (DeFi) market evolves, it seems paramount that new and current protocols incorporate more sophisticated governance techniques.  Governance is one of the fundamental building blocks of decentralized finance (DeFi). The ideas of decentralizing and democratizing governance in DeFi protocols are incredibly novel, but the techniques haven’t evolved at the same pace as the rest of the DeFi ecosystem.  Jesus Rodriguez is CTO and co-founder of blockchain data platform IntoTheBlock, as well as chief scientist of AI firm Invector Labs and an active investor, speaker and author in crypto and artificial intelligence.  For all the innovation that we have seen in the DeFi space, most protocols today are governed by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that operate using a basic one-token, one-vote model. The simplicity of that model makes it incredibly easy to implement but also creates broad vulnerability surfaces for DeFi protocols. Just as we were writing this article, stablecoin protocol BeanStalk was a victim of a governance attack that resulted in a $182M exploit. This type of attack reflects the fragility of the one-token, one-vote model which, by definition, favors large token holders at the expense of other participants in the protocol.  Fortunately, there is a relatively unknown area of computer science known as computational voting theory that includes plenty of ideas that can be incorporated into next generation DeFi governance models.  A brief history of computational voting theory  Voting theory is an ancient area of mathematics tracing back to Plato’s unfinished book “The Laws” in which the Greek philosopher proposed multi-stage voting as an alternative to the traditional democratic models.  The golden era of voting theory took place during the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, when dogmatic ideas were challenged with science and math. During those years, thinkers Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, and Jean-Charles, Chevalier de Borda created methods such as Condorcet criterion or the Borda count, respectively, which have become the foundation of many modern voting systems.  During the 1950s, voting theory received new momentum with the work of economists such as Nobel Prize winner Kenneth Arrow. Arrow’s impossibility theorem has become the cornerstone of social choice theory.  The emergence of multi-agent systems in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) triggered a new wave of research in voting theory. The blockchain space has been an adopter of many novel ideas in voting theory in the form of consensus protocols. Although DeFi has been slow to adopt more sophisticated voting paradigms, we are already seeing modern ideas from computational voting theory making its way into DeFi governance models.  Beyond the 'one token, one vote' Model  Native tokens in DeFi protocols align users with an economic interest in the protocol while also giving them the right to participate in the governance process. This duality of value seems logical but becomes problematic in simpler governance methods like ""one-token, one-vote"" because large token holders can manipulate proposals to benefit their economic interest.  In general terms, there are two fundamental types of approaches to improve DeFi governance models:  Build token models that decouple the economic interest from the governance participation. Removing this duality can indirectly lower the risk of market manipulation attacks.  Implement more sophisticated voting models that require considerably more resources to manipulate.  There are plenty of ideas in modern voting theory that can be adapted to address these two key points.  1. Quadratic voting  One of the favorite options of the crypto community is quadratic voting (QV). The concept was originally proposed by scientists William Vickrey, Edward H. Clarke, and Theodore Groves but was really popularized by Microsoft Research New England’s economist Glen Weyl. The core QV model enables voters to purchase votes where the price of votes is a quadratic function of the number of votes purchased. When applied to DeFi governance, we can envision that voters will have to spend governance tokens at a cost that grows quadratically relative to the number of votes. Two votes will cost four tokens, three votes will cost nine tokens, etc.  Ideas like QV makes it harder for large token holders to manipulate governance proposals given the increased cost of acquiring votes. Gitcoin has been one of the most prominent projects experimenting with ideas around QV with relatively good results.  2. Holographic voting  A challenge for the ""one token, one vote"" model in DeFi governance is that all proposals receive the same level of attention regardless of their relevance. This allows large token holders to manipulate important governance decisions since they don’t get the proper attention of the community.  Proposed by Matan Field and several contributors from DAOstack, holographic consensus (HC) tries to curate attention to relevant governance proposals. The core mechanism uses tokens that can be staked to boost attention to relevance proposals. HC also introduces a second token that can be staked to bet on the outcome of a proposal. Token holders that bet on the right outcome get compensated while those voting against will lose their stake. The dual token mechanism drives attention to the important proposals while also ensuring that the economic interest of large token holders is aligned with the community.  3. Proof of participation  An interesting idea that has been outlined by several forward thinkers in the DeFi ecosystem, including Vitalik Buterin, is to limit governance to accounts that are actively participating in the protocol. Imagine a DeFi lending protocol that restricts its governance mechanics to addresses that have actively issued and borrowed loans, have a trading history without liquidations or have even contributed to different governance proposals. Although not bulletproof, this method can significantly limit governance attacks as voters will need to be actively involved in the protocol.  4. Limited governance  A somewhat obvious concept, also outlined by Vitalik Buterin in a recent blog post, is the idea of constraining governance proposals to certain aspects or parameters of a DeFi protocol. For instance, consider an automated market maker (AMM) protocol in which governance proposals are constrained to changing weights within certain ranges in liquidity pools. Similarly, DeFi protocols can introduce time delays between the time an impactful proposal is approved and its implementation, giving the community time to reflect on it and prepare for the impact. This should lower the probability of catastrophic attacks via governance manipulations.  Improved DAO-DeFi governance  The rapid level of innovation and growth in DeFi has challenged some the simplicity of governance models. The current generation of governance models represent an important vector of attacks and market manipulations. Just like voting models have evolved throughout our socioeconomic history, the next phase of DeFi requires more robust governance mechanisms. Thankfully, the answers might already be in the rich history of computational voting theory.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/27/here-is-how-to-improve-defi-governance-using-ideas-from-computational-voting-theory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ddfead1e40af339ad0bc66de9497b8b8dd856a3a-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Currently Points At &apos;Fear&apos; According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the BTC market has now remained fearful for the 3rd consecutive week. The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that tells us what the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin market currently is. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from one to hundred for representing this sentiment. All values above fifty signify that the market is greedy right now On the other hand, indicator values below the cutoff show that the market sentiment is that of fear at the moment. End values of above 75 and below 25 represent investor sentiments of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively. Historically, tops have tended to form during periods of extreme greed, while bottoms have formed during extreme fear. Because of this, some investors believe that it&apos;s best to buy during the former, while the latter periods are best for selling.

The financial system is designed to create an illusion of a bog dog or a unicorn that everyone needs to own at that particular moment. Financial instruments are contracts for tradable assets that can be modified and purchased. The basis of these transactions is money, where one instrument is traded for cash. For instance, when one needs to buy shares, you will give some money worth the shares you will receive in return. Traditional financial instruments include securities, bonds, real estate, and cheques. However, the 21st century has seen a myriad of changes in the financial world and a sudden surge in technological advancements in fields such as mobile payments and blockchain databases. How Do NFTs Work? To understand this concept, we need first to understand the meaning of fungible. A Fungible asset is anything that can be exchanged or traded for another asset of the same value. For instance, it is easy to acquire another dollar. Non-fungible, therefore, means that the asset is unique. It cannot be exchanged for any other asset that may be similar to it. The rarity of the asset gives it value in the market.NFTs were not originally designed to be financial instruments; they were often disregarded. They are codes representing an asset stored on a blockchain.

42374816,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2uLP,1651086012,Bitcoin Recovers to $39K as Stocks Rebound,"Bitcoin (BTC), after dipping to a six-week low, bounced back Wednesday alongside traditional markets.  At press time, the largest cryptocurrency was up 1.8% in the past 24 hours, trading at $38,989. Analysts are attributing the price move to bitcoin's correlation with tech stocks.  ""The key story with bitcoin price continues to be its correlation with tech stocks (which is at all-time highs),” said Ben McMillan, founder of and chief investment officer at IDX Digital Assets. “As a result, the slate of tech earnings we've seen this week have been driving the daily trading in bitcoin. While that's expected to continue in the near term, we do expect bitcoin's correlation to tech stocks to come down later this year.""  Traders and investors have been concerned about Federal Reserve rate hikes and a possible recession, but Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at GlobalBlock, said that “earnings reports from many companies such as Microsoft, which released yesterday, were positive and did not support the idea of a recession coming later this year Therefore, I think the market could be reaching oversold levels in the short term.  “Binance shorts have been getting aggressive near the lows on bitcoin and Ethereum, whilst open interest rises higher and funding falls lower. These indicators add confluence for some upside in the short term as it suggests we could be due for a short squeeze,” he said.  Meanwhile, crypto analysis firm IntoTheBlock wrote in a Telegram message that “despite the recent drawdown, the two top assets by market cap are still showing a strong bottom as the majority of the holders are in profit. 58.44% of the addresses holding $BTC and 69.25% of the addresses holding $ETH are in the money or profit.”  Ether (ETH) was up 0.3% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2,860.

42407283,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSVn,1651084843,Mexican Remittances Are the Continent’s Largest; Crypto Companies Want a Cut,"If Mexico had always been a huge market for remittances, the coronavirus pandemic has made it even larger. Crypto companies do not want to miss the opportunity.  In 2021, Mexico was the third-largest recipient of remittances worldwide after China and India. According to the Mexican central bank, the amount of money sent to the country from nationals living abroad reached $51.6 billion in 2021, a 27% increase from 2020.  Almost all, 95%, came from the United States. Analysts suggest last year’s increase was mostly due to the additional income Mexican first-line workers in states like California, Texas and New York were getting. Plus, they were also recipients of U.S. government-backed stimulus checks. In early January, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Mexican immigrants’ remittances have been key to the country’s post-pandemic economic recovery.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  About 99% of these remittances were sent through electronic wire transfers. Money orders and cash deposits comprised the remaining 1%, although these might begin to be substituted by crypto-based remittance services. Bitso, Mexico’s largest crypto exchange, says it saw a fourfold increase in cross-border remittances between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022.  For a while now, sending remittances through crypto has been mostly done on these types of exchange platforms. Frida Vargas, head of business sevelopment at Bitso, told CoinDesk the company processed about $1.2 billion in remittances between the U.S. to Mexico in 2020. “Our main users are remittance companies, who use crypto technology to improve and make the remittance sending and collecting process easier,” she said.  Read More: Crypto Becomes Lifeline for Russian Emigrés Opposing Putin’s War in Ukraine  However, there’s a new wave of remittance-specific crypto products offered by several companies, including Bitso, and they’re mostly using stablecoins.  “Markets like Latin America will leapfrog into using stablecoins, which are perfect for remittances,” Mohamed Elkastassi, chief strategy officer at Tribal Credit, told CoinDesk. Pegged to a fiat currency, these coins eliminate the risks of price volatility while allowing the benefits of crypto’s other main features: speed and lower fees.  Tribal provides financing and payments services for small and midsized enterprises in emerging markets. Last December, it launched a cross-border B2B payment option facilitated by Bitso that enables the conversion of Mexican pesos to Stellar USDC, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, for faster and cheaper transactions between Mexico and the U.S.  According to a researcher from the Universidad Iberoamericana de Puebla, Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are wary of using cryptocurrencies to send money back to their homeland because “they change their worth every day.” That’s where stablecoins become handy because they help recipients hedge against any devaluation of their local currency.  For Elkasstawi, massive crypto adoption for remittances is just a matter of time. “In the future, immigrant workers will be paid in stablecoins and merchants will be accepting them as a form of payments.”  Read More: Are Crypto ‘Legal Tender’ Laws Even Necessary?  In November Bitso also partnered with Circle, a peer-to-peer payments company, to launch a new international wire transfer product called Bitso Shift. It’s designed for small businesses and freelancers, allowing them to change their dollars into stablecoins, send them to Mexico and be collected in Mexican pesos. The service charges $12 for every $1,000 sent, and no fee for collecting.  Tribal’s Elkasstawi said the reason why stablecoins have not been massively adopted for remittances is that users still depend on actual cash to spend the money they receive. This is especially true in Mexico, where 86% of all transactions are still in cash. But that already might be changing.  In mid-February, Coinbase (COIN) announced a new cash-out service across 37,000 establishments in the country. These include the 20,000 branches of Oxxo, the country’s largest convenience store chain, as well as other supermarkets and department stores.  It began as a free service, but it now charges a fee for every transaction that’s “25% to 50% lower than traditional cross-border payment solutions,” according to the exchange. Coinbase also allows users in Mexico to convert and invest their balance into over 100 cryptocurrencies, including Circle’s USDC stablecoin if they choose not to cash out.  Coinbase’s cash-out product seems to compete directly with Western Union in terms of accessibility. The company has created an app that allows collecting or sending money transfers from Oxxo stores. Western Union fees range between $8 to $37.  Read More: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  Users seem eager to ditch traditional remittance services and adopt crypto to get their money from abroad. “With long lines and plenty of ID requirements, it seemed like a crime to get U.S. dollars from Western Union,” Moises Martinez, a 25-year-old criminologist living in Mexico, told CoinDesk. “I know the paperwork is part of the security protocols, but I just wanted to get my money in my account.”  As an alternative, Martinez turned to crypto. His father, then living in the U.S., paid for his son’s entire college tuition in bitcoin, using Coinbase to send him the currency. Martinez cashed out using Taurus, a Mexico-based crypto exchange that launched a Visa debit card in 2020.  Even though Martinez’s father is back in Mexico, his son still uses alternatives to the traditional financial system like other crypto services or neobanks. Martinez still has relatives in the U.S. that rely on companies like Western Union (which was founded in 1851). “I get them: they’re used to that service and it is reliable,” he says. This might still delay massive crypto adoption for remittances between the U.S. and Mexico.  But for now, as Elkasstawi says, at least users are seeing that crypto gives them more options to manage their money.

After sharp losses on April 26, XTZ buyers are yet to reverse losses and are pinned within the bear breakout bar, signaling weakness. Based on the current setup, XTZ may slide to new 2022 lows. As such, traders may find entries on every retest of $3 to unload in the immediate term. Tezos Technical Analysis Overall, sellers are in control and XTZ prices are within the bearish engulfing bar of April 26. From this setup, every high below $3 and yesterday&apos;s bear bar offers selling opportunities for aggressive sellers from an effort versus result perspective. As per the XTZUSDT candlestick arrangement, the immediate bear target is $2.5 marking the lows of January and February 24 pin bars.

42374810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2uDr,1651082400,"Evmos, the EVM-Compatible Cosmos Chain, Mounts a Comeback","After months of hype ended in a botched launch in March, Evmos – the blockchain that aimed to improve Ethereum and Cosmos interoperability – is relaunching on Wednesday.  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible, IBC-enabled Evmos blockchain was initially slated to launch in February as a way to fold Ethereum development into the Cosmos ecosystem. With strong community backing and innovative plans for a token airdrop, the chain seemed poised for success.  Yet, when Evmos launched in March after a short delay it was plagued by bugs and reports of users struggling to claim their airdropped tokens.  After an attempted update led to a “critical security vulnerability,” Evmos’s issues became large enough that validators coordinated to halt the entire chain.  “We decided as a community of validators and on the core team to just take a step back and try it again once we have everything sorted out,” said Evmos founder Federico Kunze Küllmer in an interview with CoinDesk.  Now, a month and a half after Evmos shut down, the team feels it is ready to try again.  Lessons learned  Over the past month, the Evmos team has worked to make it easy for users to claim tokens that were lost during Evmos’s buggy March airdrop.  As a part of this effort, the team is introducing a dashboard that, in addition to allowing users to stake their tokens and participate in protocol governance, will enable users to claim airdropped tokens.  “We implemented additional checks on the claiming process and we also introduced our recovery for all the funds that were stuck,” said Kunze Küllmer. “We also have a clear guide for how to claim the tokens and how to recover tokens permanently stuck.”  After a long list of complicated integrations brought down Evmos in March, Kunze Külmer said that “the main thing that we did as well from an engineering point of view is improve our testing processes and testing procedures.”  In explaining Evmos’s new testing procedures, Kunze Külmer pointed CoinDesk to new documentation the team has created for Evmos users and developers. In addition to keeping Evmos on track, the documentation will serve as a point of reference for members of the wider Cosmos community looking to learn from Evmos’s mistakes.  “We have these software upgrade guides for all our users so that not only we can benefit from the learning experience that we had with these failed upgrades, but other users in the Cosmos ecosystem can benefit,” explained Kunze Külmer.  Ethereum + Cosmos = Evmos  Cosmos is an interconnected community of blockchains that communicate via the so-called Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. In a world where new blockchains are popping up each day to cater to unique use cases, IBC makes it easy for distinct blockchains to swap assets and interoperate without the need for specialized tooling.  Over the past couple of years, Cosmos has scaled into one of the largest blockchain ecosystems, with popular IBC-enabled chains like Terra and Osmosis reaching a combined market cap of nearly $70 billion, according to Cosmos builders Ignite.  As Cosmos and other blockchain ecosystems have expanded, Ethereum continues to house most decentralized app development. Even as new non-Ethereum chains have stolen some of its spotlight, many of the most popular newer chains – among them Avalanche, Fantom and Polygon – are built to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  By making Evmos EVM-compatible, it will be easier for Ethereum-native developers to launch apps on the chain without extra overhead. It should also lead to a smoother experience for Ethereum users because they won’t need to ditch familiar tools like MetaMask.  Evmos initially planned to relaunch on Tuesday, but it opted to push the launch back 24 hours to Wednesday at 6 p.m. UTC. Per a tweet from the Evmos Twitter account, “Evmos cannot launch without 100% confidence that we are ready to rock.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/27/evmos-the-evm-compatible-cosmos-chain-mounts-a-comeback,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42374820,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2uPB,1651082018,"Ethereum Rollup Optimism Launches DAO, Announces Long-Awaited Airdrop","It’s airdrop season in rollup land.  The popular Ethereum layer 2 rollup Optimism announced on Tuesday that it will be forming a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, dubbed the Optimism Collective.  Along with this news, Optimism set Crypto Twitter alight with the announcement of a long-awaited Optimism (OP) token and airdrop.  A “season of airdrops”  Airdrops, like those for the Ethereum Name Service and dYdX, have become a common way for projects to garner attention while rewarding early users and kicking off a token economy.  Unlike big airdrops in the past, however, Optimism announced “an entire season of airdrops” in a blog post on Tuesday. The first airdrop will reward 5% of the initial OP token supply to early Optimism adopters and active Ethereum users (e.g., users who have participated in DAO governance).  Optimism is using multiple rounds of airdrops to encourage people to use or contribute to the protocol even if they failed to qualify for the first drop. Fourteen percent of OP’s initial token supply will be airdropped in total, with eligibility for future drops being determined by the Optimism Collective.  According to Optimism, 264,079 addresses will be eligible to claim OP in the first airdrop, which will be announced on Twitter by @optimismPBC. Users can already check their eligibility status on the Optimism website.  The Collective DAO  According to Optimism, the collective was founded on the premise that public goods can be profitable, and the DAO was designed such that “positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.”  DAOs have been envisioned as a way to improve organization governance by giving community members a stake in their success, but prominent early examples such as SushiSwap and MakerDAO have found that handing the reins of a project over to a decentralized community of token holders can sometimes lead to slowdowns, messiness and misaligned incentives.  The Optimistic Collective puts a twist on the familiar DAO playbook of allowing token holders to vote on changes to the community by dividing itself into two “co-equal chambers.”  The Token House, which will include all OP token holders, will determine protocol incentives and vote on protocol upgrades. The Citizens’ House, on the other hand, will be made up of “citizens” who hold a non-transferable, or “soulbound,” NFT (non-fungible token) and are responsible for funding public goods.  The first group of citizens includes early Optimism contributors, but the rollup says that over time “the mechanism for distributing Citizenships will be determined by the Foundation with input from the Token House.”  Similar to other teams that have worked to progressively decentralize, Optimism has also formed a centralized foundation to “serve as a steward of the collective” and bootstrap the ecosystem (though it will eventually dissolve, Optimism says).  “Optimistic” rollups  Layer 2 rollups such as Optimism allow users to use some Ethereum apps more cheaply without losing the network’s essential security guarantees. They are the primary way Ethereum is working to scale its ecosystem in the face of high gas fees and relatively low transaction speeds.  Optimism scales the Ethereum network by processing transactions and executing smart contracts on a separate, rollup-specific chain.  The data processed on Optimism gets bundled up and passed back down to Ethereum, where Ethereum network actors can check whether the data is valid.  So-called “optimistic” rollups like Optimism assume transactions are true once they make it to the Ethereum layer 1 chain, and they give network validators a period of seven days to dispute transactions that they believe to be false (That differs from so-called ZK-rollups, which use complicated cryptography to validate transactions rather than assume their validity outright).  With around $500 million in total value locked (TVL) according to DefiLlama, Optimism is the second-largest Ethereum rollup. Its primary competitor in the optimistic rollup market, Aribtrum, has a TVL of $2 billion and has yet to launch its own token.

42374826,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2uXz,1651081831,"EU Crypto Laundering Plans Could Overwhelm Authorities, Bank Regulator Says","New European Union proposals to monitor crypto transactions with unhosted wallets could breach the risk-based approach set out by international money laundering regulators, an official from the bloc’s own banking authority has said.  Policymakers from the European Commission also warned any decision to scrap a 1,000-euro threshold for identifying crypto payers would need to be backed by evidence.  On March 31, the European Parliament voted through controversial provisions to identify participants in crypto payments, including transactions with wallets that aren’t hosted by any regulated exchange – leading to warnings from the industry that the bloc could stifle innovation and cramp privacy.  In particular, plans to force large transactions with unhosted wallets to be automatically reported to the authorities could prove overwhelming, the European Banking Authority’s Joana Neto said at an event held Wednesday at the European Parliament in Brussels.  “It’s very resource intensive,” said Neto, who is an anti-money laundering data specialist. “Who’s going to handle this? … If it’s going to be the competent authority, what are they going to do with that information?” A requirement to report missing data to the authorities was “amazing in theory,” but might not be practical, she added.  “The essence of the risk-based approach is not exactly reflected in the draft from the European Parliament,” she continued, referring to the principle of matching data collection to the threat of actual money laundering.  Lawmakers also supported governments in proposing to remove a 1,000-euro threshold that already applies to conventional bank transfers. That means crypto payments, uniquely, would have to identify the participants even if they are of small value.  Some legal experts have warned that such an approach risks legal challenge given privacy concerns, and officials from the European Commission said that approach would need to be justified by lawmakers and governments.  “Our message to the co-legislator is that the solution they must take must be risk based and proportionate,” said Gabriel Hugonnot of the European Commission’s financial crime team. “Are there differences in the risks that justify a different treatment?”  The battle continues to rage on that question, with the industry pointing to figures from Chainalysis that suggest just 0.15% of crypto transactions involve illicit addresses. Some lawmakers, on the other hand, say it’s too easy to break up a large digital payment into lots of smaller chunks to circumvent any regulatory limits.  Hugonnot also appeared to confirm suspicion that current draft rules could spell the end of privacy-enhancing techniques.  “In all the provisions of the anti-money laundering package we are trying to improve the fight against any and all anonymous devices,” Hugonnot said, referring to recent EU proposals to ban large cash transactions and anonymous bearer shares. That suggests there could be no legitimate use for crypto tools like mixers or tumblers, he added.  Hugonnot also hit out at “fake debates” exaggerating the impact of the plans, including denying industry claims that crypto users would need to prove their identity each time they made a payment.  “All the information that is asked [such as the payer’s name and address] doesn’t need to be directly attached to the transfer,” he said, but could be requested by crypto wallet providers separately.

42374827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2uWj,1651081238,LUNA Supply Drops to All-Time Low –  But Don’t Call It Deflationary,"The supply of LUNA, the native token of the Terra blockchain, fell to an all-time low level on Tuesday – a price-boosting dynamic that's seen by crypto analysts as an indicator of how popular the project remains despite nagging concerns about its sustainability.  LUNA's circulating supply – the number of tokens on the market – slid to 346 million, down from 355 million a month earlier and a high of 482 million last November, according to Smart Stakehttps://terra.smartstake.io/history/3650, a data tracker platform focused on the Terra ecosystem. The liquid supply – the number of coins available on the market that are not locked for staking – dropped to 90 million for the first time ever.  A lower supply of LUNA has helped to bolster the token's price in cryptocurrency markets; the price hit an all-time high of $119 on April 5.  “This results in a large price movement for the LUNA asset, as there is not only significant buying but also significant supply reduction,"" said Dustin Teander, analyst at blockchain data platform Messari. ""Both forces push the LUNA price higher, leading us to where we are now.”  The Terra blockchain, founded and developed by South Korea-based Terraform Labs, has expanded rapidly from its roots as a crypto payment protocol for online purchases to new ventures in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In the process, Terra’s native token LUNA and algorithmic stablecoin UST have leapt into the ranks of the top performing cryptocurrencies in 2022. The project also has drawn scrutiny about how sustainable its growth is.  The fate of LUNA’s price is closely linked to UST, as the LUNA token is essential to keep the price of Terra’s UST anchored to $1. The pricing mechanism to preserve the peg is built using an algorithm – an incentive for traders to step in and bring back the price to the peg – that permanently destroys and creates LUNA tokens to balance supply and demand for UST tokens.  When UST is above $1, LUNA is burned to mint UST. Similarly, if demand is low for UST and the price falls below $1, UST is burned to mint LUNA.  Read more: What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem  The demand for UST has exploded, sending its market capitalization to $18 billion from $2 billion in a year as depositors flocked to the Anchor protocol, a lending and saving project built on Terra that has a market-beating 19.5% annual yield.  “In order to get the 20% yield, people needed to acquire UST, which involved first acquiring LUNA and burning it for UST,” Teander said.  Still, it does not make LUNA a deflationary asset.  If UST demand stalls and investors flee the Terra ecosystem, UST will be burned to keep up the price peg, diluting the supply of LUNA.  University of Calgary law professor Ryan Clements said to CoinDesk TV that Terra’s growth is likely “unsustainable,” calling all algorithmic stablecoins “inherently unstable” in a research paper.  In an extreme situation, the resulting sell-off in LUNA could trigger a downward spiral causing UST to lose its peg, sending shock waves to other parts of the cryptocurrency market, some analysts have warned.

Here's How LFG's Bitcoin 'Reserve' Might Work  This year so far, LUNA’s price has held up relatively well during a time when most cryptocurrencies have struggled, as red-hot inflation, rate hikes and geopolitical uncertainties drive investors to sell risky assets from stocks to bitcoin.  Since Jan. 1, LUNA slid by only 2.8%, while bitcoin dropped 18% and several major altcoins, such as solana (SOL) and cardano (ADA), lost about 40% of their value.

50342,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=233398,1651078826,Which is the Most Decentralized Cryptocurrency?,"As the Cryptocurrency sector evolves, more technology leaders are interested in learning more about it. One core aspect often talked about in cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature. The shift in control and decision-making from a centralized entity (person, corporation, or group) to a distributed network is referred to as decentralization in the blockchain. Better and fairer service can be accomplished by decentralizing resource utilization and access in an application. Some people believe that blockchains are by nature decentralized, yet decentralization is a range, with some platforms being more decentralized than others. Today, we&apos;ll look at the most decentralized crypto and why this matters. Decentralization - What is it and Why Does it Matter? A blockchain is akin to a distributed ledger. These databases are run on a network of nodes and are implemented in software. Anyone can participate in the network by running a node because bitcoin blockchains are permissionless, and the code for popular nodes is open source. Decentralized networks are intended to limit the amount of trust blockchain users must place in one another.

42407305,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxdi9,1651077652,Are Crypto ‘Legal Tender’ Laws Even Necessary?,"The Central African Republic, a landlocked country in sub-Saharan Africa and roughly the size of Texas, has passed a law that will integrate crypto into its economy. This makes it the second country after El Salvador to give crypto equal footing among fiat currencies.  However, the country is not exactly replicating the Great Salvadoran Bitcoin Experiment, the republic's Minister of Digital Economy, Post and Telecommunications Justin Gourna Zacko, who introduced the bill, has said.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Crypto will now be accepted for tax payments, and can be used to settle private transactions across the country, Zacko said. So the move is more like a country legalizing crypto use in financial markets than explicitly elevating bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies as “legal tender.”  Just a few years ago, it would have seemed crazy if a country like El Salvador or the Central African Republic embraced crypto. The technology is still largely experimental, even if the industry itself is a massive wealth creator and lucrative source for tax revenues.  In fact, months before Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced the Central American country would go full-bore into bitcoin, an esteemed Georgetown University professor of economics, James Angel, told The Node it was unlikely central banks would ever bulk up on bitcoin.  Gold, for governments, is “Armageddon insurance,” Angel said. Crypto – the volatile, purely synthetic, non-state version of fiat currencies – is itself a bit of a doomsday tech.  But here we are, with the dominoes starting to fall. Notably, the democratically elected “shadow government in Myanmar, ousted from power after a military junta, calls the tether (USDT) stablecoin its official currency. There are other bills in other countries that are also seeking to level crypto up.  In January, an Arizona state senator reintroduced a bill to make bitcoin legal tender in the state, after a similar initiative failed to make the ballot in 2020. It’s unlikely that bill will go anywhere, political commentators noted.  Others have raised deeper questions about the nature of “legal tender” laws, asking whether they are even necessary or hold true to crypto’s endgame of separating money from the state. In the U.S., for instance, willing participants can basically transact with whomever they want using whatever type of money they want.  See also: Did Bitcoin Just Become Legal Tender in Switzerland?  Further, several U.S. states had or have accepted crypto payments at tax time. (I have no idea why anyone would want to give their addresses to the government, opening up surveillance of their entire transaction history!)  Public works  For his part, Zacko said integrating crypto would help reduce fees for financial transactions in and out of his country. It might also be a bit of a salvo for a country that has experienced on-again, off-again civil conflict, and where crypto adoption was already picking up.  He also spoke to the importance of being ahead of the curve, and appearing technologically progressive.  Critics in the country expressed “strong reservations” about the law (which passed unanimously because opponents reportedly abstained), including money laundering risks and potential impacts on foreign direct investment or international aid.  Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and U.S. government have been widely critical of El Salvador’s bitcoin plans, and the country’s credit was downgraded. It’s not clear yet whether bitcoin will be worth those costs, considering adoption has been relatively slow.  The Central African Republic will also invest in “infrastructure development” to galvanize crypto use. Reportedly, only 11% of the republic’s approximately 5 million citizens have access to the internet while 30% have mobile phones.  See also: The Internet Is a Right, Not a Luxury  Crypto may be about separating money from “the state,” but it’s entirely possible that the best effects from this law come from the government investing in its people.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/27/are-crypto-legal-tender-laws-even-necessary,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64bd8d440dbc67e1dea5f0f3defbbede009c2330-2048x1537.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The expansion, which will be one of the largest among its peers, will take place in phases. An initial 400 megawatt (MW) of capacity will be developed with immersion-cooled computers on 265 acres of land, with mining and hosting operations expected to commence in July 2023, the company said in a statement.  Riot estimates the total cost of the first phase of the expansion will be about $333 million, which is scheduled to be invested over the remainder of 2022, 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.  After completing the first 400MW phase, future capacity at Riot’s site will be expanded by an additional 600MW to 1 GW.  “Upon completion of the expansion, Riot’s developed capacity will total 1.7 GW, establishing the Company among the largest bitcoin mining operations globally,” said Riot CEO Jason Les in the statement.  On April 1, Riot said it filed for the sale of up to $500 million in shares from time to time, otherwise known as an “at-the-market” (ATM) offering, proceeds of which may be used for investments in existing and future projects. It also said in its recent presentation that the company has about $312.3 million in cash.  The expansion site is within the two hours of Riot’s Whinstone facility, which has a total power capacity of 750MW with 400MW currently developed.  Riot will partner with bitcoin mining energy services company, Priority Power, for site development management, utility interconnection, power purchase agreements and power load flexibility.  On April 5, Riot said that by January of next year, the company expects to have a self-mining hashrate capacity of 12.8 EH/s and upon full deployment of all currently contracted mining rigs, its total self-mining fleet will consume about 370MW of energy.  In addition to the company’s self-mining operations, Riot hosts approximately 200MW of institutional bitcoin mining clients at its facilities.

The crypto trends show a mixture of both positive market growth and recession, which is typical of the volatile nature of Cryptocurrencies. The condition of the crypto market is thus analyzed by looking at the characteristics of Bitcoin and stronger altcoins such as Ethereum. Negative Influences on the Crypto Market in 2022 Initial projections predicted that Bitcoin would hit price highs of up to 100,000 USD in 2022. However, it is experiencing a bear market condition, with its value at 40,000 USD falling by more than 25% from its peak value of 68,000 USD. The strong positive association between Bitcoin and other Altcoin means that the weaker coins are experiencing a similar fate which puts the market in a recession.

42422826,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qLZh,1651071600,"Founders Fund, Pantera Invest in DeFi Investment Bank Ondo Finance","Ondo Finance, a protocol aiming to accelerate the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) among mainstream investors by mitigating risk, has raised $20 million in a Series A round co-led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and crypto firm Pantera Capital.  Ondo Finance software finds investments across traditional and decentralized finance and packages them into more investor-friendly risk/reward balanced offerings for institutional and retail investors.  Structured products are a common part of traditional finance that’s well suited for the lower-cost execution of decentralized finance, Ondo Finance founder and CEO Nathan Allman told CoinDesk in an interview.  DeFi “lets us open up access to these sorts of instruments that are otherwise very expensive to administer to the smaller retail investors,” said Allman, who co-founded Ondo with fellow Goldman Sachs (GS) trading veteran Pinku Surana.  How it works  The first Ondo Finance offering was decentralized structured products, investment vaults split evenly between two tokens where one represents a lower risk fixed investment position and the other a variable position with more risks but the chance for higher rewards. The funded vault is invested into a liquidity pool on an automated market maker like Uniswap or SushiSwap for a fixed period of time.  Once the vault expires, fixed investors are paid their investment plus a fixed percentage yield and variable investors get whatever is left of the excess return.  For example, a recent vault paired BOND, the native token of the DeFi risk protocol BarnBridge, for fixed investors with the USDC stablecoin for variable investors. The vault was listed on Uniswap and expired on April 18. Fixed investors received a 35.12% yield and variable investors had a 283% yield.  The vault idea was then expanded to include a liquidity-as-a-service solution that matches decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) with underwriters to supply liquidity to the DAO’s native token, allowing users to trade the token in decentralized exchanges. Ondo said it has partnered with more than 10 DAOs includingTerra, Frax and Fei, and had more than $200 million in liquidity deposited into the protocol.  DAO PlansOndo Finance is also planning its own decentralized autonomous organization and native ONDO token.  Read More: Pantera Capital Set to Close $1.3B Blockchain Fund  The token will provide voting rights in the DAO, which will include the ability to control components of the smart contracts and to dictate some strategic decisions like partnerships with chains and stablecoins. The tokens will initially be globally non-transferrable, meaning the tokens can’t be sold in a secondary market, Allman told CoinDesk, partly to give Ondo time to set up liquidity mining to drive adoption.  “Token holders themselves will get to vote on when trading [of the token] should start,” said Allman.  Roadmap  Founders Fund and Pantera Capital have about $11 billion and $6 billion in assets under management, respectively.  Strategic investors joining the Ondo Finance funding round included Coinbase Ventures and Tiger Global. The capital will help Ondo expand its current 17-person team with hires across engineering, marketing and product development.  Ondo is working to launch a second version of the vaults, which provide more structural flexibility. The vaults are in test deployments on Curve and Convex to earn yield from algorithm-backed stablecoins. Ondo bundles multiple assets into each vault to offset the higher risks of the algorithmic stablecoins.  The funding will also help drive Ondo’s multichain expansion, which would involve bridging liquidity from multiple blockchains into a single vault. Ondo would use the bridges for the users, mitigating the risks of exploits that have become a common problem for bridge protocols.  “Multichain is a pretty huge part of our mission and value proposition,” Allman said.

42421179,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd55x,1651071045,Chad Knight: NFT Artist for the Wilder World,"If you were scrolling through social media in 2018, then chances are you came across one of contemporary artist Chad Knight’s artworks shared by millions of people – mainly because his 3D work “Release” was erroneously described as a kinetic water sculpture in Japan. There was no talk of the metaverse at the time, but Knight’s seemingly realistic art that blurred the lines between digital and physical (“are chad knight sculptures real” is still a Google search suggestion) was a sign of the art and indeed the line of work he would later pursue.  Knight’s a contemporary artist in the most contemporary sense of the word: He’s deeply embedded in the white-hot non-fungible token (NFT) space both as a practitioner and as a commentator. He’s recently taken up a job as head of cyberware for Wilder World, a metaverse built on Ethereum and 3D creation software Unreal Engine.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  What’s most striking in Knight’s approach to art is his desire to embed himself in emerging technology and continuously learn new software – a recurring theme in this interview. And contributing to the aesthetics of the metaverse, he has (fortunately for him) no option but to master cutting-edge technology.  Although his style is resolutely digital, Knight counts among his artistic influences Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Claudio Coello, Peter Paul Rubens and Caravaggio. Digital artists Virgil Abloh and Archan Nair have also influenced his art, but without a doubt, Knight’s digital sculptures with mind-bending 3D drawings are way too distinct to be mistaken for someone else’s work, even for art newbies.  Knight may be at heart of the NFT-powered metaverse, but he doesn’t actively mint his personal artwork (a distinction he carefully makes in this interview) as NFTs at the moment. As he explains, the market demand for NFTs currently lies in PFPs, or collectibles that are used as profile pictures on social media. But unlike many artists with open disdain for PFPs, Knight cherishes them. He considers them as some sort of visual identity prototypes that can later be adopted in the metaverse.  Before entering the NFT space – or the metaverse – Knight was head of 3D design at Nike for over 10 years. He quit that job last year and turned the liberation that comes with resignation into a solo exhibition titled ""Two Week Notice."" And it was thanks to the exhibition’s title that his family found out he had just left Nike.  It’s not all art in Knight’s background, however. From 1998 to 2011, he was a professional skateboarder. So naturally, his skateboarding friends, perplexed by NFTs, turn to Knight for an explanation. We did the same.  Knight, a speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus festival in June, spoke with CoinDesk from his home in Portland, Oregon.  What is it like heading up cyberware for Wilder World? And what else are you up to these days?  I've been in that role for about three months now. I've been really focused on setting up the framework, identifying partners and brands that we're going to bring in, doing my first line and also helping work with the team on the avatar system and things like that. I've been doing a lot of art – personal art – and not so focused on NFTs. Just trying to kind of give that space a little bit of room to breathe.  The other thing that I'm currently working on, with my friend Jesse Grushack, is a piece for Burning Man that we're going to submit this year. I’ve never been, and I thought it would be fun to try to build something out there.  Sounds pretty cool! But what do you actually mean by that distinction between “personal art” and NFT art? Not immediately obvious to me …  Well, that's a good question. I'm not creating it for a certain project or for the intention of “OK, it's part of this collection, and I'm going to try to sell it here.”  I feel like being an artist is like you're constantly going down your own rabbit hole. And starting to have to focus on business things like infrastructure and business plans really pull you out of that rabbit hole. And it almost tweaks how you think a little bit, so I've just been doing it personally. I guess what I mean is – I'm doing it for myself. A lot of it is to continue to learn new software, explore new techniques and things like that. I get a lot of enjoyment out of it. It's just kind of how this all started anyway.  And I think that it's a very cyclical market. I feel like art isn't the thing that people are super interested in right now. But it was a passion of mine long before NFTs, so I'm just still making art. And I've got some projects that I'm working on. But again, it's like trying to be, I guess, a little bit more thoughtful too, now that I understand what the technology is and the opportunities are with NFTs.  I think that there's not enough collectors right now – that’s the problem. There's only so many people to buy stuff up, and there's a lot of people who've gotten into it now because they just want to. It's not an investment, it's just a way of flipping and making money. And now, it's all focused on the PFPs [profile picture collectibles], and not as much focused on the art. A year ago, if people wanted to get into it, art was their entry point.  Yeah, and actually before the NFT boom, people would talk about “crypto art,” and that term has now disappeared.  Yeah, and I think it was nice. It would be nice to have some differentiation in NFTs and not call them all just NFTs because you know, we don't refer to the things in our world as “anything” and call them all the same thing. You're gonna have art, music; you're gonna have any items that you own in the metaverse that you utilize, any possessions, skill sets that your character has – it's all going to be NFTs. But it’s gonna be a little bit confusing when we just refer to everything as the same thing.  Many people who quit probably dream of quitting in a way that kind of compensates for years of toil, or they perhaps at least want to celebrate that feeling of liberation that comes with it. So in many ways people can relate to what you did, I guess. Can you tell me what it meant to you on a personal level, when making that step and then celebrating it through art?  It's funny, because ""Two Weeks Notice"" – the title – is how my family found out that I quit my job too.  And yeah, it was a significant step for me, and it's scary in a way, but I knew that I was safe to do it. Now that I'm working with a team again, I realized through that hiatus of not having meetings and things like that, I really didn't miss that team dynamic of problem-solving with the group and working with them. Building something new is exciting, but I used to sit in meetings from nine to six every single day. Nike’s a very meeting-heavy company. So from that perspective, it was incredibly freeing to be able to have time to do my own thing, and it wasn't like a second job; it was something I could totally focus on.  I’m actually surprised that Nike wouldn't give its artists the breathing space for them to be creative and instead put them in a series of meetings?  Well, that's true for the designers doing the work. I oversaw the team. So I was working with other teams to figure out how we integrate it better and so on. I loved that job. It’s just, you know, there's so many times you can be told “no” and beat your head against the wall with bureaucracy, and I think that's going to be true at any big corporation.  But that's why I just felt so good to be able to get out and work with a smaller team and actually be able to really do something. I feel like I'm actually participating in building the future and not just kind of sitting there feeling like I'm arm's length from it or but actually contributing to it. And that means a lot to me.  So what’s the work life at Wilder World like?  The Wilder World leadership team has been working on [the project] for three or four years. They've got a whole social software, part of their marketplace and everything. So all the communications happen there.  They have so much tech foundation built, so it's perfect timing for creatives to be able to come in and help put that second layer on it now. They've got the technology part, and now we get to start figuring out what all this stuff looks like that goes on top of it.  It’s already been an awesome learning experience, but there are little gaps here and there [due to] my lack of understanding about how some of the gaming elements work.  But I just wanna say that’s another reason that I'm so excited to be part of [the Wilder World] team is that everybody on it has this very tangible understanding of where the metaverse is headed. And we're getting to throw the dart out as far as we think we can see it going and build for that, and it's super exciting.  You have recently asked your Twitter followers, “Do you know the difference between digital and virtual?” Can you break down that difference?  OK, so this was something that clicked for me a couple of years ago. And was through having to try to explain that 3D is different from data technology. Digital is a language of 0s and 1s. It's a way of communicating information – it's a language that enables people to speak with computers, computers to be able to process information. So there's real data, which is sound waves and geometry – and that's how we experience the world.  And then you've got analog signals, which break down into electrical. So, again, because real, analog, digital needs certain languages that enable something to be experienced, and the experience part of it is virtual in the digital realm.  So, in the analog realm, audio is a good example of something that isn't the virtual part of it. You're not experiencing the analogue signal, and so something can use it to produce something, and it's the same thing with computers.  And I think it's just been the same thing for a Word document. It's a virtual piece of paper that you're writing on. And I think the 2D experience is so foreign to humans that it's been a weird transition, and it's kind of hard for us to wrap our heads around it. But, if you can measure something, you can simulate it. And you can pretty much measure anything in this world. So I think that there's not much limitation in terms of where we're headed.  I like that axiom, “if you can measure something, you can simulate it.” Can you elaborate on that?  I guess it's like, everything can be answered with a yes or no, right? And it goes back to true or false. Let's say audio – we can take the data from an audio file, and each beat or each sound in it can be measured on a 1 to 10 scale, 0 to 10. And then it can be applied to anything else or be recreated because as long as you can measure it and understand how it was created, then you can recreate it yourself.  So it’s like, structured messy data still gives you something to work with. … And that’s sort of the idea behind “generative art,” isn’t it?  Yup!  Let's take a step back and talk about digital versus physical, especially in the context of that viral 2018 artwork of yours, which supposedly showed a Japanese kinetic waterfall. How did you feel about the whole thing?  I thought it was hysterical. Artist Filip Hodas had a pink volcano explosion that went viral like 10 years ago, and I remember thinking it was the coolest thing to be able to convince all these people that that was a real thing. So that was something I always had in the back of my mind, not a goal but a little bit of a dream scenario.  I would even put like locations on my posts just to kind of screw with people a little bit, I guess. But when it happened, it was very rewarding too, because it's like “wow, I finally achieved photorealism.” I finally did something that people look at and can have that switch of perception to think it is real! That was pretty cool to experience. I don't understand any of the backstories about why people thought it was in Japan and all these things – super weird. But again, I was flattered by it – that’s the best way to say it.  As an artist, how do you feel about the current PFP trend, which as you said earlier, currently dominates the NFT market?  I think PFPs are super interesting! In my opinion, these are just like pictures; they're like the driver's license of your avatar. And eventually, these PFPs will be in 3D and they'll be in an avatar form. But right now, we're again in that weird space where people don't really understand what it is that they're owning. But I think it's really unique because it's evolving the technology, and it's evolving the experience that people are having with them. So in that regard, I think it's awesome. Again, they're just pictures of cartoon animals, pictures of entities that will exist in these characters and that should be existing as your persona in a virtual world, and this is just their little identifier.  NFTs are super controversial right now – plenty of people outside crypto hate them. So from an artist's perspective, who gets the NFT world and participates in it? What are the reactions you get from your artist peers who are not into NFTs?  That's a good question. I think that I tend to usually surround myself with pretty like-minded people, or people who are interested in the same things. So initially, early on, people were asking about it, like “what is it?” But at this point, all my friends are in this space and understand it really well. I have a very small group of friends too, and I have friends from skateboarding, and they've inquired about it, but it's mainly just like a “what is it?”  Do you feel like, getting more embedded in the NFT world, that your community, your circle of friends, have gone from offline to online? I guess the pandemic has obviously played its role too.  And yeah, for sure! I think a lot of artists like me have realized that they need to pull back every once in a while and be a little bit less immersed in it.  I’m getting ready to move out of Portland to head down, close to my son, down in the LA area. And that's part of the reason I'm excited to go to LA, because so many [artists] moved there. We'll get to actually physically hang out and get out of our heads together every once in a while.  Oh, man … I feel like it's been such chaos for the last year – and then resetting this year.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/27/chad-knight-nft-artist-for-the-wilder-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cf8ecd735f93b90b6309535bed29bc04949e7f1-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This cryptocurrency&apos;s adoption rate has an annual surge of 113% based on Coinshares data. Compared to the internet, which has a rate of 63%, it&apos;s definitely picking up fast and attracting more people. Hence, when El Salvador announced on September 7, 2021, that it would make bitcoin a legal tender, it brought about a new perspective on the possibilities of bitcoin in the future and its role. With El Salvador taking the lead on bitcoin adoption, several countries are finally pushing to make crypto a legal tender in their countries. Bills have been crafted and presented to the government. They touch on how Bitcoin will operate as a legal tender in countries such as Paraguay and Panama. Most of these countries are currently learning and identifying what impact the move to move could have and may soon join El Salvador. What Bitcoin as a Legal Tender Means Legal tender refers to any form of money that must be accepted in all debt forms or meet a financial obligation such as legal fees, taxes, or contracts. For example, in the United States, Federal Reserve notes and coins are recognized as legal tender. However, note that not all businesses have to accept a legal tender as payment for goods and services. A store can choose to accept cash or any other legal tender as they can develop their policies.

42374828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2uaV,1651067660,First Mover Americas: When $1M Bitcoin?,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: BitMEX co-founder and former CEO foresees bitcoin rallying to $1 million in 10 years. The bullish forecast is based on expectation that current account surplus countries will abandon dollar-denominated assets for bitcoin and hard assets like gold.  Chartist's Corner: Ether-bitcoin ratio in stasis.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Vance Spencer, co-founder, Framework Ventures  Chris Perkins, president, CoinFund  Mary-Catherine Lader, chief operating officer, Uniswap  Market Moves  How high can bitcoin fly in the long run? Probably $1 million, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto spot and derivatives exchange BitMEX.  In an essay titled ""The Doom Loop,"" published Wednesday, Hayes argued that the West's decision to freeze Russia's forex reserves and push the country out of the global payments messaging system SWIFT has set the stage for a so-called doom loop where the current account surplus nations stop investing in dollar-denominated assets like Treasuries and move into bitcoin (BTC) and gold. The U.S., then, would be forced to print even more money to finance its deficits, which, in turn, would bring more hedging demand for perceived inflation hedges like bitcoin.  ""The shock of canceling the world's largest energy producer [Russia] from the dominant Western financial system cannot be undone,"" Hayes wrote. ""If [current account] surplus countries, most of which are outside the core Western axis, decide they would rather save in gold, hard commodities, and/or Bitcoin, then they will not purchase Western debt assets.""  Countries running current account surplus are net lenders, meaning they park their money into bonds of other nations, helping finance their fiscal deficits. For instance, China, a current account surplus country, is one of the biggest buyers of U.S. Treasuries. The constant demand for Treasuries from China keeps yields or borrowing costs from rising sharply (although they can and do rise due to other factors like expected Fed tightening).  However, if China moves away from Treasuries and into bitcoin and hard assets, the U.S. would have to finance its deficit via domestic lenders or have the central bank print money and buy the government debt, according to Hayes, who pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act in February.  The latter, popularly known as quantitive easing, can be inflationary, strengthening the case for investing in bitcoin and gold. According to Hayes, the Fed would be forced to launch yield curve control (YCC), a sort of perpetual QE, which involves targeting a longer-term bond yield by a central bank, then buying or selling as many bonds as necessary to hit that objective. The Bank of Japan has been running the yield curve control program for six years and steps up liquidity-boosting bond purchases every time the 10-year yield threatens to penetrate the 0.25% cap.  ""When it is finally implicitly or explicitly declared, it's game over for the value of the USD vs. gold and, more importantly, bitcoin. YCC is how we get to $1 million bitcoin and $10,000 to $20,000 gold. There is no other politically palatable option, and the actions against Russia all but assure that YCC is coming sooner than you think,"" Hayes noted.  Hayes pointed to a supposedly impending break up of the European Union as another bullish catalyst for bitcoin.  Hayes pointed to the supposedly-impending break up of the European Union (EU) as another bullish catalyst for bitcoin.  ""The ECB [European Central Bank] is trapped, the EU is finished, and within the decade we will be trading Lira, Drachmas, and Deutschmarks once more."" Hayes wrote. ""As the union disintegrates, money shall be printed in glorious quantities in a pantheon of different local currencies. Hyperinflation is not off the table. And again, as European savers smell what the rock is cookin’, they will flee into hard assets like gold and Bitcoin. The breakup of the EU = $1 million bitcoin.""

Here, users can interact, buy land, play games, and attend events in a virtual space. A recent report suggests that the overall metaverse market was worth more than $30B in 2021. By 2030, the figure is expected to grow at a compounded rate of 39.4%. Features such as AR/VR technologies, decentralization, and virtual economies are major contributors to the metaverse growth.

Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, parent company of CoinDesk.  Upstate Interactive builds distributed applications and smart contracts on Ethereum, supporting decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and diverse software projects for the modern enterprise, according to a statement. The Upstate Interactive team will be integrated across Foundry's multiple business lines and will help with various products and services related to the infrastructure layer of digital assets to institutions.  Web 3 refers to the next iteration of the internet that promotes decentralized protocols and aims to reduce dependency on large tech companies, shifting power to individual users who can participate in the governance and operation of the protocols directly.  “The passion and skills of everyone on Upstate Interactive’s team complements those that we have at Foundry,” said CEO Mike Colyer. “This acquisition will build on our mission to shape the future of decentralization from right here in upstate New York,” he added.  The deal came about after Upstate helped Foundry with user interface/experience (UI/UX) development for Foundry's staking service. “Through collaborating on the staking site and portal, both companies discovered that working together and combining expertise would unlock the potential to empower a decentralized infrastructure on a much larger scale,” according to the statement.  Foundry launched its staking business last year to provide services to institutions related to various proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain networks.  Foundry didn’t disclose the terms of the deal but said it will close at the end of April and all Upstate Interactive employees will be joining the company at the beginning of May.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/27/foundry-to-buy-web-3-company-upsate-interactive-to-expand-blockchain-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b92171b9492a76354368dfdd67a143af6a2a536-6500x3500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407288,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSmK,1651063683,"Crypto, Cannabis and SAFE Banking","The U.S. Senate continues to deny the cannabis industry access to digital payments and banking, forcing retailers to endure increasingly deadly and more frequent armed robberies. Crypto payments offer an immediate alternative to involuntarily unbanked businesses forced to operate in cash. Promoting this form of payment adoption is a prudent, timely and well-tailored public policy response from lawmakers and regulators who can’t wait for Congress to protect cannabis businesses and their communities.  Continued federal failure to provide legal cannabis retailers with access to banking and electronic payments has deadly real world consequences for the cannabis industry nationwide. While state and local cannabis regulators across the country plead with Congress to pass the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act to fix this, all-cash cannabis businesses continue to provide attractive, opportune and lucrative targets for armed robberies by violent criminals willing to kill employees and others in their way.  Khurshid Khoja serves as board chair emeritus of the National Cannabis Industry Association. The views expressed herein are his own. The piece is part of Payments Week.  This year’s “4/20” [April 20] holiday alone was forecasted to generate $130 billion in sales for legal cannabis retailers in the U.S. However, currently less than 800 U.S. banks are willing to bank the cash proceeds of those sales or provide access to cashless payments.  The predictable result is the presence of large honey pots of cash on-site at most cannabis retail businesses. When combined with the purported unwillingness of some law enforcement in certain jurisdictions to protect legal cannabis businesses, the criminal opportunities are irresistible to some.  Read more: Drugs, Drugs and More Drugs: Crypto on the Dark Web  The number of institutions that currently bank cannabis businesses is miniscule. They take on significant regulatory risk, proceeding under existing (but non-binding) Obama-era U.S. Department of Treasury guidelines that neither codify any safe harbors or provide any legal certainty, but do significantly increase their costs of complying with federal banking regulations nonetheless.  Notwithstanding the grave threat to public safety, the Senate has repeatedly failed to take action on the SAFE Banking Act, which would provide safe harbor under anti-money-laundering laws – and legal certainty – to those federally chartered institutions willing to bank cannabis.  Read More: Why Banks and Payment Processors Shun Perfectly Legal Businesses  In theory, this would multiply the ranks of these institutions and make banking services more accessible to the cannabis industry as a whole. The Senate’s failure is underscored by the fact that the House of Representatives has passed some version of the SAFE Banking Act on at least six occasions – most recently by including it in the House version of the America COMPETES Act.  Cryptocurrency payments are not only a viable and necessary public policy alternative to the all-cash status quo, they offer a superior alternative to the federally regulated banking system and traditional payment rails even after the Senate acts to provide cannabis businesses with access under the SAFE Banking Act.  When weighing the mounting costs of continued inaction, it would be difficult to argue that exploring digital payments that are technically feasible, commercially available and lawfully accessible right now isn’t an obviously necessary step.  What might be less obvious is the advantages crypto payments have, relative to the banks and their digital payment rails even if the SAFE Banking Act passed.  Banking on crypto  Most regulators and industry advocates implicitly assume that passing SAFE will immediately improve access to banking and digital payments for all industry operators and quickly supplant cash payments. While passing SAFE is still a necessary legislative step toward providing equitable industry access to banking and merchant services, it is far from the only necessary step to minimize cash payments, and it is unlikely to produce quick results.  While the Act would ensure that a licensed cannabis retailer’s sales revenue would no longer be deemed the “proceeds of unlawful activity” under federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws, these deposits would still be subjected to heightened scrutiny and exhaustive “suspicious activity reporting” requirements by the banks under the same federal AML laws. Accepting these deposits would thus significantly increase a bank’s cost of compliance with federal regulations, costs which would be passed on to account holders through significantly increased fees; this is essentially the approach taken by U.S. banks currently willing to bank the dank.  It’s difficult to see how this would materially improve access to banking, especially for small, woman- and minority-owned businesses that are already unable to absorb those fees. Indeed, the Act includes an implicit admission that it may take years and additional steps before these businesses are able to access financial services on equitable terms.  When contrasted with the ease of tracking transactions through a transparent, open and widely accessible public blockchain, the advantages of crypto payments seem obvious. Payments recorded upon the blockchain already provide relevant and immutable transaction data to determine whenever any volume of unlawfully originated funds flow through a licensed cannabis business – provided law enforcement does the constitutionally-necessary work of identifying public wallet addresses that are of legitimate concern.  No reporting mandates are necessary, and no third-party intermediaries need to be compelled to provide access to transaction data.  Under the circumstances, promoting the adoption of cryptocurrency payments among cannabis retailers is not just our best alternative, it is a moral imperative.  Read more: Why the Marijuana Industry Needs Crypto  Congress absolutely must act to pass the SAFE Banking Act as soon as possible. But cannabis businesses, consumers and regulators should stop waiting for Congress to act first to protect public safety. Instead, they should press state and local lawmakers on the urgency of adopting cryptocurrency payment alternatives and demand enabling legislation to facilitate this adoption – like bills permitting the payment of cannabis business taxes in cryptocurrency.  And while some far-sighted elected officials in legal cannabis jurisdictions are already championing the idea of accepting crypto for taxes (like Colorado Governor Jared Polis and New York Mayor Eric Adams), we need many more like them and much more to be done. State and local legislators should step in immediately to protect public safety by empowering their cannabis regulators to take deliberate steps toward fully integrating crypto payment solutions into existing cannabis point-of-sale and compliance systems. Doing so will keep lawful, tax-paying and job-producing businesses afloat.

However, Blockmetrix CEO and co-founder Nevin Bannister told CoinDesk the proceeds from the new funding will go towards expanding its operations, including buying more mining machines and investing in joint ventures (JVs) to build infrastructure.  “This is what we call our colo-light strategy, wherein Blockmetrix partners with an industry-leading colocation developer and operator by contributing equity and functioning as an anchor tenant for the new venture,” Bannister said, adding that the JV partner will provide all of the developmental and operational expertise. “This allows Blockmetrix to significantly control our energy cost and secure locations for our rigs, while having a retained equity interest in the facility with no operational requirement.”  Blockmetrix’s current average hashrate is around 0.32 exahash per second (EH/s) and plans to expand it by more than 200% to 1 EH/s by the end of this year once the remainder of the mining rigs arrive and are plugged in. The year-end hashrate projection doesn’t include potential mergers or acquisitions of existing miners, which the company is currently considering, Bannister said.

This new regulatory principle by the British overseas territory’s financial regulator states that a distributed ledger technology (DLT) provider must maintain the integrity of any market in which it participates, according to a press release Wednesday.  The principle, which crypto companies will have to follow, addresses a longstanding concern. Market manipulation has been an “increasing risk” among DLT companies, Albert Isola, minister for digital and financial services at Gibraltar’s government, said back in 2020.  Market integrity is essential for a fair, orderly and efficient market and factors in monitoring for manipulative trading and other forms of market abuse, high disclosure standards and robust consumer protection, a note by the government said.  The legislation states that a DLT provider will need to implement measures to prevent, or  mitigate the effects of any type of manipulation of prices, liquidity or market information and prevent employees from engaging in insider trading, according to guidance published alongside the policy.  The new legislation was drafted with the help of a specialist market integrity working group made up of government representatives and leaders in the blockchain and digital asset space.  The focus on market integrity is another principle the country's financial regulator is emphasizing, on top of another nine that companies are already required to follow. These principles emphasize integrity, business management, governance, financial crime, contingency arrangements and more.  Back in 2017, Gibraltar released a regulatory package for distributed ledger technology that allowed crypto companies to get a license if they complied with the existing principles.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/27/gibraltars-government-targets-crypto-market-manipulation-with-new-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/490c42018db3223d327a89c36d34a8873e7c39df-5419x3613.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420817,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcTF,1651059000,So What if the Ethereum Foundation Holds Fiat?,"ETH devs connect in Amsterdam  This past Monday capped off the final day of Devconnect – a week-long gathering for Ethereum developers organized by the Ethereum Foundation (EF). The conference in Amsterdam overlapped with 4/20 (or April 20, apparently a working holiday in Ethereum-land), but the real draw was the expert talks on everything from maximum extractable value (ooh) to applied zero-knowledge technology (ahh).  The Devconnect itinerary was jam-packed with panels and presentations featuring everyone from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to pseudonymous crypto-sage Hasu.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The conference also aligned with the release of the Ethereum Foundation’s 2022 annual report, marking the first time the organization has publicly disclosed a summary of its finances.  In the report, the non-profit steward of the Ethereum ecosystem disclosed that it holds around 0.3% of all ether (ETH). While there’s been a good bit of reporting on this number, you could have just looked up the EF’s Ethereum address yourself if ever you wanted to know how much ETH was in the organization’s treasury.  What’s more interesting is that in addition to $1.3 billion in ETH and $11 million in other cryptocurrencies, the EF disclosed that it holds $300 million in non-crypto investments.  Fiat to the moon?  While it would be easy to poke fun at the Ethereum Foundation for holding some of its treasury in cold, hard, government-issued cash, I don’t agree with the Twitter critics who say this signals the EF doesn’t have faith in ETH as a true store of value.  It’s not anti-Ethereum to admit that ETH still suffers from relatively high volatility, so having a bunch of fiat on hand to invest and pay the bills makes sense on a practical level.  Mind you, the Ethereum Foundation hasn’t always been so flush with cash. Crypto journalist Laura Shin recorded the Ethereum Foundation’s rocky financial past in her recently published (and highly entertaining) history of Ethereum, “The Cryptopians.”  The Ethereum Foundation, which is registered as a Swiss non-profit, was formed in 2014 to manage the original ETH token distribution event and serve as an official hub for Ethereum ecosystem development.  Around 3 million ETH (or 5% of the initial ETH supply) went to a long-term EF endowment, according to crypto research firm Messari, but – as Shin notes in her book – a large portion of that ETH was sold in Ethereum’s earlier years to keep the fledgling project afloat.  Throughout its early history, the Ethereum Foundation was apparently plagued by financial mismanagement, enough to nearly imperil the entire project.  While $300 million is a whole lot of fiat, a diverse investment portfolio could go a long way toward helping the EF (and perhaps Ethereum as a whole) weather the storm should ETH ever take a major hit to its price.  Following the money  In addition to providing a breakdown of the EF treasury, the report includes details on how the treasury has been used to spur ecosystem growth over the past year.  The EF said it spent $48 million last year to continue its mission of growing the Ethereum ecosystem. “Approximately $20 million of this total was in the form of external spending, which includes grants, delegated domain allocations, third party funding, bounties, and sponsorships,” according to the report. “The remaining $28 million was used to fund teams and projects within the EF community.”  In its report, the EF spoke about how it has partnered with third-party organizations like Gitcoin to use quadratic funding to reward grants to public goods projects.  In Ethereum development, “public goods” refer to infrastructure which benefits the broader Ethereum ecosystem and development community. Organizations like Gitcoin award grants to public goods according to a community vote. They use “quadratic funding” – a simple mathematical formula – to ensure the largest projects don’t run away with all of the funding.  Keep an eye out for a future edition of this newsletter to hear a bit more about my thoughts on the advantages (and disadvantages) of what Gitcoin calls an “optimal” method of public goods funding.  A shadow of a merge  EF report aside, no Ethereum newsletter can end without some mention of The Merge – Ethereum’s upcoming shift in consensus mechanisms.  As Devconnect was wrapping up this past weekend, developers could be found huddled together in conference rooms to monitor the second shadow fork of the Ethereum mainnet. If you’ve been following along the past few weeks, you may recall hearing about shadow forks, which are like practice runs of Ethereum’s transition into a proof-of-stake network.  Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko gives a more detailed overview of shadow forks in his Ethereum Roadmap FAQ – a solid visit if you’re looking for a more in-the-weeds update on how the Merge is progressing.  Per Beiko’s FAQ: “TL;DR: a shadow fork is a new devnet created by forking a live network with a small number of nodes. The shadow fork keeps the same state & history, and can therefore replay transactions from the main network.”  As for why shadow forks are important, Beiko explains that they “allow us to see how nodes react when The Merge happens using only a small number of nodes and without disrupting the canonical chain.”  Ethereum developers have been running shadow forks on Ethereum testnets for the past several weeks, and they ran the first shadow fork on Ethereum’s mainnet around two weeks ago.  A mainnet shadow fork is like the Mount Everest of shadow forks, simulating how the network will respond under the most realistic (read: most complicated) conditions.  While the past two mainnet forks have been “successful” – meaning the network was able to successfully transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake – node operators have run into issues that still need to be addressed before the actual Merge takes place (hopefully sometime later this year).

The fund will focus on all stages of blockchain and crypto companies creating “new digital economies.” Limited partners included global investment giants Tiger Global, KKR and Sequoia China, among others.  CoinDesk previously reported on the existence of the fund in January when regulatory filings showed a $500 million target.  The new Dragonfly Ventures III fund more than doubles the $300 million raised in the firm’s prior two funds combined. The new fund’s size puts Dragonfly in the same league as Sequoia Capital and Bain Capital, which each recently made nearly $600 million crypto commitments, and further proves that the venture capital frenzy that drove record high fund sizes last year hasn’t slowed down.  Founded in 2018, Dragonfly Capital’s investment portfolio includes smart contracts platform Avalanche, layer 1 blockchain platform Near Protocol, DAI token creator MakerDAO and zkSync creator Matter Labs, among others.  The new fund will allow Dragonfly Capital to lead rounds in later-stage companies, Dragonfly Capital General Partner Tom Schmidt told CoinDesk in an email.  “Since inception, we have always backed founders at earliest stages, and continued to back our portfolio companies into later stages. We haven’t always had the funds to lead further rounds and double down on teams we believe in,” Schmidt said. “With Fund III, we can back teams throughout their lifecycle and new founders as their companies mature.”  Read more: A16z Forms Crypto Research and Coding Unit to Help Web 3 Startups",POSITIVE,DAI,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MKR | DAI | NEAR,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/27/dragonfly-capital-raises-650m-for-third-crypto-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/177942804e796ac5c9e1d741e6d8842244e85422-3800x2529.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The former cabinet secretary and one-time deputy chief of staff for Trump’s White House said she’ll help with funding and compliance strategies at the Zurich-based company, which aims to offer a compliance layer on decentralized finance (DeFi) contracts to satisfy government rules meant to combat money laundering. She arrives at her first crypto role on the heels of Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former budget head and acting chief of staff, who is also helping advise Astra on its upcoming plans for raising capital and its interactions with the U.S. government.  As the former top official for U.S. border security from 2017 to 2019, Nielsen became a well-known representative of Trump’s immigration policies and its hotly debated actions at the Mexican border. At Astra, she’ll help the startup with cybersecurity and the “global risk environment,” in addition to policy matters when they come up, according to the company.  “I’m fascinated and very excited by the DeFi evolution,” Nielsen said in an interview. “What we have been missing in DeFi is a layer of trust. Astra’s decentralized legal layer will assure regulatory compliance and enable efficient and fair dispute resolution.”  Astra Protocol is seeking to provide compliance without jeopardizing the decentralization of contracts, relying on a network of legal and audit firms around the world that can provide anti-money laundering services. However, the fledgling company hasn’t yet sought any U.S. regulatory approvals for its technology.  “We are able to connect users to experts in the decentralized legal network within seconds and minutes,” Nielsen said. She contends the advance will “add more trust from a regulatory perspective,” which will result in more mainstream traditional capital coming into the market, boosting retail adoption.  Bringing in Nielsen and Mulvaney could also help bolster ties to Republican officials and lawmakers, just as Washington braces itself for the midterm elections this year that could see the GOP make gains in Congress.  “Having been in charge of a key part of the U.S. government, Ms. Nielsen will play an essential role in helping us efficiently navigate an ever-changing governmental and regulatory landscape,” said Phil Hogan, the former European commissioner for trade who leads Astra’s advisory board, in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/27/former-homeland-security-official-nielsen-to-join-astra-as-adviser,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/523ee92b9e3aaf2c1ddea36976d9a268e8006ccc-5733x3822.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw30iR,1651055517,Bitcoin's Derivative Data Suggests Potential for 'Short Squeeze',"Macro traders expecting a continued decline in bitcoin (BTC) should look at the positioning in the derivatives market, or otherwise they risk being caught off guard by a potential short squeeze, which is a rapid move higher driven by bears abandoning their bearish bets.  For a short squeeze to occur, the market needs to have a higher-than-usual bearish activity. In such situations, a minor price bump can send bears or short sellers running to square off their positions, which, in turn, drives prices further up.  Open interest, or the number of open positions in bitcoin's perpetual futures market, rose to 256,752 BTC early this week, the second-highest daily tally in 365 days, surpassed. only by Jan. 4's total of 260,000 BTC, data provided by Arcane Research shows.  Most of these could be short positions, as data tracked by Laevitas shows the funding rate – the cost of holding long/short perpetual futures positions – has been consistently neutral to negative in recent weeks. A negative funding rate means shorts are paying longs to keep the bearish position open. In other words, the market is skewed bearish. That's also evident from the depressed futures premium, also known as the basis, on major exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity. The three-month premium recently slipped to 1.1% annualized on the CME and 2% on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by open interest and volume.  So, now if bitcoin turns higher, the cost of holding shorts will become a burden for traders holding bearish positions. And they could offload their bearish bets, putting upward pressure on prices. Bitcoin was last seen trading near 2% higher on the day near $38,900, according to CoinDesk data.  ""All [open interest] growth in late April has been accompanied by substantially negative funding rates, suggesting that shorts are the key aggressor while also implying some capitulation from longs after this leg downward,"" Arcane Research's Vetle Lunde wrote in a weekly research report shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday.  ""The sentiment, funding rates and futures basis [premium] suggest that shorts are the most confident. Thus, a short squeeze is possibly on the table,"" Lunde added.  While open interest in perpetual futures has increased, the number of open positions in regular futures remains depressed. Perpetual futures differ from regular futures as they lack predetermined expiry. So, perpetual futures positions can be held indefinitely without the need to square off or roll over positions ahead of the expiration date.  Open interest as a standalone indicator reveals only the amount of fiat money locked in the derivatives market.

42374848,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw30jh,1651055189,"Dogecoin, Terra Fall Steepest Among Major Cryptos as Long Traders Lose $280M","Declining sentiment for cryptocurrencies stemming from a poor economic outlook in broader markets led to a market-wide decline on Tuesday that caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for traders betting on higher prices, data shows.  Bitcoin (BTC) lost support at the pivotal $40,000 level on Tuesday evening, dropping to as low as $38,121 on Wednesday morning before a nominal increase during Asian trading hours. Ether (ETH) fell below $3,000 to as low as $2,781.  A fall in bitcoin and ether led to steep declines in other major assets. In the past 24 hours, dogecoin (DOGE) fell 10% after a two-day rally, while Terra’s LUNA dropped 7.2%. BNB Chain’s BNB and Solana’s SOL emerged as outperformers, falling just 2% as other assets fell at least 4%.  Some $281 million worth of “longs” were lost to liquidations on crypto-tracked futures, representing 81% of all futures trades in the past 24 hours. Liquidations in the crypto market happen when a trader has insufficient funds to fund a margin call – or a call for extra collateral demanded by the exchange to keep the trading position funded.  Overall, liquidations in the crypto market exceeded $350 million, the third-largest level in April. Over $128 million of that came from bitcoin-tracked futures, while $92 million arose from ether futures. Futures tracking dogecoin lost $24 million, which was similar to Tuesday’s loss.  Troubles in Asia and U.S. dent sentiment  The market-wide decline in cryptocurrencies on Tuesday arose amid falling optimism in the broader financial markets.  China continued to battle coronavirus outbreaks, leading to a fall in Asian markets, while the U.S. Federal Reserve inched closer to a key meeting next week, one that is expected to bring forth a big interest rate hike to tighten monetary policy in the country.  Russian troubles roiled equities in Europe. Reports suggest the country may cut gas supplies to the region, which may choke growth and stifle local economies. Russia has already cut off supply to Poland and Bulgaria, leading to a surge in European gas prices.  Sentiment, however, seemed to stabilize on Wednesday. Equities indexes in Europe were up since the open, with Stoxx 600 and Germany’s DAX rising 0.29%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures rose 1%, and the Shanghai Composite gained 2.5% as China vowed more infrastructure projects to bolster the local economy.  A relief in Asian and European markets saw bitcoin slightly recover, adding $500 since Asian morning hours on Wednesday. But failing to regain the $40,000 level could prove bearish for bitcoin, according to some analysts.  “Bitcoin has abruptly fallen below a critical support line, a bearish signal,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “At the same time, the uptrend breakdown failed to be confirmed by buying near previous local lows.”  Kuptsikevich, however, noted institutional investors withdrew considerably less capital from crypto exchanges compared with the previous week, citing CoinShares data. “The net outflow of funds last week was $7.2 million, although it was down from the previous two weeks when investors withdrew more than $231 million,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE,ASIA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/27/dogecoin-terra-fall-steepest-among-majors-as-long-traders-lose-280m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4bdc4b68baab84a7afaaf1004537d6939077e6ba-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

From banking to supply chains, it revolutionizes several aspects across businesses and industries of all sizes. The crypto market which was only worth $1 billion almost a decade ago, has now exploded into a massive $2 trillion industry and what originated with the Bitcoin blockchain, has evolved into a full-fledged crypto ecosystem with over 18000 different projects. Blockchain solutions have emerged to solve real-world problems. And one of the critical issues they are solving is preserving Natural Capital by avoiding gold mining. Gold mining is known for being among the world&apos;s most harmful industries. It displaces populations, taints drinking water, harms workers, and damages natural habitats. As a whole, gold mining has had such a negative influence that it is now jeopardizing people&apos;s health and ecosystems globally. Gold Mining&apos;s Devastating Environmental Effects Gold has been the most precious component of jewelry and a preferred mode of exchange for centuries. However, mining just one ounce of gold from ore can produce around 20 tons of solid waste.

Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, evolved in an immense way over the last ten years. Bitcoin is its first real use case, and it is now recognized as a global monetary network with a fixed supply that several countries have accepted as legal tender. Yet, blockchain&apos;s functionality doesn&apos;t end with Bitcoin. There are many prominent use-cases of blockchain technology that helped the crypto market accrue over $1.8 trillion in market cap. That too, despite little or no attention and participation in the early days of growth. The Scope of Blockchain-Powered Disruption Blockchain technology will be a disruptive force across industries. For example, it can transform the venture capital industry, reshaping how companies raise money with the help of tokenization. This in turn will help companies increase capital efficiency exponentially while enabling decentralization. Security Token Offerings (STOs) are a working use case in this regard. With STOs, startups can freely distribute tokens in the form of equity and raise capital in an adequately regulated manner. Gaming is another prominent industry that blockchain disrupts.

A few decades ago, the internet&apos;s acceptance rate was lower since individuals were unfamiliar with the innovative network. However, users began to rely on the web as part of their everyday life as years went by. Conversations around metaverse concepts are also gaining similar attention on the internet. By definition, a metaverse represents a digital universe where users interact through augmented or virtual realities. Metaverse further applies blockchain technology to enhance this digital environment with decentralization. While it may seem far-fetched, several prominent companies are already leveraging the ecosystem to build an online presence. At the same time, other iconic brands hope to use metaverse to improve their interactive strategies with customers. Among the companies that are onboard, the metaverse bandwagon includes: Facebook Facebook&apos;s journey into the metaverse began in October 2021 at an augmented virtual and reality conference. The event was meant to address the development of a digital universe where users can work and play.

""Bond-to-equity ratio of 60:40 has lost its luster: BOLD is the new 60:40. Gold's volatility is now lower than Nasdaq, but the yellow metal has offered better returns than tech stocks, tech stocks are falling because of peak internet.

While crypto ETPs have become widespread in Europe with more than 70 now listed, BOLD appears to the be the first that combines bitcoin and gold exposure.  Bitcoin has often been compared to gold becuase its perceived benefits in portfolios as a hedge against inflation.

Larger sizes mean more transactions can be included in each batch, but it can affect transaction times and overall network capacity.  Input Output said the 10% increase in block size network would help increase data throughput and scalability. The performance of decentralized applications, or services that rely on smart contracts, on Cardano is additionally expected to improve.  Input Output added it would monitor network performance and behavior closely over the next five days to determine the next required increase in block size. The previous increase came earlier in February when block sizes expanded from 72KB to 80KB at the time.  The step comes ahead of Cardano’s eventual Basho upgrade, which would introduce sidechains on the network. Sidechains are a separate blockchain network that connect to another blockchain – called a parent blockchain or mainnet – via a two-way peg.  Meanwhile, the fundamental improvement did little to buffer the price of Cardano’s ADA token amid a declining sentiment in the broader crypto market.  ADA fell 8.3% in the past 24 hours, one of the biggest losers among major tokens, as bitcoin (BTC) lost support at $40,000 and slumped to the $38,000 level.

42374868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw30kx,1651042800,Europe's Lawmakers Set to Advance Discussion of Controversial Crypto AML Rules,"Talks involving the European Union’s parliament, commission and council begin Thursday on controversial anti-money laundering rules for crypto transactions, the last stage towards the passage into law of measures that some have said could kill privacy and stifle innovation.  Many in the industry question the premise that tough new rules are needed against a tide of criminal behavior, but more pragmatic voices are looking at the legislative details that could prove crucial – such as how the law will treat small payments and unhosted wallets, as well as when the new law would take effect.  The draft legislation would require crypto providers to verify customer details and report suspicious transactions to the authorities – but the industry has complained it could prove burdensome to implement, and would end digital anonymity.  A last-minute protest led by Coinbase (COIN) and similar companies largely fell on deaf ears, and on March 31 European Parliament lawmakers voted to apply tough money-laundering rules to the sector, arguing the rules were needed to curb crime. Now, attention turns to what the final form of the law will be – where talks are reaching the closing stage.  Both lawmakers at the European Parliament and national government meeting in the EU’s Council have said they want to see tighter monitoring of which parties take part in crypto transactions. They say that should apply even for the smallest payments – unlike for conventional bank transfers where customer identity only needs to be verified for transactions over 1,000 euros ($1,066) – as it’s easier to circumvent by chopping up digital payments into small chunks.  In practical terms that may not make much difference, according to a recent blog by Oldrich Peslar, head of legal at the Rockaway Blockchain Fund.  “I do not think that this is some tragedy” to apply checks to small crypto payments, Peslar said, because it is “all information any compliant service provider could already have,” and gathering it “is not an administrative burden nor any invasion of privacy.”  Challenge  But from a legal point of view, it could constitute an unfair intrusion into personal affairs that could invite a legal challenge, blockchain law expert Thibault Schrepel told CoinDesk.  “You are putting [on] more obligations if it’s crypto-related than if it’s not,” Schrepel, an associate professor of law at the Free University of Amsterdam, said in an interview.  “That would be the worst outcome,” he added, potentially infringing EU human rights law – not the least because money laundering is more widespread using other, more traditional means of payment.  Lawmakers could be swayed by the risk of a legal challenge, Schrepel believes – but in practice it may be difficult to get them to retreat from a position they share with the Council. In other areas there is less consensus on the right approach – and, for the law to become final, lawmakers and governments will have to thrash out their differences in a series of closed-door meetings, beginning Thursday.  Read more: I’m Not Anti-Crypto, Says Architect of Controversial EU Money Laundering Proposal  That includes the parliament’s proposals to make checks apply to unhosted wallets, and to have a central blacklist of dodgy providers. Those are issues that concern Peslar, warning they could spell the end of privacy-enhancing features such as mixers or currencies like monero (XMR).  Extending bank-style know-your-customer checks to self-guarded crypto holders – such as a wallet not hosted by a central exchange – “isn't aligned with my values,” and is out of line with how cash is treated, he told CoinDesk. “We should protect [the] privacy of people, not destroy it.”  Governments may come riding to the rescue. If the final text edges towards the position of the Council of the EU, representing national ministries, that would mean a better outcome for unhosted wallets, Blockchain for Europe has said.  Yet, the lobby group’s Secretary-General Robert Kopitsch told us, it’s not so much about what the law does, as when.  The Council says the new rules should wait for crypto licensing legislation to take effect, and apply only two years after the separate Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation is finalized. The MiCA legislation, which could allow crypto operators to work across the EU if they meet financial-stability and investor protection norms, is also currently in its closing stages of negotiation.  Lawmakers, however, want to see a phasing in of between nine and 18 months, while French central banker François Villeroy de Galhau on Tuesday said the rules should be implemented by “at the latest early 2024.”  That matters a lot, Kopitsch believes – because crypto providers might decide to drop services altogether rather than face the legal risk of a rushed job.  The timeline for implementing is “actually the biggest problem” of the forthcoming negotiations, Kopitsch said, noting the importance of coordinating with other jurisdictions such as the U.S. “In nine months you cannot do anything.”  Read more: ECB's Panetta Blasts Crypto as ‘Ponzi Scheme’ Fueled by Greed  Step back  Some would rather take a step back from the fine print of negotiations and remind lawmakers that crypto is not the bogeyman of illicit finance  For criminal behavior “it’s not bitcoin these people are going to use, because it’s traceable,” Pascal Gauthier told CoinDesk, saying that cash and conventional finance would be far more attractive to those seeking to hide than transparent blockchains.  Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, a French company that produces hardware that can be used as unhosted wallets, cited data that suggests trades with illicit addresses represented just 0.15% of transactions last year. (Chainalysis, which carried out the research, also suggests that figure could be as much as double as new dubious activities come to light.)  Claims of widespread illicit behavior “are false arguments that have been debunked,” Gauthier said, adding that lawmakers who actually want to ban crypto all together were using financial crime concerns as a fig leaf.  But there are also plenty of voices urging the EU to press on with strong constraints on the sector – including global standard setters the Financial Action Task Force, officials who warn crypto is implicated in child porn and terrorism, and the European Central Bank’s Fabio Panetta, who likens crypto to a lawless Wild West.  Even if the industry sees those views as a wild mischaracterization of crypto risks, they are bound to color the end result. The final version of EU anti-money laundering laws won’t be admired by everyone, but optimists within the sector are hoping lawmakers will at least make the best of a bad job.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/27/europes-lawmakers-set-to-advance-discussion-of-controversial-crypto-aml-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23647b1672602d5ef9dd1a3d0d7ffa8cd2845c0b-7500x5000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It added that although “most citizens in El Salvador have a cell phone with internet, less than 60% of them downloaded Chivo Wallet.”  According to the report, “Chivo is not being widely used to receive remittances from abroad.” Its figures align with recent reports from the Salvadoran Central Bank, according to which 1.6% of remittances were received by digital wallets in February, the study said. “In the first quarter of 2022, we find almost no new adopters and the share of remittances in bitcoin is at its lowest point since Chivo Wallet’s launch,” it added.  In addition, 5% of Salvadorans paid taxes using bitcoin, while 20% of firms accept bitcoin and 11.4% said they had positives sales using the cryptocurrency, the report concluded.

To continue with its digitization plans, the government has also taken up the help of decentralized digital technologies. In March, the government of Buenos Aires presented a white paper proposing a blockchain-based digital identity platform that gives the city&apos;s residents control over their personal data.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  The Brazilian Senate plenary approved a bill regulating crypto transactions Tuesday night.  The bill, introduced by Senator Flávio Arns, moves next to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, which will vote on the bill. If approved, the executive branch then has the power to veto it.  The text creates the label ""virtual service providers"" for crypto companies, which will be subject to the same responsibilities as other financial institutions for crimes against the Brazilian financial system.  If approved, the bill will prevent the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission from overseeing the crypto market, except for initial coin offerings (ICO). In addition, the bill said the Brazilian executive branch will designate an agency to supervise the crypto sector.  The Brazilian Senate's economic affairs committee had approved Arns’ bill in February, shelving two other crypto bills presented by senators Styvenson Valentim and Soraya Thronicke.  The bill also designates crime carried out by virtual assets as punishable by a penalty of between two and six years in prison. The original text proposed a penalty of between four and eight years but it was reduced after a request made by Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco.

The bill itself specifies that the New York Department of Energy ""shall not approve a new application for or issue a new permit ... for an electric generating facility that uses a carbon-based fuel and that provides, in whole or in part, behind-the-meter electric energy consumed or utilized by cryptocurrency mining operations that use proof-of-work [PoW] authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions.""  Another provision would ban renewals for existing permits for similar facilities if the renewal applicant seeks to grow their facility.

According to a Spanish-language resolution published in Cuba's official gazette on Tuesday, the license will be available to individuals or organizations both Cuban and foreign.  The approved licenses will be valid for one year and may be extended for a second year, “given the experimental and novel nature of this type of activity,” the BCC said.  The providers will be allowed to operate with virtual assets approved by the BCC, the resolution said without disclosing further details. It did clarify that virtual assets “do not include digital representations of fiat currency, securities and other financial assets widely used in traditional banking and financial systems, which are regulated in other provisions of the Central Bank of Cuba.”  In August, the BCC issued a resolution establishing rules to regulate the use of virtual assets in commercial transactions and licensing of service providers in that sector.  That previous resolution allowed the bank to grant licenses to “service providers of virtual assets for transactions related to financial, exchange and collection or payment activities, in and from the national territory,” the BCC said on Thursday.  At that moment, the BCC stipulated that government agencies must refrain from using virtual assets in transactions, except in cases it authorizes.  The current resolution didn't specify how the Cuban government will levy taxes on the virtual assets activity.  It stipulates the BCC will provide or deny the requested license ""in a term that in its totality does not exceed ninety working days from the date of receipt of the required documentation."" In order to issue a license, the BCC will first consult with a ""crypto assets group.""  According to the bank, the resolution will be effective 20 days after its publication.  In addition, providers will not be able to cease operations without prior authorization from the BCC and will have to keep accounting records of their operations according to the standards issued by the Ministry of Finance and Prices, based on the approved Cuban Financial Reporting Standards.

It works in two ways: it allows casinos to operate more efficiently and effectively, enabling developers to offer higher security and transparency. As a result, decentralized online casinos are more secure and transparent than their centralized counterparts. Also, since the technology is decentralized, it can be operated by just about anyone. The advantages of blockchain gambling are many. First, there is less chance of third-party manipulation of your funds. Second, there are no third-party fees when using cryptocurrency. Third-party fees are reduced. And third, there is no need for monthly bank statements to track transactions.
