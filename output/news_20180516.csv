On April 23rd, PeckShield, a blockchain security startup,discovered a new batchOverflow bug in multiple ERC-20 Smart Contracts and quickly alerted the public. Unusual SMT and BEC token transactions happened at about 03:28:52 AM UTC, according to PeckShield. The bug which effected the Ethereum smart contracts let malicious attackers create and receive large values of the batchOverflow-affected tokens. Immediately after the incident took place, Huobi Pro, a decentralized exchange network established in 2013, blocked all tokens from deposits and withdrawals to keep users funds safe and away from attacks.

42429078,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdVh,1526493811,Jack Dorsey Hopes Bitcoin Will Become Web's 'Native Currency',"Is bitcoin destined to become the default currency of the Internet?  At least one well-known business executive – Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Square, who previously predicted bitcoin’s future dominance back in March – hopes that's the case. Dorsey sat down with Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference in New York City to talk more broadly about his company’s goals for the digital currency.  “I’m just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin,” said Dorsey said during Wednesday's fireside chat, adding:  “I hope it will be bitcoin. I’m a huge fan.”  Dorsey admits the idea that bitcoin will someday be the basis for all payments made on the Internet remains a topic of debate at Square.  “We’ve led with that mindset. But there’s still a lot of skepticism and a lot of debate and a lot of fights. But that’s where the magic happens, where creativity happens,” he explained.  Despite the controversy, Dorsey argues that the vision of open access that bitcoin inspires is fundamental to the role Square has always played in the payments industry. “Any payment that comes across our table, the seller should be able to accept,” he remarked.  When Dorsey first began contemplating how to implement bitcoin payments into the Square platform with Mike Brock, an engineer at the company, the two initially settled on a goal that was grandiose in its simplicity.  Either one of them, he reasoned, should be able to walk over to the Blue Bottle across the street and buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin without the transaction looking any different than a regular dollar-denominated payment, perhaps without the cashier even knowing that bitcoin was being used.  According to Dorsey, the team had a working solution within a week.  “It felt amazing. It felt electric. And it felt like something we needed to explore a lot more,” he said.  More work to come  Square has yet to build a full bitcoin payments solution for merchants and consumers, as it quickly changed direction to work on a buying-and-selling service to be integrated into its Cash App. But Dorsey said that the goal is same as it has always been.  “We want to go back to that original idea of being able to purchase a coffee with it. And that’s why we’re working with [Lightning Labs],” said Dorsey. “Whatever it takes to get there, we’re going to make sure it happens.”  Dorsey – who counts himself as a fan of the hacker ethos surrounding bitcoin’s rise to fame – claimed that whatever path Square takes to pushing mass adoption of bitcoin payments, it will do so without threatening the openness of the network.  “There’s so much openness in the community, and I want to make sure nothing in the corporate world threatens that,” he stated, going on to say:  “We cannot risk hurting what made this possible to begin with … We can’t do any of this without the technology being strong and available for everyone.”  Photo by David Floyd for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Morgen Peck,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/16/jack-dorsey-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-webs-native-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ab21fcefc647fcaf49ab7c1039084f2dcb43222-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulator announced Wednesday it has launched a mock ICO called HoweyCoin, presumably named after the Howey Test, which ""touts an all too good to be true investment opportunity.""  However, the company notes, ""the offer isn't real."" Users who try to invest in the token sale will instead be redirected to the regulator's education tools, which are aimed at pointing out the signs of fraudulent token sales.  According to the HoweyCoin website, most travel businesses ""require processing, centralized currency, and most importantly, nickel and dime fees that add up to literally billions.""  HoweyCoin is different, the fake site says, because:  ""HoweyCoins utilize the latest crypto-technology to allow travelers to purchase all segments without these limitations, allowing HoweyCoin users to buy, sell, and trade in a frictionless environment – where they use HoweyCoins to purchase travel OR as a government-backed, freely tradable investment – or both!""  The website goes on to report that investors will receive 1–2 percent returns, and advises them to ""HODL,"" mimicking websites for existing fraudulent or potentially fraudulent token sales.  The site similarly features Twitter testimonials and list of its team members, though whether any of them are real is debatable – there are no social media or professional profiles linked to the names.  In a press release, the SEC also noted that the site includes ""a white paper with a complex yet vague explanation of the investment opportunity, promises of guaranteed returns, and a countdown clock that shows time is quickly running out on the deal of a lifetime.""  In a statement, Owen Donley, chief counsel of the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, said that the site incorporates many of the hallmarks of fraudulent token sales – pertinent information for investors looking to avoid financial pitfalls.  “Fraudsters can quickly build an attractive website and load it up with convoluted jargon to lure investors into phony deals,” said Donley. “But fraudulent sites also often have red flags that can be dead giveaways if you know what to look for.”  SEC logo via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/16/the-sec-just-launched-a-fake-ico-website-to-educate-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c58b36befaebc5c2246248708a3fe615600eea6-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Among other alleged failings, Houston-based Wind Wide Coin is said to have fabricated client profiles using images of public figures including actress Jennifer Aniston, Prince Charles and former Finland prime minister Matti Vanhanen to gain attention for its products.  One detail provided in the Texas State Security Board order further gives the effort a somewhat ridiculous air, with the agency stating that the scheme gave alternative names to the purported clients, labeling Jennifer Aniston as ""Kate Jennifer"" and Prince Charles as ""Mark Robert.""  The order accuses the firm and three individuals of claiming to be licensed in the state, when in fact that was not the case; of selling unregistered securities; of misleading investors with fraudulent claims and withholding information.  Among the claims made by the company, as provided by the Texas State Securities Board in evidence, the firm allegedly claimed that income from the investment scheme is ""100 percent sure"" and that clients ""can't lose money,"" adding that ""there is no risk.""  Wind Wide Coin was ""illegally, deceptively and fraudulently offering investments"" in Texas, Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board, told CoinDesk in an email.  The order concludes that the firm must immediately cease and desist from selling unregistered securities and conducting fraud in Texas.  ""Today’s action is a reminder that, step by step and case by case, we’ve been uncovering a virtual playbook of tactics employed by promoters of illegal and fraudulent cryptocurrency investment programs,"" Rotunda said.  The case marks yet another action by the state's securities regulator, as it moves to protect investors from fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes.  Earlier this month, two bitcoin investment schemes were also issued cease-and-desists by the Securities Board for allegedly selling unregistered securities.

One of several this week, it cuts to the heart of the project's aims to dominate the issuance of tokenized securities. But the plans go beyond just the acquisition of potentially popular domain names.  In the run-up to the company's Wednesday morning appearance at CoinDesk's Consensus conference, Polymath also revealed it's in the process of closing a deal to acquire a large stake in the Barbados Stock Exchange and that it's working on a deal with the alternative trading system tZero.  With those two partnerships, it believes it will have the platform to create tokens that can actually trade and dominate the coming transition of traditional equity to crypto. Neither deal is done, but Polymath CEO Trevor Koverko projects that they should be closed by early June. (Polymath raised $58.7 million in a private placement of tokens to accredited investors, according to Business Insider.)  Koverko sees a crisis of liquidity in security tokens. As CoinDesk previously reported, many of the tokens issued so far are under a lockup period required by U.S. securities regulations, but Koverko argues that's not the whole story.  ""It's also because everyone's scared to release them in the wild because you can't prevent unaccredited people from getting them,"" Koverko told CoinDesk. ""What we're doing is we're bringing a measure of restraint and typical Wall Street-like compliance.""  Polymath has built a system that makes a whitelist of accounts that have gone through the know-your-customer, anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) and investor accreditation checks that make them viable to trade with. That way, once a token has been issued on Polymath, it shouldn't be possible for an unaccredited investor in the U.S. to acquire it.  It's calling this ST20, which it describes as a new standard for security tokens. For now, these tokens will be issued on the ethereum blockchain (it is not actually an ethereum standard). The company has partnered with SelfKey, IdentityMind and Shyft as its KYC/AML partners.  Polymath is one of several companies that have jumped into the token issuing space, which grows more crowded by the week. The firm describes itself as a platform, one that brings in companies and guides them through the process of issuing a security token. The companies with the strongest proposals will get access to elite consultants, legal counsel and possible investment from Polymath's new security token fund, which it also announced this week.  One of Polymath's partners, Gabriel Abed, founder of Bitt, a Caribbean platform for mobile money, explained the value of a crypto exchange in the country. ""Barbados has the most double tax treaty agreements in the world.""  That means that if a company pays tax in one country, it doesn't have to pay tax in the other. ""It's quite cool as well when you look at the China relationship that Barbados has,"" because so many Chinese companies have needed to look abroad as domestic regulations have banned new token issuances, he said.  Bitt is in the family of companies, like tZero, that have investments from Patrick Byrne and Overstock.com. Abed is working to negotiate the use of TZero's backend to run a crypto specific exchange out of the Barbados Stock Exchange.  Once the exchange is running, it will be a ready place for new tokens to trade, with guarantees built into the ST20 platform that no one will be able to hold them that shouldn't. Koverko anticipates equity and real estate to begin quickly moving onto the platform. He also sees opportunities for people in the developing world with capital but without local financial infrastructure to make investments.  Just as Africa skipped the landline phase and went straight to mobile, Koverko envisions a mobile-based capital market there as well.  The Barbados Stock Exchange and tZero had not confirmed the deals in process at press time.

Co-founder Ryan Shea said the company was launching the resource, which is aimed at bridging the gap between decentralized app developers and potential users. The open-source project will be free for developers, and Blockstack sees “this as a critical moment for decentralized application development and discovery,” Shea said.  He went on to explain:  ”The goal here is to demonstrate, to really bring together app developers and users and provide value in connecting the two. We want to help users discover decentralized applications. We launched our browser last year which was a great success, and after that we started noticing people were building real apps on top of our platform, and this last year we were focused on learning from them.”  Indeed, it's the first step toward what is intended to become a dedicated storefront for dapp developers, with the goal of allowing devs to charge for premium versions of their app as well as expand to a wider market.  “We’re looking to make this a comprehensive dapp store, and one component is an index and you can see the most popular applications, and another component is a feature list kind of like what you can find in the Apple app store,"" he added.

Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification 1.0, unveiled during CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York, comes weeks after Jeremy Millar, a founding board member of the 500-plus-member group, spoke about the importance of common standards as a way to connect development efforts across the enterprise-focused, ethereum-based initiative.  It's a significant moment for the group, which launched at the start of last year with backing from major corporates like British oil giant BP, Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft, as well as stakeholders in the blockchain work such as ethereum startup studio ConsenSys, Nuco and BlockApps, among others. CoinDesk first reported on the group's work in January 2017.  In statements, representatives from the initiative framed it as the result of a months-long collaborative effort between different stakeholders and one that widens access to the software.  Ron Resnick, executive director for the EEA, said of the release:  “The EEA’s Enterprise Ethereum Specification is the result of 18 months of intense collaboration between leading enterprise, technology and platform members within our technical committee. This EEA open-source, cross-platform framework will enable the mass adoption at a depth and breadth otherwise unachievable in individual corporate silos.""  Indeed, Resnick spoke about the work during a recent interview with CoinDesk, pointing to the process as one aimed at connecting the different software clients developed by group members.  ""All the ethereum client companies see the need to agree on these building blocks and components and how they talk to each other, because if we don't, then we don't have a way to compete against the proprietary solutions,"" he said at the time.

42429099,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdzh,1526475624,Bear Revival? Bitcoin Risks Fall Below $8K After 3.5-Week Low,"Bitcoin's (BTC) bears have unraveled the minor rally in prices since Saturday and are now looking to pull the cryptocurrency below the $8,000 mark, the technical charts indicate.  The bears' comeback comes after bitcoin saw minor gains after the May 12 low of $8,204, but the bulls repeatedly failed to cut through the key falling trendline hurdle. As a result, bitcoin fell to a 3.5-week low of $8,100 on Bitfinex earlier today.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,366 – down 4.7 percent in 24 hours.  Daily chart  The above chart shows that bitcoin has dipped below the 50-day moving average (MA), currently located at $8,290. As discussed yesterday, a close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal resumption of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and could yield deeper sell-off to $7,800.  The rejection at the descending trendline hurdle and a drop to $8,100 has reinforced the bearish view put forward by the short-term moving averages (5-day and 10-day), which are sloping downwards in favor of the bears.  The retreat from $8,884 to $8,100 has also established a falling top (lower highs pattern) – a (you guessed it) bearish setup. While the 10-day MA has crossed the 100-day MA from above (bearish crossover), and the relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).  As a result, there is a high probability that bitcoin will now go on to close today (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA and confirm a bear revival.  4-hour chart  The bad news (for the bulls, at least) continues in the 4-hour chart. The downside break of the expanding channel (bearish breakdown) indicates the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed and could yield a drop to $7,524 (target as per the measured height method).  Note, the major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) are sloping downwards (bearish).  View  BTC will likely close below $8,290 (50-day MA) today and confirm a bear revival.  The cryptocurrency looks set to test support at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from April 1 low to May 5 high) and could go as low as $7,524 (expanding channel breakdown target) in the next 24–48 hours.  An unexpected break above $8,884 would abort the bearish view.

Working in partnership with REX Shares founder Gregg King, Kelly will actively manage a portfolio of roughly 30 companies actively using blockchain technology and matching one of four general criteria, he told CoinDesk. The fund will support firms from the seed stage onward.  He told CoinDesk:  ""When I look at the investment landscape, to me blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity ... if I look at every other asset class, to me the most attractive investment is blockchain and cryptocurrency. The growth is explosive [and] the potential is enormous.""  The four criteria, or ""pillars,"" include enterprise blockchain, or companies using the technology to streamline existing business processes; ""Wall Street disruptors,"" that is, services changing how securities are traded (such as Overstock.com's tZero exchange); mining focused entities; and exchange firms and startups creating a decentralized internet, he said.  Further, the fund will evolve over time, Kelly said, noting that ""this is an active ETF [so] we'll be able to add companies to the space.""  While right now the fund may be invested in some enterprise companies, he believes that ""over time we might become 100 percent pure play,"" or entirely invested in blockchain-specific startups.  That said, the ETF will not be invested in any cryptocurrencies directly, he added – rather, it would be invested in companies with regulated security offerings.  The fund will be open to anyone who has a U.S. brokerage account, he noted, including investors who reside outside the country. A person does not have to be an accredited investor to participate.  Kelly cited the progress companies have made in developing blockchain technology over the last year as the reason for the ETF, saying that firms were ""finally getting some revenue from blockchain and cryptocurrency. Even a year ago you had a few who were doing it, but they didn't have significant revenue streams.""  Now, with some companies even receiving bank financing, Kelly expressed confidence that he could ""put together a diversified portfolio.""  Neither is Kelly worried about the volatility seen in cryptocurrency markets. Although his ETF will be invested in companies working with various crypto assets, he said:  ""With all investments obviously there’s risk, and the volatility of bitcoin versus equities can change, historically bitcoin has been volatile. That being said we don’t know what the future holds – as more people and more investments come into cryptocurrencies those potentially could actually become less volatile.""

42429086,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdjh,1526454015,"'BitLicense Refugees': ShapeShift, Kraken Talk Escape from New York","If you wanted to hear red-meat rhetoric about New York State's regulatory approach, a fireside chat Tuesday between two of the cryptocurrency industry's most outspoken leaders delivered.  For example, the audience at Consensus 2018 in New York City cheered when ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees invoked a local icon to make the case that the state's BitLicense was a case of regulatory overreach.  ""Here we are two miles from the Statue of Liberty and you cannot sell CryptoKitties in the state without that license. That's the absurdity of what's happened here,"" he said.  And Jesse Powell, the CEO of Kraken, got some laughs at the expense of former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.  When Scheniderman's office sent a request for information to Kraken (along with several other exchanges) earlier this year – three years after his company stopped doing business in New York – it felt like ""a slap in the face,"" Powell said.  But then ""it turns out this asshole actually slapped people in the face,"" he quipped, referring to the allegations of physical abuse that forced Schneiderman to resign shortly afterward.  Yet between these zingers and applause lines about the BitLicense – which both executives blame for driving their companies out of state – there were subtler points made. The conversation highlighted the challenges facing both the industry and regulators worldwide as governments come to terms with the ramifications of cryptocurrency.  Powell, for example, pointed out the tension between anti-money-laundering regulations and customer privacy protections. In the case of the BitLicense, he said, Kraken would have had to ""disclose all the information about our entire global client base to the state of New York.""  That was not only distasteful, Powell said, but ""potentially illegal"" under the privacy laws of other countries.  ""To service New York today, what we'd have to do is create a special purpose entity just to service New York and completely firewall off"" all the exchange's other users to protect their privacy, he said.  Alternative models  Widening the lens, Powell contended that the U.S. ""has really failed"" by leaving it up to local regulators to figure out how to deal with cryptocurrencies.  ""In others parts of the world, it's an issue that's being taken seriously by heads of state – presidents, prime ministers. It's not something that's relegated to individual regulators at a state level,"" he said. ""It should be treated as a national economic and national security issue, maybe even an international issue.""  Powell cited Japan's Virtual Currency Act as an example of ""reasonable"" regulation. Although the law is ""not perfect,"" he said, ""we're already seeing an explosion of business in Japan"" as a result of the clarity it brought.  Voorhees, however, held up a different U.S. state as an example of how to do things right: Wyoming, which recently passed a package of five blockchain-related laws.  The two most important ones, in his view, were a law that excludes tokens from being automatically categorized as securities, and another that excludes digital asset companies from being automatically classified as money transmitters.  ""That's the model people should be looking at, they've done it the best,"" Voorhees said.  And despite using the phrase ""statist oppression"" early in the conversation to describe his feelings about New York when the BitLicense was created, Voorhees later clarified that he thinks regulators generally have good intentions.  But their aims can be met today by means other than imposing bureaucratic, bank-style regulations on businesses that want to be nothing like traditional financial institutions, he argued.  ""The crypto industry and regulators can find common ground in realizing that this incredible new technology can achieve many of the noble goals of the regulators such as protecting consumers,"" Voorhees said.  Regulatory hopscotch  Ultimately, though, the two executives depicted cryptocurrency as a highly mobile activity that can easily relocate when any jurisdiction starts to appear heavy-handed.  Powell said Kraken's main office is located in San Francisco only as a convenience because that's where he lived when he started the company. Crypto businesses can basically pick up and move anywhere in the world they want to be, he said.  And users need not always move to another place, use a VPN to mask their IP address or even break the law to get around restrictions; Powell shared a tip for New York residents who feel deprived because of the way the BitLicense has limited their cryptocurrency trading options.  ""If you're here stuck in New York and you can't trade how you want to trade, set up a Wyoming LLC and you can trade through that and have your business trade for you,"" he said.  Further limiting regulators' power, Powell said, the rise of decentralized exchanges will give users even more alternatives.  ""If they can't do what they want on Kraken they're doing to do it on a decentralized exchange,"" he said.  And Voorhees said ""regulatory hopscotch"" by exchanges and other businesses that move from one country to another is only a symptom of a broader phenomenon that won't easily be resolved.  He concluded:  ""Bitcoin basically broke down the borders of how value moves across humanity. There is no way that an invention like that doesn't run straight into the jaws of regulations. And that conflict is going to be one of the great themes of my lifetime.""  Photo via Wolfie Zhao for CoinDesk.

42429083,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdNh,1526443216,CNET Founder Backs $50 Million ICO for Video Streaming,"Streaming a TV show or a sports game directly to your laptop doesn't make big TV networks much money today.  However, that might change if VideoCoin, a new decentralized project that's taking aim at the price major broadcasters and media companies pay to stream content, succeeds on its vision. When a broadcaster sends out a broadcast over the airwaves, one signal can reach many devices, but when it broadcasts over the internet one signal goes to one device.  ""It's all cost and no revenue,"" Halsey Minor, CEO of Live Planet, an immersive video startup, told CoinDesk in an interview at Consensus 2018. Live Planet is a strategic partner in VideoCoin, which announced Wednesday the completion of a $50 million initial coin offering (ICO) entirely through private investment.  Leading investors included Galaxy Investment Partners, Alphabit Fund, ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio, Akamai Co-Founder Randall Kaplan and Science Blockchain. VideoCoin will not be doing a public sale, but a spokesperson for the project said that there will be details about an airdrop to supporters over its Telegram channel in the next two weeks.  ""What we're building is the next-generation infrastructure for how you do video processing and distributed services,"" Minor, best known as the founder for the tech media website CNET, said. The plan is to create a platform that allows broadcasters to send their video streams out to unused computer infrastructure, such as server farms that have excess capacity, for processing.  Minor has a track record betting on early technology that faced serious doubts at first. As an early backer of Salesforce, he bet that companies would put their data into the cloud in order to better manage relationships with customers.  Since then, cloud businesses have become enormous and Amazon Web Services has become the dominant force in that space. ""I think most people would believe that Amazon Web Services is the last step in computing,"" Minor said.  However, by decentralizing computing tasks, Minor believes that there is still more margin that can be shaved off the cost of computing services. He said:  ""I believe the blockchain could unleash a highly competitive market on computing in the same way I believed Salesforce could change enterprise software.""  ""You don't need specialized hardware to do video mining,"" Minor explained. All computers, even cell phones, come with video encoders built in. That said, Minor doesn't see as much opportunity in personal devices as he does in data centers.  ""For the video part, we're in very good stead,"" he said, citing team members who worked on enterprise streaming solutions. ""The hard part is building a very performant blockchain.""  With the completion of the token sale, the company announced it would update its product roadmap and new partnerships support adoption of the open source VideoCoin platform. Halsey said:  ""The one use case the blockchain that's going to work first is the commodification of hardware. It's perfect for it.""
