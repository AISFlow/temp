42399141,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVTA,1468966603,How to Follow the Ethereum Hard Fork as it Happens,"Update: The hard fork has occurred. Earlier estimates on when it would take place based on estimates for the time it takes to mine a block were off by about two hours. Click here to read our coverage of the event.      A rare event in the history of public blockchains is expected to take place today.  Following the exploitation of a major project, the ethereum development community is expected to create a new history of transactions that will disregard the disputed funds through a mechanism called a hard fork.  To pull off the feat, a number of hurdles have had to be crossed, leaving just this one remaining – the voting of the miners that today confirm transactions on the public blockchain. Assuming all goes well, the hard fork is expected to occur early Wednesday afternoon UTC.  For those unwilling to wait for the breaking news, we’ve put together a list of resources that members of the media are likely to turn to for their own coverage. (For more details and background, follow our extended coverage of The DAO and Ethereum here and here).  Countdown clocks  As mentioned previously, tomorrow's hard fork of the etherum blockchain intends to return funds drained from the smart contracts that comprised The DAO.  But, when the technical changes that undoes this action will occur is less clear.  This is because action on the ethereum network will occur at a specific block on the blockchain, and the time it takes blocks to be mined fluctuates. Currently this total is around 14 seconds, but as it varies, the time it will take to reach the milestone block is also expected to change.  To keep track, some members of the community have programmed special clocks to count down to the event. Of the three clocks we've identified, only two were synced up within 20 seconds of each other at the time of publication.  The SlackNationhttps://slacknation.github.io/medium/11/11.html counter has been widely sited on reports on on social media. Ethereum block explorer EtherScan is also widely used by industry participants, and offers its own hard fork countdown. A third clock also exists at TickCounter, though that clock is a full hour behind the other two.  For a somewhat regularly updating record of the node adoption at top mining pools — an important number to see which half of a hard fork is adopted, Reddit user econoar has been doing a pretty decent job a updated numbers at this link.  Blogs  Activity on blogs is also likely to be high.  For perspective, there are two blogs worth tracking with a rather high likelihood of posting valuable information both leading up to the hard fork and immediately following.  Since the DAO attack on 17th June Slock.it, the company that wrote the open-source code behind The DAO, has been regularly keeping its followers up to date with posts on their efforts. Most recently the company posted the actual specification being used for the hard fork there, and it will likely be publishing further updates through that channel.  Though the actual decision making process has been largely decentralized, Slock.it has been working closely with the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that manages platform development, to determine the solution they believed was mostly likely to be supported by the community.  As such, we'll be watching here for updates on the official Ethereum Foundation blog.  Twitter  Ethereum co-founder and lead developer of the go-ethereum project, Jeff Wilcke is the author of the Etherum Foundation post on the hard fork and has been tweeting regularly about the event.  Slock.it’s lead technical engineer Lefteris Karapetsas is yet another frequent tweeter about The DAO hard fork.  However, it's likely that interesting comments will be coming in from a variety of sources, guided by Twitter's hashtag system. At press time, popular hashtags in use include #TheDAO, #Ethereum and #HardFork.  Wild cards  Another source worth keeping an eye on is the page EtherScan uses to track The DAO tokens. You can use this page to keep an eye on the balance in the account labelled, TheDarkDAO Balance, as well as the two accounts labeled WhiteHatDAO Balance.  Though there are several clients running the ethereum protocol, geth, the ehthereum client of the go-ethereum project was mentioned by name in the most recent Ethereum Foundation post on the hard fork. Click here releases to follow go-ethereum’s GitHub page.  If you enjoy being a fly on the wall or want to engage directly with those involved, the Ethereum Community Forum is a great place to visit.  But perhaps most improant to the hard fork is the Pool Discussion category, which is currently filled with conversations about the hard fork.

42399145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVZ4,1468960237,UK Legislators Cast Critical Eye on Bitcoin and Blockchain,"A committee of the UK House of Lords, the upper chamber of Parliament, struck a curious and at times critical tone when discussing blockchain technology and its impact on finance and government.  During an afternoon hearing of the The Economic Affairs Committee, members heard from academics and representatives of the blockchain industry, as well as Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor for monetary policy of the Bank of England. Lasting about three hours, the hearing demonstrated a mixture of genuine interest and skepticism on the part of committee members.  It was the first major committee discussion of the technology within Parliament, and follows a period of growing interest within the UK government to pursue possible applications.  In addition to Broadbent, witnesses who spoke included Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters (who spoke via phone); 11:FS co-founder and director of blockchain Simon Taylor; Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research associate director Dr Catherine Mulligan; Gresham College professor of commerce Michael Mainelli; and PwC transformation and assurance director Lord Spens.  During his appearance, Broadbent discussed both the concept of a central bank issued digital currency – which he indicated is an evolving, years-long process – as well as the technology’s broader impact on financial markets.  Broadbent went on to frame the conversation about blockchain within a broader question of how financial markets should be structured at all, telling committee members:  ""When you think of things on these scales, the benefits are clear and quite large, and so are the costs. And what I was really trying to say is, even though this is a very new technology, I think it's possible, once you think through, to realize that some of the big questions involved are very old, not to say ancient.""  On bitcoin  Committee members asked a number of questions about bitcoin, though at times the digital currency was branded as ""anonymous"" (bitcoin is by design a pseudonymous system).  The topic came up when one member asked how the Bank of England would operate a central-bank issued digital currency.  Broadbent dismissed the idea that the Bank of England would use a similar model, indicating that any network, if it came to fruition, would be a permissioned one.  ""We would never have a system like that,"" he said.  He elaborated on this point during the hearing, suggesting that market participants wouldn't want an open, permissionless system when asked whether financial institutions might use a bitcoin-like system to escape regulatory scrutiny Further, he indicated that financial system players would prefer one that includes oversight from regulators.  ""I don't think that's what we would be most worried about, because I think people would want us involved,"" he added.  Doubts raised about welfare trial  One notable moment in the hearing came during the second of three sessions, when the topic of a welfare payments proof-of-concept developed for the UK government’s Department of Works and Pensions was criticized by some members as ethically unsound.  Committee member and former UK chancellor Alistair Darling was vocally critical of the move, echoing past concerns raised by privacy advocates in the country.  ""It does raise an ethical issue as to whether the state should know if someone is spending money on one thing or another,"" he said.  In the back-and-forth that followed, Mulligan suggested that, according to her best knowledge, the proof-of-concept calls for an opt-in approach that wouldn’t require such oversight. That said, she conceded that there are privacy concerns that need to be worked through before such a system becomes production-ready.  Mulligan told the committee:  ""There are, really, a number of profound issues that need to be looked at from a regulatory perspective, and also these kind of moral and ethical questions, it raises them, very large questions for our society if we wish to use these technologies.""

42399151,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVb2,1468953811,South Africa's Banks Are Going DIY to Test Ethereum's Blockchain,"Members of six African banks reportedly met yesterday to discuss the next steps in their ongoing effort to connect aspects of the South African banking system via a private version of the ethereum blockchain, according to sources.  Present at the event was CIO of Barclays Africa's corporate and investment banking division, Andrew Baker, who said that while the unnamed banks are still in the early phases of the ""most pure collaborative process"" he’s ever participated in, the effort has been propelled by a surprising technology – instant messaging.  After some early internal work within Barclays subsidiary, Absa, including logging archived payments on a blockchain and writing simple ethereum-based smart contracts, Baker created a WhatsApp group and invited a few of his peers at competing banks.  By giving those bank representatives administrative access to the blockchain group, he said the team of would-be competitors quickly grew to 50 members from six of South Africa’s largest banks.  From there, he said the group has invited an unnamed regulator and a payments service provider, and as of last Friday, the group had successfully networked together on the ethereum blockchain.  But it all comes back to instant messaging:  ""The biggest contribution we made was to start a WhatsApp group. That is it. The whole thing, the genesis of it is instant messaging.""  Internal tests first  But before growing its network, Absa set out to learn as much as it could about how its own internal processes worked – or didn't work – with the ethereum blockchain.  With the help of former Barclays vice president Simon Taylor, Baker said the bank built smart contracts designed to send emails based on events that occurred in various RSS feeds and ran BigChainDB in an Amazon EC2 cloud service to archive past payments.  The BigChainDB integration was designed to help the bank be compliant with requirements to make its payments data ""tamper-proof"", he said.  Absa then experimented with exporting its payments data into BigChainDB in the JSON format before settling on an an XML version. As part of the test, Baker said the bank showed that it could also query the data after it was uploaded to the blockchain.  Also before engaging with other banks, members of Absa built their own do-it-yourself ethereum mining rigs using wine boxes and PVC pipes as part of an internal competition to see who could generate the highest hashrate. To check the code for bugs, another team member established a bug bounty program in GitHub.  ""Then we started to realize there wasn’t much more we could do internally,"" said Baker, adding:  ""The key word is distributed. You don’t need to be distributed if you’re looking at your own systems.""  Building connections  What he found after sending out the initial WhatApp invites was that the banks across South Africa were all engaged in similar experiments, and that they, too, were looking to bring their work to a larger scale.  The resulting synergy led to a working environment unlike anything Baker said he's experienced before.  ""My background is I come from a markets business doing high-frequency trading,"" he said, adding:  ""My view on the world is compete, compete, compete. So when we started this you start to think people are going to run their own agenda. It didn’t happen.""  Instead of competing, Baker said members of the WhatsApp group with more efficient processes would give advice with an ""all ships rise"" mentality. As such, the network wouldn't just be geographically distributed, but comprised of varying parts of the banking industry and hosted in diverse services.  While Absa hosts its ethereum nodes in an EC2 virtual server, another bank uses Microsoft's Azure, another uses its own internal data center, and the regulator, Baker said, hosts its node from an Africa-based data center.  ""We wanted to really experience a distributed, multi-geography, multi-database, ethereum-based service,"" Baker said.  Absa is now ""fully integrated"" with the ethereum blockchain, he says, and most of the other banks are, too, meaning that when they start running smart contacts, they will be able to begin transacting in real-world assets.  Though much of the operational overhead is being built into the blockchain, for now, the transactions themselves will be settled using traditional technology and ""matched"" on the ethereum blockchain.  But how to use the network?  Early contenders for the first smart contracts to run on the South African ethereum banking network are syndicated loans and securities loans, which are currently run as over-the-counter operations. This means that banks need to liaise directly with one another much more frequently than they would with a blockchain, something Baker thinks they can end.  ""We think we can operationalize [the loans] on a distributed ledger,"" he said. After successfully connecting the banks to each other via a private version of the ethereum blockchain, Baker said the group set about deciding how to build the MVPs of their smart contracts.  On Monday, the banks met to determine which of them can provide people with which skills for an upcoming week-long event to determine how to use this network now that it exists.  A seventh bank is expect to join the group soon, but despite the growing number of participants, Baker indicated the group still has a roll-up-your-sleeves type attitude.  Baker concluded:  ""What’s going to happen next is we’re going to set up a workshop in Capetown for a week and bring everyone down. There’s a couple of projects that are up for grabs.""

42399155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVey,1468949721,Where Will Bitcoin Prices Go Post-Halving?,"In the aftermath of bitcoin's 'halving' on 9th July, market experts have begun to take positions on whether they believe the digital currency’s price will rise or fall in the weeks and months ahead.  Long a matter of discussion in bitcoin's trading community, market observers had been anticipating the event, which saw the number of new bitcoins issued per transaction block reduced from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, for years, and had been eager to see how it may affect both trading and the larger sentiments of investors.  Any anxieties have now been eased, as one week after the change, the halving has been seen by many a non-event in terms of price or overall impact on the network.  While the digital currency experienced, by bitcoin standards, a modest decline following the event (falling to $626.87 on 9th July, a figure that was 5.7% below the opening price), bitcoin prices have remained relatively stable.  Since then, prices have continued to build gains, rising to a press time total of $668.75, and going forward, many market observers suggest gains are likely to continue.  Gains ahead?  Market observer Joe Lee, co-founder and CIO of digital currency trading platform Magnr, for example, expects to see a ""slow and steady"" rise in the price to coincide with new confidence in the system.  ""[The halving] represents a new level of maturity and stability in bitcoin’s blockchain,"" Lee told CoinDesk.  Lee said any gains are likely to be a reflection of new demand from those who were reluctant to invest before what was perceived to be a major event in the digital currency’s calendar.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, identified a separate source of potential bitcoin gains by pointing to new macroeconomic concerns.  While some observers said China and 'the Brexit' drove much of this activity, Hayes said he believes bitcoin could see upside market moves in the near future as a result of Bank of Japan (BOJ) monetary stimulus.  As the BOJ employs further monetary easing, a weaker yen could help fuel gains in bitcoin.  ""The markets are focused on whether Japan will take Bernanke's advice and directly monetize Abe-san's proposed fiscal stimulus,"" he stated. ""Should the BOJ embark down this path, it will flood the global markets with more free money.""  Block debate  Bitcoin could also enjoy some upside based on what progress the community makes toward solving the block size debate.  Currently, each bitcoin transaction block has a maximum limit of 1 MB of data, a figure that a vocal component of the community has alleged is preventing or limiting wider consumer adoption.  Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager at bitcoin trader Richfund, weighed in on this highly visible issue, telling CoinDesk that it is not as big of a problem as some many believe.  He also emphasized his preference for focusing on block efficiency instead of size.  ""Scaling up does not solve the problem, it's just kicking the can down the road,"" said Gao. ""Making blocks more efficient is a better area we should direct our energy and discussions toward.""  Lee also emphasized the key role the block size debate could play in the bitcoin community, and how it could create uncertainty for traders.  ""Our eyes are on growth in underlying demand with the next major trading event being speculation around the uncertainty provided by the block size debate. With there being two clear camps, contention is inevitable,"" he said.  Long wagers  Another factor that could affect bitcoin prices going forward is speculative leveraged trading.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, spoke with CoinDesk about how market activity has cooled down a bit following the halving. Even so, speculative bets have been primarily bullish, he emphasized.  ""Long-short positions seem to have stabilized around 72% in favor of longs, but most of those are residual longs from before the halving,"" he told CoinDesk on 14th June.  He continued:  ""For a true mean reversion and ‘resolution’ of the halving event with respect to market dynamics, these residual longs would need to close, either through a long squeeze (sharp selling) or a pump enticing traders to close at a profit.”  While a short-term price increase may not be forthcoming, market observers said investors should keep in mind that bitcoin prices have enjoyed a steady, upward movement over time.

42399144,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVV8,1468941338,Russian Regulator Intends to Allow Bitcoin Buying and Selling Abroad,"An official from Russia’s Ministry of Finance has indicated the financial regulator now supports changes to a proposed law that would still ban bitcoin domestically but carve out provisions for its use as a foreign currency.  In a new interview with state-owned newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev said the change in tone is part of a broader effort to limit the use of alternatives to the ruble domestically, while removing uncertainty for those working with blockchain, its underlying distributed ledger technology.  The announcement represents a significant change in tone for the organization, which has long pressed forward on a bill to ban digital currencies, as well as impose criminal penalties on their users, despite more favorable remarks from the Russian central bank.  According to the interview, the Ministry of Finance continues to support a ban on the use of bitcoin in Russia, a move it believes is supported by its Constitution, which mandates the ruble be the sole currency in use for national commerce.  Still, Moiseev suggested his agency will seek to adjust the law to allow citizens to use bitcoin, and even profit from using bitcoin as a ""foreign currency"" in areas where such activities are legal.  Moiseev said:  ""Can Russian citizens have a wallet and pay bitcoins in those countries where it is allowed? Why not? Therefore, we are formulating the law in such a way in order to allow buying cryptocurrencies for foreign operations and allow Russian citizens to sell bitcoins for profit reasons in foreign countries.""  Moiseev also clarified that, at present, there is nothing preventing the use of bitcoin domestically, and that the intent isn’t to limit development of blockchain technology, but prevent its use from threatening the ruble.  ""We must remove responsibility for bitcoin emission from data operators in order to avoid risk of their punishment,"" Moiseev told the news source.  He said an updated version of the law could be submitted to the state law-making body, the Duma, before the end of 2016.

42399147,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVW7,1468889112,Congressional Resolution Calls on US Government to Support Blockchain,"A new resolution submitted to the US House of Representatives calls for the development of ""a national policy for technology"" that would include digital currencies and blockchain technology.  It invokes the idea of bitcoin without calling it by name – referring to ""alternative non-fiat currencies"" – and blockchain tech, which it says has the potential to ""fundamentally change"" how trust and security are established in online transactions.  The non-binding resolution  is sponsored by Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Indiana; and Representative Tony Cardenas, a Democrat from California, is co-sponsoring the bill.  The resolution goes on to say that alternative currencies are ""leveraging technology"" to improve security and increase transparency in ways that could allow them to supplant the ""decades-old payment technology"" used by financial institutions.  It states:  ""The US should develop a national policy to encourage the development of tools for consumers to learn and protect their assets in a way that maximizes the promise customized, connected devices hold to empower consumers, foster future economic growth, create new commerce and new markets.”  The submission further encourages the US government to promote the advancement of alternative technologies that ""support transparency, security and authentication"". At the same time, it calls for innovators to develop technologies that encourage consumer commerce.  The resolution was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which saw one of its subcommittees hold a hearing on bitcoin and blockchain tech earlier this year.  The resolution's introduction has won early praise from advocates of the technology who work on Capitol Hill, including Jerry Brito, executive director of the non-profit Coin Center.  ""The proposed House Resolution from Rep Kinzinger shows that many in Congress understand that the federal government should adopt policies that encourage blockchain innovations to flourish,"" he told CoinDesk.  However, the timing of the resolution's introduction indicates that it may be some time before the Energy and Commerce Committee actually moves to address the measure.  The resolution was introduced on 14th July, just before Congress began a weeks-long recess ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Both the House and Senate won't reconvene until the first week of September.  A representative for Rep Cardenas was not immediately available for comment when reached.
