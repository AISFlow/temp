42377844,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73o8l,1417106463,Citi Chief Economist: Bitcoin is Closest Commodity to Gold,"Gold is a commodity like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Citi's chief economist argues in a research note published yesterday, ahead of a Swiss vote that could cause the global gold price to spike.  Switzerland will hold a popular referendum on Sunday called 'Save Our Swiss Gold'. If passed, it would mandate the Swiss National Bank to hold a fifth of its assets in gold and to repatriate its holdings from England and Canada. The bank would also be banned from selling its gold in future.  Gold prices have dropped as markets await the referendum. If the referendum is passed, gold prices will surge, although this is unlikely, CNBC reported.  Polls show that the initiative has the support of only 30% of voters, short of the 50% required, the broadcaster said.  Value by agreement  The low chance of a successful referendum hasn't stopped the mega-bank's chief economist, Willem Buiter, from warning that the proposal is a bad idea. Buiter spends much of the 14-page note describing the similarities between gold and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  ""Gold as an asset is equivalent to shiny bitcoin,"" he wrote in his note to clients.  Gold, Buiter continues, is unlike any other commodity, but bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bear the closest resemblance to it. Like gold, bitcoin has to be mined, is limited in supply and has no significant utility.  He also notes that both gold and bitcoin are anonymous to a degree and are ""outside assets"", that is, assets that are not a liability to any other party.  Fiat currencies, he argues, are defined not by the legitimacy conferred upon them by political rulers, but by the fact that they have no intrinsic value. Instead, they are valuable only because enough people agree that they are. Therefore, gold can be thought of as a 'fiat commodity'.  In the note, he also likens gold to the currency of the Isle of Yap: stone disks called 'rai' with a limited supply.  The popular online course hosted by the University of Nicosia and taught by Andreas Antonopoulos and Antonis Polemitis also uses the rai example, except it is likened to bitcoin. In both cases, the stone currency has no intrinsic value, beyond what is agreed upon by the people on the island.  Buiter writes:  ""This intrinsically useless form of money ... is in all essential respects equivalent to gold today. Another example would be pet rocks ... another is bitcoin, a fiat virtual currency.""  Humanity's oldest bubble  Both gold and bitcoin are, in Buiter's view, in ""benign bubbles"". The analyst argues that since fiat money is intrinsically useless, it should be valued at zero in a hypothetical economy in a state of 'fundamental' equilibrium. Gold's positive value therefore shows that it is in a bubble, Buiter says.  ""The gold bubble, is, of course, pretty impressive ... It has had a positive value for nigh-on 6,000 years. That must make it the longest-lasting bubble in human history,"" he writes.  The fact that gold is in a bubble is no indicator of its future value, Buiter says. The same would apply to bitcoin's future price. Investors in either asset, then, should brace themselves for ""an exciting ride"", he says.  Buiter writes:  ""Even though I view gold as a pure bubble, that bubble may well be good for another 6,000 years ... investing a vast amount of money in something whose value is based on nothing more than a set of self-confirming beliefs will make for an exciting ride.""  Since gold has no intrinsic value and it is in a bubble, the Swiss central bank would be exposed to undue risk if is mandated to hold a fifth of its reserves in gold, Buiter says.  Instead, he advocates a balanced portfolio of commodity exchange-traded funds for the bank.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/27/citi-chief-economist-bitcoin-is-closest-commodity-to-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c5c65cf93575e044b460fc30118fd59fefee859-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377855,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oLL,1417094956,Purse.io Closes $300k Funding to Expand Amazon Discount Service,"Update (17:40 27th November): Updated with comment from Bobby Lee, Roger Ver and StrongVC.  _______________________________________  Purse.io, a San Francisco-based startup that allows people to buy items on Amazon using bitcoin, has closed a $300,000 seed funding round involving prominent members of the bitcoin community.  The firm has also announced new data on the discounts provided by its platform for Amazon shoppers, along with a VIP membership scheme and a redesigned website.  Roger Ver  , Bobby Lee and Terrence Yang all took part in the funding round, along with FundersClub and StrongVC, Purse.io said, adding that the money will be used to build bitcoin apps and improve the user experience.  ""Our mission is to build awesome use cases that will drive mainstream bitcoin adoption. To do that, we also need to bridge the gap between 'one-click shopping' and shopping with bitcoin,"" said company co-founder Andrew Lee.  John Nahm, co-founder and managing director of StrongVC, told CoinDesk:  ""This is our second bitcoin investment ... The co-founders are hardcore, super-sharp believers in bitcoin and are on a mission to innovatively solve one of the biggest challenges of bitcoin, which is consumption/usage.""  Meeting twin needs  Purse.io  is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches customers wishing to purchase bitcoin using their credit cards or gift cards and with bitcoin holders who want to spend their cryptocurrency with retail giant Amazon.  As a simple example of how it works, say Alice wants to spend $50-worth of bitcoin on Amazon. She makes a wishlist for her item and posts it on the Purse marketplace, placing the correct amount of bitcoin in escrow.  Bob wants to buy $50 of bitcoin, so he accepts the order, and pays with credit/debit card or gift card. When the items arrive with Alice, she notifies the website and the bitcoin is released from escrow to Bob.  The service ultimately won the admiration of users, and its new investors.  Bitcoin Foundation board member and BTC China CEO Bobby Lee told CoinDesk that he has become an ""avid user"" of the service, one that also sees the potential in the Purse.io business model.  ""From early on, I had envisioned that people would one day be able to buy anything with bitcoin because as long as it had a market price, an intermediary party could always come in to accept the bitcoin on behalf of the seller, including someone like Amazon.com,"" Lee said.  Discounts on the rise  Discounts for shoppers  are based on the premium that bitcoin buyers are prepared to pay for the service and are set by the Amazon shopper when the order is placed on the marketplace.  Notably, Purse.io has released data indicating that, over the seven months since the firm launched, it has seen the average discount rate for bitcoin shoppers increase to around 20% – figures that exceed even the company's initial expectations.  Purse.io explained:  ""We hypothesized that the market would equilibrate at 5-8% discounts. We never expected to uncover 20% discount rates when we first started.""  While great for customers, the firm also views the discounts as an incentive for mainstream users who may not yet be interested in digital currencies.  Purse says its business model creates a new bitcoin use case, giving more people access to bitcoin using their credit cards, while at the same time opening up Amazon to holder of the digital currency.  Roger Ver, who also confirmed to CoinDesk that he was involved in the funding round, said:  ""I recently became a huge fan of the company after becoming one of their users ... I think Purse.io could be one of the killer apps that drives bitcoin into the mainstream.""  Opportunity in gift cards  Purse.io also allows customers to use their Amazon gift cards to be redeemed, unofficially, through its marketplace. Since these cannot normally be redeemed outside Amazon, or transferred or sold through third parties, the company suggests many users are prepared to use them at a substantial discount.  The company claims there are an estimated $15bn in outstanding Amazon gift cards and credit balances that are locked to an individual's account and can only be used on Amazon – potentially a great way for the company to generate revenue.  Additionally, a substantial portion of these credit balances are distributed internationally through affiliate advertising programmes, which creates additional opportunities, the company says.  Purse.io essentially provides Amazon gift card holders with a way to get get cold hard cash (after they exchange their BTC, of course).  VIP benefits  Along with the funding announcement, the company has launched an invite-only premium programme, Purse VIP, which is aimed at Amazon Prime members.  VIP users are offered the best rates when they buy bitcoin on Purse.io's platform, having exclusive access to sub-10% discounts for the first 24 hours after they are posted.  Andrew Lee said:  ""To incentivize spenders to set lower discounts, we guarantee that their order will be fulfilled in less than 24 hours, or Purse will automatically purchase the order ourselves. So far, we haven't bought any orders ourselves because they're getting fulfilled even quicker. The average VIP order is fulfilled in under six hours and delivered in 2.5 days. This means merchandise is delivered as quickly as purchasing on Amazon directly with Prime.""  The service currently has more than 12,000 users and monthly transactions have passed the $120,000 mark, the company says. Purse.io is featured on the Blockchain wallet as a preferred merchant.  CoinDesk has reached out to the company's new investors and will update this article if confirmation is received.

42377856,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oNr,1417079661,Decentral Launches Bitcoin Talk Show and Video Channel,"Toronto-based co-working space Decentral has rebranded, dropping 'bitcoin' from its name and launching two new sites including a 24-hour bitcoin video news service.  This will include the new Bloomberg-like information dashboard site Decentral TV, and a redesigned version of the original Decentral.ca site, which itself has a new focus on news updates and informational content.  Co-founder Anthony Di Iorio told CoinDesk Decentral's aim is to be ""a home for decentralized and disruptive technologies"", whatever form they may take, providing quality and in-depth reports from its Spadina Avenue studio and around the world.  He said:  ""We want to make it the place where people are coming for everything they need in one spot.""  The site will host multiple different video shows led by its flagship Decentral Talk Live show, a talk show-style program hosted by Di Iorio himself and partner Ethan Wilding, with a third rotating seat shared by up to 10 other hosts.  Viewers will be able to call or write in and ask questions of the hosts.  Other bitcoin video media producers will be invited to contribute too. The key, Di Iorio added, is quality.  ""I think there's a lack of good quality (bitcoin) video content. There's a lack of reviews on products. Video reviews do really well, and I don't think there's anything in the bitcoin space that's really going in-depth with good product reviews. That's what we want to do.""  Interviews for the flagship show will be done in Decentral's new studio and via Skype, featuring subjects from across the decentralized technology ecosystem.  News, reviews and more  So far the team has done interview series with representatives from various bitcoin ATM companies, is currently working on one with exchanges, and plans another with wallet services.  Di Iorio thinks there is enough material out there – whether it be news, reviews, or educational in nature – to supply about six hours of new content per day, which could then be repeated over a 24-hour period.  As well as the video content, Decentral TV's dashboard page features a selection of other news and information from the decentralized technology world: curated headlines from various daily news sources, price and mining data charts, and a ticker at the bottom of the screen showing price updates on the top 15 cryptocurrencies.  Users can configure their preferred exchanges and local currency for bitcoin prices. A dropdown playlist shows a selection of available videos.  As an incentive to viewers, Decentral TV will be running a 'hidden brain wallet' contest similar to the one used for its Rushwallet product, in which clues are hidden around the set for viewers to piece together. A total of 10 BTC will be up for grabs in the first two weeks.  Growing the team  Decentral began life as a co-working space for bitcoin startups, but has since expanded to house decentralized technology projects of all kinds, most notably crypto 2.0 project Ethereum.  Di Iorio said the organization is trademarking the 'Decentral' name in various jurisdictions with the goal of franchising its take on the co-working concept around the world.  ""We're really building things up at Decentral. In-house we've got a graphic designer, lawyer, accountant, security specialist, developers – so we're really building up a good team and the co-working space is starting to pick up. It's going good.""  Teams working at the Toronto location have produced the Kryptokit and Rushwallet bitcoin browser solutions, and the organization also hosts an accelerator fund to support entrepreneurs developing the second generation of cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/27/decentral-launches-bitcoin-talk-show-and-video-channel,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c09ecbd815df04ec6657c1aa713a7e379ff3306-1500x791.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
