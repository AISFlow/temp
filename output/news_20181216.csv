42402361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43nu,1545001348,The Intrinsic Value of Crypto (What the Bubble Hasn't Changed),"Hu Liang is co-founder and CEO at Omniex, an institutional trading platform for crypto assets, and a former senior vice president of State Street.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  At the inaugural Consensus Invest last year in New York City, I was on stage with a host of notable names in the crypto world to discuss what 2018 would hold.  That event, in November 2017, would also mark the first time I announced the formation and funding of Omniex, the first institutional investment and trading platform focused on crypto-assets, following my departure from State Street Bank & Trust.  Just a few weeks ago, I was again in NYC for Consensus Invest. Now, with the eventful year of 2018 almost behind us, I've spent some time thinking about what has transpired and whether the intrinsic value of crypto has materially changed for institutional investors.  The Intrinsic Value Argument  I've always maintained the true intrinsic value of crypto is its ability to create decentralized networks that ultimately lead to new forms of businesses. In fact, in this article from one year ago, I made this exact argument.  The financial use case, beyond that of blockchain technology, is that of crypto as a new and standalone asset class in a multi-asset class portfolio, be it passive or active. A year later, I have not wavered in my thinking. What I have realized and adjusted to, however, is that a new asset class is not created in just one year.  The meteoric price increase in nearly all crypto assets a year ago has affected everyone from retail investors to institutions. While I externally maintained the price increase was not sustainable, there were nights when I thought to myself ""Maybe this can go on,"" even though I knew the fundamentals did not support it at the time.  I can't help but think back to the 1996 speech of former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan during the rise of the Internet bubble, ""How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions...?"" Well, with hindsight being 20/20, I think we can say we now know.  But does this come as a surprise? For someone like me who went to college and started his professional career during the height of the internet bubble, this really does not surprise me. In fact, many have equated the rise of blockchain and crypto to internet’s rise during the 1990s.  In other words, saying their use cases have yet to fully mature.  When I was leading the Emerging Technologies Center at State Street, I actually equated crypto and blockchain to the internet of the 1970s, which would imply it's even further away from maturity. The asset pricing bubble, however, came quicker in crypto than for the internet. This is logical as both information dissemination and business model transformation are much faster post Internet.  A Post-Bubble View  Is the fall of crypto really that impressive?  Let's put it in perspective with the dot-com. NASDAQ, at its peak in 2000, fell 72 percent. Cisco, a bellwether of the technology industry, was down about 86 percent from its peak. And finally, Amazon, the biggest story of the internet age, was down a massive 95 percent from late 1999 to late 2001, crashing from $107 to just $5.97.  The similarities I'm attempting to draw here aren't about the crash, but rather its aftermath.  We learned post dot-com that for a company to have sustainable value, it must have real utility. An online pet store isn't very interesting in the long run, but an online book store with path to become the online ""everything store"" is compelling.  Now is when we really need to focus on delivering on the true intrinsic value of crypto and blockchain, turning away from undue speculation and creating real use cases and value networks. As Michael Casey so clearly put it, we caused the current crypto-winter and we are the ones who should fix it.  What does fixing it mean? As stated earlier, I don't believe the true intrinsic value of crypto has changed. It is the foundation of a new business and economic model, one in which a fully or partially decentralized network can provide similar value to those of centralized networks with fewer intermediaries. It also plays a vital role in demonstrating that centralized and decentralized models are not mutually exclusive.  I often hear people and panel moderators asking ""Which model will win?""  The answer is quite simple, both. Just as we don't expect one company to dominate a market sector, we should not expect centralized business models of today to be the only model going forward. This plays true for the inverse as well; decentralization will also have to share the market. So, to me, fixing it means proving the decentralized model will work, en-masse, over time.  A 2019 View  As we greet 2019, I look forward to two areas of advancement.  The first is moving beyond retail to create a crypto ecosystem that empowers institutional investors to participate in the crypto and blockchain revolution. Let's not forget that crypto is the only asset class in history that didn't start from the institutional front, and as a retail-first phenomenon we’ve been left with an ecosystem devoid of institutional infrastructure.  However, the infrastructure and uptake are well on their way.  2018 has also shown that crypto and blockchain have clearly caught the attention of institutions. With crypto moving beyond the retail market, companies like Fidelity, ICE (parent of NYSE), NASDAQ, Microsoft, Starbucks and a host of Ivy League endowment funds have all either started initiatives or invested in the space. Along with global regulators, this concerted effort is now laying down all the appropriate functions and a solid foundation for institutional fund managers to enter the space.  The second and perhaps more important area of advancement in 2019 is a broader adoption of decentralized networks at the protocol level. New opportunities are invitations to startups. The important thing to remember is that startups don’t all succeed. Despite the setback of the ICO boom, as true innovations succeeds in garnering wider adoption, the true intrinsic value of crypto will be realized – and that moment will be a great one.  For now, at Omniex, our goal for 2019 is to continue building a sustainable ecosystem for institutions to easily adopt crypto as a new asset class. Along with the other institutions mentioned earlier, I'm a firm believer the industry will regain its prior highs, built on a sturdier foundation, as broader protocol network adoptions continue into 2019.

42402354,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43f3,1544958057,"Exchanges, Startups Pick Sides After the Bitcoin Cash 'Hash War'","The so-called ""hash war"" over the future of bitcoin cash is over – and what remains appears to be a persisting rivalry between the forces behind what are now two distinct cryptocurrencies.  Created in November when the blockchain underwent a controversial system-wide upgrade (also called a hard fork), there remains a segment of the bitcoin cash community that follows a new software protocol called Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision, or BSV.  With the remaining community following a competing implementation of bitcoin cash called Bitcoin Adjustable Blocksize Cap, or ABC, the expectation shortly after the split was that one blockchain would quickly overtake the other.  In part, these expectation were stoked by rumors of an impending “hash war” in which SV proponents would redirect computation energy also called hash power – normally used to mine blocks on a blockchain – to sabotage operations on the ABC chain.  But following the hard fork that led to a split the bitcoin cash blockchain, Craig Wright – the one-time Satoshi Nakamoto claimaint, chief scientist at nChain and one of the leading figureheads for BSV – denied plans of chain attacks, instead calling for a strategy called “persistence hunting.”  He told CoinDesk:  “This is long term. People have got to understand that we are not taking the quick easy path and if they don’t like it that’s too bad.”  Now, nearly one month after the fork occurred, proponents on the SV side, including Wright, are focusing efforts on developing SV’s brand and attracting adoption among users and businesses.  Though on this front, Roger Ver – CEO of bitcoin.com and outspoken supporter for Bitcoin ABC – argued at a CNBC event in Tokyo last week the SV side was still losing.  “The ABC version of bitcoin cash has more hashrate, more exchanges, more wallets, more everything. The BSV coin – I wish them good luck – but it's a separate project and it's not bitcoin cash. They have … less everything,” said Ver.  As such, the two coins – while no longer engaged in a battle over sustained computation energy or hash power – are nonetheless in fierce competition with one another to achieve the highest degree of user adoption.  After all, the original vision of bitcoin cash, still championed by Bitcoin ABC and SV supporters alike, is the creation of a global peer-to-peer payments network.  Both see the ultimate use case for their respective cryptocurrencies as a digital form of cash, certain proponents on the Bitcoin SV side even go so far as to say that in the long-run there will exist only one cryptocurrency.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Lorien Gamaroff CEO of BSV wallet Centbee said:  ”There will be one bitcoin. I think that all these other coins – all these thousands of them – will disappear and only bitcoin [SV] will survive and that’s bitcoin in its original form.”  A “pro-business” move  Straying from the original design of bitcoin in an important way, bitcoin ABC developers implemented a contentious upgrade five days following the bitcoin cash split.  The changes to the network were two-fold:  Block finalization: The history of blocks on the bitcoin ABC blockchain can only be reorganized – or “reorged” in short – back to ten blocks. This means that transactions featured in a block that has been added to by a minimum of 10 blocks are final. In other words, these transactions cannot be changed even if a longer running version of the ABC chain proposes alternative transaction history.  Reorg threshold: In addition, for a longer running bitcoin ABC chain to reorg even less than ten of the most recent validated blocks, the length of the chain must feature twice as many blocks as the number it seeks to reorg. This means that for an opposing chain to attempt a four block reorg, this chain must present not only five newly rendered blocks but eight.  Outside of preventing a maliciously mined version of the bitcoin ABC blockchain from overtaking the network, this upgrade dubbed “Bitcoin ABC 0.18.5"" poses benefits to businesses and cryptocurrency exchanges operating on the network.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Tanooj Luthra – ex-Coinbase engineer and current CTO for blockchain startup Elph – explained:  “It’s definitely a pro-business, wallets, operations heavy move … If you don’t have some amount of guarantee that a transaction has been finalized how can you ever actually use the currency? How can you actually buy a good with it?”  Viewing the traditional guarantee of “proof-of-work” or the longest running chain as an ideological preference, Luthra explained that in practice reliance on hash power did not hold practicality for smaller cryptocurrencies like bitcoin ABC.  As such, he predicted strengthened support from exchanges and businesses exchanging funds on the network as a result of this upgrade.  To Luthra’s point, three cryptocurrency exchanges – Coinbase, Bitso and Gemini – have since allocated the bitcoin cash ticker symbol “BCH” to the Bitcoin ABC blockchain. They have also additionally refrained from adding support for users looking to trade the Bitcoin SV cryptocurrency citing continued “uncertainty” over its future as in the case of Gemini.  Outside of these three, other exchanges have enabled support to Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV either allocating the bitcoin cash symbol to Bitcoin ABC or differentiating it from Bitcoin SV as “BAB/BCHABC.” These exchanges include but are not limited to: OKEx, Kraken, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and CoinEx.  The makings of 'sound money'  And though Bitcoin SV is currently unlisted by certain cryptocurrency exchanges, it’s value on the exchanges that do allow SV trading has climbed in recent days to sit almost at par with the ABC coin.  Having grappled over the past week on the five exchanges listed above, bitcoin ABC looks to hold a slight price advantage over the other – both being valued below $100 at the time of publication.  Confident that the SV platform will “ramp up” in profitability over time, Steve Shadders – Bitcoin SV developer and director of solutions and engineering at nChain – told CoinDesk:  “Substantial businesses and organizations have committed to building on the SV blockchain … I’m very confident about the future of bitcoin SV because the businesses that have pledged to support us are the ones that have real sustainable business models.”  Pointing to the official bitcoin SV website, Shadders noted that two dozen cryptocurrency services and ten different wallet applications currently support the nascent blockchain network.  One of these very businesses being Centbee, Gamaroff added that his convictions about the SV blockchain came down to believing in its future as “sound money.”  Rejecting all new and controversial changes to protocol – apart from increases to block size – bitcoin SV supporters like Gamaroff believe in “a fixed protocol set in stone.”  “Every coin out there wants to be sound money but nobody realizes that for it to be sound, it needs to be unchangeable,” said Gamaroff.  Echoing these sentiments, Ryan X Charles CEO of MoneyButton – an online payments tool listed to operate on the SV network – told CoinDesk before the split that the “burden to businesses” of continual changes to the protocol was “well-intentioned but not based on operating a … business.”  At the same time, supporters of ABC like Luthra maintain that changes to the code – as opposed to reducing the stability of a network – are healthy signs indicating prolonged usability.  Speaking to ABC’s most recent upgrade 0.18.5, he told CoinDesk:  “It’s a really good sign that [ABC developers] are trying to get more widespread adoption and make things little bit more usable and little bit more practical.”  Though several businesses, such as CoinText and BitPay, have already announced their support of the new bitcoin ABC network, a full list to indicate the relative number of competing services on ABC has yet to be created.  As such, with the bitcoin cash hash war having come and gone, the renewed battle between these two camps are unlikely to be solved on the basis of hash power any longer. Leaving it up to market forces now to decide the fate of bitcoin ABC and SV, the key question to ask moving forward will be: who is using which network?

42402349,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43b7,1544955326,Coinbase and the Awkwardness of Growing Up,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk’s product team.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.    --------------------------    Coinbase's recent announcement that it was considering another 31 tokens for listing was greeted with a potent mix of vindication, disappointment, query and speculation.  The exchange’s decisions generally spark a heated discussion, but this one seemed particularly controversial, with detractors and supporters taking totally different interpretations of the move.  Many expressed shock that Coinbase would degrade its brand by supporting what some deem low-quality assets; others celebrated that a broader range of options would soon be on offer; some liked the general plan but disapproved of the details.  Whether you agree with the strategy or not, the important part is not which tokens were chosen, or even whether the exchange should be considering tokens at all.  Rather, the big takeaway is a subtle yet significant shift in what we mean by “exchange,"" and in what that says about infrastructure development.  You’re everything to me  In the early days of bitcoin, an “exchange” was where we could buy cryptocurrencies with fiat. Choices were limited, volumes were relatively low and all were operating under the radar of the financial regulators.  Fast forward to today, and the landscape is barely recognizable. “Exchanges” of all shapes and sizes are dotted around the world, and many enable trading of a bewildering array of assets, and some offer licensed services.  Yet, technically, none of them are “exchanges” in the traditional sense of the word.  In traditional finance, investors interact with exchanges through their broker-dealers or similar. There is a buffer between the trading platform and the end client, which – in typical “middleman” fashion – adds a layer of cost but also of regulatory protection and convenience.  In crypto-land, the exchange often is also the broker-dealer. And the custodian. And the clearinghouse. And sometimes also the prop trader, the investment bank and an issuer.  This is complicated for regulators, who need to monitor potential conflicts of interest. It’s also complicated for the users, especially those used to dealing in traditional securities.  Move with the times  What does this have to do with Coinbase’s evolution?  The client-facing nature of crypto platforms makes investors’ choice of trading venue a much more important part of their crypto strategy. And the need to capture and retain clients is fundamental to an exchange's survival.  In the traditional equity world, investors tend to not care (or know) where the stock they want to buy is traded. They give instructions to their broker-dealer, and the broker-dealer executes in its clients’ best interests.  In the young world of digital assets, the services offered by exchanges have a material impact on new investors’ choices. But, as in life, clients eventually “grow up” and start to want more complicated options.  Coinbase, with its relative reach and ease of use, has done a great job of bringing new participants into the crypto space. But the users that it has today are more sophisticated than they were a year ago.  All are familiar with the basics; many now want to diversify into lesser-known altcoins, especially given the need for return and the bleak performance by the large-cap cryptos. What’s more, setting up accounts on other exchanges has gotten easier over the past year, even with stricter identification requirements. Switching costs are low.  So, in the light of intensifying competition and an increasingly demanding client base, as well as the difficulty of bringing in new investors in this bear market, Coinbase has taken what seems like a sensible business decision: diversify the offering, and give existing clients what they want.  Stumbling block  Where the strategy seems more questionable is in the transmission of this information, and the potential consequences.  Leaving aside the negative feedback on the chosen coins (few of which meet the criteria that Coinbase published back in September), the decision to reveal which are under consideration could be interpreted in several ways.  The company maintains that it would rather dispel suspicions of insider trading by letting the public know which ones might get listed. This sounds prudent, but does not fully remove the risk of unintended consequences.  In crypto land, much more so than with traditional securities, where a token is listed is fundamental to its value, especially given the lack of liquidity in the market for newer issues. Just the possibility of listing on Coinbase is enough to send a token’s price up.  If Coinbase then decides to not support a particular asset and its price falls, the company could find itself – fairly or unfairly (I am not a lawyer) – vulnerable to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or investor lawsuits for market manipulation.  What’s more, since employees could have accumulated a coin before the initial reveal and sold before the rejection, the specter of insider trading does not necessarily go away.  A lot at stake  So, Coinbase’s strategy is a departure from its previous public image of “crypto blue chip,"" but it does make sense in the broader evolution of the market. By widening its offering to cater to an increasingly sophisticated client base, Coinbase is highlighting the deepening maturity of the sector.  However, in its rush to get ahead of (or even keep up with) market trends, it is possible that it has overlooked a deeper shift: a widening disconnect between the sector’s roots and its current status. The crypto asset sector started out retail. That implies different priorities and tactics, as well as a different client-first mindset.  Yet few sectors, if any, are as regulated as capital markets. The increasing attention from media, official organizations and institutional investors requires a shift in standards.  Juggling the need to navigate this roadmap with that of growing a business in a challenging sector is tough, and fraught with confusion and conflict over what is expected – especially when it comes to communication.  What is fine in a consumer business is not necessarily fine for a financial enterprise, where the wealth of others and the appearance of market integrity are at stake.  This is a big risk: Coinbase getting into regulatory trouble would be a blow to the industry as a whole. No doubt it has a legion of qualified lawyers advising it on its every move. Let’s just hope that internal structural issues don’t blind it to the needs of the new world into which it is evolving.
