42398476,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTc8d,1436562439,VC Firm Block26 Makes First Bitcoin Bet on Airbitz Wallet,"Los Angeles-based venture capital firm Block26 has completed its first investment, contributing $450,000 to the ongoing seed round for bitcoin wallet provider Airbitz.  Launched in June, Block26 has indicated it plans to focus specifically on blockchain and digital currency ventures, contributing to seed to later-stage rounds.  Calling the funding the company's ""first big announcement"", Block26 principal Ni'coel Stark indicated that Airbitz is representative of the kind of companies in which her new venture firm is looking to invest.  Stark told CoinDesk:  ""We're really looking for nuances in the technology. Airbitz is an amazing wallet, it solves problems for consumers, but it's so much more than that. We see opportunities beyond the wallet, the ability that they have to go into security, their contributions to the Internet of Things, altogether they really make them fascinating.""  She went on to call Airbitz ""underrated"" compared to its competition due to its team's ability to contribute to areas of the technology beyond simply creating quality mobile bitcoin wallets.  ""Block26 is attracted to what's under the surface,"" she added.  Going forward, Stark indicated that Block26 intends to ""innovate along with the space"", and that it plans to focus on a smaller selection of high-quality startups.  Founded in 2014, Airbitz was previously accepted into the Plug and Play Tech Accelerator, based in Sunnyvale, California.

42398479,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcBa,1436559348,Deloitte Outlines Concept for Central Bank-Backed Cryptocurrency,"Would a central bank ever issue its own cryptocurrency?  While the verdict may still be out, a new report by professional services giant Deloitte explores how it might go about doing so.  Entitled ""State-Sponsored Cryptocurrency: Adapting the best of Bitcoin’s Innovation to the Payments Ecosystem"", the report envisions a bitcoin-like system in which financial institutions act as uncompensated miners for a ledger governed by a central bank.  The idea of a central bank-backed cryptocurrency has been floated in the past, as shown by concepts like Fedcoin and comments by the central bank of Singapore.  In such an instance, the central bank would, in theory, have control of the money supply, and the currency on the network would be declared legal tender and linked with whichever fiat currency the central bank issues.  Deloitte suggests that such an experiment would be worth pursuing, particularly as institutions like the US Federal Reserve seek new methods of improving existing digital payment methods, noting:  ""The result very well may just be a new method of handling payments that would revolutionize the current system. With the potential to reduce costs, reduce errors, speed the transfer of money, balance privacy with anonymity, and do it without the day-to-day operational need for a centralized organization, whether commercial or federal, the result could truly be transformational.""  Of course, there would be key differences between bitcoin and Deloitte's hypothetical central bank cryptocurrency. For example, there would be no limit on the number of network tokens, whereas bitcoin is designed with hard cap of 21m BTC.  The central bank would also control development and determine which entities verify transactions. In addition, banks would provide user-facing services like wallets, although according to Deloitte, users would retain control of private keys.  Monetary policy powers  The fact that a hypothetical central bank-backed cryptocurrency would lack a hard limit and be subject to supply increases or decreases represents perhaps the largest departure from bitcoin under the concept.  Deloitte outlines how a central bank might go about controlling the money supply within such a system, explaining:  ""To increase the supply of money, a central bank could transfer crypto-dollars, in realtime, from its private key to different financial institutions’ private keys. In order to contract the money supply, a central bank could increase reserve requirements and financial institutions would transfer crypto-dollars to the central bank’s private key, in a manner that would be functionally identical to how this process works today.""  Would such an idea catch on?  Deloitte concludes that while a central bank-backed cryptocurrency ""may not replace bitcoin or any other virtual currency or paper fiat currency in its entirety"", the concept could some day form part of a broader ecosystem of digital currencies.

42398490,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcON,1436553200,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Greece Lightning Strikes Twice,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.  The fires of one of bitcoin's hottest recurring debates raged on this week, with the digital currency's potential use case as a safe haven asset during times of economic crisis taking the forefront amid continued struggles in the eurozone.  The focal point of the media's attention, as with last week, was Greece, a beleaguered nation suffering the effects of economic uncertainty, with reports attempting to discern if and how the digital currency was playing a role in this larger narrative.  Not up for debate was the fact that bitcoin's novel status as a fiat currency alternative was highlighted by the struggles. Complicating matters, however, were reports that often confused the expected usefulness of a more mature digital currency ecosystem with its current market.  Arguably more problematic were attempts to tie the issues in Greece to seemingly tangential events, such as the increase in the digital currency's price and issues with its payment network, that ventured into speculation while providing little, if any, plausible conclusions.  Bitcoin, the new safe haven?  Though little evidence was found that Greek buyers were behind bitcoin's rising price, some commentators noted that the perception of the digital currency's utility as a hedge for the euro was convincing investors of its potential.  Nasdaq's David Floyd offered a truly relatable description of bitcoin's current market position, asserting that bitcoin is ""growing up"" in the eyes of investors as a result of its association with the crisis.  Floyd wrote:  ""People are beginning to acknowledge that the kid [bitcoin] has a point.""  Still, he suggested that bitcoin perhaps isn't a practical solution for currency crises today. ""Bitcoin's identity crisis,"" he said, can't last for ever. ""It's high time the cryptocurrency found a niche and made a productive contribution to the financial ecosystem. In short, bitcoin, get a job.""  Floyd also adddressed the digital currency's potential in Greece, pointing to how the underdeveloped bitcoin ecosystem was holding back its utility in the current crisis.  ""Some observers have called the price move purely coincidental. Others have suggested that the increased demand is coming not just because of Greece, but from within Greece, as panicked citizens move their savings into the digital currency. Greece's one bitcoin ATM, however, has seen zero activity since capital controls were imposed on June 28: no one who's managed to get euro bills is about to convert them,"" he said.  Reports from on the ground differ from this conclusion, as Greek ATM owner Vedran Kajić estimates his ATM conducted €800 worth of business on Friday alone.  Still, drawing the connection between market movements and the media's coverage, he added, is an exercise in armchair psychology. He argued the hypothesis that a potential Greek default would drive nervous capital into bitcoin is ""perfectly plausible"".  ""Bitcoin is the new safe haven,"" he added.  The comments did much to boost the validity of many in the bitcoin community, who trumpeted how the price of gold, a traditional safe haven asset, has moved little over the course of the Greek crisis.  Why bitcoin?  Less convinced of the usefulness of such debate was FT Alphaville's Izabella Kaminska, who instead put forth the opinion that the attention given to bitcoin made little sense given that the country was not experiencing a currency crisis.  Her argument, put simply, seemed to imply that as a non-government currency, bitcoin or another blockchain-based money, while potentially helping individual citizens, would do little to solve the problems a government would face during a crisis.  She asked:  ""Why on earth would Greece want to replace the euro, a currency it already thinks too restrictive, with another which would be even more constraining and give Greeks even less control over monetary affairs!?""  In her argument, Kaminska cited FTCoin, a cryptocurrency-based solution proposed by Greece's former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. Using this concept, he had attempted to find a way to normalise Greece's tax evasion issues – sometimes branded a national sport.  Kaminska, however, attacked the argument that a digital currency would solve tax collection issues in Greece, stating:  ""If and when this [adopting a parallel currency] happens, the parallel scrip will remain a highly politicised form of money whose true value will be linked to the government's democratically-approved authority to extract taxes and spend funds on the public's behalf. Whether that coupon comes as FTCoin or drachma makes little to no difference.""  Cited in a CNBC piece by Kalyeena Makortoff, Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics put things into perspective, agreeing it was unlikely that the Greek government would officially adopt bitcoin.  Search for answers  Finally, the narrative propagated in sometimes problematic ways in stories that sought to connect more specific issues with the technology to Greece.  Reporting for Bloomberg, Olga Kharif picked up on the surprise bitcoin fork that took place over the Independence Day celebrations in the US, leading to the validation of some transaction blocks meant to be invalid.  This fault, caused by the delayed implementation of a bitcoin core update by a small part of network participants, seemed to cause some concern among mainstream journalists, though it was written off as regular activity by many steady market observers.  Kharif led her piece with the Greek economic crisis, describing bitcoin's price movements in relation to events in the European country but soon took to reminding people that the digital currency was flawed, suggesting it was not an ideal solution for the debt-ridden economy.  ""Over the weekend, bitcoin's software provided a well-timed reminder of why it's not the perfect financial system, either.""  Given the attention Greece has driven to the technology, however, it remains to be seen whether next time there is a macro-level crisis, the ecosystem will be more prepared.

42398485,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcIT,1436544158,Problems Mount for Customers of GAW Miners Linked ISP,"Customers of GAW High Speed Internet, the ISP linked to now-defunct cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners, are reportedly experiencing broad service outages.  As reported by regional news service VTDigger, users in the Brattleboro area of Vermont have lost access to email accounts, and GAW HSI staff are reportedly unresponsive to complaints.  The news comes months after services outages in Massachusetts occurred, during which phone access for small business customers of GAW HSI was cut off. Service was later restored for some of those affected customers.  GAW HSI owes Vermont $18,018 in disbursed grant funds that were never used, an amount the state Attorney General's office is currently seeking. According to VTDigger, that office issued two letters seeking repayment in April and May.  State telecommunications official Jim Porter told the news service that the ISP has been on the radar for years owing to service issues, noting:  ""For a couple of years we have believed they have provided subpar service. As we look at our connectivity map we want to increase speeds in targeted areas where GAW is the provider. We have known them to be a problematic provider for two to three years.""  Customers in the state have been advised to contact the Vermont Department of Public Service to be direct to alternative ISPs.  GAW HSI, formerly known as Great Auk Wireless, is a New England-based ISP previously run by Josh Garza, who later established GAW Miners, and is owned by Cantor Fitzgerald vice chairman Stuart Fraser.  Customer problems  Those affected say they have been adversely impacted due to the unannounced loss of service, echoing complaints from other HSI customers who have previously indicated service disruptions resulted in significant problems.  One customer told VTDigger that they've been without access to their Gmail account since May.  ""It’s just really, really bad,"" Vermont resident Dawn Carillo said. ""Everything in my life goes through my email. I don’t get notices through the mail. I’ve done away with paper wherever I can.""  Customers from Maidstone, Vermont say that they were promised annual reimbursements and free broadband access after agreeing to lease their property to HSI. These promises, they say, have not been delivered.  The complaints seem to mirror those from customers of GAW's mining and cryptocurrency ventures, many of whom have sustained losses as its mining operations have ceased and the price of paycoin has crashed to roughly 6 cents apiece, according to Coinmarketcap.com.  Growing legal challenges  The move by Vermont officials to take action against GAW's ISP company for the service failures represents the latest legal challenge against the now-defunct organization. It remains unclear what steps the state AG's office will take, a representative for the office was not immediately available for comment.  In April, a Mississippi-based utilities firm filed suit against GAW Miners for breach of contract, seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid electrical bills. GAW failed to respond to the suit and on 22nd June the court clerk filed an entry of default in the case.  A court case in Connecticut, also filed in April, sought roughly $200,000 in damages from GAW Miners and PayBase, the money services platform created by GAW. The two plaintiffs in the case filed suit after seeking arbitration. The judge in that case ultimately found in favor of the plaintiffs, authorizing a garnishing of GAW and Paybase-related bank accounts.  GAW and its former CEO Josh Garza could face a more concerted legal effort in the near future in the form of a group lawsuit, which is said to have drawn support from both US-based and international customers numbering at least 400 individuals. That lawsuit is expected to be pursued in US federal court.  The company continues to be the focus of an on-going investigation by federal authorities including the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).

With the addition of the new payment option, ChangeTip users can add to their tipping wallet via credit card, bitcoin or a direct ACH transaction.  Purchases can be made with any card running on the Visa or MasterCard network, however, American Express and Discover are not available. Additional bank fees apply for purchases.  ChangeTip head of community Victoria van Eyk indicated that, while users could previously use credit cards to make bitcoin purchases through Coinbase, the addition of a direct credit card purchasing option will remove added friction from the wallet top-up process.  Van Eyk told CoinDesk:  ""The idea is to make buying bitcoin really easy, so we decided to create an option where users can do it right on the website. We want to provide the smoothest end-to-end experience.""  Credit card users are restricted on how much bitcoin they can purchase with the service, with daily limits being set at a minimum of $10 and maximum of $20. Additionally, users can only buy $40 worth of bitcoin every three days and $80 each week, though this figure increases based on the number of social accounts users connect to ChangeTip.  To add a credit card, users must provide their first and last name, email address, mobile number, date of birth and billing address.  Users who are not verified with the service must then connect a verified Facebook or Twitter account, and connect an additional Twitter, GitHub, Reddit or StockTwits account.

42398474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTc7e,1436498423,Wedbush Report Projects $400 Bitcoin Price By 2016,"The price of bitcoin can be expected to rise to $400 over the next 12 months, according to a new report by Wedbush Securities.  Authored by Gil Luria and Aaron Turner, the report begins with the goal of forecasting the future value of shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), the first publicly traded bitcoin fund launched in March, ultimately concluding it will outperform its current $30.60 price to rise to $40 next year.  In its calculations, however, Wedbush expands on its approach to valuing bitcoin based on its expected penetration of large target markets. The bitcoin payments network, it suggests, could end up powering 10% of online payments and 20% of global remittances by 2025  The report reads:  ""By aggregating the utilization of the various applications, we arrive at our $400 BTC price target, which translates to $40 per share of GBTC. This implies [roughly] $6bn market capitalization, which we would also describe an option on bitcoin supplanting some payment volumes from Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union, who combine for [less than] $300bn in market cap.""  Wedbush indicated it sees bitcoin demand stemming from its increasing use in e-commerce payments, remittances and micropayments due to its ability to reduce costs in these industries. For instance, the report estimates bitcoin can lower online payments fees from 3-8% to less than 0.5%, while it can cut the cost of remittances from 5-10% to less than 1%.  Secondary to these industries, the report predicts, will be bitcoin's growth as a ""banking alternative"" in times of economic crisis, its applications for machine-to-machine transactions and applications of the blockchain as a distributed ledger.  Speaking to CoinDesk, author Gil Luria indicated that the goal of the paper was to answer a question that has long been the subject of theory, but little actual research.  ""At this point, with all the investments from big exchanges and VCs, I thought it was worth tackling the tougher question of how to value a bitcoin,"" Luria said.  Billions in volume  For its calculations on the subject, Wedbush also sought to determine how many bitcoins could be expected to be in circulation and held for investment annually until 2025.  The report notably foresees the percentage of bitcoins being held for speculation decline at a 2% rate annually over the next decade, falling from an estimated 24% today to 4% in 2025.  At that time, Wedbush expects bitcoin to account for 10% of the $5.9tn online payments market, 20% of the $744bn remittance market and 20% of the $924bn microtransactions market.  Using these calculations, Wedbush forecasts the bitcoin network could support $595bn in online payments volume, $148m in global remittances and $184bn in microtransactions.  Additional inroads are expected in enabling financial services in the developing world, with the bitcoin network accounting for $596bn in this financial activity.  ""We see the scope of disruption as substantial considering 20% of US GDP is generated by industries whose main function is as a trusted third party,"" the report states.  The calculations led the Wedbush authors to conclude that, based on the amount of bitcoin needed to support such financial activities, the price of bitcoin is currently trading at 40% below its expected future volume at its current $270 price.  Risk remains  Despite a mostly positive outlook, Wedbush acknowledged that the price of bitcoin could ultimately fall to $0 or otherwise rise and fall erratically.  The report projected that a change in the perception of bitcoin's eventual value, even by as small as 0.01%, could drive a $100 change in the value of the payment network's currency.  ""This is different than most other financial instruments that have a far narrower range of outcomes, which in turn create more stable values,"" the report reads.  Wedbush further suggested that there remains a 50% probability that bitcoin could succumb to a ""Napster outcome"" whereby it is overtaken by another distributed payments network, rendered useless due to a fatal flaw or made broadly illegal.  Still, it suggests there is also a 49.98% chance bitcoin will become a solution for its target use cases and a 0.02% probability that bitcoin will become a ""global working capital of trade"", in which case it foresees a scenario in which a single bitcoin could be worth up to $1m.
