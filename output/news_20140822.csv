42377556,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723NX,1408746305,BitPay Reveals it Paid ESPN Bitcoin for Bowl Game Sponsorship,"BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi announced today that his company paid for its upcoming college football bowl game sponsorship in bitcoin.  The surprise news came at a press conference held by BitPay and the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce to promote the upcoming Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl.  There, Gallippi revealed that BitPay paid ESPN Events, a subsidiary of the popular US sports network ESPN, in bitcoin in order to secure the sponsorship, a company spokesperson confirmed with CoinDesk. Notably, Tampa Bay Business Journal has estimated that its full contract with the broadcaster is estimated at roughly $1.5m over the course of three years.  The event was held at the St. Petersburg Museum, which has announced that it will accept bitcoin as part of BitPay's wider promotion for December's main event, joining a list of merchants that includes Ferg's Sports Bar and Grill, Green Bench Brewery Co and Hotel Zamora.  In addition to Gallippi, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair and BitPay executive director of the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl Brett Dulaney were also in attendance.  The Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl will be held on 26th December.  About the bowl  The news is the latest update on BitPay and its work to promote bitcoin through the major televised sporting event. Announced on 18th June, the promotion was widely covered by the mainstream media, including The Wall Street Journal, Sports Illustrated and the editorial arm of ESPN.  BitPay further highlighted its plans for the game at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) in July, appearing at the event with an ESPN representative.  The postseason sporting event takes place at the end of the NCAA college football regular season. In lieu of a traditional bracket-style playoff, teams are paired based on their performance in the regular season, before facing off in matches in individual bowl games.  In total, 39 bowl games will be held at the end of this year.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42377547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723CD,1408743025,Bitcoin Center NYC Brings Bitcoin Startup Incubator to Wall Street,"Bitcoin Center NYC has announced that it is now accepting applications for a startup incubator that will help entrepreneurs fund and manage new digital currency ventures.  While the launch has brought new attention to New York's first brick-and-mortar bitcoin resource center, co-founder Nick Spanos explained that the announcement simply adds formal branding to the work already being done by his team at 40 Broad Street.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Spanos moved quickly to separate his new incubator from more conventional offerings, describing the program as a showcase for talented entrepreneurs who want to attract the knowledge and capital they need to succeed.  Spanos told CoinDesk:  ""We're more than an incubator in someone's garage out in Silicon Valley. We're on the ground floor here, we're 100 feet from the New York Stock Exchange and we have market makers and Goldman Sachs people and anyone you can think of that walks into our doors, and they want to invest.""  Once accepted into the program, Bitcoin Center NYC will provide startups with office facilities, housing and access to its staff, though Spanos noted such extensions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Personal struggles  Spanos told CoinDesk that the reason he decided to extend this opportunity to upcoming bitcoin entrepreneurs lies in his own past. Prior to entering the bitcoin industry, Spanos was an tech entrepreneur, having founded web ventures in the hospitality industry in the 1990s.  The former founder and CEO of Getaroom.com, Spanos describes his startup as an early AirBnB, an online destination that offered booking for vacation rentals and grew to encompass offices in Buenos Aires, Florence and Manhattan.  Still, he says that his business ultimately was passed over for investment due to the fact that he didn't have crucial connections.  He recalls:  ""I was a viable business and made money every month, and some of these other outfits, they didn't make any money. But they did have one thing, they had a pretty good Wall Street connection.""  Fostering relationships  Throughout the interview, Spanos sought to frame Bitcoin Center NYC's location as its strategic advantage and main selling point for entrepreneurs, saying that this high visibility will give startups the exposure they need.  ""They can be out in Wisconsin, thinking they're going to get funded, but that's not where it happens,"" he added.  Spanos also noted that simply by working at the Bitcoin Center NYC, selected startups will be provided mentorship opportunities from individuals with a wide range of backgrounds.  But, at its simplest, he says the new initiative is just about allowing Bitcoin Center NYC to continue to do what it does best:  ""We're just augmenting our brand to encompass this also, we've been doing it anyway, and we want to do it some more.""

42377552,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723HF,1408739153,From Gold Rush to Arms Race: Why Bitcoin Mining is Heading North,"The face of industrial-scale bitcoin mining is changing with every passing month, having already pushed far beyond the bounds once envisioned, perhaps, by the hobby miners of four years ago.  The landscape is much different now. Many large-scale mines are shifting from warehouse set-ups to data centers better equipped to deliver the massive power and cooling resources necessary to compete in a steadily accelerating industry.  CoinDesk spoke with executives from some of the biggest hardware companies in the mining space. During those discussions a picture emerged of an industry undergoing a rapid level of investment, development, and most importantly, competition.  KnCMiner director of marketing and public relations Nanok Bie put it simply:  “It’s an arms race. Absolutely.”  As both he and Spondoolies Tech CEO Guy Corem explained to CoinDesk, the next stage of industrial-scale bitcoin mining will focus on squeezing every ounce of operational efficiency out of both the hardware itself and the facilities that house it.  The search for these capabilities has led bitcoin companies to the Arctic Circle, focusing on data center space in Norway, Iceland and Sweden in particular, where sub-zero temperatures make an ideal environment for mining.  Arctic push  As Bie explained, the industrialization of bitcoin mining has led companies to seek out the lowest resource costs possible. While many areas of the globe offer competitive costs and infrastructure, the Arctic is unique because the nations there actively seek business from bitcoin companies.  Bie told CoinDesk:  “It has to do a lot with access to cheap cooling and cheap energy. The energy costs and the energy taxes are interesting in [the Arctic], and there are several countries in the region that are well positioned. These countries are also very keen on getting this business. In general, the Arctic Circle will be the center of these developments going forward.”  These cultural and political opportunities – as well as the promise of low-cost bitcoin mining – are bringing companies to the region. At the same time, bitcoin mining in the region isn’t exactly new.  A report by The New York Times from December 2013 shined the spotlight on an Iceland-based mine. Based on conversations with those in the mining space, that company’s early approach could become the standard in the months and years ahead.  The issue of centralization  The push for Arctic-based facilities capable of delivering greater hash rates raises a key issue in the bitcoin network: centralization. Many in the community feel that putting control of the transaction process into the hands of a powerful few is dangerous, and for Corem, represents a problem not only facing the bitcoin community but the hardware companies themselves.  He explained:  “We think that too much centralization and too much industrial mining is not a good thing. Too much centralization is hurtful for bitcoin and for the ecosystem.”  Corem continued by saying that the market seems to be moving in favor of centralization, but argued that other players in the space, including Spondoolies, are actively moving to keep the network as decentralized as possible. This can be seen in efforts like MegaBigPower’s franchisee program, which begun explicitly as a means of expanding the network’s capacity in a decentralized manner.  Ultimately, it may be too early to say in which direction the industry will shift. While larger companies in the space, like KnCMiner, favor large investments in centralized operations, other mining firms like Spondoolies are pushing for broader decentralization. The next year, no doubt, will show how these opposing forces will interact with one another as the industry develops further.

42377555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723Jl,1408735208,BitPay on the State of Bitcoin Merchant Adoption in Europe,"Though digital currency has undeniably accumulated a strong following among consumers in Europe, the region has arguably trailed the US market in one notable area – high-profile merchant adoption.  Despite a number of mid-size merchants such as AirBaltic, 220volt and most recently Shipito joining the growing ranks of bitcoin merchants worldwide, a merchant with the revenue and notoriety of DISH, Expedia or Overstock has yet to become part of the region's bitcoin ecosystem.  However, according to BitPay director of European business development Moe Levin, this narrative may soon change. He told CoinDesk:  ""The sales cycle for merchants in Europe is longer than North America, I think that's the real difference in not seeing the billion-dollar companies here. Soon to be announced though.""  Throughout the interview, Levin stressed that while BitPay may not be making headlines in Europe, the reasons for this are cultural. Europeans simply see bitcoin as a less sensational, more practical business solution that can help them save on operational costs.  ""There are not so many big statements from people here, but everyday like clockwork more and more merchants are turning on BitPay's service, because it isn't a stretch. They don't need to be convinced the same way North Americans do,"" Levin added.  But, while the efforts haven't yet yielded headlines, Levin explained that BitPay is adding roughly 200 new merchants to the ecosystem each week, and that in doing so, it's produced valuable insight into how European business owners are thinking about bitcoin.  Defining the European bitcoin merchant  Levin indicated that, so far, BitPay hasn't seen a notable difference between the demographics of its US or European customers. In both regions, its merchants are primarily focused on winning bitcoin's main demographic – tech-savvy males, ages 18 to 45 years old.  ""The best merchants are the ones that target this demographic exclusively. So we're talking about electronics, travel, apparel and online purchasing,"" Levin explained.  The company's ability to penetrate each country, however, differs greatly. Levin indicated that while adoption is high among merchants in noted tech hubs such as Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich, countries like Austria lag behind due to their older, less tech-minded demographics.  Still, Levin suggested that bitcoin may have the best chance of achieving wider adoption in areas where bitcoin better competes against the available fiat alternatives, adding:  ""For the longest time the highest hits and search volume [on Google for bitcoin] has been from Estonia, the Netherlands and some of the Baltic and Scandinavian countries.""  Currencies are a way of life  Still, there are historical and cultural factors that make the European merchant market unique. For example, Levin noted that the transition to the euro, while 15 years in the past, has opened up European merchants to thinking more critically about currency.  ""People have been accustomed to so many currencies for such a long time that bitcoin is not a foreign idea. A bigger eurozone is a worldwide currency,"" he remarked.  Levin also suggested that Europeans are naturally more hostile to fees from banks and financial providers, whereas in North America, these costs are viewed as part of doing business, adding:  ""Here they've had enough of it already. They say listen the banks have done questionable things for a long time, they say that's enough of that, why should we be paying fees? They don't have the trust in banks that North Americans generally do, so it's on their minds.""  E-commerce growth key to adoption  Levin also addressed another potential area where bitcoin can aid European merchants – cross-border payments, which he described as surprisingly uncommon given the geographical proximity of the region's member states.  He said:  ""In Europe, I don't know what the reason is, but many people shop from the national e-commerce giants, and that's changing. Obviously, there's Amazon that's strong here and there are some other big players, but they're still shopping nationally.""  Bitcoin, Levin said, could be the key to helping European consumers break down these barriers of conventional commerce, citing it as a strong selling point that could become more prevalent in the future.  He added: ""Cross-border shipping is growing, and it means that bitcoin can assist with that.""  Roadblocks to adoption  Levin acknowledged that BitPay faces a number of challenges in Europe, however. In particular, he noted that due to a variety of local payment options, merchants aren't always able to put bitcoin first. He explained:  ""[Merchants] don't prioritize [bitcoin] over turning on an Estonian payment option or an Italian payment option, so from the company's perspective, they may put bitcoin on a 2015 list.""  He also pointed to the relative efficiency of existing payment networks in Europe, citing them as stronger than those currently in place globally. For example, he mentioned the iDEAL payment network in the Netherlands, which allows customers to pay for Internet purchases using online bank transfers.  Introduced in 2005, the system processed more than 142 million transfers in 2013.  ""In the Netherlands, to send money bank to bank, it takes a second. It's just as fast as sending bitcoin,"" Levin noted.  Focus on Europe  Of course, Europe is not only important for bitcoin, the market also poses a strategic relevance for BitPay, which is seeking to become the leading global bitcoin payment processor. While it faces competition from Coinbase in North America – the San Francisco startup that currently boasts big clients such as Overstock and Dell, that company has yet to prioritize Europe in a similar way.  Since closing a $30m Series A round in January, BitPay has been seeking to further its influence in Europe, adding key investors in the region such as Virgin Galactic's Sir Richard Branson and opening its European headquarters in April.  Levin said that, as such, BitPay has ambitious benchmarks for enrolling merchants this year, concluding:  ""We have benchmarks toward the end of the year to have another 30,000 to 40,000 merchants. The benchmarks are there, the main thing we're dealing with now is absorbing all the demand.""  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42397881,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES56,1408729224,New Drug Trafficking Charges Added in Ross Ulbricht Case,"UPDATE (22nd August 20:00 BST): Updated with comment from Ross Ulbricht attorney Joshua Dratel.      New charges have been filed against Ross Ulbricht, the 30-year-old, Texas native accused of using the alias Dread Pirate Roberts to operate illicit online marketplace Silk Road.  Filed on 21st August, the charges include narcotics trafficking, distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet and conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identification documents.  The latest development in the case follows news that Ulbricht had lost his bid to dismiss the case this July. Ulbricht's legal team had sought to remove certain money laundering charges levied by Federal prosecutors, arguing that bitcoins were not deemed to be money by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Ulbricht's attorney Joshua Dratel, of Joshua L. Dratel, PC, told CoinDesk that the while the US government has added new charges, this doesn't represent a change in the nature of the evidence that will be provided in the case. Further, he said the defense will not need to conduct any additional discovery.  Dratel explained:  ""If that is true, and it's too early for us to draw a conclusion (having just received it yesterday), these additional charges simply demonstrate the government's penchant for converting a single alleged course of conduct into a set of multiple similar, interchangeable charges in an effort to improve its chances of having a jury, overwhelmed by the sheer number of charges, agree with the government on at least one.""  Ulbricht was originally charged with drug trafficking, money laundering, computer hacking and for serving as the ‘kingpin‘ on a drug trafficking enterprise, charges he plead not guilty to on 7th February.  The latest filing adds more specifics to the accusations, alleging that Ulbricht personally distributed substances containing methamphetamine, cocaine, LSD and heroin, and conspired to sell fake ID documents, including passports and driver's licenses.  Ulbricht is currently serving time in New York's Metropolitan Detention Center, awaiting a trial set to begin 3rd November.  Support effort continues  The charge is also the latest blow to FreeRoss.org, the legal defense fund seeking to raise money for Ulbricht's defense, as well as the group's supporters.  Despite continued interest from the mainstream media regarding the case, Lyn Ulbricht, mother of the accused and manager of FreeRoss.org, indicated on 3rd July that this interest had not translated into an uptick in contributions.  Still, grassroots support from the bitcoin community for the group continues. On 7th July, noted bitcoin community member and angel investor Roger Ver started a twitter campaign for Ulbricht that promised $10 would be donated to FreeRoss.org for every retweet.  At press time on 7th July, Ver's message of support had received more than 16,000 retweets.

BitcoinTour  allows users to exchange their digital currency for hotel, train and flight reservations, as well as tour bookings. Airlines supported by the firm include Air Asia, Citilink and Lion Air. The agency also claims to support ""almost all"" of the starred hotels in Indonesia.  The organisation has been set up as part of Bali's BitIslands initiative, which aims to turn the popular Indonesian tourist destination into a 'bitcoin paradise'. The company also accepts payments in Indonesia's national currency, the rupiah.  BitIslands' project director Oscar Darmawan said that even though BitcoinTour is less than two weeks old, it has already taken more than $10,000 in bitcoin, adding:  ""We are confident that in the future the sales will be increase by more than triple that.""  Bitcoin Island  The BitIslands project, launched in May 2014, plans to persuade all local businesses to accept bitcoin and is sponsored by Bitcoin.co.id, Indonesia’s largest bitcoin exchange and lobby group.  Darmawan said:  ""[The] Bitislands Project has been growing quite well in Bali. There is a co-working space, hotels, villas, restaurants, a jewellery shop, food delivery services and even taxis that are accepting bitcoin. Currently, we are also running a bitcoin centre that provides free education for people who want to know about bitcoin.""  BitIslands' full bitcoin business directory can be seen here.  Tourist benefits  Extending from close to Malaysia all the way to Australasia, Indonesia is a vast archipelago of over 13,000 islands littered with volcanoes, tropical forests, diver-friendly reefs and a host of different cultures.  While an increasingly popular destination for travellers, the nation's infrastructure often leaves much to be desired.  ATMs are often few and far between and offer limited amounts for withdrawals, businesses do not always accept credit cards outside larger tourist spots and travelling with large amounts of cash comes with the usual security concerns.  For this reason, there is a significant use case for integrating bitcoin into the nation's tourist infrastructure, Darmawan said.  ""We get visited by many bitcoiners,"" said Darmawan, ""and some of them come with interesting stories about how they lost their wallet because it got stolen when they were on the market. So they need to sell some bitcoin to get some rupiah. And some of them come straight from the airport to get cash in rupiah. We are glad to be helping them while visiting Indonesia.""

42397889,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbESB0,1408716419,Bitcoin's Popularity Boosts Phishing Scam Success,"Bitcoin has fired the public imagination so intensely that even non-bitcoin users are falling for phishing scams that dangle the prospect of cryptocurrency riches in front of them, according to new research from digital security firm Proofpoint.  Proofpoint  found that thousands of phishing messages disguised to look like emails from a Blockchain wallet were sent to addresses with no direct link to bitcoin. This is a departure from typical bitcoin phishing attacks that target known and active cryptocurrency users, according to the security firm.  The new attacks yielded a ""staggeringly high"" response rate of 2.7% from victims, suggesting that members of the general public were sufficiently attracted by a bitcoin lure to click on the malicious links.  Kevin Epstein, vice president for advanced security and governance at Proofpoint, said:  ""Imagine a phish touting automobile insurance that was sent to non-car owners – the fact that anyone clicked, much less 2.7%, is startling testament to human weakness and the intrigue around bitcoin.""  Companies and organisations hit  The Proofpoint research found that 12,000 messages were sent to more than 400 large companies and organisations across a range of industries, including finance, media and manufacturing, in two ""waves"" of attacks on 13th and 14th August.  The firm declined to name any of the targeted organisations, citing confidentiality agreements, but said they included one of the world's largest financial institutions, a Japanese automotive manufacturer, two major American universities and three of the biggest international healthcare organisations.  The malicious messages were made to look like an automated email from wallet provider Blockchain, alerting the recipient that there had been an unauthorised attempt to open the wallet.  The recipient is asked to reset their wallet password by clicking a link which brings the victim to a log-in screen that seems identical to the Blockchain wallet page. Any wallet details submitted through this fake log-in page are transmitted to the scammers, who can use them to access the victim's wallet.  While the attack would only be profitable if it tricked an actual Blockchain wallet user, Epstein said that the high click-through rates, which have been better than for benchmark rates for marketing communications like email newsletters, suggest that even non-bitcoin users knew enough about cryptocurrency to be lured by the prospect of gaining access to some potentially lucrative bitcoins.  ""It's a staggeringly high click-through rate given the relative percentage of recipients who would have been bitcoin holders,"" Epstein said.  'Topical news' approach  Proofpoint noted that the phishing attack's employed a straightforward 'account warning' template that is simple yet highly effective.  The phishers also played on current fears over hackers from China by framing their initial message as a security alert over an unauthorised log-in attempt originating from Sichuan province in western China. That province's technical university has made headlines as a possible proving ground for state-sponsored elite hackers.  Epstein said this was the ""topical news"" approach to phishing, which had been recently deployed in other attacks that used this summer's World Cup as cover.  ""Topical news is always effective. We have seen and will likely continue to see 'Chinese hackers' as an element,"" Epstein said.  The research did not uncover the attacker's identity, although Epstein said that the attacks appeared to be purely profit driven, which ruled out organised crime or industrial espionage.  He warned that the method of attack held rich potential to inflict greater damage in future, particularly if they were used to deploy trojan horses, which is software that performs unauthorised actions on your computer, or ransomware, which blocks a victim's access to a computer until a ransom is paid.

42397877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbES29,1408711913,OKCoin Reveals BTC Reserves of 104% as China's Exchanges Undergo Audits,"Chinese exchange OKCoin today released details of an audit to prove it holds 104.86% of the bitcoin reserves required to cover customer balances.  Going forward, the company will also seek to implement a cryptographic 'merkle tree’ verification system, allowing users to verify for themselves that their account balance was included in the audit data.  Other China-based exchanges are busy working on audits of their own, following recent demand from the local community for the companies to be more transparent in their accounting.  BTC China  announced on 19th August that it would allow an independent third-party audit of its hot and cold wallets, while Huobi is in the process of implementing its own merkle tree-based proof system. Huobi is also working to integrate its newly-acquired multi-signature wallet service Quickwallet.  OKCoin's audit, which lasted four days, was completed free of charge by Stefan Thomas, CTO of Ripple Labs. Thomas had previously overseen similar audits for digital currency exchanges Kraken and Bitfinex.  CEO Star Xu acknowledged that today's audit represented ""just one point in time"", but promised that more would occur on a regular basis as a necessary step towards financial transparency.  OKCoin  ’s CTO, Changpeng Zhao, said:  ""We have always sought to provide our customers with confidence in OKCoin’s security and world-class technology architecture. Whilst many bitcoin businesses have talked about being transparent, only a handful have taken the necessary steps.""  Huobi's response  Huobi posted a statement on Reddit detailing its thoughts on the proof-of-reserve matter.  According to its research, Chinese customers tend to use their exchange accounts like banks. As a result, only 20% of Huobi's reserves are being actively traded, with the remaining 80% remaining dormant between major market movements, it said.  The exchange added that this 80% would be ""encouraged and incentivized"" to move their funds into the company's new multi-signature Quickwallet accounts, which would become more tightly integrated with Huobi's other services to allow for instantaneous transfers.  Huobi also offers 'Yubibao' wallets in which customers make their funds available for lending to margin traders, and earn interest in return.  BTC China to hold audits, set up hotline  BTC China said it already makes 100% of its order book publicly available, and will prove its own reserves by allowing independent third-party auditors access to an anonymized accounts database.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk the auditors will be ""prominent leaders in the domestic bitcoin industry, with an influential public profile and a vested interest in the honest reporting of the exchanges"". They must also have a strong financial background and a deep understanding of bitcoin.  The audits will then take place on a quarterly and annual basis. Additionally, an international audit team will be selected to satisfy non-Chinese customers, the spokesperson continued.  ""While our auditors are prominent within the Chinese bitcoin community, we recognize that to many of our international users they may be unknown. As an international platform, it is very important to us that all of our users, current or potential, have faith in our security and stability as an exchange.""  Why it's an issue now  Proof-of-reserves for digital currency exchanges has been a sensitive issue in the community since the collapse of Mt Gox in February.  Since that time, exchanges such as Kraken and Bitstamp have taken steps to verify their bitcoin holdings through third-party audits by respected members of the digital currency community.  More recently, however, margin-trading and interest-earning accounts introduced by exchanges like OKCoin, BTC.sx, Bitfinex and Huobi to attract 'serious' traders were criticized, perhaps unfairly, for causing the recent sudden drop in bitcoin value.  Users in China, meanwhile, were beginning to question how their local exchanges had grown so large and profitable. Some speculated in various online forums that bitcoin companies were running a fractional reserve system akin to modern-day mainstream banking.  ""Of course, this is a very risky practice that can potentially cause a default,"" said BTC China, adding that there were concerns about risk management strategies at any exchange offering complex financial products.  User 'P2PBucks', who operates a popular Chinese bitcoin portal website, was one of those asking for answers.  He told CoinDesk that users need more action than audits:  ""In my point of view, exchanges must [be] under the surveillance of whole bitcoin community. Only merkle tree and third party notaries are not enough – every exchange must disclose their cold wallet addresses.""  ""Exchanges are playing a extremely important role in bitcoin world! Market prices are coming out from these exchanges, they are deciding the price, which are used by the whole world. Every bitcoiner must keep an eye on them,"" he continued.  Exchange transparency techniques  CoinDesk has previously published a detailed description of what happens when Ripple's Stefan Thomas performs an exchange audit, using a combination of anonymous account records, bitcoin block merkle trees and other tools developed especially for the purpose.  According to bitcoin guru Andreas Antonopoulos, for audits to be effective at winning customer confidence they need to be thorough and followed up with future examinations.  Audits should also look at the company's fiat currency operations, and include assessments of security safeguards in place, he said.

42397892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbESCy,1408704114,How Burning Man's Camp Bitcoin Became Camp Dogecoin,"Black Rock City excludes buying and selling by definition.  Rising from the Nevada desert for the annual Burning Man festival, it's a temporary community where rental van logos are covered to avoid commercialism and where a bike ride might net you a free dance lesson or a grilled cheese sandwich from a billionaire, but no shopping.  So what is a cryptocurrency camp doing at Burning Man, an event where even bartering is deemed too capitalistic?  Relax. It's dogecoin.  Late-model burgundy caravan  In the official Burning Man database, the camp is registered as Camp Bitcoin. But after hatching a plan for a bitcoin-themed camp early this year, its organisers began dropping out: one is getting married, one has a new baby and another ended up under house arrest.  Just a couple of weeks before 'burners' (the term for Burning Man attendees) were to converge in the Nevada desert, Gary Lachance and a handful of other dogecoin enthusiasts, most of them from Vancouver, British Columbia, picked up the mantle and ran with it. Now Camp Bitcoin has been rechristened Camp Dogecoin.  Lachance said in an email that he and friends are driving a ""late-model burgundy doge caravan"" that was bought on credit especially for the trip. It should be hard to miss.  ""We'll be strapping a giant red rocket to the roof, slapping a doge head on the hood, and overloading the van with crazy people and unlikely items and diminishing our odds of getting across the border. That's how we roll.""  Another contingent is heading south in more low-key style, driving a rented recreational vehicle.  Unpredictable and illogical  Wendell Davis, of bitcoin wallet maker Hive, originally conceived the camp with Satoshi Square founder Josh Rossi and other friends. Davis said he approves of the shift from Camp Bitcoin to Camp Dogecoin.  ""That's totally in line with Burning Man itself. It's totally unpredictable and illogical. If Camp Bitcoin's destiny was to become Camp Dogecoin, then so be it,"" said Davis, who opted to stay home for health reasons.  Lachance, whose life is devoted to decentralization, predicted that dogecoin's absurd aesthetic will be a better cryptocurrency ambassador to Black Rock City than bitcoin would have been.  He added:  ""People see bitcoin and they think in terms of money laundering and drugs. But they see this dog and that's just like [chuckles] the last thing on their minds. The subversity of it is definitely awesome.""  Camp Dogecoin will be part of Anahasana Village, an established Burning Man locale with plenty of infrastructure to share with the dogecoin crew, which, having come together in a couple of weeks, is light on preparation and funding.  Wallets, buttons and a dance party  Organizers think 20 or more burners will stay in camp, but no one is really sure. They are broadcasting their plans to the 200 recipients of the original Camp Bitcoin mailing list, so it could turn out to be more.  Planned events include a Worthless Currency Exchange, where Monopoly money is traded, a Bitcoin for Beginners class, and discussions about cryptocurrency and decentralization in general.  Participant Cameron Gray plans to print out paper wallets with a few dogecoin in each to give away free. Kyle MacDonald will bring a button-making machine, which he will use to create buttons with a dogecoin theme or any other kind of button that the moment calls for.  Lachance, who propagates a phenomenon known as the Decentralized Dance Party year-round, hopes to throw such a party on the playa, and will also be recruiting folks who want to run Decentralized Dance Parties in their home cities.  The organizers say the loosely planned events all revolve around helping burners understand the intersection between cryptocurrency and decentralization with the annual gathering's guiding principles, like radical inclusion, decommodification and self-reliance.  ""We're not just going to go there and say, 'doge is love',"" said Gray, a Vancouver musician who runs cryptocurrency coworking space decentral.bangtown.  He added:  ""The mission [will be] helping people get into crypto to understand why it's a good thing, even though it's money at Burning Man. How it connects with open source, how it connects with radical inclusiveness, how it connects with justice, transparency, openness. Yeah.""  This is not the first time cryptocurrency will be mentioned at Burning Man.  For the past three years, there has been a gathering where 50 or more people showed up to learn about bitcoin for about 90 minutes, said Darrell Duane, mayor of Anahasana Village and a bitcoin enthusiast who has been helping make Camp Bitcoin/Camp Dogecoin a reality.  Some camps have used bitcoin to raise funds, and some people have urged Burning Man organizers to accept bitcoin for tickets.  Founding principles  In online discussions, a common thread has been the concern that any currency-themed camp might contradict Burning Man's non-commercial ethos.  One of the Ten Principles of Burning Man is 'decommodification' with the explanation: ""our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising."" In that spirit, camps do not put up corporate logos, and many burners even cover or change the logos on their vehicles.  Lachance and the other organizers feel that Camp Dogecoin is in line with Burning Man's principles, since it will not be advertising a company, and any logo that they end up displaying will not be a corporate one.  He added:  ""Dogecoin is not an organization, it's basically a protocol. It's like having Camp Email.""  Veteran burner Duane acknowledged that other burners may question how a crypto-camp is appropriate given the aversion to advertising and commerce. His response is that cryptocurrency essentially decommodifies banking, making it very relevant to the burn.  ""If we were to talk about using BitPay or Coinbase, that would not be appropriate,"" said Duane, who welcomes any controversy as a way of pushing Burning Man boundaries, adding:  ""Some people will say, 'You can't do this, you can't sponsor this camp.' We'll be educating them.""  The shift to dogecoin will probably eliminate some of the controversy that may have arisen around bitcoin.  Bitcoin is used by major corporations and has spawned slew of startups; it's big business. It's hard to feel as threatened by a currency with a big grinning shiba inu mascot that likes to say ""such wow"".  But one controversy is sure to arise in the desert as enthusiasts who have only communicated in type meet in person for the first time: how to pronounce dogecoin.  Lachance's web page about the camp lists only three rules, and one is: ""Dogecoin must be pronounced 'dogh-gee-coin', not 'dohj-coin'.""  But as many, if not most, people use the latter pronunciation, commenters on the page quickly took issue with Lachance's edict. In a phone interview, Lachance stood by the ban on 'doje'.  ""We're totally against that,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/22/how-burning-mans-camp-bitcoin-became-camp-dogecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd7c82d5623860e5f9c38a066b82e14a12d88c1a-1280x652.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
