Now Bitcoin fell more, and GBTC's discount, to add insult to injury, widened further still. I explain why, as well as provide some hints for the future. For a long while, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) has traded at a discount to NAV -- Net Asset Value, the value of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) it holds. Indeed, one year and a half ago I wrote an article titled “ The Price For Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Makes Sense ”, on why this was the natural state for GBTC. I highly recommend reading that article, since it goes into much more detail than this one will, on the mechanics of the discount itself. Since then, and especially in the last few months (and weeks), this discount has widened further still. As of yesterday, the discount to NAV stood at 40.6% . Here’s how the discount has evolved over GBTC’s life : Coinglass.com, Theblock.co We can clearly see GBTC is now at a record discount to NAV. This begs an explanation, which this article will provide. The Reason Is Simple As I explained in my previous article, if GBTC holders need to exit their GBTC positions, there’s just one door: to sell. This is so because BGTC redemptions, at NAV, remain closed. That redemptions remain closed is obvious – there would be little to no discount to NAV if they were opened. Now, why do GBTC holders currently “need to exit”? They need to exit, in large part, because of recent events at FTX (FTT-USD). Indeed, the collapse at FTX. For some holders, it’s not even a “need to exit”. They are forced to exit. And since the only way to exit GBTC is to sell it. They are forced to sell it. Said another way, GBTC is under “forced selling” conditions and pricing. That drives the discount higher, since the sellers aren’t price-sensitive. They will just take whatever liquidity GBTC can provide; they’ll sell at whatever price there are buyers. We’re thus witnessing widespread GBTC liquidations. In a crisis you sell what you can, not what you want to. This is 1000x truer in a liquidity crisis, where your immediate liabilities requiring payment (for instance, withdrawals) exceed your liquid assets available to service them. First goes cash, then go cash equivalents, bonds, etc. Then goes anything which can be sold quickly and not at an extreme market impact. GBTC, in this sense, is a liquid asset. So, it gets liquidated (sold), because there’s no other way to convert it to cash – redemptions aren’t available. We have direct knowledge of at least one large forced seller, because we know the entity most under pressure held GBTC in its balance sheet (though already not a lot). Here’s a leaked FTX haphazard balance sheet, published on the Financial Times (subscription required) and elsewhere, supposedly put together by Sam Bankman-Fried himself on an Excel worksheet: Financial Times, others You’ll notice: That the level of immediate liquidity is extremely low, $900 million to face already more than $5 billion in withdrawal (USD and EUR) requests. That there’s still a bit of GBTC in there, in the “less liquid” column. There was likely more. And it’s one of the few easy to sell things which was still available to sell – some tokens in the same column might seem similar, but selling them would crash their value much more than selling GBTC, worsening the overall picture. I should add that there were rumors Alameda , connected to FTX, also held significant amounts of GBTC. These rumors are believable since Alameda and FTX shared positions in much of the same “less liquid” tokens as well. However, on FTX we have direct proof of ownership (however reduced already), while on Alameda it’s just rumors. Finally, much as FTX and Alameda held GBTC, so did other crypto and DeFi companies, from many of which FTX and Alameda had borrowed money. FTX’s and Alameda’s collapse equally put pressure on many of these DeFi companies, leading them to sell whatever they could to meet redemptions. Some, like BlockFi, eventually stopped being able to honor such redemptions, and had to close them. A curiosity here: Grayscale and BlockFi share the same owner, DCG (Digital Currency Group), which also owns Coindesk. A few observations: Since there’s a link to GBTC, there’s a higher likelihood these entities held GBTC. Although there shouldn’t be any cross-liability, an attempt to rescue the lending arm might lead DCG to attempt something which could produce a reduction in the GBTC discount. Namely, liquidating the trust (as long as it owns enough of it), which would entirely remove the discount and give access to the underlying value at NAV. This would generate free money, which would be useful in dealing with the crisis. However, at the same time this would kill the GBTC golden goose which regularly puts out commission eggs. GBTC has a 2.0% management fee. And this is charged on NAV. Hence, at the current $10.5 billion NAV, GBTC generates in excess of $200 million per year in management fees. It’s hard to liquidate the fund and let go of such income stream. Anyway, it’s obvious that liquidations tied to the FTX/Alameda collapse were the latest catalyst creating a higher GBTC discount still. Alongside, worsening crypto sentiment will also have contributed (again, the only way out is to sell). Indeed, worsening sentiment had already created a long slide in the discount. What About Looking Forward? As I said 1.5 years ago, it was my view that cryptocurrencies in general were a bubble. That bubble has deflated substantially. The whole cryptocurrency market was worth $2-$2.1 trillion when the previous article was written. Now, even though the market is comprised of a yet higher number of cryptocurrencies, the whole market is worth “just” $830 million . There is still a lot of irrationality in this shrunken market. Shiba Inu-themed joke coins like Dogecoin (DGE-USD) or Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) are still worth $11 billion and $5 billion, respectively. There are large potentially dubious stablecoins being worth as much as $66 billion still. Hence, arguably, there’s potentially a lot more downside out there. At the same time, though, we have three realities: First, is that the current market (for GBTC and cryptos in general) is – as explained -- one of forced liquidations. Typically, markets tend to bottom when forced liquidations happen, even if only temporarily. Second, is that GBTC’s discount is so large, that it discounts not the current crypto market size, but a crypto market size (and Bitcoin worth) that’s 40% lower. It’s perfectly possible that a crypto rebound would simultaneously see GBTC’s discount narrow, perhaps substantially (to, say, 20-25%). This would make GBTC outperform Bitcoin on a rebound. Third, on the other hand, we might be close to a recession in the U.S. (and EU) on account of higher interest rates, impact on housing, less stimulus and a negative wealth effect, just to name a few factors. Recessions typically lead to a level of asset liquidation as well, so this is a potential negative for Bitcoin, crypto in general, and GBTC as well. This is a negative. Weighing these factors, I’d tend to -- at the current GBTC price -- be temporarily neutral on GBTC even if I remain negative on crypto in a longer-term view.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SHIB,BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558910-gbtc-heres-why-discount-became-larger-still?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4391948.jpeg

Binance is the largest crypto exchange, but is it safe? There's some key differences between Binance and FTX. Moreover, I believe Binance Coin could be one of the best-performing coins in the coming bull cycle. Overview The recent demise of the FTX ( FTT-USD ) exchange has sent shockwaves across the crypto markets. Everything began to unravel last week when the native FTX token, FTT, began to plummet: FTT price (CoinMarketCap) This began partly when Binance CEO Zhao said it would be liquidating its FTT position. This was then followed by a leak of Alameda’s balance sheet , which revealed that the trading firm, also run by Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, was backed mostly by FTT. As of writing this, FTX has officially filed for chapter 11, leaving possibly over 1 million creditors to be made whole. How did this happen? The FTX implosion has reignited the narrative that crypto is but a Ponzi scheme, but this is a gross misrepresentation. The FTX exchange eventually failed due to a lack of liquidity, which was sparked by the fall in the value of the FTT token, which represented a large portion of the exchange's reserves. There also appear to have been some management issues, and authorities are investigating whether criminal misconduct occurred . But in the grand scheme of things, there is life after FTX, and while some have been dragged down with FTX, other crypto players have gained from the situation. Some of the big winners of this debacle have been decentralized exchanges, like Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) and private storage solutions like Trust Wallet, which saw its token rise over 47% . However, all eyes are now on centralized crypto exchanges, and none is larger than Binance. Binance also shares a layer of similarity with FTX in that it promotes the use of its native token, Binance Coin ( BNB-USD ) and even its own stablecoin, Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ). Is Binance exchange safe, and if so, is BNB a worthwhile investment? Is Binance Safe? The short answer is yes, and the company has gone to great lengths to prove it since the resilience of the whole crypto industry was put into question last week. Last Thursday, Binance published the address of its cold wallets to prove that it does indeed have the necessary reserves to support its $12 billion daily trading volume. These wallets have a total of $65 billion in assets with the following composition: $21.3 billion in BUSD $6 billion in BNB $13.4 billion in US Tether ( USDT-USD ) $8 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) $6 billion in Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) With this information alone, we can already see a stark difference between FTX and Binance. Alameda held a very large part of its net equity in FTT. This is not the case with Binance. BNB represents under 10% of the reserves, while over half of the reserves are denominated in USD stablecoins, with Bitcoin being the next largest holding. On top of that, Binance does not engage in large-scale trading or loaning. ""We don’t have loans, we don’t have debt,” he said. “I believe, in the industry, we don’t owe anybody any money"" Source: Changpeng Zhao, Twitter Having said that, Binance has just launched an Industry Recovery fund which might be used to prop up distressed companies/assets. All in all, the only way that Binance could suffer a liquidity crunch like FTX is if the value of its stablecoins was put into question. BUSD is a stablecoin launched in collaboration with Paxos, which is regulated by the New York state’s Department of Financial Services. Meanwhile, USDT is the largest stablecoin by market cap and has been under intense scrutiny in the past few months, leading it to increase its US Treasury reserves back in October. There’s no better place to hold your crypto than your own private wallets, but short of that, I think Binance is, in my opinion, the most secure and most competitive exchange out there. BNB is a strong Buy Binance’s native token has been one of the best-performing in recent months, and I believe it is a worthwhile investment. BNB can be used to pay for fees in the Binance exchange at a more competitive rate, but it also has functionality beyond that. The Binance Smart Chain is EVM compatible, which means that it has smart contract capabilities. Binance aims to provide an open, permissionless and multi-chain environment for innovators. Another strong point of BNB is its burn rate. The Binance exchange does a quarterly BNB burn using its profits to support its price of BNB. The company will continue to burn BNB until there are $100 million tokens in circulation. On top of that, BNB also has an automated burning mechanism where a percentage of each transaction fee is burned. The big downside to BNB is centralization, with the chain using a Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism and only 40 validators. Price Target Now, let’s look at the price analysis for BNB. BNB Price analysis (Author's work) Since the inception of the coin, we have formed at least 3 waves up, with the peak at $700 being the top of wave 3. Since then, we have come down in an ABC structure, which may have bottomed as we approached the 21.4% retracement. This is not a large retracement, but it is sufficient for a wave 4, and given the impulsive action we have seen off the low in June, I think we could already be starting a fifth wave up. The target for this wave is around $1000, which is the next key fib extension based on the arithmetic chart (the chart shown above is logarithmic). However, I believe that we could see BNB retest recent lows in the next few months. This short-term analysis has been explained more in-depth to my subscribers. Risks Although I believe Binance is a well-managed exchange with good intentions, the company has been accused of aiding money launderers. Also, Congress could possibly launch an investigation over Binance's role in the FTX collapse. After all, the announcement that the company would be selling its FTT holdings sparked the sell-off in the token. The crypto space is still fairly new, and there are still undefined lines of what is legal and what isn't and who can do what. To this extent, Binance also has to carry the burden of being linked to China. This is where the company was first started, though it is now headquartered in Hong Kong. In the future, Binance could face increased regularity scrutiny and even face a shutdown of its operations. This has already happened in the UK, where Binance has been banned. Final Thoughts Understandably, the FTX collapse has cast a shadow of doubt over centralized exchanges, but Binance is not like FTX. While I would still advise people to keep their coins in personal wallets, I don’t believe Binance is at risk of bankruptcy, and, in fact, I believe that BNB could be one of the best-performing cryptos in the coming bull market.",NEUTRAL,BNB | FTT,EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | BNB | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558903-binance-real-winner-of-ftx-collapse?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4391169.jpeg

Semafor reported on Thursday that Bankman-Fried will now be represented by David Mills, a criminal law and white-collar crime professor at Stanford University’s law school – where Bankman-Fried’s father, Joseph Bankman, also teaches law. According to a Bloomberg story on Friday, Bankman-Fried's previous attorney, Martin Flumembaum, had dropped him as a client due to unspecified conflicts.  “We informed Mr. Bankman-Fried several days ago, after the filing of the FTX bankruptcy, that conflicts have arisen that precluded us from representing him,” Flumenbaum said in a statement to Bloomberg.  Flumenbaum did not return CoinDesk’s requests for comment.  Though Bankman-Fried has not been accused of any crime at press time, his conduct is being investigated by the Justice Department, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and others.  A filing signed by John Ray III, the new CEO of FTX, suggested Bankman-Fried had at best engaged in poor practices in running FTX’s financials, saying he did not trust the consolidated asset and liability claims FTX had prepared under the former CEO and calling him “potentially compromised.”  Bankman-Fried has said a number of things publicly, prompting Ray to say in the bankruptcy filing that the former CEO is not currently employed by FTX and has no role representing the company.

Like physical gold ETFs that hold actual gold, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holds actual Bitcoin. Unlike physical gold ETFs that trade close to net asset value, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades like a closed-end fund that can trade at significant discounts and premiums. Currently, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades at a roughly 40% discount to its net asset value or value of its underlying Bitcoin. The FTX collapse has led to forced and panic selling of Bitcoin, which could turn out to be a unique opportunity to add Bitcoin to a global diversified portfolio. In the past week there has been forced and panic selling of Bitcoin due to the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX (FTT-USD) crypto exchange. This might be a unique opportunity to buy Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin-tied assets. The Greyscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ), which owns Bitcoin as its underlying asset, recently traded at 42% discount to the net asset value. While closed-end funds and trusts often trade at small discounts to their net asset or liquidation value, it is extremely rare that any fund trades at a 42% discount. For certain investors, who believe Bitcoin has a future in the financial world, and with a high risk tolerance, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a buy due to its discount to the current price of Bitcoin. Background On My View Of Crypto I think this section is important given the hype, bad information and general lack of understanding around cryptocurrencies. Please bear with me. I first learned of Bitcoin in 2012. I first bought Bitcoin in 2016. I have traded it three times, all profitably, selling most of my Bitcoin in 2017, 2019 and 2021. I have been accumulating a new Bitcoin position since early summer 2022. Bitcoin currently makes up an equivalent of about 5-10% of my bank savings (depending how much savings I spend in a given period). It has long been my advice that people with excess bank savings should explore Bitcoin holdings as part of a diversified currency approach. Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD) combined make up about 4% of my net worth. I have not been a crypto cheerleader though. The disclaimer in many of my articles on crypto has been this: The short story is that most cryptocurrencies are going to zero, but there will be survivors that rise to much higher price ranges. We expect Bitcoin and Ethereum to be among the biggest, if not the biggest. The world of Blockchain is far bigger than crypto though and we expect some big winners there too. This is a journey of separating winners from losers. I have been covering crypto currency, in particular Bitcoin and Ethereum, for members of my investment letter Margin of Safety Investing since I started the service. This includes numerous investment webinars. Part of a my discussion with Meb Faber in early 2021 included caution about volatility, but belief Bitcoin would have a future in the financial world. In January 2022, I interviewed crypto and accounting expert, Dr. Sean Stein Smith, and in that conversation said this about crypto : (27:52) ""...for somebody who's worried that well I missed it, it's too late to get into Bitcoin or Ether, I would still tell them buy the dips. I'd be looking for big dips 30, 40, 50 percent dips because I think that's the kind of volatility Bitcoin is in for... (28:51) I'll probably buy some Bitcoin if it really gets down into the 20s again, you know the 20,000 area, I think that 20 to 30,000 range is like a pretty hard floor. I know a lot of technical guys are saying 37,000 I don't know I just wait for the momentum to be done going down and then I pick up the knife off the ground, um, yeah I might miss the first move up... (57:11) ""I think the main answer is Ethereum and Bitcoin and maybe a couple of competitors to Ethereum, are gonna do well. You know I am on record of saying that 99% of cryptos are going to zero..."" I would consider myself a Bitcoin ""mediumist."" That is, I think it will have a role in the financial world, which I'll cover in closing, but that we will never buy our pizza with it. That made me hungry, so let's dig into... The Mechanics Of GBTC’s Discount The Greyscale Bitcoin Trust is not an ETF (it wants to be), thus it does not trade based on the value of its underlying value of its holdings like an ETF would. Rather, its trust structure causes it to trade like a closed-end fund, subject to the price that investors are willing to pay for it. In addition, for the unfamiliar, you cannot take Bitcoin out of GBTC by being an owner of GBTC units. It is not a brokerage like Coinbase (COIN). So, while the value of the Bitcoin in the trust was worth 42% more than the trust’s trading price on the exchange the other day, that’s what investors were willing to pay, so that’s what the price was. A simple supply and demand equation. When GBTC was only Bitcoin game in town, market demand outstripped supply, shares of GBTC was trading at a premium or for more than the underlying bitcoin it represents. This was the case for much of 2015 to 2019. When supply outstripped demand (roughly around the time Bitcoin ETFs became available), shares of GBTC flipped to trading at a discount. Closed-end fund firm Nuveen explains that closed-end funds trade at discounts frequently, especially during volatile times. If that’s the case, why wouldn’t you buy a closed-end fund or trust trading at a discount? That’s actually a good question with a legitimate answer. The Reasons GBTC Trades At A Discount A CEF or trust might trade at a discount because people anticipate there is a high risk that the underlying assets could trade lower in value. In essence, this is the market partially anticipating a price decline in the underlying assets, in this case Bitcoin. So, why did demand fall for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in the first place? Probably a combination of competition from ETFs, fear of falling Bitcoin prices and limited liquidity for the fund – both internally to dispose of assets and externally of having a large market to sell GBTC into should there be a volatility driven deeper dive in price. A few days ago, crypto lender BlockFi said it unwound its entire position in GBTC and would not take shares as collateral, before walking back the statement hours later. Why would it do that? Well, if it needs liquidity, it wants an asset that is highly liquid and has at least some semblance of stable value. Blockfi is also a firm that suddenly announced layoffs and might be heading to bankruptcy due to its ties to FTX which filed bankruptcy last week. FTX apparently overleveraged its balance sheet and backed that leverage with its own coin which had very little real value it turns out. Now, Blockfi suddenly has a liquidity crisis. So, you have to consider if the falling price of Bitcoin recently is part of a capitulation event caused from Sam Bankman -Fried and FTX’s Bankruptcy. This event has actually mimicked the Fed’s tightening policy by sapping crypto liquidity. With Bitcoin falling from a high of around $69,000 to slightly under $16,000 in about the past year, it’s understandable that people are scared of a further decline in Bitcoin prices. Add a lower liquidity threshold for GBTC and it trades at a deep discount. And, as mentioned, there is a lot of fully liquid Bitcoin ETFs available now – 18 by my count. All are currently futures based products, which is interesting to me when considering how crummy futures based commodity ETFs have treated investors over the years. Will GBTC Close The Discount Gap? That depends on what you think of Bitcoin, the structure of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and, prepare to have your noodle twisted, what the future structure of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust might be. We’re not going to argue about the future of Bitcoin today, but, suffice to say, if you don’t think Bitcoin has a future in the world of finance, well, then you probably won’t want to buy any GBTC at any price. That’s easy. If you do think Bitcoin has a future in the world of finance, then you should consider GBTC in your basket of crypto investments. For if Bitcoin has a future, and it’s more optimistic than current pricing, then the pessimism and concerns that drove GBTC demand down, should reverse to at least some extent. We know GBTC is not cheap with an expense ratio of 2% on top of trading expenses. That works against it versus ETFs and direct Bitcoin ownership. And, as covered in Axios , “Grayscale may have misstepped and overissued shares to the market.” Simply put, there could be too much supply of GBTC units. I don’t find this particularly compelling if you think Bitcoin indeed has a role in global finance. This is where it gets very interesting. Grayscale is trying to change the structure of the trust to be a Bitcoin physical, aka, spot, ETF. This is akin to the Sprott Physical Gold ETF ( PHYS ) and other physical commodity ETFs. So far, the SEC has said no, then softened, then hardened again on allowing Bitcoin spot ETFs that hold actual Bitcoin. What you think about the future of Bitcoin spot ETFs plays a direct role in whether or not GBTC might be a good investment for you. A Bitcoin spot ETF approval would allow Grayscale to convert its trust into an ETF, closing the gap between price and the underlying bitcoin. That is because of the unique ETF share creation and redemption mechanism using authorized purchasers. The result is that ETFs tend to only impact the price of underlying assets during especially high volume. If GBTC is allowed to become an ETF, then its price should close the discount gap rather quickly via the standard ETF share creation and redemption process. Will GBTC Become An ETF? So, that begs the question whether GBTC will become a Bitcoin spot ETF. Nobody knows the answer yet. But, if I were to wager, I would say it is likely it will. According to Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale: “Because the SEC has disapproved the application to convert GBTC to an ETF, the next point of escalation is to go through the judicial branch.” And that’s exactly what is happening. Grayscale is suing the SEC to allow it to convert its trust to a Bitcoin spot ETF. Grayscale vs SEC (Grayscale) At this point in the process, Grayscale's amicus briefs have been filed and the SEC is about 3 weeks away from having to file their briefs. Here is the timeline of the legal process as we know it now: Grayscale vs SEC timeline (Grayscale) Go here t o get Grayscale’s case updates . If Grayscale wins its case, then the futures based ETFs would now face a formidable competitor. I suspect the SEC is protecting the futures firms or trying to control volatility. But, if trying to control volatility is its aim, clearly the past year speaks loudly against its approach. At this point, it seems as though a court decision could occur. I think it is more likely there is a settlement with the SEC that allows GBTC to become a Bitcoin spot ETF. Why? I think that Grayscale has convincingly argued that the SEC rejection of the Bitcoin spot ETF was arbitrary. You can read what Grayscale's suits said here. The claim includes that the order to reject an ETF was “arbitrary, capricious, creates unfair discrimination between . . . issuers…” I think that is likely true. But, I think the SEC knows that. So, if they know that, why did they do it? Could it have simply been a way for the SEC to buy time to figure out how to actually regulate their corner of the crypto world, which will surely be shared with other alphabet soup agencies, such as the CTFC and FTC? Could they have been waiting for an event that got Congress involved? I could be wrong, but if physical spot gold ETFs exist, and Bitcoin is legal, then spot Bitcoin ETFs have to be allowed to exist. The trick is how to regulate that market then. Bitcoin's Role In The World I happen to believe that Bitcoin has a future in global finance, even though I don’t think it will be a common medium of exchange (one of the three functions of money). Here are my simplified core reasons: U.S. frenemies and enemies, and maybe even the U.S., would both like to see a counter balance to the dollar’s dominance in international trade. Bitcoin can provide this in a similar way that many have described gold’s role as a provider of currency diversification and stabilization to the international trade system. Bitcoin satisfies one of the definitions of money in that it is a “store of value” due to its scarcity and that it cannot be printed like fiat currencies. If gold is a “store of value” because it is scarce and people hold it, despite gold being heavy, then why can’t Bitcoin be a store of value given it is scarce and people hold it while it is light as light? The super wealthy see Bitcoin as being akin to a golden passport. That is, because Bitcoin can be transferred quickly and securely (when done right), it acts as the ultimate way to buy freedom under many circumstances. Do not underestimate the desire of people to protect themselves even if they are good. Institutions and family offices now own 5% or more of Bitcoin and that is growing fast. If I believe in anything, it is “follow the big money.” Under those assumptions, which you might disagree with, which means my entire thesis could be wrong, I think Bitcoin rises substantially in value from here. I will cover my back of the napkin price ranges in another article, but the range starts at $100,000 per Bitcoin and rises from there depending on how much institutional interest, wealth allocation and retail FOMO there eventually is. A Large Potential Risk For Grayscale The firm Genesis Global Capital is a big lender to crypto hedge funds and is facing a restructuring due to $175 million exposure to FTX. Genesis halted withdrawals from its yield product and stopped all new lending on Wednesday. Per NYT : ""Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group , one of the biggest players in the crypto industry. Founded by Barry Silbert in 2015, D.C.G. is a crypto conglomerate that owns dozens of companies, including the news site CoinDesk and the asset manager Grayscale Investments, which runs the world’s largest crypto fund."" CoinDesk just posted this article: Grayscale Business As Usual (CoinDesk ) It would seem there could be a conflict of interest there. In these moments, that is important to be aware of and scared of. In normal circumstances, I would find it unlikely that a Grayscale does not have adequate safeguards from contagion from problems at a portfolio company of their parent. The risk here is that FTX brings down Genesis and that brings down the entirety of Digital Currency Group. There is a vacuum of information at the moment and that means very high risk. Here's Who Should Buy GBTC If you believe that Bitcoin has a role in the financial world, that Grayscale is not at some sort of contagion risk from FTX and if GBTC becomes an ETF, the discount to NAV will close fast. In fact, I think it will start to close fast on any signs of negotiations between the SEC and Grayscale. I believe both things are true (again, if you disagree, then walk away). I would categorize myself as a Bitcoin ""mediumist"" not a ""maximialist."" The Bitcoin m aximalists believe Bitcoin is going to take over the financial universe, wiping out government backed fiat currencies, while bringing world peace, feeding the hungry, giving us all 80 year retirements, powering our cars and be able to fight off an alien invasion right after it deflects a killer asteroid. Or something like that. I just think Bitcoin gains enough interest as an alternative asset, for the reasons listed above, to be around forever, or at least longer than I'm alive (and hopefully living to a ripe old age) and that the price will go higher from here. So, for the opportunistic Bitcoin believer, with an aggressive risk tolerance, who wants some Bitcoin exposure in an IRA, who thinks GBTC will become an ETF eventually, it’s time to start buying a tiny amount of GBTC. I think you can hold a very small single digit percentage in IRAs for the large potential upside. Non-qualified holdings should be directly in Bitcoin. Stop. Period. Non-qualified holdings should be directly in Bitcoin. Buying GBTC, should be in addition to owning some actual Bitcoin for the equivalent of a single digit percentage of your bank savings. Owning Bitcoin directly, and having it in cold storage, is the best way to take advantage of a price dislocation, as well as, the best way to avoid counterparty and contagion risk. On the FTX collapse and resulting fallout, I also think there are some Bitcoin, crypto and blockchain stocks worth owning. Think transparent, profitable and low leverage, aka, not FTX type companies.

42388623,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRPEy9,1668725303,Market Wrap: Crypto Respond Sideways to FTX and related crises,"Investors and other interested crypto parties had a landscape of industry devastation to survey on Thursday – FTX related and otherwise.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  In the immediate foreground was CoinDesk scoopmeister Ian Allison’s report that Binance was preparing a bid for bankrupt lending platform Voyager Digital, citing a person familiar with the plans.  A previous auction, which was completed around the end of last September, saw the now defunct FTX emerging as the “white knight,” winning out against rivals Wave Financial and Binance. At the time, CoinDesk had also reported that Binance's bid for the U.S.-based Voyager had been shut out due to national security concerns.  The story dovetails with Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s comments that his exchange, the world’s largest by trading volume, is setting up an industry recovery fund to help rebuild the industry. Voyager’s VGX token was recently up more than 48% on the news.  Looming in the background, was the widening fallout from FTX’s liquidity crisis stemming from an earlier Allison report about the misappropriation of its FTT token and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  Brutal assessment. On Thursday, FTX’s Interim CEO John Ray, who has witnessed more than his share of corporate incompetence overseeing the bankruptcies of energy company Enron and other major companies, offered this take: ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said in a court document filed on Thursday.""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""  Other News  Crypto markets responded to the latest events with their recent sangfroid, with bitcoin and other major cryptos trading sideways, some tokens a bit to the green and others slightly in the red. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently up about 1% and hovering comfortably over its $16,000 support of the past nine days. Ether was recently changing hands above its most recent about $1,200 support, off a couple of smidgens of a percentage point. XRP was recently up nearly 3% but the popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were down slightly.  Meanwhile, Binance and OKX suspended support for the Solana blockchain versions of the two largest stablecoins – Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT – the exchanges announced separately in blog posts on Thursday. While Binance said it temporarily suspended deposits of USDC and USDT on Solana until further notice, OKX went further saying it was delisting the tokens effective Thursday at 3:00 UTC. Binance subsequently resumed deposits for USDT on Solana, the exchange said in a new blog post. Later, OKX updated its announcement with a slightly changed wording, saying that it halted support for the two tokens instead of delisting them.  Equity markets also remained largely oblivious to crypto’s growing crisis with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all falling a few fractions of a percentage point. Stocks and cryptos correlation on Thursday offered a veering from recent weeks when the two asset classes showed increasing independence from one another.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Market Analysis  Crypto Risk Management Remains Paramount in Coming Weeks  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Funding rates have turned positive for bitcoin in an early, albeit hopeful sign that market sentiment is shifting positive. A positive funding rate reflects increased demand for long positions, indicating improved investor sentiment.  However, this trend should be viewed in the context of eight prior days of negative funding, and bears watching, as the sharp decline on Nov. 9 may represent an overshoot to the downside.  The foundation for a potential short squeeze will have been laid, if this plays out.  Read the full technical take here.  Altcoin Roundup  Voyager token surged after a report that Binance will offer a lifeline to the bankrupt crypto lender.Voyager Digital's native coin, voyager (VGX), jumped 55% at one point in the trading day after CoinDesk reported that Binance's U.S. arm is relaunching a bid to purchase the bankrupt crypto lending platform. Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July, citing more than 100,000 creditors and as much as $10 billion in assets and liabilities.  Binance and OKX raised confusion. The exchanges suspended support for USDC, USDT on Solana, then backpedaled. Binance subsequently resumed deposits for Tether's USDT on Solana, while OKX reworded an original statement saying it delisted the tokens.  Ether staking yields jumped to 25%. That's an all-time high since the merge. Just staking ether (ETH) on Lido is paying out 10% annualized, while a more elaborate move bumps yield to as much as 25%.

The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market has yet to make a major move. Still, there have been some great price movements by these top 4 altcoins lately despite the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market could be headed.

The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. A standout performer in these times has been TWT as the price rallied with over 100% gains in less than 48hours as the price broke out with strong bullish sentiment above $1, rallying to a high of $2.7 before facing rejection to a region of $3. The price of TWT trades at $2.1, holding up well above the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages as the price eyes further movement to the upside. If the price maintains its structure and bullish movement, we could see the price rallying to $3. Price Analysis Of Litecoin (LTC) On The Daily (1D) Chart LTC’s price has recently outperformed BTC after showing a bullish trend despite the market’s uncertainty due to the FTX fiasco. Despite facing rejection to a region of $50, the price of LTC bounced off from this area as the price rallied to reclaim the 50 EMA acting as strong support for the price of LTC. If the price of LTC holds above $60, we could see the price rally to a high of $65-$70 in no time. Price Analysis Of GMX On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of GMX was rejected from its resistance of $48 and is currently trading at $39. GMX has maintained its bullish structure despite the rejection and market turmoil that has affected most crypto projects. The price of GMX needs to hold above the region of $35 to avoid the price going lower. Top 4 Altcoins- Price Analysis Of Chiliz (CHZ) On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of CHZ has continued to show bullish trends holding well above the 50 EMA. Despite the pullback across crypto assets in the market, CHZ has continued to look strong, respecting the bullish trendline. The price of CHZ broke the resistance at $0.236, a close above this region could send the price to a region of $0.3.

""New revelations continue to shed light on what now appears to be an appalling case of greed and deception,"" the letter read. “The public is owed a complete and transparent accounting of the business practices and financial activities leading up to and following FTX’s collapse and the loss of billions of dollars of customer funds.” The Senators also said they want to understand FTX's thinking behind acquiring insolvent crypto lender Voyager Digital ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ), as well as details on the former's relationship with its sister company Alameda Research, and the status of the $1.7B of customer funds that apparently went missing. “Billions of dollars-worth of investor funds seem to have disappeared into the ether ( ETH-USD ),” the letter said.

The latest wave of turmoil in digital-asset markets shaved some $183 billion from the industry market cap. The figure dropped to $736 billion on Nov. 9, the lowest since January 2021.

I am certain that I am not alone in my ignorance–which explains why once-exclusive artists like Jeff Koons and Takashi Murakami have emerged from the mist to flog their art in Web3 form, allowing anyone with the funds to trade fine digital art on platforms like OpenSea or Rarible.  For a period in 2021, it looked like the mission to reach those wet behind the ears with NFTs had worked – at least for the artists, and for a while. Digital-native Beeple collected $69 million from one sale in early 2021, but Murakami missed the mania and launched his collection shortly before the market crashed this spring. “I am very sorry,” he tweeted after the prices of his flower NFTs wilted.  Still, other fine artists have found fresh hope in the space, believing that NFTs could help them reach new audiences. Collaborative art studio Random International worked with Danil Krivoruchko on a collection of generative NFT origami shapes on OG.Art. The artists told me that the market helps them meet collectors who would “not have the bandwidth to acquire a large-scale immersive work from us” but still want to support them.  Indeed, they say that NFTs change the relationship they have with their audience, opening up new forms of art. Things change when the audience actually owns the artworks, no longer forced to loaf around galleries filled with art owned by other people. “Web3 feels much more like a space that becomes part of the fabric of the artwork itself rather than being a market in the traditional sense,” they say.  While they can’t quite retire on the proceeds of their origami collection – their project has a floor price of just 0.3 ETH, or $1,542, as of this writing – the prospect of reaching larger audiences with accessible new work is enough reason to mint NFTs, they say. The market is, of course, “both terrifying and invigorating.”  The bet to enter Web3 has certainly paid off for Chinese artist Huang Yuxing, who in late October sold his NFT collection, Meta-morphic, for over 1,300 ETH (about $2 million) on NFT platform LiveArt. That far surpasses the princely figures he raked in for his physical art; his painting Enlightening sold for $1.1 million at a Christie’s auction in July 2020.  The Beijing-born artist finds NFTs “more fluid and flexible than traditional art.” He hasn’t found that the buyers he sells to have changed – yet – but found more opportunities to communicate with Web3’s inhabitants. Yuxing held two AMAs before his pre-sale, attracting several thousand listeners, and spoke to potential buyers on social media or in private messages to build his brand.  After all, “no art exists only for the sake of the art itself,” he says, and how a community uses the art can confer even more meaning. “But whether it is classical painting or the current NFT form of work, only the form has changed between them, the core of the art has not changed,” he said.  Riffing off his gemstone-themed NFT project, Yuxing said: “Everyone has their own gemstones in mind, and everyone can find their own value and their own gemstones in their lives. The different understanding of the gemstone is the user's ‘use’ of the art.” What metaphors could sprout from the next chapters of his NFT project – bubbles and pine trees – is anyone’s guess.  One cannot help but question whether Yuxing’s decision to wade into NFTs is a form of shameless money-grabbing – ramping up the financialization of his own industry. So I asked him. “It is a fact that art has financial properties, but there is no answer to whether art will be hyper-financialized,” he responded enigmatically.  And even if it does, Yuxing doesn’t think profit margins ruin art. In the process of hyper-financialization, he says, art should hopefully “simultaneously stimulate the audience's thoughts and emotions about human intelligence, desire, existence, time, about our own relationship with the universe, about eternity.”  Yuxing, who has clearly bucked the market’s downfall, considers the NFT industry like the Internet of the early 1990s – a huge bubble that, once popped, leaves a sticky residue of useful technology. “The term ‘money grabbers’ gives the real creators a chill,” he says. “A real artist's traditional business is more stable and more profitable per unit of time.”  Plus, some NFT artists have enjoyed the practicality of selling through Web3 platforms, freed from the shackles of the traditional art system. Loie Hollowell, an American artist who mints NFTs about her experiences of giving birth (which she has undergone twice, as of last year), appreciates easy-to-track royalty payments – something that’s harder to trace in the traditional market.  What’s more, she says smart contracts make it easy to ringfence some of the proceeds for charitable organizations. A quarter of the proceeds from her project, “Contractions”, which launches in late October on Art Blocks, goes to charities that support reproductive care, including abortion. At the same time, NFTs help make her work more accessible, allowing her to sell at a price “where a more diverse group of collectors can have access.”  But while Web3 technologies may have made it easier for fine artists to sell to a wider audience, it is less certain whether that audience remains interested in NFTs. The number of traders on OpenSea has increased from about 20,000 to 1.8 million in the past two years, but monthly trading volume has cratered from peaks of $4.85 billion in January 2022 to $348 million nine months later, according to one Dune Analytics dashboard.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/17/nfts-web3-fine-art,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bde889cb3bd7ad70a489c23e3e9fd03465116c7-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As an analyst, it would be improper, and even irresponsible to suggest that this marks anything remotely close to a bottom.  The starting point for investment decisions should center on risk management…and then risk management again. Institutional investors’ actions embody this strategy as many have remained on the sidelines during recent weeks' turmoil.  The looming uncertainty that other crypto entities will soon be in distress, only adds to the motivation to wait. As some groups must liquidate BTC and ETH, the cost basis for both will only improve.  What is arguably the worst event in crypto market history, the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX, may become a building block for crypto firms to succeed in the future, a sizable chorus is saying.  But that event remains far off. In the interim, data will remain paramount as crypto markets wade through FTX contagion. Some data will reinforce trends but other information may counter them.  The positive funding rate reflects increased demand for long positions, indicating improved investor sentiment.  However, this trend should be viewed in the context of eight prior days of negative funding, and bears watching, as the sharp decline on Nov. 9 may represent an overshoot to the downside.  The foundation for a potential short squeeze will have been laid, if this plays out.  Yet funding rates for ETH remain negative. This is worth watching, given BTC and ETH’s strong correlation. BTC and ETH prices generally move in tandem, so any distinction between the two is noteworthy.  The three-month rolling basis for BTC has moved into positive territory, a potential bullish sign. Three-month basis highlights the yield that can be earned by buying an asset in the spot market, and selling it in the futures market. Still, the 0.307% spread leaves little to be desired.  The three-month basis being previously negative implies bearish sentiment and may continue, which should be concerning for investors. . There’s certainly no guarantee that this will not continue. The primary message is the directional change.  Basis for ETH has also moved into positive territory, with a healthier 5.4% spread between spot and futures markets.  A look at options open interest by strike price shows increased put buying at the $16,000 strike price and lower. For ETH a spike in put option buying is building at the $1,100 strike price. As a put option represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset, the activity at lower strike prices is to be understood.

42388602,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRPDgd,1668716160,Bitcoin Holds Steady Over $16K Amid Widening FTX Fallout,"Bitcoin was trading sideways Thursday, despite a growing rush of companies admitting exposure to embattled crypto exchange FTX and its sibling company, Alameda Research.  On Wednesday, the lending arm of Genesis Global Capital joined the list of firms caught in FTX fallout as it halted customer withdrawals. In a call with customers, Genesis Interim CEO Derar Islim connected the firm’s decision to FTX’s collapse.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at around $16,600, little changed over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hovered over its latest $16,000 support for a ninth consecutive day. BTC dropped below its previous $19,000 support as the first threads of Sam Bankman Fried’s FTX empire began unraveling.(Genesis owner Digital Currency Group (DCG) is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Thursday email that markets have already “priced in” the latest news.  “It might take another downfall of a major crypto company or a de-risking movement on Wall Street to take bitcoin below its recent low,” he wrote.  Last week’s slower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation date for October also “partially softened the fall” in the BTC market, Serhii Zhdanov, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange EXMO told CoinDesk, although a quick recovery of the market is “not foreseen for the nearest future.”  The CoinDesk Market Index recently dropped 0.6%. Ether (ETH) was down 0.3% to $1,210 at the time of publication.  Liquidity crisis  FTX-Alameda’s fallout has spurred a larger drop in crypto liquidity over the past week than in any previous market drawdown, according to a report by crypto data firm Kaiko. Many market makers must operate with “delta-neutral strategies,” according to Eliézer Ndinga, director of research at crypto investment products firm 21.co.  “They have to go long on specific products but also possibly go short to make sure that they can hedge against a specific downside,” Ndinga told CoinDesk in an interview.  Genesis’ had $8.4 billion in loan originations and $2.8 million in total active loans at the end of the third quarter, according to its website.  “This is bigger than many people think,” Ndinga said, adding:“I think the best-case scenario for players like Genesis would be to find fresh capital or more of the highest bidders to help the company to operate better.”  “We're going to hear more about the effects on these players in the space,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/17/bitcoin-holds-steady-over-16k-amid-widening-ftx-fallout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ccbe33cc0bfdff74622b8c60d1605ebb9a78f6e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42388615,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRPEW5,1668716052,"FTX Ventures Was a Disorganized Mess With Missing Financials, Bankruptcy Documents Say","Crypto exchange FTX established a $2 billion venture capital fund early this year, instantly becoming one of the crypto industry’s largest funds. The capital was said to fully come from the now-collapsed FTX and then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. New bankruptcy documents claim to show, however, that the inner workings of FTX Ventures, like much of the company, were an organizational nightmare.  FTX Ventures participated in funding rounds for some of the largest names in crypto, including Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, USDC stablecoin issuer Circle and two different fundraises for the Aptos blockchain. The collapse of FTX following liquidity concerns, which led the firm to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, raised questions about those investments.  The FTX umbrella covered over 100 smaller legal entities, which complicates any story about the internal organization. According to paperwork filed on Thursday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, FTX Ventures, the operations that both invested in companies and accepted investments, spread its funds across Clifton Bay Investments LLC, FTX Ventures Ltd, Island Bay Ventures Inc and, “potentially, affiliated companies.”  Of those groups, Clifton Bay Investments and FTX Ventures were the only entities that prepared quarterly financial statements. And financial statements for Island Bay Ventures haven’t even been located, according to new FTX CEO John Ray.  The Sept. 30 balance sheets showed $1.52 billion in assets for Clifton Bay and $493 million for FTX Ventures with the majority, unsurprisingly, falling under the “investments” heading. FTX Ventures had $492 million in total liabilities.  Clifton Bay had $1.5 billion in liabilities, the majority coming from a category called “related party accounts payable” – or money owed to other FTX-owned entities. There were four balances: $1.4 billion and a separate $68.6 million with Alameda Research, $38.5 million with Alameda Ventures and $2.25 million with West Realm Shires Services, the legal name of FTX US.  The FTX legal team warns that even they aren’t confident that the financials are correct, noting that the balance sheets were unaudited and produced while Bankman-Fried was in charge.  Amy Wu, a former Lightspeed Ventures partner who headed FTX Ventures, announced her resignation last Friday.

42388600,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRPDbx,1668715904,"US Senators Warren, Durbin Probe FTX Collapse","After the spectacular implosion of FTX last week, questions about what brought the once-mighty exchange to its knees are swirling – and lawmakers want answers.  Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) sent a letter on Wednesday to both the Bahamas-based exchange’s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and its current CEO, former Enron clean-up man John Jay Ray III, who replaced Bankman-Fried after FTX and its 130-odd subsidiaries declared bankruptcy on November 11, asking for more information about what precipitated the exchange’s collapse.  Warren and Durbin, both longtime, outspoken crypto skeptics, said the collapse of FTX – which, until recently, had a $32 billion valuation and was largely perceived as one of the most stable exchanges in the industry – “justify our long-standing concerns that the crypto industry ‘is built to favor scammers’ and ‘designed to reward insiders and to defraud mom-and-pop investors’.”  Bankman-Fried's father, Stanford law professor Joseph Bankman, helped Warren draft legislation for her Tax Simplification Act in 2016, and was previously a donor to her campaign.  Their letter kicks off an investigation into the collapse of FTX and the behavior of Bankman-Fried and his close-knit circle of fellow executives, who have been accused of self-dealing and fraud – behavior the Senators say “appears to be an appalling case of greed and deception.”  Warren and Durbin’s letter establishes a timeline for FTX’s collapse, beginning with CoinDesk’s report on Nov. 2 that Bankman-Fried’s quant trading firm Alameda Research’s holdings were largely comprised of FTT, FTX’s native token – a revelation that sparked a liquidity crisis as investors lost confidence and began withdrawing funds from the exchange.  Despite Bankman-Fried’s initial assurance to investors that their assets were fully backed on Nov. 7, the exchange halted withdrawals the next day, and Bankman-Fried’s promises were revealed to be baseless. On Nov. 8, rival exchange Binance indicated its interest in a potential bail out, but pulled out of the deal the next day, claiming FTX’s issues were “beyond our control or ability to help.”  After the Binance acquisition fell through, FTX’s remaining fall from grace was swift and chaotic.  “One thing is clear: the public is owed a complete and transparent accounting of the business practices and financial activities leading up to and following FTX’s collapse and the loss of billions of dollars of customer funds,” the Senators wrote in their letter.  By Nov. 28, Ray and Bankman-Fried are required to provide Warren and Durbin with information and documents about FTX and its subsidiaries’ balance sheets, the cause of the exchange’s liquidity crisis, its rationale for buying bankrupt crypto exchange Voyager Digital, and whether reports that Bankman-Fried and other executives built a “backdoor” into FTX’s accounting system to allow them to alter financial records and move money around without alerting other people are accurate.  The current and former FTX CEOs are also required to provide historical data about FTX’s transfers to Alameda Research, the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research, and what happened to the missing customer funds.  Warren and Durbin’s letter also demands answers – and internal communications – about the late-night hack on Nov. 11, which saw hundreds of millions of dollars drained from FTX-controlled wallets.

Recall on November 6 when CZ tweeted that Binance would offload the rest of its holdings in FTX token ( FTT-USD ), the coin issued by FTX, ""due to recent revelations"" likely referring to a CoinDesk story that raised questions about the financial health of Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, as well as the overlap between FTX and its sister company Alameda. To put it bluntly, that Twitter post led to FTX's rapid downfall as traders rushed to withdraw their funds en masse after discovering its $8B balance sheet shortfall, resulting in SBF's crypto empire filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ""I may have happened to be the last thing that poked it,” he said, adding ""to be honest, even if I didn’t make that tweet, this whole thing could still happen."" When asked about whether FTX's meltdown could've been prevented if regulations were put in place, the Chinese-Canadian billionaire argued, “I wouldn't say prevent a hundred percent, but it could have reduced the chance of that happening."" The FTX collapse has sent shockwaves through the crypto ecosystem and is negatively impacting some high-profile players in the space already, with a long and growing list of firms disclosing exposures to the once-mighty exchange. Crypto brokerage Genesis, for example, was forced to pause customer withdrawals earlier this week given ""abnormal"" outflows that exceeded its liquidity. And BlockFi, which has close ties to Alameda, is preparing to file for bankruptcy. Overall, the demise of FTX ""will hurt our business and the industry in multiple ways, CZ said. Regulators all around the world will be scrutinizing us very heavily going forward, and getting new licenses around the world is going to become much harder. Short term negative, long term, I actually think many of them are actually going to be positive.""

Binance Halts Operations With Solana, Is This Blockchain In Danger? Binance, OKX, Bybit, and other top crypto exchanges took a similar measure. The platforms suspended operations with stablecoins USDC and USDT on Solana but failed to explain their decision to the users. For example, Binance posted the following message via its social networks and its official website: Fellow Binancians, Deposits of USDC (SOL) and USDT (SOL) have been temporarily suspended until further notice. Thanks for your support! The crypto trading venue didn’t specify when they will resume stablecoin operations with Solana. OKX took a stricter measure by fully delisting the digital assets. Similar to Binance, the exchange kept its reasoning in the dark. Across social media, users have been speculating about the reasons for this decision by crypto exchanges. Some believe the delisting is motivated by the collapse of FTX and its former CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The former FTX executive was a well-known Solana bull. The collapse of FTX might create unforeseen consequences across crypto companies, projects, and crypto ecosystems. The market believes recent events could negatively impact SOL. Bankman-Fried and other FTX investors were thought to have accumulated millions of dollars in SOL. The company is in the middle of its bankruptcy process. Therefore, there are expectations that the Bankruptcy court might order the liquidation of any funds in Solana or other cryptocurrencies in this proceedings.

Many crypto assets have followed a correlation with the decline of FTX Token, FTT. As a result, the past few days brought an intense bearish pull on the prices of virtual assets. With the recent events’ outplay, the crypto market’s overall performance shows doubts and fear. As a result, investors and other participants have initiated a panic sell-off for most crypto assets. Hence, the cumulative market cap has been experiencing a free fall since last week. The overall market cap sits at $824.19 billion at the press time, showing a drop of 1.92% over the past day. Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Records Higher Gains During Market Uncertainty Also, the bearing trend triggered by the FTX crisis has brought the global primary cryptocurrency down. Bitcoin has maintained a low correlation in the crypto market, creating more tension for its long-term holders. BTC Price Drop Creates Selling Pressure From the recent reports, BTC long-term holders are facing intense selling pressure due to the declining market situation. The price of Bitcoin has been falling since last week with no restrictions. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $16,666 indicating an increase over the past 24 hours and its dominance over altcoins is 38.49%. A report from Glassnode, an on-chain data provider, highlighted the MVRV ratio of Bitcoin’s long-term holders. The firm noted that BTC long-term holders are currently facing acute financial stress. They are holding an average of -33% in unrealized losses. According to the firm, such a value is close to the lows of the 2018 bear market, where the peak unrealized loss was – 36% on average. The data provider noted that the last time BTC long-term holders had a similar stress experience was at the token’s price reversal point. This means that Bitcoin’s bottom could be around the corner. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Yet To Get Worst? However, Peter Shiff, a BTC critic, thinks the worst Bitcoin selling pressure is yet to come. Sharing his older prediction from June 2022, Shiff stated that selling pressure on Bitcoin for bill payments would only worsen once the recession deepens. Also, that could happen if several holders lose their jobs, primarily workers in blockchain firms that would become bankrupt. So unfavorable changes for such holders will lead to more Bitcoin sell-off. Following the collapse of FTX, many Bitcoin investors have transferred their holdings from exchanges. They now refer to using self-custody for their holdings. This has created massive historic withdrawals from crypto exchanges.

4380622,https://newsbtc.com/?p=508960,1668711647,"Bitcoin Reserve On Binance Sharply Rises, Whales Preparing For More Dumping?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin reserve on Binance has been sharply going up in the last couple of days, something that could be a sign of dumping. Bitcoin Reserve On The Crypto Exchange Binance Has Observed Sharp Growth In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the funding rates have been negative while these inflows have been made. The “exchange reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently stored in the wallets of a centralized exchange (which, in this case, is Binance). When the value of this metric goes up, it means investors are depositing their coins to the exchange right now. As investors could be depositing to such a platform for selling purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish impacts on the price of the crypto. On the other hand, decreasing value of the reserve suggests coins are exiting the exchange currently. Such a trend, when sustained, can be a sign of accumulation from investors, and could thus be bullish for the BTC value.

Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange reserve for the crypto exchange Binance during the past month: The value of the metric seems to have been riding an upwards momentum in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Binance Bitcoin exchange reserve started to rapidly fall down around ten days ago as the crash started. This happened because the collapse of FTX made investors more wary of crypto exchanges than ever before, and so they were withdrawing coins off centralized platforms in hordes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sports Betting: All You Need to Know After seeing a final sharp plunge a little less than a week ago, the indicator started moving sideways. In the past couple of days, however, this trend has changed. The Binance Bitcoin exchange reserves are now climbing back up quickly, suggesting that investors have been depositing large amounts. This could be a sign of activity from whales, and would imply that these humongous holders may be preparing to dump. The quant has also talked about another indicator’s trend, the “Funding Rate,” which tells us whether the futures market is leaning towards shorts or longs right now. The below chart displays the trend in this metric. Looks like the metric has a red value currently | Source: CryptoQuant The funding rates are highly negative at the moment, implying the majority of the contracts are shorts. Based on this the analyst thinks a short squeeze could possibly take place, which would propel the price in the short term. However, the quant also believes that’s when the whales would potentially make their move, and dump the crypto.

ETH’s price continues to show strength after a bearish downtrend with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. ETH’s price bounces from a low of $1,100 on the daily timeframes as the price aims for a recovery toward the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) In the last two days, the crypto market has seen some drastic shift in sentiment, with Ethereum (ETH) and the price of other altcoins battling for survival after the news that Binance would not be taking over FTX after conducting due diligence. Previous weeks saw the price of Ethereum (ETH) perform well, rallying from a low of $1,300 to a high of $1,680. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Records Higher Gains During Market Uncertainty Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The news of Binance rescuing the situation by taking over FTX led to so much tension as the crypto space remains unsettled, leading to most altcoins suffering in price, including the price of ETH. The price of ETH saw its price decline to a weekly low of $1,100 before bouncing off this region, showing some great strength to a region of $1,300 as the price aims to break higher. The price of ETH needs to rally to a region of $1,450, acting as a demand zone to remain safe from sell-off. Weekly resistance for the price of ETH – $1,500. Weekly support for the price of ETH – $1,100. Price Analysis Of ETH On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ETH remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $1,200 support after bouncing off from the region of $1,100, which saw ETH losing its demand zone to the bears. If the price of ETH breaks above $1,500, we could see more rallies for ETH price; a break below a region of $1,100 would lead to more sell-offs for ETH. Daily resistance for the ETH price – $1,500. Daily support for the ETH price – $1,100.

BlockFi was said to have turned down Nexo's offer and moved forward to be bailed out by FTX US, which filed for Chapter 11 last week. FTX US's offer was worth some $680M but the deal never went through . Note that BlockFi suffered deep losses during the summer given its exposure to bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. The Nexo deal included $30M for the acquisition of 51% of BlockFi, $30M for BlockFi's existing stakeholders upon successful S1 registration of its yield product with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a $500M credit line to handle the company's liquidity issue, according to an investment proposal document viewed by Seeking Alpha. It was ""a better alternative to the FTX proposal,"" Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev told The Block, ""but BlockFi's management chose to go with FTX."" In addition, Nexo had a five-year call option on the remaining 49% of BLockFi's equity at a 10x value of the proposal. The troubled lender's downfall has accelerated since the summer given its deep ties to Alameda Research, a trading firm that was part of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire that recently fell apart. In fact, ""Alameda was BlockFi's largest debtor,"" Trenchev added. BlockFi was then forced to pause customer withdrawals last week and more recently eyed bankruptcy protection .

The regulator, Johnson said, was “monitoring and overseeing on a daily, if not hourly basis, verifying what we believe to be the case, which is [that] every dollar of customer assets held at LedgerX continues to be available.”  Johnson made her remarks at a crypto regulation conference in London.  LedgerX was a ""point of interaction"" between the CFTC and FTX US. Before it was acquired by FTX last year, it applied to become a registered derivatives clearinghouse with the CFTC in 2017.  Johnson said that the CFTC had required LedgerX to maintain segregated funds separately, submit to monthly, quarterly and annual examinations, and demonstrate the veracity of assets held in accounts on behalf of customers with balance sheets and verified bank statements.  It also required reserves to be held by FTX, including a liquidity reserve for one year and for operating capital not to be touched, pledged or reinvested or in any way threatened, she said.  Her comments echoed those of CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam, who told a futures conference earlier this week that he credited LedgerX’s escape from bankruptcy to his agency’s oversight.  In FTX’s bankruptcy filing on Friday, LedgerX was one of the companies excluded from the filing, Johnson stressed (although the filing did include FTX US Derivatives, alongside several other companies that aren’t even tied to FTX).  She said that even with no legislation, CFTC always has a “number of options” to provide oversight to preserve market integrity.  Still, Johnson said that the CFTC needs direct authority from Congress to engage market participants and require them to come into the regulatory framework of U.S. markets.  She said the CFTC doesn't have the authority at the present time to force market participants to come under its regulatory purview, which would make them subject to surveillance, oversight and policing.  She characterized the relationship between regulators in the U.S. as like “coming to Thanksgiving dinner.”  “There are some folks you might not necessarily seat side beside,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/17/cftc-has-boots-on-the-ground-at-ftx-subsidiary-ledgerx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d2f5b07607053ce71b17b3a2682aea8b29f46e5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to analysts, recent events are promoting a narrative that is strongly associated with decentralization. Following the FTX news, leading hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor and Ledger reported skyrocketing and record-breaking sales. This was also accompanied by the trend of massive amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH (ETH) being withdrawn from exchanges. As Glassnode reported, Bitcoin investors have withdrawn a historic 106,000 BTC/month to self-custody following the collapse of FTX. This only compares to only three other times: April 2020, November 2020, and June-July 2022. Following the collapse of FTX, #Bitcoin investors have been withdrawing coins to self-custody at a historic rate of 106k $BTC/month. This compares with only three other times:– Apr 2020– Nov 2020– June-July 2022https://t.co/92aYVYU4Yt pic.twitter.com/em7CsDBWUf — glassnode (@glassnode) November 13, 2022 Which Altcoins May Benefit From FTX Collapse? The altcoin market is often dominated by narratives or special trends. For example, in recent months and years, “Ethereum killers” and layer 2 solutions for Ethereum have been strong trends that have given investors above-average profits. According to Eight, the new trend for the next few months could be decentralization. The downfall of FTX promotes a narrative strongly connected to decentralization. Do you know which projects can benefit from this narrative ? 🧵 pic.twitter.com/wQ4zVsh5EO — Eight (@eight_global) November 17, 2022 In that sense, Eight’s first pick is GMX, a decentralized spot and perpetual exchange that supports low swap fees and trading without price impact. As the analysts note, the advantage of decentralized exchanges is that traders do not have to deposit their coins on an exchange and are therefore not exposed to the security risks of a centralized exchange. The GMX token is ranked 87th among all cryptocurrencies and has recorded a strong price increase of about 20% over the last seven days. Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Records Higher Gains During Market Uncertainty In a similar vein is the second recommendation, DYDX. The platform is also a decentralized exchange platform for cryptocurrency margin trading for assets such as BTC, ETH, SOL, DOT and more. The DYDX token currently ranks 144th by market cap and is even posting a gain of about 30% over the past seven days. With UNI, Eight lists another decentralized exchange token that it is far from being an insider’s tip anymore. The decentralized exchange made headlines in recent days as the daily trading volume of the ETH/USD pair on Uniswap was 500 million higher than on Coinbase. Uniswap came in 2nd behind Binance. Related Reading: FTX New CEO John Ray Reveals More Scandals In Court Filing Another interesting decentralized exchange is PancakeSwap, which is based on the BNB chain and aims to provide a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum. CAKE currently ranks 66th, but unlike the others, it has recorded a slight loss over the last seven days. What Else? Lastly, Eight recommends not only decentralized exchanges, but also decentralized wallets. Specifically, we are talking about the Trust Wallet and the SafePal app. The former acts as an intermediary, connecting different blockchains through the use of its nodes. It has a robust mechanism for sending, receiving and storing multiple cryptocurrencies, and currently supports over a thousand crypto coins. The TWT token was trading at $1.15 a week ago and has skyrocketed over the past week. At press time, TWT was trading at $2.14. In conclusion, the analysts said: These are just some of the projects that represent alternatives to trading and custody services offered by centralized exchanges and witnessed increased rate of attention and user adoption after the bankruptcy of FTX. Therefore, we suggest that you add them on your watchlist!",POSITIVE,UNI,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/all/consultancy-uncovers-best-altcoins-to-profit-from-ftx-collapse/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/4374263.jpeg

Even now, more than a week after the initial bankruptcy, SOL continues to buckle under the weight of uncertainty left among its users and investors given Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) heavy involvement in the Solana blockchain. Will SOL continue to suffer or is there a reprieve on the horizon for this digital asset? Solana’s Relationship With FTX Even now, the reason for Solana’s success is largely tied to its FTX/Alameda relationship. There is no telling if the blockchain would still have found the same level of success otherwise but the investments of these companies played a major role in the accelerated growth and adoption. And now, the blockchain looks to be paying the price for it. Related Reading: Bearish Signal: Bitcoin Miners Dump 7,700 BTC In One Week FTX, although now bankrupt, still owns millions worth of SOL after purchasing 50.5 million tokens from the Solana Foundation. It is being released to FTX/Alameda through gradual unlocks that will happen through 2028 but it is this relationship that is hurting Solana right now. Every single token associated with FTX and Alameda Research has already tanked in the last week, bringing SOL’s price down toward two-year lows. Uncertainties around whether FTX and Alameda would hold the tokens once they’re unlocked or sell immediately also mount sell pressure on the token as each unlock draws closer. Can SOL Bounce Back From This? SOL is already down more than 94% on a year-over-year basis and the FTX collapse has not helped matters. The bank run on the exchange saw investors panic sell tokens such as FTT and SOL in large amounts in a bid to avoid any unforeseen losses. SOL price falls to $13 | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com At $13 per token, SOL is now trading firmly below its 50-day moving average. This is an important technical level for any digital asset in the space if they are to begin another upward rally for the short term. Unless SOL sees a pump that puts it above this level, more decline is likely to follow. Even with the Solana Foundation assuring users in the space that the blockchain still has about 30 months of runway left with over $100 million in cash, faith in the blockchain still remains low. The Solana Fear & Greed Index shows a score of 25, which puts investor sentiment in the Fear territory.

Bitcoin was already in a bear market looking for a bottom when the FTX bankruptcy came along and accelerated the move down. If the technical analysis is useful in calling the market, it is certainly more useful in calling Bitcoin price moves. At least with stocks, you can hang your hat on fundamentals, but with the market and Bitcoin, you better use technicals. To evaluate the market and Bitcoin, you have to know how to measure Demand and Supply, because fundamentals are not the primary driver of Demand and Supply. Since Bitcoin, so far, has no value other than transferring funds like Western Union, it may be priced accordingly. However, because of Demand and Supply it is overvalued. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is easy to buy, but is it easy to sell? It is imploding because of Supply. It exploded to an enormous price of $69,000 simply because publicity inflated Demand well beyond the Supply, as most small speculators treated it as a “buy and hold” investment for the long term. Other than exaggerated Demand driving price higher in an illiquid market, Bitcoin had no value except as a wire service like Western Union ( WU ). Such services have a very low valuation compared to Bitcoin. It was a craze speculation and now that the bubble has burst, price is dropping as fast as it went up. It is now recognized as a highly speculative, risk on asset. The bear market and coming recession create a risk off environment. Risky assets fall. Purely speculative investments become worthless. Bankruptcy of firms involved in Bitcoin shake the market. If all the investors want their money back, it creates a run on the Bitcoin “banks.” We are used to being protected by a run on any bank in the U.S. because the government steps in and stops the run on the bank and covers all deposits. Bitcoin does not have that protection. I can still see a famous, TV, talking head, Jim screaming at the camera that he could not liquidate his Bitcoin position and get his money back. This is a professional caught in the squeeze. The poor, small investors have no such recourse to get their money back. Now we know that some pension funds are going to take a Bitcoin hit as well as some professional speculators and investors. Will Bitcoin ever see $69,000 again? Only if publicity can create more Demand than Supply for years to come. That seems unlikely with crypto firms going bankrupt. Yes, there is a limited Suppy of Bitcoins. Yes, if you are smart enough to create a narrative that will get all buyers to “buy and hold” and suck in more new buyers because the price is soaring, then there is no limit to how high price will go before the profit taking starts. Yes, if the Reddit network of traders decided to corner the Bitcoin market, price could rise rapidly. This is the old game of penny stocks and tulip bulbs. Bitcoin is just a new form of such old time speculations in the market. Its biggest advantage in the scheme is limited Supply. As you can see the time to be in Bitcoin was when everyone was buy and hold and everyone wanted to get a piece of the action as price soared to $69,000. Could it happen again? Anything is possible. Could it happen now? Not with bankruptcy news, investors screaming like the talking TV heads losing money and the regulators swooping in after the horse is out of the barn. Where is the bottom and can you make money during big bounces in a bear market? The good news is yes, you can make money in big bounces during a bear market. Just look at the current bounce in the stock market ( SPY ). The bad news is that Bitcoin is still diving, looking for support and the next bear market bounce. Here is our monthly chart showing the winners taking price up to its peak and now the losers left holding the bag. The winners were the smart traders on Wall St. who ran it up. The losers are the poor, small investors who used their retirement funds because they thought it was going to $400,000. When Elon said you could no longer buy a Tesla with Bitcoin, you knew the game was over. When the talking head on TV screamed that he could not get his money, you knew a bankruptcy was coming. Notice the bounces in the Bitcoin bear market. We think that Bitcoin is targeting a test of support at $14,000. If traders corner the market or Tesla accepts Bitcoin to buy a car, or any other positive narrative, Bitcoin will get bear market bounces. We don’t think that will happen just now. Here is the monthly chart showing the rise and fall of Bitcoin and note the Supply signals. Except for Chaikin Money Flow, they have not improved yet.

However, the fan-themed token also witnessed a sizeable decrease in trading volume over the past 24 hours. Approximately $571,090,877 worth of CHZ has exchanged hands in the last day, representing a 38% decrease. The token might see more trades soon as the official opening match of the world cup is just four days away. Related Reading: Cosmos (ATOM) Trades Below $13 As Bulls Give Up; Here Are Levels Bulls Will Buy CHZ To Bail Out Stranded Holders on FTX Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO of Chiliz, said on Twitter that the company would set aside 38 million CHZ to assist affected FTX users. According to the tweet, the company will compensate each victim with $10,000. The company’s head added that the 38 million CHZ bailout fund would go to FTX subscribers who couldn’t withdraw after the exchange’s collapse. However, he mentioned that only FTX users who owned CHZ on the exchange would receive the $10,000 payout. According to the tweets, the 38 million CHZ indicates the on-chain amount FTX exchange held in its wallet up to the previous week. The company’s latest initiative “will be just for private users and not for institutions,” Chiliz added. However, “full legal assessment and clearance from the liquidator to send us the list of users” must first be obtained. On November 12, hackers stole more than $400 million from the already troubled FTX exchange. This occurred shortly after the exchange had filed for bankruptcy, only hours before. Sadly, Dreyfus claims that the attack resulted in the loss of 37 million CHZ. The Bulls Fueling A Convincing CHZ Rally – Can They Succeed? After establishing long-term support in the $0.15 area, the bulls were able to stage a convincing rally. This recovery brought in a huge 25.5% ROI in just six days. Meanwhile, in the four-hour time frame, CHZ broke out of a bullish flag. CHZ climbed back up over the $0.22 resistance after the pattern break. In addition, both the 20 EMA (red) and the 50 EMA (cyan) were going north and trying to finish above the 200 EMA (green). The possibility of a bullish crossover may bolster optimistic short-term outlooks. The sellers may be able to keep the buyers in check if CHZ’s price breaks the $0.24 resistance level. The first major support for a bearish reversal, whether it happens right away or in the future, is between $0.20 and $0.21. A sustained move over $0.24 would signal buyers are committed to pushing prices higher. Under these conditions, the first significant barrier is around $0.27 and $0.29.

Bitcoin prices have already dropped by 75% since their previous all-time high, but more might be in store. Comparison to previous corrections suggest that the slump could get worse before it gets better, and could last for a long time. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been stuck in a crypto winter since some time now, which the picture above this article very fittingly illustrates. While worldwide markets seemed to recover during the last couple of weeks, there seems to be no let-up for cryptocurrencies with a never-ending stream of bad news for Bitcoin and crypto investors. Of course, most notably the sudden bankruptcy of FTX (FTT-USD) which has the potential to negatively affect Bitcoin in the near future, and might even trigger a larger crisis . Parallels between past events and today This is not a wholly unprecedented situation. Bitcoin has had its problems in the past, for instance in 2014. Most Bitcoin investors will have likely heard about Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox was a large currency exchange which, at one point, handled about 70% of Bitcoin transactions worldwide. This exchange already experienced some problems with hacks and leaks in the years leading up to 2014, but in February 2014 the firm went bankrupt due to a bug in their software leading to stolen Bitcoin. A company as large as this, handling 70% of worldwide transactions in 2014 might have been an even larger negative event for Bitcoin than the recent FTX downfall. The Mt. Gox events triggered or at least strongly exacerbated the slump in Bitcoin price which happened between 2013 and 2015. Let us take a look at what happened between 2013 and 2015, and how it compares to the current situation. Data by YCharts Graph 1: Bitcoin price development over the last couple of years (logarithmic) (Source: YCharts) Since YCharts data does not go back this far, you can find a graph which goes back until 2013 here . Also, in another less pretty chart which you can find here , you can find the all-time price development of Bitcoin on a log scale since 2010 (this is very useful since the other charts do not go back this far). As we can see in all the graphs, the current drawdown looks bad but still not as bad as it was in 2013-2015. Now let us put numbers on these corrections and see what happened in the past compared to today. Past corrections In a previous article I wrote about Bitcoin, I created a table of major Bitcoin crashes and drawdowns. Since this table gives a nice overview of price development, I will paste it here again: Previous crashes Previous high Low % correction Time until low Time until new high Summer of 2011 (Mt. Gox security breach) $21.1 $2.2 -89.6% ~5.5 months ~2.5 year Middle 2013 $164 $70 -57.3% ~3 months ~7 months Late 2013 (Banking ban and Mt. Gox bankruptcy) $1242 $170 -86.3% ~1 year and 7 months ~3 years and 1 month End of 2017 $18,319 $3,302 -82.0% ~1 year ~3 years Early 2020 (Covid) $10,332 $5,182 -49.8% ~1 month ~6 months Table 1: major Bitcoin crashes (created by author). Please note that I took the daily average prices for the highs and lows. Let us take a look at these price developments. In 2013-2015, prices went from a high of $1242 in 2013 to a low of $170 in January 2015. This was a decrease of more than 86%. The first correction in this table, which was triggered by a Mt. Gox security breach, was more severe percentage-wise, but prices were still at a very low level compared to now, so I am ignoring this one in my analysis. As we can clearly see from the table, for the more serious corrections (2013-2015 and late 2017) it took more than a year for Bitcoin prices to reach their low and more than 3 years to reach a new all-time high. Currently, Bitcoin has fallen from its high of $68,789 in November 2021 to the current price of $16,750. This is a drop of 75% already. If we expect that the situation of today is comparable to the situation in 2013-2015 and the drop will be equal in terms of percentage, Bitcoin has room to drop to slightly below $10,000. Compared with the correction which started in 2017, Bitcoin would have to drop to about $12,500 to equal these losses percentage-wise. Parallels and differences There are many parallels between the situation for Bitcoin in 2014 and now: A major exchange went down ( Mt. Gox then and FTX now) People have been talking about systemic risk for the crypto markets because of these problems, but today with the addition that this risk might spill over to the 'regular' financial markets Price development has been abysmal There are also s ome signals however that current situation is very different from the situation in 2013-2015. The Mt. Gox disaster was around the beginning of the price slump in 2013-2015, the FTX bankruptcy happened while Bitcoin price is already down considerably from its all-time high. The Mt. Gox disaster was arguably much more severe, since this exchange handled about 70% of worldwide Bitcoin transactions during its heyday. In 2013-2015, the world was still recovering from a major financial crisis which at the time heavily undermined the trust of people in financial institutions. In hindsight, this might have been a major factor which propelled cryptocurrency to popularity. Interest rates and inflation are both up considerably since 2015. Let us take a look at the last point I mentioned. How do interest rates and inflation influence the price of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general? Data by YCharts Graph 2: Inflation rate developments in some major economies (source: YCharts) Let us look at inflation rates first. In the graph above, inflation rates in some of the world's most important economies are depicted (U.S., China, Germany, Japan, UK). As we can see, there are large discrepancies here: ""western"" inflation (U.S., Germany and UK) has picked up dramatically while ""Asian"" (China and Japan) has remained quite stable. Why this is the case is out of scope for this article, but a couple of causes likely include the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and the Z ero COVID policy in China. But on aggregate, global inflation rate has picked up since 2021, and is certainly at a higher level than it was in 2013-2015 when the previous large crypto winter happened. Theoretically , Bitcoin acts as an inflation hedge. I put the world theoretically in italics, since until now, there is not adequate data to confirm this. But let us think about the forces at work between crypto markets and currency markets when there exists a world in which fiat currency gets inflated (and central banks increase interest rates): Bitcoin has very limited inflation since the number of Bitcoin in existence has been determined mathematically and is growing slowly. Actually, there might even be deflation since some Bitcoin gets lost. If there exists fiat currency which is experiencing inflation, the price of Bitcoin should go up in the long term versus this fiat currency. But in the current situation, since almost every person needs fiat currency as well, investors experience a decrease in liquidity by this inflation which likely has spilled over into crypto markets. Interest rates also play a role here: if interest rates for fiat currency are lower than inflation (which is the case right now), this could make crypto investing more interesting. If interest rates are higher than inflation, which might become reality in the future, fiat currency bonds would be more interesting for investors than crypto. In the short term, spillovers from fiat currency inflation are likely to have had a negative effect on crypto markets, but on the longer term, if inflation stays high for a longer period of time (and central banks remain behind the curve ), this could have a positive effect on crypto price development. Time scale and conclusion Perhaps even more important than how far Bitcoin's price will fall is how long the crypto winter will last. But a straight answer to this question cannot be given. If we compare the current situation to the situation of 2013-2015, where it took one year and 7 months for Bitcoin to find a low and more than three years to reach a new high, it would not be extraordinary to expect that Bitcoin could reach a new low around mid 2023, and go back to its previous high not before the end of 2024. That is, if situations are comparable and history repeats itself. And that is, if Bitcoin ever gets back to its previous all-time high, which some people doubt . Of course, history does not repeat itself but it often rhymes , and the situation in 2013-2015 is not completely comparable to the current situation. Things which are quite different now are inflation, interest rates, the geopolitical situation and the fact that we are not recovering from a financial crisis at this moment. As I argued in this article, inflation could have a short-term negative effect on cryptocurrency but a long-term positive effect. When compared with previous corrections, Bitcoin price could easily go below $10,000 and it could last until the end of 2024 before we see new all-time highs, if we ever. But I still see potential for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the financial system of the future, and although crypto markets can be particularly brutal, prices have the potential to experience major recovery in the mid to long term. An interesting catalyst could be the change of Bitcoin from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, if it ever happens. Also, please note that I almost exclusively looked at Bitcoin in this article, but most other cryptocurrencies are affected by the factors at work here. In fact, other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are getting more important compared with Bitcoin as you can see on the Bitcoin dominance chart here . Last but not least, please keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency has large risks, so do not use leverage and do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Thank you for reading!

42421423,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDD3,1668702359,They Burned Down Crypto. Now They Want a Comeback,"On Wednesday, Vox published a bombshell interview with former crypto exchange FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, where the 30-year-old crypto trader all but revealed he had, in fact, co-mingled customer funds with those of his hedge fund, Alameda Research. This would be a problem on its own, as it violated FTX’s terms-of-service as well as likely falls afoul of wires or securities laws.  Bankman-Fried’s crime, which “wasn’t quite lending [customer deposits] out” but something “messier,” “more organic” and “reasonable” than that, was compounded after a run on his exchange left up to one million FTX users without access to their funds. Billions of dollars worth of crypto are missing – and the “messy accounting” at FTX and Alameda are still being sorted.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  He’s now attempting to raise $8 billion in financing to make customers whole. What that will look like is anybody’s guess, (Bankman-Fried did not respond to a request for comment). But the sum is far greater than the company, once valued at $32 billion and now going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, ever raised. SBF has also resigned as CEO.  That Bankman-Fried thinks he can mount a reversal of fortune shows a deep disconnect with reality. He’s lied repeatedly in public, to customers and to investors – his trust is burned, and he’s likely facing criminal charges. And while he thinks he was once “one of the world’s greatest fundraisers,” his success was built on a charm offensive and misdirection.  See also: How Sam Bankman-Fried's 'Effective' Altruism Blew Up FTX | Opinion  FTX counted a number of white glove funds as investors, including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures and Coinbase’s angle fund. Apparently no one did any due diligence – Sequoia even committed after finding out SBF was playing League of Legends during the meeting. That level of lax scrutiny won’t happen again.  Of course there are exceptions, Kevin O’Leary, the celebrity investor and paid FTX spokesperson, said he’d be willing to bet again on SBF. And that’s the scary thing: while Bankman-Fried is likely finished, he has peers that are attempting to do the same thing – recoup their reputations, possibly raise money and restart their “hero’s arc” – and just might.  Namely, Terra creator Do Kwon and Three Arrows Capital co-founders Su Zhu and Kylie Davies have recently been doing the media circuit, being tapped as experts to comment on Bankman-Fried’s rise and fall. Zhu and Davies, who nuked billions of dollars, are even reportedly on the market to raise a new crypto-investment fund.  All three are on the run from the law, have been accused of not cooperating with authorities and have ended up in non-extradition countries. The three have seemingly come up with a story that Bankman-Fried had popped the unsustainable LUNA bubble that eventually implicated Three Arrows.  But already there are indications that this attempt to make themselves the victim are thin. Zhu wrongfully called out former FTX employee turned whistleblower Zane Tackett for conspiring against 3AC, getting key details wrong. He also furthered conspiracies that the Democratic Party is conspiring with Bankman-Fried (who was a mega-donor) to evade justice.  See also: 'Down Infinite': A Ham-Fisted Attempt to Rehabilitate Do Kwon | Opinion  The disgraced Terra co-founder made a surprise appearance on the popular podcast Up Only last week, where Do joked how he was the wrong person to take “crisis management” advice from.  Do had appeared next to convicted felon Martin Shkreli, who noted Bankman-Fried and Do will likely go to jail, though not to worry much as it isn’t that bad. Shkreli, aka Pharma Bro, a name he earned after jacking up the price of a life-saving medicine, might be the template for reinvention, having emerged from prison a full-flung “crypto bro.”  It’d be one thing if Do, Davies, Zhu or Bankman-Fried had also served their time after being convicted. And, to be sure, they all deserve a fair trial.

42421419,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoD9x,1668702293,The Tax Implications of the FTX Bankruptcy,"The crypto world has been shaken by the biggest black swan event in its 13-year history. FTX has become insolvent and all funds on the exchange are frozen.  The FTX situation is no fun for anyone, especially if you had funds on the exchange. But there are some silver linings from a tax perspective. I’m a certified public accountant (CPA) and I’ve been in crypto since 2014, so unfortunately this isn’t the first time I have seen taxpayers lose (or potentially lose) some or all of their crypto holdings due to an exchange being shut down.  Laura Walter is a CPA and the founder of Crypto Tax Girl, a cryptocurrency tax firm. Joe Howe is a crypto tax specialist at Crypto Tax Girl. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  We still don’t know what will ultimately happen with FTX, but in the meantime, here’s my advice on how to make the most of this bad situation.  FTX filed bankruptcy, which means customers with assets on FTX could still get a portion of their funds back – or they could get nothing at all (as we saw with the long drawn-out cases of Mt. Goxand Cryptopia). So while in limbo, how and when should this potential “lost” money be reported on your tax return?  The best thing you can do at this moment is get any documentation you can from FTX about your account (CSV files of all transactions including withdrawals, deposits, trades and income, as well as screenshots of balances and account info). In light of the recent hack on FTX though, please proceed with caution when trying to get documentation.  See also: Tax and Compliance Challenges Enterprises Face in Crypto | Opinion  As of right now, all users’ funds are frozen and FTX has halted withdrawals, so FTX users are stuck. This unfortunately means that from a tax perspective, there is nothing you can do yet. Because there is still a chance that your funds will be recovered, you cannot deduct any losses, and you aren’t required to report any gains.  If, however, the funds don’t end up being recovered and the exchange gets shut down (as we’ve seen with Mt. Gox, QuadrigaCX, BTC-E, Cryptsy, Celsius and so many others), I would recommend classifying tokens lost on FTX as worthless investment losses, and taking a capital loss in the year that it is determined that the tokens are deemed worthless.  Per the Internal Revenue Service: “If you own securities, including stocks, and they become totally worthless, you have a capital loss…Worthless securities also include securities that you abandon. To abandon a security, you must permanently surrender and relinquish all rights in the security and receive no consideration in exchange for it.”  Though crypto is not considered a stock or security, it is also subject to capital gains and losses, which are reported on Form 8949, so this also applies here.  Read more: Why NFT Tax-Loss Harvesting Remains a Challenge for Investors | Opinion  Because users were holding funds on FTX with the intent to invest them, I take the position that if funds are not returned to users, they have a worthless investment. This means that users’ assets held on FTX can be treated as a sale for $0 on the last day of the year in which it becomes clear they will not be getting their funds back (i.e., the investment becomes worthless), and deduct the cost of the tokens lost as a capital loss on Form 8949.  It is important to note that you cannot take a capital loss for the current fair market value of the tokens. Rather, you would take a loss for the original cost basis of the tokens (i.e. what was paid for them or the value of the tokens when you acquired them).  It is also important for users to wait to take the worthless investment loss until they’re sure that they won’t ever recover their funds. This is because if they do end up recovering them in the future, they would need to include the value of the tokens at that time as income, which may end up being more costly.  As soon as we get more clarification on what the future holds for FTX, I will start advising clients to either treat their funds on FTX as worthless investments or as traditional capital gains or losses. For now, we'll all have to wait out the storm and cross our fingers that our FTX funds aren’t lost forever.

The coin lost its previous gains following the market downtrends. The fledgling coin BTC printed over a 5% decline in the last week and ETH decreased by around 8%. Similarly, the DOGE token was down over 8% on its week-on-week chart, losing 1.27% on the day. At $0.083, Dogecoin trades dangerously close to its week’s $0.083 floor. Any bearish move may pull it under, losing its substantial gain. Dogecoin, like the rest of the market, tumbled over after the FTX implosion earlier this week. As the top coins struggle to recover, Dogecoin has still managed to entice traders in recent days. Although trading volume has dropped by over 40% in the last day, there’s still hope for an upswing in the coming days.

Doge Founder Speaks Against SBF’s FTX Comeback On Wednesday, Sam Bankman-Fried turned to Twitter to announce his plans to “raise liquidity, make consumers whole, and relaunch.” SBF’s announcement followed the exchange’s filing for bankruptcy under ‘Chapter 11’ on Friday, November 11th. But Billy Markus, known on Twitter as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, was having none of it. The Doge founder insisted that SBF should not be given a second opportunity, given the part he played in the FTX debacle. The former CEO of FTX says his businesses’ monthly asset accumulations exceeded their liabilities. These claims come despite accusations that FTX hid a $10 billion black hole in its accounts. However, SBF made it quite clear that they were not transferable securities. In a series of tweets, SBF disclosed that FTX’s assets totaled $8 billion. Out of that number, $5.5 billion were classified as “semi-liquid,” and $3.5 billion were unmarketable. The cryptocurrency entrepreneur continued by stating that Alameda has a margin position on FTX International and FTX US. He added that the company had the resources necessary to compensate all consumers. However, the developer of Dogecoin is strongly opposed to this idea. According to him, “those who commit enormous massive fraud” shouldn’t be given “a second chance to perpetrate enormous massive fraud again.” Can Doge Reach $0.1? What The Charts Say In the wake of the market meltdown triggered by FTX’s collapse, the price of dogecoin fell by over 43%. But after hitting a low of $0.0790, the cryptocurrency has been rising. The memecoin is trading at $0.0850 right now and might use some help from the bulls to go back up to a solid position. According to the RSI, there hasn’t been much of an uptick in purchasing pressure. Therefore the cryptocurrency has been trading below its $0.0914 resistance level. DOGE may revisit the $0.0914 resistance level again if buying pressure picks up. At this point, it may break above or perhaps turn that level into support.

If it manages to break out of this range, it will be one step closer to completing an 18.5% surge and hitting $0.1000. The cryptocurrency market is still rather susceptible to corrections.

Bitcoin Has So Far Declined 24% Under The Realized Price As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, drawdowns below the realized price have been shrinking with each cycle. A popular capitalization model for Bitcoin is the “realized cap,” which measures the cap by weighting each coin in the circulating supply against the price at which it was last moved. This is different from the usual market cap, where every coin in circulation is simply multiplied with the latest BTC price. Now, from this realized cap, a “realized price” can be derived by dividing the metric with the total number of coins in circulation. The usefulness of this price is that it signifies the cost basis of the average holder in the Bitcoin market. This means that whenever the normal price dips under this indicator, the average investor enters into a state of loss. Here is a chart that shows the percentages below the realized price BTC has gone during each cycle: Looks like the value of the metric has plunged in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the latest crash in the price of Bitcoin has taken the crypto 24% below the realized price, the deepest value observed in the current cycle so far. It’s apparent from the chart that the previous bear market of 2018/19 saw an even larger drawdown, as the price had declined about 30% below the metric at the bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin 7-Day Volatility Comes Alive As FTX Collapse Shakes Market Comparing the two cycles in isolation would suggest the current bear market still needs to see a notable amount of decline before the same bottom values are hit. However, things change when the 2015 and 2012 bottoms are also taken into account. In 2012, Bitcoin went as low as 60% below the realized price, while in 2015 the decline was around 41%.

There seems to be a pattern here, and it’s that the percentage of fall below the indicator has been shrinking with each cycle. If this trend continues to hold this time as well, then Bitcoin may in fact already be near a bottom for this cycle. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16.5k, down 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 14% in value.

The revelation in a court filing, though scant on details, would indicate that Alameda held an advantage when making risky leveraged trades on FTX. Crypto derivatives exchanges such as FTX automatically sell the collateral of traders who borrowed its money to place bets that turned south.  John J. Ray III, the new CEO of FTX who characterized Alameda as a ""crypto hedge fund,"" cited “the secret exemption of Alameda from certain aspects of FTX.com’s auto-liquidation protocol” among a list of poor security and financial controls that have been uncovered since he took control of the company in the early hours of Nov. 11, shortly before it filed for bankruptcy in a U.S. court.  The blurred lines between Alameda and FTX, two supposedly separate businesses, has proved crucial in the collapse of the company. It was the revelation by CoinDesk that Alameda’s balance sheet was stuffed with FTX-issued tokens that led to questions about the company’s financial health, eventually snowballing into insolvency.  The allegations are part of a litany of poor management practices highlighted by Ray, previously responsible for sweeping up the mess left by Enron, who said FTX was the worst failure of internal controls and record-keeping he has seen in his 40-year career.  Ray also highlighted practices such as registering Bahamas real estate in employees’ names using company funds, and managers approving disbursements by posting emojis on an internal chat platform.

At Monday's inquiry, Binance was asked whether it knew its actions – which included saying it would unload much of its FTT holdings on the market and agreeing to acquire FTX before backing out of the deal – would lead to its rival's collapse.  Binance responded on Wednesday by denying it had a deliberate plan to sink FTX. In the document it sent to lawmakers, Binance included a timeline of events and suggested that the causes of the collapse were “the financial irregularities and possible fraud initially reported in the CoinDesk article"" on Nov. 2.  The government is figuring out how to regulate the industry and is set to announce a consultation to explore what's needed.

""This incident will set us back a bit, but then the industry will become healthier,"" Zhao, known in the crypto community as CZ, told CNBC. ""So it's actually better in the long run."" ""I think fundamentally, though, if we look at the industry 5 years, 10 years from now, the industry will be much, much bigger,"" the head of Binance ( BNB-USD ) added. Taking aim at FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who has come under fire for his management of the crypto exchange headed into its bankruptcy, Zhao referred to his former rival as a ""bad player,"" although he also acknowledged that the overall structure of the crypto market played a part in the recent meltdown. ""We shouldn't blame this problem on any single person, other than Sam, but everybody in the industry [does] share a bit of the responsibility,"" he said. The latest criticism of Bankman-Fried has come from his successor as FTX CEO. John Ray III, who has been tasked with steering the company through its bankruptcy, said in a court filing , ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here."" On the subject of regulation, Zhao contended that his firm has always ""embraced"" government rules for the crypto industry in the U.S. However, he suggested that additional oversight wouldn't necessarily have prevented the FTX crisis. ""I think regulations could minimize some of the problems, but when a person lies, when there's a bad player that just wants to do bad things, regulations [don't] prevent it,"" he said. The collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. In the wake of the news, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) plunged to a 52-week low below $15.55K. The crypto has recovered a bit lately, although it remains below $16.5K, down more than 70% over the past 12 months. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) dipped below $900 in the wake of the FTX meltdown, although it has rebounded to within sight of $1.2K lately. The crypto is down about 9% for the past month and lower by about 72% for the past year. Names like Cardano ( ADA-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) have also suffered in the wake of the FTX bankruptcy, adding to weakness seen throughout 2022. For more on the possible future of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Seeking Alpha contributor BOOX Research agrees with CZ's general position, saying that ""the collapse of FTX is ultimately bullish for Bitcoin ."" However, fellow SA contributor Paulo Santos takes a more bearish view, arguing that ""more regulation can't cure the problem.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3909218-binance-ceo-ftx-collapse-is-a-setback-but-crypto-is-actually-better-in-the-long-run?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4368512.jpeg

The financing was a combination of senior debt and equity capital and included some returning investors such as Kestrel 0x1 as well as new ones, including Shima Capital, the company said in a statement. The startup has also bought Hydrokraft AS, a renewable energy-based data center in Norway, without disclosing the terms of the deal.  ""The Hydrokraft purchase is part of an ambitious plan to create a vertically integrated green bitcoin mining platform that has power sovereignty, benefits from geographic diversification, and a robust balance sheet,"" according to the statement.  Hydrokraft's data centers are powered completely by hydro electricity and have an operating capacity of 30 megawatts (MW) which can be expanded to 60MW, Arkon said in the statement. The startup plans to immediately begin work to build out incremental infrastructure to utilize the facility’s full capacity.  The funding comes as the bitcoin mining industry has been in survival mode during the crypto bear market – dealing with not just falling prices, but also surging energy costs – leading to bankruptcies and a plunge in share prices for publicly traded companies. However, in recent months, mining companies that have access to low cost energy and more innovative business models are getting financed by investors.  Most recently, a new solar-powered bitcoin miner, Aspen Creek Digital Corp. (ACDC), raised $8 million in Series A funding and Vespene Energy, a company that converts methane gas released from landfills into power for bitcoin mining, closed a $4.3 million funding round.

42414874,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTyTX,1668697124,Hong Kong Regulator Calls for Tough Rules Despite Ambitions to Be Crypto Hub,"Crypto service providers are moving from the fringe to provide a full range of financial services, making a ""light touch"" regulatory approach “far from adequate,” a Hong Kong regulator said on Thursday.  Julia Leung, deputy CEO and executive director at Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said that the recent turmoil in crypto markets highlighted not only the volatility and structural vulnerabilities in the industry, but also how it is becoming more connected with traditional financial services.  Leung's comments during a speech at a crypto conference in London comes just as Hong Kong expressed a desire to open itself up to crypto – and possibly relax its tough regulations.  International cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy last Friday, was once based in Hong Kong, and sources told CoinDesk that the exchange still has staff in the city.  Leung noted that Hong Kong’s opt-in regulatory framework requires that client assets be separated from a firm's own assets. To address conflicts of interest, it prohibits virtual-asset platforms from trading on their own account and they can't lend or pledge client assets.  Centralized virtual-asset trading platforms operate in ways similar to stock exchanges and broker-dealers, Leung said, adding that the SFC will hold the platforms to similar standards that apply to stock exchanges and broker-dealers.  She noted that the SFC had announced its opt-in framework for centralized trading platforms in 2018 but that authorities could apply the full force of their legal power only to platforms willing to trade at least one security token.  Only two companies in Hong Kong, OSL and HashKey, are licensed under the opt-in regime. Most retail investors in the city use unlicensed platforms.  A bill now in Hong Kong’s Legislative Assembly would expand the existing regulatory regime to platforms that don't trade security tokens. If that bill is passed, all centralized platforms would need to be licensed by the SFC, whether or not they trade security tokens, although they would receive a grace period.  Leung said that given recognition of the growing investor demand for virtual assets, particularly among private banks and hedge fund customers, it was important for regulators to provide clarity to banks, brokers and fund managers.  “Many financial institutions are now exploring how to tokenize financial assets or develop their own tokens on private blockchains,” Leung said.  The SFC plans to issue a notice to clarify that tokenized debt securities as digital representations of traditional securities on the blockchain should be treated in a similar way as existing conventional securities, she said.  Leung also spoke about decentralized finance, saying that “most DeFi activities operate outside any regulatory system”.  According to Leung, some operators are intentionally elusive to minimize liability and regulatory scrutiny. She said that regulators worldwide have reached a consensus on a coordinated approach and that they would be “relentless” in pursuing DeFi regulation.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/17/hong-kong-regulator-calls-for-tough-rules-despite-crypto-hub-ambitions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/316864d0a6efc9f44a6077877f2fa4ea7fe5f434-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the fiery aftermath, some critics are blasting the very existence of centralized exchanges like Sam Bankman-Fried’s, saying they haven’t been reliable stewards for customers’ assets.  But the blowup has reinvigorated the discussion about a potential solution, something called ""proof of reserves,"" or PoR, a way of showing – with little or no doubt – exactly how many tokens are at any exchange that adopts the technique. If in place at FTX, proof of reserves could have in theory prevented customers’ money from being moved where it shouldn’t have been (to Bankman-Fried’s trading firm Alameda Research).  Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has already shared its wallet balances and says it plans to conduct a proof-of-reserves snapshot “in the next few weeks.” Other exchanges that have made similar commitments include Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit.

Stablecoin issuers like Paxos use it to prove they have sufficient assets backing their tokens, while exchanges like BitMEX use it to prove customer deposits correspond to assets in custody.  “It would have been a pretty solvable problem if there was more transparency on the balance sheet. We already power multiple stablecoins and multiple gold coins and multiple financial institutions, where we prove their balance sheets through proof of reserves,” Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk in an interview. Nazarov is the co-founder of oracle network Chainlink, which offers a proof-of-reserves product.  How does proof of reserves work?  There are several ways for an entity to prove its asset reserves, from traditional third-party audits by companies like Armanino to ""Merkle tree proofs"" (cryptographic verification via data structures called Merkle trees).  Read more: Proof of Reserves: Could It Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?  Then there are methods employed by blockchain analytics companies. Chainlink, for example, separates proof-of-reserves implementation into two categories: off-chain and on-chain.  The off-chain alternative involves a third-party provider like Chainlink receiving API (application programming interface) access from an exchange, its custodian or its auditor to independently verify the exchange’s holdings.        The on-chain route involves a proof-of-reserves smart contract on one network (usually Ethereum) that receives data feeds (on a block-by-block basis) from Chainlink’s oracle network about a provider’s on-chain wallet balances on another network (e.g., Bitcoin).        Either way, the result is users can verify a company is actually holding the assets it claims to be holding.  Industry experts weigh in  Eric Richmond is a corporate and securities lawyer turned crypto entrepreneur. He founded and ran Tetra Trust, Canada’s first licensed digital-asset custodian in 2019. He is now the chief operating officer at Coinsquare, one of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.  Read more: Canadian Digital Asset Brokerages Coinsquare and CoinSmart to Merge  Coinsquare is a registered investment dealer that reports to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), a self-regulated collection of more than 170 dealers similar to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) in the U.S. Richmond believes while proof of reserves is a step in the right direction, regulation might be a better solution.  “We have an obligation to run daily reports to view our client liabilities versus assets in cold storage,” Richmond explained. “Every single day, we ensure one-to-one in cold storage, which is a requirement of ours under IIROC registration.”  Cold storage means keeping assets offline, not connected to the internet.  Other experts like Nic Carter believe proof of reserves is “the industry’s last hope in terms of making a strong self-regulatory commitment.” Carter is a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, a firm that invests in crypto financial infrastructure.  “Lord knows we need to represent to regulators that we are capable of self-regulation, especially after FTX shattered confidence like this,” Carter told CoinDesk.  “PoR would inhibit situations like Quadriga, FTX or Gox. If any exchange now refuses to do one, I should expect that people will be extremely skeptical of them,"" he said.  In the 2019 collapse of QuadrigaCX, Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, it was later revealed its late founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had misappropriated and misused client funds, leaving only a fraction of value behind for its creditors to claim. In the 2014implosion of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, poor security practices and questionable fund activity resulted in a massive hack. Creditors are still fighting to regain some of those lost funds. The downfall of those platforms, like the collapse of FTX, forced the industry to consider significant improvements to fund and custody management.  Peter Eberle, president and chief investment officer of Castle Funds, a cryptocurrency-focused investment firm, echoed Carter’s comments.  ""I believe this will force exchanges to be more transparent. They will need to prove that they are not commingling funds and that they are not lending out customer assets. They will have to earn trust from customers that they actually have the assets that they say they do,” Eberle told CoinDesk. “Audited financial statements, proof of reserves, will be standard going forward. This is something that should always have been the case, but wasn't.""  Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, also agrees the industry needs more transparency. He says his organization has already started to provide attestations.  “This is a matter of self-regulation within the entire industry. In terms of our next steps, we'll look at our internal data, and then find out what kind of data can really reassure our users. And then we'll work with the third parties to disclose data as needed,” Lyu told CoinDesk in an interview. “So far, we've already disclosed information for the bigger and more influential tokens, including ethereum and BTC.”  Read more: Let’s Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, Okay?",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LINK | BNB,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/17/proof-of-reserves-emerges-as-a-favored-way-to-prevent-another-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd0d698de2227a1f02d0249248a86601037eb269-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The industry’s exciting new concepts and vernacular can leave one overwhelmed and confused. Then quickly comes the realization … this is all subject to tax?  Countless blog posts, journal articles and webinars have sought to address and resolve the crypto tax “gap” – from creating awareness around enacted and proposed legislation. There are also a number of technology solutions enabling data aggregation and organization aimed at making tax obligations simple.  Thomas Shea is the financial services crypto tax leader at Ernst & Young LLP. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  However, even the most comprehensive of guides cannot consider all of a taxpayer’s unique facts or adequately assess the risk associated with taking certain positions. Crypto is about empowering individuals, afterall.  The complexity of applying current tax rules to new concepts in crypto like mining, staking, lending, multi-wallet aggregation, Web3 gaming, NFT purchases and “yield farming,” can lead to significant errors or omissions.  At this critical juncture in the regulatory timeline, it feels like taxpayers are again faced with uncertainty related to their individual obligations. However, progress is being signaled from regulators and it’s in the best interest of all taxpayers to ensure they don’t get caught flat-footed.  See also: What Will It Look Like When Taxation and Privacy Collide? | Opinion  The current income tax guidance and infrastructure at present has induced a heavy reliance on self-reporting. That is to say, the burden for aggregating and compiling what is often publicly available transaction and asset-related information lies with the end-user.  While the U.S. Treasury has alluded that tax information reporting regulations will likely be released by the end of this year, most taxpayers will not be receiving a Form-1099 related to all their digital asset activity for 2022.  However, we’ve seen more attention and proposed legislation in the last 12 months than in any other period in the digital asset era. Further still is the evolved view in recent legislative proposals (including Treasury Green Book and Responsible Financial Innovation Act), that extends provisions historically reserved for commodities, securities or currencies to digital assets without necessarily classifying crypto as any of these existing asset classes.  This is an implied acknowledgment that digital assets are a separate and unique class – an understanding that is essential to the continued expansion and growth of this budding industry.  Still, as of today, the industry still has limited authoritative guidance. The reporting onus lies with taxpayers and the 2022 tax reporting season is rapidly approaching. On top of that, the IRS criminal investigation division announced that “hundreds” of crypto cases are coming.  Read more: Tax and Compliance Challenges Enterprises Face in Crypto | Opinion  So, what should you do? I am consistently asked by clients for advice on how to make use of the tools that exist and how to best undertake the necessary aggregation and tracking data. A variety of tax reporting platforms are available to taxpayers, and they are not all created equal.  Seeking a trusted tax advisor and solutions that align to your profile and activity can go a long way in this endeavor. It is critical to anticipate these significant responsibilities and act now. These steps may even include amending previously filed returns. Doing so can, and likely will, save you time and money and better protect you against unanticipated future tax obligations.

42414872,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTxxh,1668696009,"Bahamas May Have Directed 'Unauthorized' FTX Transactions, Filing Says","Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX is accusing the government of the Bahamas of directing unauthorized access to FTX's systems in order to withdraw assets after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., court filings from Thursday show.  The document, filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, didn't specify which transactions were unauthorized or how they occured.  The accusation was included in a document challenging a complaint filed in a New York court by the Bahamian liquidators tasked with overseeing FTX's assets. The liquidators, in their chapter 15 filing, which apply to bankruptcy cases that require cooperation between U.S. and foreign courts, had asked the U.S. court to turn over control of the proceedings to the Bahamas, where the crypto enterprise had its headquarters.  FTX's Thursday filing asked the court to order the transfer of the chapter 15 case from the New York court to Delaware in a bid to ""end the chaos"" surrounding the complex proceedings involving FTX's numerous entities seeking bankruptcy protection, so that all proceedings could ""take place in a single venue.""  Despite FTX's desire to end the chaos, its accusations against the Bahamian government stand to add fresh disorder to the proceedings.  The debtors “have credible evidence that the Bahamian government is responsible for directing unauthorized access to the debtors’ systems for the purpose of obtaining digital assets,” after legal proceedings began in the U.S. last Friday, the filing attributed to FTX Trading said.  ""It appears that the automatic stay has been flaunted, by a government actor no less,"" the filing added, referring to the bankruptcy norms that require a freezing of assets until they can be divided up to creditors.  The filing cites ""recorded and verified texts"" from former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and co-founder Gary Wang that were made in connection with an investigation into a hack that occurred over the weekend following the bankruptcy filing.

42411060,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVTv,1668695509,"Crypto Users Want to Pay Taxes, but We Need Clearer Rules","Something often said about the crypto community is that it’s full of libertarian tax cheats. The stereotype doesn’t come from nowhere – crypto does have its roots in crypto-anarchist ideology. And many of our favorite stories often involve “sovereign individuals” and “oppressive regimes,” even though those fables are distorted into antagonistic media narratives about the industry.  Today’s community looks vastly different than it did even a few years ago, let alone when cypherpunk coder Satoshi Nakamoto first invented Bitcoin. The contemporary crypto scene is diverse – full of financial, artistic, ideological and technical blockchain users – and frankly, only a minority are crusaders against taxation.  Richa Joshi is co-founder of Push Protocol. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  So why does this narrative persist? The answer is more nuanced than stubborn resistance.  There are people who dislike or are confused by contemporary tax rules around crypto – including regulations that make buying coffee with BTC a taxable event and airdrops a form of income.  Still, by and large, the crypto community does not want to evade or avoid taxes – they just want clear and commonsense rules. The vast majority of crypto users are citizens who wish to pay their dues to their communities, their cities and their government. (Crypto, afterall, is about collaboration – and nation states are pretty big communities.)  However, despite year-over-year efforts to clarify crypto tax filing, regulatory agencies have failed to keep pace with technical innovation in Web3. (This doesn’t include rules that make sense, like capital gains paid after buying a token for x and selling it for 2x, which has a direct analogue to traditional finance.)  Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Things get complicated when considering how crypto is meant to function, and how it differs from anything that came before. Take gas fees, or the price you pay to run computation on a blockchain like Ethereum, which could be treated as traditional portfolio management fees or possibly discounted from capital gains. Further, many DeFi mechanisms – like flash loans! – have limited or no equivalents in traditional finance.  This scale of differentiation between crypto financial mechanisms and traditional ones is felt primarily by individuals filing their taxes, who are burdened both with submitting their taxes without clear guidelines and with the potential downfall of getting them wrong.  Even well-meaning actors may end up feeling unsupported or scrutinized by regulators, and that tension results in the kinds of anti-tax conversations heard on Crypto Twitter. When people in crypto criticize taxes, they do so less out of ideological grandstanding and more out of simple frustration with a system that appears to ignore a technology that is growing in size, profitability and significance.  Read more: The Case for Taxing Proof-of-Work / Opinion  They’re commenting on the tension between filer and regulator, which emerges when authorities appear to ignore the nuances of the rules they’re writing or how that affects what you can do with a blockchain.  Take, for example, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s recent suggestion that unrealized gains should be taxed – any crypto trader who has experienced a bull market will recognize the consequences of being left with such a tax! Many people were rich on paper in 2021, and wiped out today, for instance.  Read more: How Web 3 Could Change Tax Collection  As Web3 grows and encroaches on nearly every industry in some way or another, the need for renewed crypto tax regulation will become clear. If this technology is broadly accepted, to the point where most don’t even recognize that they’re interacting with a blockchain, having less stringent rules will become necessary, not a preference, as we can’t have people incurring capital gains taxes without even knowing it.

The Input Output Global Research Hub is the collaborative effort of the University of Edinburgh and IOG to improve scientific understanding and set new standards for research within the blockchain and distributed ledger industry, according to a press release. The hub will have a broad remit, including helping foster development in Haskell, a mathematically pure computing language underpinning Cardano.  The launch builds on IOG’s existing relationship with the university, where it previously established a Blockchain Technology Lab within the School of Informatics. It also follows the funding and launch of the Blockchain Research Hub at Stanford University in August and the donation of $20 million by IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson to establish the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania.  “IOG has been working with the University of Edinburgh for some time, and I’m thrilled that this new research hub will let us continue to advance our industry,” Hoskinson said in a statement. “Working with leading institutions like Edinburgh to set up these blockchain research hubs is essential to our vision of making academic rigor an industry standard.”",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/17/cardano-blockchain-builder-iog-funds-45m-research-hub-at-edinburgh-university,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59f3337e71d9d0e794364f8a238303f42458bcf6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(COP27 is short for 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC. UNFCCC is short for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. COP27 runs Nov. 6-18 in Sharm el-Shiek, Egypt.)  The platform is built for the Ethereum ecosystem, and will aim to mitigate the excess energy consumption that the blockchain used before it went through the Merge in September.  “The idea is to gather a bunch of capital and invest the capital into technologies that can have a significant positive impact” Joseph Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys and a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain told CoinDesk. “I anticipate that this group will want to fund projects that are not old style, legacy technology projects but do think about how they build systems.""  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain  The Merge saw Ethereum swap out its old energy-intensive model from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS). Under PoW, Ethereum was powered by miners, which competed to solve cryptographic puzzles to add transactions to the digital ledger. Under PoS, Ethereum uses validators to approve and add blocks to the blockchain, which burns less energy. Since the Merge, Ethereum has reduced its energy consumption by 99.9%.  “The Merge set a new and extremely high bar for climate mitigation across the entire business and financial sector. It demonstrated that through sheer force of collective will, we can successfully drive technological decisions that massively reduce carbon output,” Lubin was quoted in a press release.  Mining has received backlash from regulators due to its environmental harm. The European Commission shared in October that it was prepared to shut down crypto mining in the event that Europe faces a dire energy crisis this winter. In addition, regulatory bodies such as the European Union have proposed to limit PoW in the EU. China banned Bitcoin mining in 2021.  Some PoW chains, like ZCash and Dogecoin, have shared that they are looking to switch to PoS because of energy concerns.

42421421,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDAz,1668692700,"Post-FTX Meltdown, Regulation-Abiding Companies Can Restore Trust","Only just a few weeks ago, it seemed like the crypto universe had found a new sense of calm and stability – leave it to Coindesk’s journalists to pop that illusory bubble in dramatic fashion.  We’re now around two weeks out from the report that took down FTX, strongly suggesting that its financial foundation was built on a shell game it played with sister-firm Alameda Research using its FTT Token. That news touched off a series of events that led to FTX’s bankruptcy at the end of last week.  This week, other companies are starting to fall, and it may take a long time for them to stop falling. As we have documented in recent years, Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX were among the most prolific investors in crypto companies on the planet. Beyond Bankman-Fried’s status as a “rescuer” of fallen crypto companies like Voyager Digital, he also was an active venture capital and private equity investor.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Consolidation coming  Now, all of those investments are coming unwound. Just this week, after news that the FTX rescue of Voyager has been rendered void, Genesis has stopped withdrawals. After halting withdrawals last week, crypto lender BlockFi appears to be preparing for bankruptcy. These firms are just the tip of the iceberg.  Rather than a period of relative stability, the tide is now going even further out in the crypto universe, and a much smaller cohort of firms are going to emerge unscathed.  What’s worse, with a full bankruptcy impacting such a large, complex firm, the fallout will stretch over a very long period of time, said Daniel Shamah, co-head of the bankruptcy litigation group at international law firm O’Melveny.  “Bankruptcy court is a fishbowl,” said Shamah. “Every decision FTX made in recent weeks will be highly scrutinized by a litany of players – committees, potentially an examiner or a trustee, other investors – with a range of tools at their disposal. Expect this to be a long, expensive process that will take years to play out.”  The process is likely to uncover more weakness in the crypto space and perhaps more dominos ready to fall.  Watch: FTX Contagion: Who Are the Winners and Losers in the Ecosystem?  Mud on a trusted face  Even worse is the loss of trust in FTX and Bankman-Fried, who were seen by some as reliable and stable entities, if not out-and-out saviors of the crypto space. FTX and its founder were among the most recognizable and outspoken faces in the industry.  What advisors and clients need now from the digital assets space is a trusted partner, someone they can work with. Crypto exchanges will need to diversify their revenue streams to create more stability during crypto downturns, according to Suneet Muru, an analyst on the thematic intelligence team at GlobalData. This demand for more diversification puts pressure on young, technology-driven companies, many of which are still trying to define, develop and scale their businesses.  “FTX’s bankruptcy will be a classic example of ‘short-term pain, long-term gain’. It will deflate the crypto market cap over the next few months, but will force exchanges to realign their business models toward effective risk management. Now more than ever, exchanges must demonstrate how they differ from banks and keep far less of their own cryptocurrencies on their books.”  Warning signs were there  Not everyone trusted FTX. Digital Asset Research, a provider of institutional data, insights and research for the crypto space, never passed FTX as a “vetted” exchange and never placed it on its own list of trusted actors.  Some of the reasons FTX failed to pass DAR’s muster included opacity, weak KYC/AML controls and its unusual relationship with Alameda research.  LevelField Financial CEO and founder Gene Grant was also wary of FTX long before the CoinDesk report.  “The yellow caution lights were flashing for FTX for some time,” said Grant. “The world loved the story of a brash young man taking on the world, building an empire, and creating a firm from nothing. The problem is that financial services companies are not the same as other companies, and the qualities that make a great leader are those that are less flashy: trustfulness, safety and risk mitigation.”  Read more: These Crypto Market Makers Were Wary of FTX Before Collapse  While much of the world was enthralled by Bankman-Fried's ability to move billions to fund and bailout others in the digital assets space, Grant was concerned with FTX’s origin story, which had its roots in a quasi-illegal arbitrage crypto trade in South Korea, and that Alameda Research was purportedly named under false pretenses to secure bank accounts for the company.  Sam Bankman-Fried surely isn’t the only person in the crypto universe who has built a mostly positive reputation by playing it loose with regulators. While many in the financial services industry scoff at the stringent regulations placed upon them by state, federal and industry agencies, failure to follow those rules should be taken as a huge red flag in and of itself.

Ray III, the new boss of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, criticized the ""unprecedented"" management of ex-CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried that ultimately led to the once-mighty firm's demise, according to a court filing issued on Thursday. “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” said Ray, who has more than 40 years of legal and restructuring experience, including overseeing Enron's high-profile bankruptcy in 2001. “From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented,” he added. Ray mapped out a number of poor management practices that took place within Bankman-Fried's crypto empire, including FTX's failure to ""keep appropriate books and records, or security controls, with respect to its digital assets."" It also used unsecured group email accounts to access private keys, Ray noted, and used software to hide the misuse of customer funds. In addition, he cited FTX's failure to reconcile daily positions on the blockchain, and the ""absence of independent governance as between Alameda (owned 90% by Mr. Bankman-Fried and 10% by Mr. Wang) and the Dotcom Silo (in which third parties had invested),"" the filing said. Speaking of Alameda Research, an affiliated trading firm of FTX, it made a total of $4.1B in loans to related parties, the filing showed, including $1B to SBF himself, $543M to FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and $55M to FTX Digital Markets chief Ryan Salame.

The receding costs signal lower inflation and economic recession ahead, weakening the case for continued liquidity tightening by the Federal Reserve.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  FTX Exploiter Swaps Thousands of Stolen BNB Crypto Tokens Into Ether, BUSD  Bahamian FTX Liquidators Cite ‘Serious Fraud and Mismanagement’ in Court Filings  Ether Staking Yields Jump Up to 25%; All-Time High Since Merge",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | BNB,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,"Lyllah Ledesma, Krisztian Sandor, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/17/first-mover-americas-binanceus-makes-another-run-at-voyager-digital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35f4bf3a6e5c9b6788d6041594fb258f0cc61c6e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ray III issued a scathing assessment of ""unprecedented"" poor management practices by his predecessor, Sam Bankman-Fried, in a series of filings in a Delaware court.  Ray, who has previously supervised financial scandals such as Enron, criticized poor record-keeping and a lack of experience among senior managers, as well as the use of company funds to purchase real estate in the Bahamas.  ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said in a court document filed on Thursday. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""  Ray is attempting to unravel a complex mess of dozens of companies which seem to have had scant regard for corporate norms.  FTX “did not keep appropriate books and records or security controls” for its digital assets, used unsecured shared email accounts to access private keys, and to this day cannot provide a list of those working for the company as at Nov. 11, he said.  Ray also criticized the use of software to conceal the “misuse of corporate funds,” a failure to reconcile blockchain positions daily, and the absence of independent governance between Alameda and the cluster of companies that includes FTX.com — an issue, first revealed by CoinDesk, which caused cracks in the company to deepen ahead of its collapse.  In the Bahamas, FTX Group corporate funds were “used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors,” and assets were assigned to staff personally with no record of them having to repay any loan, he said.  Those attempting to salvage something from the wreckage of the complex network of scores of companies are now caught up in a complex jurisdictional tussle.  Liquidators from the Bahamas have argued that the company was operated from there, in practice, and that the U.S. side of the affairs should be handled as a subsidiary issue in a New York court under Chapter 15, another section of the U.S. bankruptcy code which deals with cross-border failures.  “Having two bankruptcy courts consider related issues simply makes no sense,” said a separate filing on behalf of what remains of FTX Trading, the Antiguan company which filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. “It would result in potentially inconsistent opinions, duplication of efforts, and unnecessary expense.”  “In terms of the celebrity of Mr. Bankman-Fried, his unconventional leadership style, his incessant and disruptive tweeting since the Petition Date, and the almost complete lack of dependable corporate records, these Chapter 11 Cases are unprecedented.”  UPDATE (Nov. 17, 13:43 UTC): adds more details throughout article.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/17/new-ftx-boss-condemns-management-of-the-crypto-exchange-during-sam-bankman-frieds-tenure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/473cba2d52ca752cb1f90fda4f3c09997a3dc3fd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Registration in Spain follows Bitstamp's approval in Italy in July. Founded in 2011, the exchange is also registered to operate in Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  There has been a slew of crypto exchanges expanding their authorized footprint across Europe in recent months, pending the European Union's (EU) markets in crypto assets (MiCA) regulation coming into force. Registration in individual member states should in theory make it easier to operate across the bloc.  Of late, Coinbase won approval in the Netherlands, Crypto.com in Italy, and Luno registered in France.

42414875,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTyIv,1668686218,JPMorgan: The Shrinking Stablecoin Market Is Another Sign of Investors’ Exodus From Crypto,"One way of measuring investors' exodus from the crypto ecosystem is the shrinkage of the stablecoin market, JPMorgan said in a research report Wednesday.  Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset such as the U.S. dollar, are the equivalent of cash in the crypto world and provide a bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, the report said. The growth of the stablecoin market can be viewed as a proxy for the amount of money that has entered the digital assets sector, the report added.  The combined market cap of the largest stablecoins reached a peak of $186 billion in May, before the Terra/LUNA collapse, the note said. That compares with less than $30 billion at the start of 2021 and about $5 billion a year before that. Since May, the stablecoin universe has dropped by $41 billion, with just under half of the decline attributed to the demise of Terra.  JPMorgan says that excluding Terra, it could be argued that the stablecoin market peaked at around $170 billion at the start of the year, was little changed till May 2022, and has been falling ever since.  The bank says that since May 2022 about $25 billion has actively exited the crypto market via stablecoin redemptions.  This outflow of $25 billion looks small relative to the $165 billion that had entered the crypto market via stablecoin creation in 2020 and 2021, “but it would be difficult here to imagine a sustained recovery in crypto prices without the shrinkage of the stablecoin universe stopping.”  Read more: Coinbase: FTX’s Collapse Will Likely Lead to an Extended Crypto Winter",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/17/jpmorgan-the-shrinking-stablecoin-market-is-another-sign-of-investors-exodus-from-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e7e16d796a7c01b115967f7a60aa9602e8f479e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414878,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTyYq,1668684399,"Crypto Will Soon Threaten Global Financial Stability, FSB Official Says","Recent market turmoil has given the Financial Stability Board (FSB) “all the more reason” to develop a globally consistent regulatory framework, an official said on Thursday.  The international body monitors and recommends standards for the global financial system, and is made up of major economies and institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Rapid growth of crypto markets in the presence of structural vulnerabilities and incomplete regulations and supervision means that they will “soon reach a point where they represent a threat to the stability of the global financial system,” said Steven Maijoor, who is the chair of the FSB's working group on crypto assets.  Maijoor made the comments at the Institutional Digital Assets and Crypto Regulation Symposium organized by City & Financial Global in London.  Regulators worldwide – who were already looking into increasing supervision of crypto after the market fallout from earlier this year – are now exploring tighter requirements with renewed urgency following the collapse of multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency exchange FTX last week.  FSB was already looking to set up global standards for regulating crypto, with its annual report published Wednesday, echoing Maijoor’s worries about it potentially threatening financial stability. The report said a number of crypto’s structural vulnerabilities are similar to those in traditional financial markets.  “Trust is built in drops, and lost in buckets,” Maijoor said, drawing parallels between crypto asset markets and the downfall of the Bank of Amsterdam three centuries ago, saying that “it is the FSB’s goal to learn from the past.”  Maijoor, who is an executive board member of the central bank of the Netherlands and a member of the European Central Bank's supervisory board, said that many crypto markets are characterized by high levels of information asymmetry, making it often impossible to know which actors have bad intentions and which platforms are at risk of overreach.  He also said that “crypto cannot simply be considered a fad,” and that many crypto activities do not comply with existing regulation or take place outside of the regulatory perimeter.  The cross border nature of crypto assets poses an obvious challenge for national supervisors,” Maijoor said, adding that they require regulatory response coordinated across borders which is “exactly what the FSB is working on.”  The FSB has published reports open to public consultation, which call on jurisdictions globally to develop new financial norms for crypto risks, focus on international regulation and tighten rules for stablecoins.  He noted that financial supervision is often organized across different sectoral authorities and that the FSB has issued high level recommendations which urge authorities to move beyond sectoral boundaries.  While the FSB has focused on financial stability, Maijoor said that widespread fraud and malicious behavior should also be on regulators’ agendas.  “Crypto activities in many ways resemble the activities of traditional finance,” he said, saying that these activities should be regulated on the principle of “same activity, same risk.”  Read more: ‘Comprehensive’ International Crypto Rules Proposed by Influential Finance Watchdog",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/17/crypto-will-soon-threaten-global-financial-stability-fsb-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61e4eeeb3c0a298c048101258f99460ac6eb1a9e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

By some accounts Germany is the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdiction, largely because of tax rules, and major lenders such as Commerzbank are among those who applied for licenses.  But the regulator is also prepared to get tough. BaFin recently ordered crypto exchange Coinbase to remedy organizational shortcomings revealed during an audit, and crypto companies there will soon be subject to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA).

Some 10,000 BNB tokens were converted into 2,000 ether, worth over $2.4 million at current rates, and a total of 19,714 BNB became $5 million of BUSD over two transactions. The BNB and BUSD tokens form the backbone of BNB Chain, a blockchain network closely related to the crypto exchange Binance.  It is not clear why the attacker is swapping the stolen funds and choosing to convert them to ether and BUSD specifically. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.  The attacker, who carried the first conversion on Tuesday, seems to carry out the conversions at roughly the same time of day. The transactions on Tuesday and Wednesday occurred between 09:00 UTC and 11:00 UTC, as did today's.  The funds were siphoned from FTX's crypto wallets late Friday last week. Soon after, the exchange said on its official Telegram channel that it had been compromised, instructing users not to install any new upgrades and to delete all FTX apps.

42414883,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTyjS,1668677079,Bahamian FTX Liquidators Cite ‘Serious Fraud and Mismanagement’ in Court Filings,"There are signs that “serious fraud and mismanagement” occurred at crypto exchange FTX, according to court filings made by the company’s Bahamian liquidators late Wednesday.  The crypto exchange, headquartered in the Bahamas, declared bankruptcy in the U.S. after revelations from CoinDesk regarding a blurring of lines with sister trading firm Alameda Research's financials led to investor panic and significant outflows.  “The Joint Provisional Liquidators’ findings to date indicate that serious fraud and mismanagement may have been committed” with respect to the group, said the document filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. The documents were filed on behalf of Brian Simms, Kevin Cambridge, and Peter Greaves, who have been put in charge of winding up the company’s affairs in the Bahamas.  Read more: Bahamian Supreme Court Approves Liquidators for FTX Assets  FTX filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on Nov. 11, but that has been disputed by Simms, who in a Tuesday legal filing said that the whole group was, in practice, managed from the Bahamas.  The Wednesday filing seeks to block the sale of any FTX assets provisionally, until courts reach a formal decision under Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, which deals with cross-border insolvency.  Media reports last week that said Alameda owes FTX around $10 billion were “essentially confirming that FTX Brand’s management misused customer deposits on the FTX digital asset exchange to extend undisclosed loans to Alameda,” the filing added, also citing the failed $500 million loan to Voyager in May.  The company, which includes around 134 subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide, is caught in messy legal proceedings to liquidate and repay as many as one million creditors.  FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned on Friday and it is possible the company will face criminal proceedings, an official notice from the Bahamas Securities Commission said Sunday.

However, the project was pushed back to August 2021 and again until 2022, with ASX citing COVID-related disruption as the cause of the delays.

A previous auction, which was completed around the end of last September, saw the now defunct FTX emerging as the “white knight,” winning out against rivals Wave Financial and Binance. At the time, CoinDesk had also reported that Binance's bid for the U.S.-based Voyager had been shut out due to national security concerns.  Following FTX’s announcement last week to file for bankruptcy, Voyager said it had reopened the bidding process for the company, and is in active discussions with alternative bidders. Wave Financial and trading platform Cross Tower are reported to be in the running.  Voyager did not return requests for comment by press time.  Voyager's native token VGX jumped as much as 50% after CoinDesk's report was published, at the time of writing VGX was up over 40% at $0.4066.  Thomas Braziel, managing partner at investment firm 507 Capital said matters are complicated by the fact Voyager is going to have a claim against the FTX estate for breach of contract.  “The problem is that the claim is only going to be against FTX US,” said Braziel in an interview. “I worry a lot of the collateral is going to be held in trust. So any cause of action they have could end up being behind all the customers. And the problem is that if customers aren’t going to be made whole, then what’s your unsecured claim going to be worth? It’s going to be worth bupkis.”  Earlier this week, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said his exchange is setting up an industry recovery fund to help rebuild the industry.  “Binance is not looking to be the ‘white knight’ of crypto,” said Binance chief communications officer Patrick Hillmann in a message to CoinDesk. “There are no Luke Skywalkers or Darth Vaders in business. This is a company, with the most to lose as it's market leader, looking around to see where we can help bolster the industry through a black swan event.”  Read more: Bankrupt Crypto Lender Voyager Reopens Bidding Process Following FTX’s Collapse  UPDATE (Nov. 17, 08:43 UTC): Adds VGX token movement.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/17/binance-to-relaunch-bid-for-bankrupt-lender-voyager-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2d546af9e30e0cbc03e45b7a996d65f0c871b08-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ATOM’s price continues to look weak after a bearish downtrend with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. ATOM’s price trades below the daily 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as bulls eye levels to buy in. In the last two days, the crypto market has seen some drastic shift in sentiment, with Cosmos (ATOM) and the price of other altcoins battling for survival after the news that Binance would not be taking over FTX after conducting due diligence. Previous weeks saw the price of Cosmos (ATOM) perform well, rallying from a low of $13 to a high of $15. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resists But Breaking This Resistance Could Encourage Bulls Cosmos (ATOM) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The price of ATOM, despite showing some great strength in recent weeks, ATOM has been left hanging in the air as the current state of the market has led to the price dropping to its weekly low of $10 after a long while. The price of ATOM saw its price decline to a weekly low of $9.5 before bouncing off this region, showing some great strength to a region of $10 as the price aims to break higher. Weekly resistance for the price of ATOM – $11.5. Weekly support for the price of ATOM – $6.5. Price Analysis Of ATOM On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ATOM remains weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades below the key support region of $11.5, with bulls eyeing lower regions to buy in on the price of ATOM. The region of $8.5-$5.5 has been a key demand zone for the price of ATOM on both weekly and daily timeframes, considering how strong this project has been with good community backing. Daily resistance for the ATOM price – $12. Daily support for the ATOM price – $8-$5.

42414889,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBTz9z,1668669522,Ether Staking Yields Jump Up to 25%; All-Time High Since Merge,"Staking vanilla ether (ETH) is generating eye-catching yields for crypto hopefuls amid a broader market crisis with returns on most fixed-income crypto products dropping as low as 0%.  Operations at centralized crypto lending companies such as Genesis and Circle were caught in the contagion risks stemming from the downfall of crypto exchange FTX in the past few weeks. Withdrawals have been paused at Genesis, while yields on clients’ stablecoin deposits at Circle have dropped to 0%.  The decentralized finance (DeFi) market is muscling on. Users simply staking staked ether (stETH) at staking service Lido are earning as much as 10.7% – an all-time high since the Merge event – with even higher returns for holders as the value of stETH increases.  stETH is a token representing an equivalent amount of ether that has been staked. Staked tokens are locked up for an extended period to provide liquidity for staked ether.  “Recently, the liquid staking protocol also had to increase rebasing oracle limits from 10% to 17.5% to let the increased rewards flow to stETH token holders,” analysts at Delphi Digital said in a Friday note. Rebasing, or elastic, tokens are cryptocurrencies that automatically adjust supply levels to maintain a constant value.  The increased rewards have led to related borrowing strategies offering yields of as much as 25.5% on the Interest Compounding ether product (icETH) offered by Index Coop.  As a result of the increased rewards, the yield earned by recursive borrowing strategies such as icETH has also reached an all-time high of 25.5% since the Merge. It stands at 24.05% at writing time.  The Interest Compounding ETH Index (icETH) enhances staking returns with a leveraged staking strategy. The strategy uses a user’s stETH tokens as collateral on DeFi lending service Aave to borrow wrapped ether (WETH) – a token that tracks ether – that is in turn used to purchase additional stETH tokens.  This effectively leverages the amount of collateral supplied to Aave and uses that to increase yield for traders.  Data shows some $21 million worth of icETH tokens are currently on the market, with $12 million put to use on Aave to generate additional yields for holders.  However, there are some caveats to these high yields.  “Apart from smart contract risk, investors in icETH need to consider the liquidation risk from borrowing ETH from Aave and interest rate risk from the spread between borrowing cost and staking return,” Delphi analysts said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/17/ether-staking-yields-jump-up-to-25-all-time-high-since-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf818481852f94c352a0c2792c3ffdbc5ab67a09-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We are buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow,"" Bukele tweeted late Wednesday. Soon after, Sun announced a similar plan, mimicking Bukele's accumulation strategy.  The strategy of purchasing bitcoin on a set schedule instead in reaction to market movements is known as dollar cost averaging (DCA). The advantage of DCA is that it removes the emotional component of decision-making and you end up paying less in dollar terms for the investment over the long run than you would spend while timing the market.  Bukele and Sun's decision to employ the DCA strategy comes as the recent collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX threatens to prolong the crypto bear market. Analysts are worried that bitcoin could slide to $13,000, having already lost 76% since hitting a record high of $69,000 a year ago.  El Salvador announced bitcoin as legal tender in June last year in hopes that the cryptocurrency would help solve long-standing economic issues. Since then the debt-riddled nation has purchased 2,381 BTC supposedly at an average price of $43,000 .  Sun's Tron DAO Reserve, a community-focused body that supports development on the Tron network, has acquired millions in BTC, Tron's native token TRX and tether (USDT) as collateral backing its dollar-pegged stablecoin USDD. At press time, the collateral backing USDD included 14,040.6 BTC, 240 million USDT, 442,323,460, and 954 million TRX.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/17/el-salvadors-president-nayib-bukele-and-trons-justin-sun-to-buy-one-bitcoin-every-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f362ceaaf433ef4838a9c71cc95ebda319fa4bcd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Judging from the prolonged bear market, most experts were optimistic that it was close to an exit point. However, recent trends in the crypto world and macro-financial activities have prolonged the downtrend. The feds’ rate hike continues to affect crypto assets adversely. XRP’s case with the SEC also has hurt crypto holdings. With their recent victory over crypto giants LBRY, the XRP case is viewed with anxiety. XRP and LBRY cases bear striking similarities, although the XRP’s legal team has expressed confidence in their chances. Related Reading: Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, And Sam Bankman-Fried Sued Over FTX Collapse More recently, FTX’s collapse has also sent investors into a withdrawal frenzy, preferring to hold their assets. In addition, trust in central exchanges is now at an all-time low and has called to question the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies. In the past 24 hours, prices of cryptocurrencies have significantly changed, with changes recorded in most projects. Bitcoin’s Price Drama BTC price recorded a brief bullish rally credited to the tweets of Elon Musk and Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao. Zhao talked about creating an industry recovery fund to help crypto projects that are strong but face liquidity problems. This announcement comes on the heels of the FTX disaster and Binance’s proposed bailout that was suspended. Elon Musk had responded to a tweet from Michael Saylor about converting his Tesla holdings to Bitcoin and its positive effect on the Market. The Twitter exchange between the two entrepreneurs created a brief rally for the world’s number one cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s price recorded an intraday high of $17,190. However, it could not withstand the resistance and succumbed to bearish pressure falling to $16,191 subsequently. BTC’s price has slightly recovered and is currently trading at $16,713. The total market capitalization for crypto is around the $890 billion mark. These figures show a $10 billion increase in the market cap. However, Bitcoin’s dominance took a hit and is currently at 36.6%. With the current volatile market phase, investors will likely proceed cautiously as events unravel. However, Bitcoin will likely lead the rally if the prices recover in the coming days. Bitcoin Price Performance Bitcoin’s recent price performance shows that the coin is observing a price downtrend. The FTX collapse might also have aided this downward spiral. Investors have gone short on losing positions to cut losses and prevent total bankruptcy. Related Reading: Bitcoin 7-Day Volatility Comes Alive As FTX Collapse Shakes Market Bitcoin’s current support levels are at $16,265 and $16,404.8. However, market volatility will have a say in Bitcoin price, with the coin crossing the critical pivot point of 16541.7. The MacD indicator clearly shows Bitcoin’s brief rally and descent into a complete bearish phase. The volatility is high, and a risky investment for investors since a further drop is still likely. The SMA 50 and 200 also reflect the bearish trend of BTC and will likely continue their descent on the chart. It is not likely that bitcoin will go on a bullish spree.

In a statement released Thursday morning, Temasek said that the $210 million investment, which accounted for 1% of FTX International, and $65 million for 1.5% of FTX.US, represents 0.09% of the firm's net portfolio value of $293.5 billion (SGD 403 billion).  ""There have been misperceptions that our investment in FTX is an investment into cryptocurrencies. To clarify, we currently have no direct exposure in cryptocurrencies,"" the firm said in a statement.  Temasek said that the failure of its investment in FTX isn't an indictment against cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, but rather a poor bet on Bankman-Fried.  “It is apparent from this investment that perhaps our belief in the actions, judgment and leadership of Sam Bankman-Fried, formed from our interactions with him and views expressed in our discussions with others, would appear to have been misplaced,” Temasek said. ""While this write down of our investment in FTX will not have significant impact on our overall performance, we treat any investment losses seriously, and there will be learnings for us from this.""  Before investing, Temasek said that it did eight months of due diligence on FTX, reviewing its audited financial statements, analyzing regulatory risk, and cyber security threats.  ""Separately, we also gathered qualitative feedback on the company and management team based on interviews with people familiar with the company, including employees, industry participants, and other investors,"" it said.

Primarily, the BIS offers various banking services to several national central banks. Also, it creates a platform for regulatory policies and monetary discussions. The organization also delivers analysis based on the economy of the nations. Related Reading: Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, And Sam Bankman-Fried Sued Over FTX Collapse The member central financial institutions of the BIS elected about 18 directors to govern its operations. The central member financial institutions consist of the governors of the central banks in France, Belgium, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. These are the permanent directors of the board. They may also collectively appoint another director from one of the member central banks. Finally, the governors from the other member major financial institutions are to elect the 11 directors left of the entire board. The BIS Study Considering the ongoing movement of the crypto market, it’s no surprise that many investors are at a loss. Therefore, the BIS decided to look at the situations of crypto investors regarding the current state of the crypto market. Its findings revealed that about one-third of BTC retail investors are currently at a loss. The study was based on the activities of retail investors on different exchange applications. According to the survey, most exchange application downloads occurred when BTC was still above $20K. The study covered data from 2015 to 2022, spanning about 95 nations. The survey showed that the retail investors bought an average of $100 worth of BTC monthly. From this data, about 81% of retail investors are currently at a loss. This occurrence is raising concerns about venturing into crypto investments. The BIS believes the crypto ecosystem is one of the riskiest investments for anyone. Moreover, its implementation may not do the economy any good as it stands now. Bitcoin Still Attracts Retail Investors As opposed to the belief of the BIS, investors are still showing more interest in Bitcoin regardless of the current situation. The BIS, however, noted that digital currencies are pretty volatile. Therefore, should intending investors venture into it, they could also incur losses. Moreover, these digital assets are still not recognized as global payment methods. This fact also indicates that cryptocurrencies have no governmental backing. Related Reading: Bitcoin 7-Day Volatility Comes Alive As FTX Collapse Shakes Market The Bank of International Settlements also cited that despite the fall of Bitcoin, investors still perform trading transactions with this token. About 75% of the BTC price is lost within the space of a year, and that’s not all. Considering the crash of FTX and 3AC, the BIS noted that investors’ confidence in crypto investments should be somewhat shaky. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $16,586.

Crypto's latest stab in the back came Wednesday morning as the lending arm of crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading temporarily suspended redemptions and new loan originations, adding to the rapidly widening fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s collapse.  This article was adapted from Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Crypto markets recoiled with most major cryptocurrencies spending much of the day in the red.  Bitcoin was recently trading just below $16,700, down 1.4% over the past 24 hours asBitcoin investors resumed their defensive posture of the past week. Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,200, a 3.7% decline. Other major altcoins were largely in the red with CEL and UNI both off more than 5%. FTX’s FTT token declined nearly 4% and was trading at just $1.66, far removed from its high near $36 earlier in the year.  Genesis Interim CEO Derar Islim told customers on a call that Genesis is exploring solutions for the lending unit, including finding a source of fresh liquidity. He said Genesis intends to detail its plan to clients next week. Genesis Global Capital serves an institutional client base and had $2.8 billion in total active loans as of the end of the third quarter of 2022, according to the company’s website. Genesis owner Digital Currency Group (DCG) is also the parent company of CoinDesk. ""Today Genesis Global Capital, Genesis's lending business, made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations. This decision was made in response to the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion,"" said Amanda Cowie, vice president of communications and marketing at DCG.  Equity markets continued to pay scant attention to crypto's ongoing travails. The tech heavy Nasdaq jumped more than a percentage point, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped slightly.  Genesis’ announcement is the latest entanglement to FTX’s liquidity crisis and subsequent filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week. The industry is already reeling from multiple debacles earlier this year, including the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and the LUNA token that backs it.  In an email to CoinDesk, Gene Hoffman, president and COO of energy efficient blockchain Chia Network, noted in an email to CoinDesk that Genesis Global Capital is suffering from ""the type of problem (that) blockchains are built to solve.""  ""The Wall Street paradigms and behaviors applied to the emerging technology are what keep blowing up, and will continue to blow up,"" Hoffman wrote. ""Cryptocurrency doesn’t add anything to lending, and yet we’ve seen actors in the space extending themselves and cranking up their leverage with dubious assets and no oversight.  He added: The industry has to move beyond the “crypto bro” schemes and rugpulls. Crypto and blockchain are not an “asset class” but are a set of rivalrous technologies and we should approach cryptocurrency and blockchain responsibly.""

What's Next for the Crypto Industry?  By Shaurya Malwa  Crypto markets have a way of ignoring time.  Some weeks pass with markets and technical developments moving slower than a snail’s leisurely walk.  Then there are days that pack months – or arguably years’ – worth of action into a few hours. The recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX and spreading fallout belongs to the latter category. In a few days, one of crypto’s flagship enterprises has evaporated, and contagion has gripped markets swept up in new doubts about the industry’s stability.  Crypto funds and projects have lost hundreds of millions of dollars custodied on exchanges and lending companies have ceased certain operations, most recently the lending arm of crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading, which suspended withdrawals on Wednesday. Genesis Global Capital had $2.8 billion in active loans in its recently completed third quarter, as CoinDesk reported.  Genesis Global Trading CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of the same parent firm, Digital Currency Group (DCG).  In a call early Wednesday, Interim CEO Derar Islim told customers that the company’s issues related to FTX’s collapse.  Islim said that Genesis is exploring solutions for the lending unit, including finding a source of fresh liquidity. He added Genesis intends to detail its plan to clients next week. The story now sounds like a refrain of the crypto industry’s myriad tragedies of recent months. Terraform Labs, Celsius and Three Arrows Capital all offered some vague hope of making good to customers, even as their paper walls were crumpling. What hope has Genesis Global Capital?  Last week, Genesis disclosed that its derivatives unit had about $175 million in locked funds in its FTX trading account. As a result, DCG opted to strengthen Genesis’ balance sheet with an equity infusion of $140 million.  The announcement was noted by Gemini, the crypto exchange and custodian that has a partnership with Genesis.  ""We are working with the Genesis team to help customers redeem their funds from the Earn program as quickly as possible,"" Gemini said in a statement, adding that it was “encouraged by Genesis’ and its parent company Digital Currency Group’s commitment to doing everything in their power to fulfill their obligations to customers under the Earn program.""  To be sure, Genesis has not declared solvency issues. The client call implied Genesis was currently illiquid due to market conditions but not insolvent, which would mean it was unable to pay debts owed.  Scant comfort.  Market affect?  Scores of market participants on Crypto Twitter floated theories of how Genesis’ problems would affect the market – ranging from the impact on DCG-owned investment firm Grayscale’s bitcoin and ether products to on-chain sleuths signaling trouble at crypto exchange Gemini, citing on-chain data.  Some opine the search for liquidity to help Genesis may see it unwind part of its GBTC holdings, a Grayscale product that tracks bitcoin, causing prices of bitcoin to plummet to as low as $8,000.  Genesis is a big player in crypto that a year ago, in what now seems the long-ago, pre-bear market past, had over $50 billion in loan originations and $12.5 billion in active loans. It traded over $31 billion in spot volume and over $21 billion in derivatives volumes. Those volumes fell last quarter, however, because of troubles at Three Arrows Capital, another once-high-flying crypto fund.  Traditional finance market participants liken the ongoing crisis to historic macro events, such as Long Term Capital Management’s (LTCM) billion-dollar implosion in the early 90s and Lehman Brothers’ fall from grace in 2008.  Some of these institutions may soon be caught up in the current mess. The next chapters in this ongoing, unsavory saga are difficult to predict, although the chances are likely that conditions will worsen before they improve.

The Associated Press reported late Wednesday that California Republican Mike Garcia won reelection in the state's 27th Congressional District, giving the party the 218 seats needed for control.  The Republicans had long been expected to win the House, though their eventual majority will be unexpectedly slim, and Democrats managed to fend them off from taking over the Senate. While a small number of House races still await final results, Republicans can now expect to soon install their new speaker of the House and – importantly for the crypto industry – new leaders for House committees.  The digital assets lobbyists, trade associations and political action committees had prepared for a divided Congress and the industry can now focus attention on a handful of committees and a few bills expected to be recycled from the current session. Republicans will soon be running the agendas on the House Financial Services Committee – expected to be chaired by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) – and the House Agriculture Committee, where Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) is currently the ranking Republican. Those panels will be crucial for future crypto bills.  As it stands, McHenry has already been a key negotiator for legislation that could establish rules for stablecoins – tokens typically tied to assets such as the dollar – meant to keep steady values as they’re used to buy and sell more volatile digital currencies. McHenry has been in talks with the current chairwoman, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), and both have projected confidence about an agreement eventually being possible.  Thompson and others on the agriculture panel, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have long been pushing bills such as the Digital Commodity Exchange Act to set up wider rules for the industry. Another bill being weighed by the Senate and House agriculture panels, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, found some traction this year (including public backing by now-disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried), but has also drawn industry criticism for its potential effects on decentralized finance (DeFi).  The new Congress starts work on Jan. 3.

The lesson is that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is structurally unsafe. As a result, crypto is easier to steal, and we will get these stories over and over, regulation or not. More than four years have passed since I started writing a very extensive series on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), comprised by the following articles: Bitcoin Series #1 – The Basics Bitcoin Series #2 – Usage Bitcoin Series #3 – Security Bitcoin Series #4 – The Bitcoin Arms Race Bitcoin Series #5 – Altcoins And Forks Bitcoin Series #6 – Other Considerations Bitcoin Series #7 – The Endgame Bitcoin Series Addendum - Market Structure Bitcoin Series #8 – Bitcoin Is Not The Future Bitcoin Series #9: Bitcoin's Failure Is An Important Strength Bitcoin Series #10 - Tainted Money The FTX (FTT-USD) failure has again shown crypto remains exceptionally vulnerable to strange failures, generally affecting crypto exchanges. These failures - usually attributed to hacking - typically produce very large losses for customers, as well as lead to renewed distrust in crypto in general, and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) , the best-known crypto, in particular. Calls for more regulation are typical, at this point. Today’s article is about a lesson which the FTX collapse allowed us to learn, or perhaps re-learn, which fully applies to Bitcoin. I still recommend anyone not very familiar with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general to read the entire series, starting with the first article. Whether you share my opinions or not, you will greatly increase your knowledge on this cryptocurrency – the biggest of them all. Crypto-Holding Institutions Are Intrinsically Unsafe This is something many “investors” in Bitcoin fail to understand. The belief in Bitcoin’s (and other cryptos' ) resilience to direct attacks on the blockchain, clouds the obvious fact that the blockchain itself serves as nothing but a master/omnibus account when it comes to a crypto exchange or broker. In this sense, crypto exchanges aren’t different from regular banks, brokers or exchanges. These, too, don’t really keep 1 account per customer when it comes to depositor or investor assets. Instead, for instance at the central bank, the bank will have just one account. And the broker will equally have just one account at a securities depository, or at the exchange. Then, internally, a broker divides its assets present in these aggregate (master/omnibus) accounts by using an internal book-keeping system to establish how much of the asset each customer owns. It's the exact same with a crypto exchange. On the blockchain (per each cryptocurrency), the crypto exchange will keep just 1 or a few addresses where all the crypto will be stored. Then, an internal book-keeping system will divide this aggregate between customers. Since assets are kept concentrated in one (or few) places, regular banks and brokers have to be extraordinarily cautious regarding the security of the access to this place (as well as the internal book-keeping). Indeed, no one executive will be able to tamper or move assets recklessly both within the bookkeeping system, or from the master account. Systems will be in place to, at all times, verify the consistency of the aggregate assets implied by the internal book-keeping system, and the value held on master accounts. No executive will have the power to move assets quickly and in large chunks, and no unjustified (not consistent between the ledgers) movement of assets will be possible silently. Cryptos are different: No internal system belonging to a crypto-holding institution can prevent or censor the movement of crypto by any person having the keys to the (few) exchange wallets. Unlike in at a regular financial institution, such movement can be initiated from anywhere (geographically) and completely outside the company's software infrastructure. The person knowing and using the keys needn’t be known to the institution or part of it (though he can be). The person using the keys needn’t sign anything (at the institution) to move crypto. The person using the keys needn’t request anyone the permission or ability to realize a transfer. The person using the keys needn't even penetrate or use the institution's systems in order to steal the crypto. Instead, a person just has to sign a transaction with the required keys, and immediately the exchange wallets will be breached, and the transaction will go through with nothing and no one being able to censor it. Of course, like with regular financial institutions, it will be possible for the crypto-holding institution to immediately realize an accounting inconsistency emerged between the value held in its master accounts, and the one implied by its internal bookkeeping. Unfortunately, even in the case such alarm uncovers trouble, the trouble will already be irreversible (a characteristic of Bitcoin and most other cryptos – transactions cannot be reversed or censored). This, for all purposes, means that any institution holding crypto will always be unsafe. There are no possible safeguards for this structural vulnerability. Misdealing Is Much Easier With Crypto This is a corollary which results from the previous observation. Without looking – it’s doubtful FTX transferred cash or cryptos to Alameda. It’s much more likely FTX bought stablecoins (with the cash) and shared keys with Alameda. As well as shared keys regarding various master crypto accounts. The money wouldn’t move (in a suspicious way), so no third parties would thus be warned. Ownership would just be a book entry. Internally, there could be warnings – but those were suppressed, as per Reuters (bold is mine): In a subsequent examination, FTX legal and finance teams also learned that Bankman-Fried implemented what the two people described as a ""backdoor"" in FTX's book-keeping system, which was built using bespoke software. They said the ""backdoor"" allowed Bankman-Fried to execute commands that could alter the company's financial records without alerting other people, including external auditors. This set-up meant that the movement of the $10 billion in funds to Alameda did not trigger internal compliance or accounting red flags at FTX , they said. In his text message to Reuters, Bankman-Fried denied implementing a ""backdoor"". This kind of action is possible because generally, in crypto, there is no ownership nexus. He who has the keys, controls the crypto but doesn’t really own it. He’s just able to move it. And if 2 (or more) institutions have the keys to a given crypto address, then they both can move this crypto and act as its owners. How they report ownership of the underlying crypto at any given time is entirely arbitrary. How they chose to move it to “somewhere else” at any given time is also entirely arbitrary (but will raise red flags internally in the unaware institution, as explained). In the presence of a misdealing actor, this is a tremendous hole in crypto security. The misdealing actor will single-handedly, and without possibility of censorship, be able to move assets away from any of his controlled (or even not controlled, as long as they were controlled in the past) institutions at ease. This risk probably expressed itself both during the time FTX and Alameda were seen as viable, legitimate entities, and after that time ( during the supposed hacking ). Notice how this differs from common banking. In common banking, each account has an ownership nexus. 2 different institutions will not be able to claim ownership of the same master account. And to transfer assets from the account of one institution to the account of another will require the agreement of those with the power to commit the institution, leave a paper trail, and be subjected to scrutiny. The financial institution holding one or both accounts (for customers) might even suspect the activity taking place and interrupt it to conduct further scrutiny. The risk for someone trying to compromise a crypto-holding institution is thus many orders of magnitude higher, due to this structural difference. Finally, even if an illicit transaction takes place at a regular institution, there's still a good chance to reverse it. Such isn't possible with Bitcoin. Regulation Won’t Solve The Problem The flaw I described, and which must have been taken advantage widely in the context of the FTX collapse, cannot be solved by regulation. The most regulation can do is to be extremely strict regarding internal controls up to and including the internal warning system. But crucially, there is no possible system or regulation which can prevent or reverse a master account from being abused from anywhere in the world, just as long as the keys to the master account are known to someone wanting to compromise them. This is structural to Bitcoin and most of crypto in general. It is so by design. Hence, regulators, when it comes to crypto, will always be handicapped. This is unlike the present financial system, where checks and balances can keep control of most catastrophic attempted transactions, or reverse them after the fact. Indeed, the one common fraud within the financial system is typically slow – it mostly consists of making uneconomic loans to “friendly” customers. This can over time collapse an institution, but it will tend to: Last a long time, since no single loan can be catastrophic and avoid scrutiny, plus loans aren’t instant. Not compromise a very large percentage of customer deposits. In the end, to not imply widespread customer losses in the sense that deposit insurance schemes exist the world over. It can, however, lead to creditor and investor losses. Anyway, the central point is: Crypto in inherently unsafe. Crypto is easier to steal as the possession of just 1 key can compromise a master account irreversibly and without the chance for censorship. Given the above, the losses will tend to be larger and affect customers (depositors) to a much larger extent than in regular deposit-taking financial institutions. Outside Of An Institution, Crypto Is Unpractical Crypto fans will immediately say that none of this applies if you just keep your crypto with yourself. Which is true, the vulnerabilities I talk about are present in the crypto ecosystem as a whole, not on the underlying blockchains. It’s very hard to take your crypto if you don’t have it deposited somewhere. However, at the same time, it's wildly unpractical to hold crypto yourself. Besides the opportunity to lose it forever just because you lose the key, there’s also the fact that crypto is crazily unpractical. For investors, which is what this argument concerns itself about, there’s simply no practical way to trade in and out of your crypto without putting it into an exchange, which is where liquidity for trading exists. Hence, there’s no solution here either. There Will Likely Be More Details Of Wrongdoing At FTX Already, we know that FTX used customer funds which ought to have been segregated, to be loaned out to Alameda, which proceeded in some form to lose them. We also know that FTX did this in a covert way. These seem the main wrongdoings within the collapse. However, I’ll immediately put forth that further wrongdoing is going to be disclosed. From observing the “haphazard” FTX Balance Sheet volunteered by SBF to which the Financial Times had access , I conclude the following: We notice the existence of large liabilities in several cryptos, including BTC and ETH. These are to be expected. If a customer decides to buy BTC, acquiring that BTC for him will become a liability to FTX. This is so because, if a customer buys BTC then FTX has to buy BTC and hold it in one of its master wallets. Hence, FTX’s balance sheet will show both a BTC asset (held in its master wallet) and a BTC liability (the BTC is owed to the customer and registered as so in FTX’s internal book-keeping system). Hence, one would expect BTC to not only show up on the liability side of FTX’s balance sheet, but also appear on the asset side, and for the amount of BTC on the asset side to be the same or more than what customers bought for themselves. Yet, there is no meaningful BTC or ETH on the asset side. It thus follows that it wasn’t just customers’ cash funds which might have been abused. Even the customers’ crypto assets were abused. This is yet to be disclosed in the news (though it is implied by the leaked balance sheets). Indeed, given what’s on the asset side (mostly obscure FTX-linked tokens), I’ll go as far as to say that nearly all customer assets (not just cash) are gone. It also follows that in abusing customer crypto assets, the exchange had to keep a diverging accounting of those assets on the client-facing interface. Or else, the customers would think their assets still existed, which they didn’t. This is part of the “backdoor” we earlier talked about. The FTX Customer Losses Are Going To Be Very Large It’s immediately evident that if customers face losses, then other creditors and investors will be entirely wiped out. However, from the leaked FTX balance sheet, it’s also immediately obvious that very large losses are coming to the customers / depositors as well. Initially the reports put this shortfall at $1-$2 billion , but there’s reason to believe the shortfall is much larger. Let me explain why: Taken at face view, the leaked balance sheet indicates $8.9 billion in liabilities (of which around $8.1 billion look to belong to customers), and $9.6 billion in assets ($0.9 billion liquid, $5.45 billion less liquid, $3.23 billion illiquid). This translates into an actual positive book value of around $0.7 billion. One would argue that perhaps the problem was just one of liquidity mismatch, between the assets and liabilities. And that some emergency help could plug the liquidity hole until assets could be liquidated. However, immediately there is a supposed hidden $8 billion liability. That totally changes the balance, as now the hole could be as large as $7.3 billion. The hole, though, is even larger. After all, many of the illiquid assets will be all but worthless in a liquidation scenario. This includes $4-4.5 billion of the less liquid assets, and likely nearly $3.15 billion of the illiquid assets. Thus, $7.15-$7.60 billion of the $9.6 billion in assets looks very dubious. If we take these dubious assets off, we can thus be looking at just $2 billion in actual assets trying to satisfy $8.1 billion in customer claims. In this case, recoveries for customers would be around 25%. However, there might be reason to believe that the hidden $8 billion liability also belongs to customers (since it matches with the kind of reporting that says around half of the customer deposits were lent out to Alameda). In that case, recoveries might be as low as around 12.5%. This could be mitigated by assets at Alameda, but the scenario there is equally disastrous, with a lot of made-up assets ( FTT-USD ) as well as the same kind of less liquid assets held by FTX which will be near worthless in a liquidation scenario. Conclusion This article leads to the following conclusions and predictions: Bitcoin (and crypto in general) is structurally unsafe when used through an institution. And not even regulation can make it safe, in the sense that there will always be an extreme vulnerability because of the potential to sign irreversible and un-censorable transactions from anywhere in the world just by knowing the keys to the master accounts at a crypto-holding institution. Bitcoin (and crypto in general) is also easier and more appealing to misdeal, given that structural problem. I struggle to call it a “flaw”, since this structural problem is actually part of the design for Bitcoin. I believe recoveries for customers will be low at FTX. For FTX investors and creditors, recoveries will be zero – they come after customers, so if customers are going to suffer large losses, everyone else is a zero. The blockchain technology is valid, but the “get rich quick” mentality means the things speculators can bet on (the value of crypto coins) is divorced from the value the technology can add. Indeed, blockchain technology doesn’t require any “flying tokens” to be used or to be valid. One, or more, stablecoins built with a more robust permission system as well as a more robust reversion system (while keeping anonymity) will eventually steal away most of the functional, legitimate, use for crypto. This will lead to a loss of value for Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH-USD) , etc.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558599-bitcoin-regulation-cant-cure-problem?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4329474.jpeg
