The month has historically been bearish for the digital asset, which makes it no surprise when multiple dips had begun to rock it. Now, as the month draws to a close, it continues to follow the trend for most of the month. This means that it is likely not to be any significant recovery, and single-digit gains may be the best it can do. September Proves To Be Deadly The month of September has not been kind to the digital assets that currently play in the crypto market. From the beginning of the month to the present day, the crypto market has been wracked by dips and crashes, which has left most assets barely holding their heads above others.

42422230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jG7h,1664402399,Is Bitcoin an Inflation Hedge? Investors Are Still Unsure,"Bitcoin (BTC) regained the $19,000 level Wednesday intraday as industry watchers pondered anew whether the largest cryptocurrency would become a go-to asset in times of high inflation.  BTC was recently up about 3% over the past 24 hours and roughly 6% over the past seven days, according to Messari data.  “Following the philosophy of buying when there’s blood in the streets and the common saying of being greedy when everyone around you is fearful, we might be at the opportune time to start slowly placing capital,” said Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at STORM Partner.  The macroeconomic environment has had an increasingly significant influence on the crypto market in the current, bearish sentiment-filled market cycle. BTC’s latest rebound Wednesday followed the Bank of England’s announcement earlier in the day that it would buy bonds after the government’s tax-cut plan triggered a massive sell-off.  Painful inflation has led central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to pursue aggressive interest rate hikes, putting downward pressure on prices of risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  The global crypto market capitalization has dropped from $2.9 trillion in November to $959 billion now, according to CoinMarketCap’s data.  “I think that crypto is just following the same trend as the market and it’s just pure risk-off appetite because of the current volatility and uncertainty,” Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday.  “If the stock market rally is able to overcome hard landing fears, that should provide a nice backdrop for cryptos,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note. “This broad risk-on rally doesn’t seem like it has legs to stand on, but this bounce could last a little longer.”  Ether (ETH) rebounded above $1,300 Wednesday, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours and 6.9% in the past seven days.  Ether has appeared to show a greater inflation resistance since Ethereum’s historic Merge shift two weeks ago to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” blockchain system. Ethereum’s annualized inflation rate since the Merge is around 0.19%, lower than BTC’s 1.75%.  Alexandre Lores, director of blockchain market research at Quantum Economics, expected the inflation rate rivalry between BTC and ETH to continue fluctuating “back and forth between now and 2024.”  The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures the price of ETH relative to BTC, started falling after the Merge to the current level of 0.06. Lores said he wouldn’t buy the BTC-ETH inflation rate flippening narrative until the ratio breaks its all-time high record of 0.15 in late 2017.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/28/is-bitcoin-an-inflation-hedge-investors-are-still-unsure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff447f890af71797137fcb9ac4bdb41675955ea7-1148x586.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422247,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jGbh,1664400213,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Reverses Course Again, Trades Toward 20-Day Moving Average","Price Action  Bitcoin and ether traded higher on Tuesday, reversing course from the prior day.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose 2.4% on Wednesday on above-average volume compared with its 20-day moving average. Bitcoin started the day in positive territory as traditional U.S. markets opened, logging four consecutive positive candles on its hourly chart. A trading candle represents the open, high, low and close price for an asset during a selected time frame. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reclaimed the $19,000 price point, but continues to trade below the psychologically important $20,000 mark.  Ether (ETH) was roughly flat, falling 0.07% on moderate volume. The price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has fallen 19% since the Ethereum network’s Sept. 15 conversion from proof-of-stake to proof-of-work. ETH’s value compared with BTC has fallen 21% relative to BTC over the same time frame. Ether supply has increased by 8,400 ETH since the Merge. Absent the Merge, ETH supply would have grown by approximately 167,000 ETH over the same time frame.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, declined 0.35%  Economic Calendar: Wholesale inventories rose by more than expected, increasing 1.3% versus estimates of 0.3%.  Higher inventory levels may signal an economic slowdown, which would please the Federal Reserve in its efforts to tame inflation by decelerating economic growth.  Year over year, pending home sales decreased 24% in August, the largest decrease since April 2020, and larger than the consensus estimate of a 23% decline.  While not released Wednesday, consumer revolving credit figures, released Sept. 8 showed revolving debt increased 11% annually for the month of July. Given the extent to which retail investors participate in crypto markets, increases in revolving credit debt is likely to suppress the amount of capital available to purchase additional assets.  Currently, digital asset markets are navigating a challenging environment of high inflation, inverse correlations to the U.S. dollar, increasing interest rates and higher consumer debt.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities were higher across the board as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose 1.9%, 2% and 1.97%, respectively.  Commodities: WTI crude rose 4.4% while European Brent crude rose 3.2%, marking the second consecutive day of increases for both. Natural gas rose 3.6% following a 3% decline on Tuesday. In metals, gold prices increased 2%, while copper futures increased 3%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin approaches its 20-day moving average  Bitcoin moved higher on Wednesday, approaching its 20-day moving average on above-average volume. The increase marks the third consecutive day where BTC’s price has traded in the opposite direction from the previous day.  As indicated in prior Market Wraps, BTC appears poised to trade relatively flat as prices have tended to revert more to its mean rather than trend in a particular direction. In the aggregate, BTC prices are trading near the same levels they were in June.  A look at BTC’s hourly chart shows a string of five consecutive hours of positive price action, beginning at 12:00 UTC (8:00 a.m. ET).  Applying Bollinger Bands to the hourly chart highlights the tendency for BTC prices to move to extremes before reverting to the mean (average) price.  Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that measures an asset’s 20-day moving average, and plots two standard deviations above and below that average. Statistically, an asset’s price is expected to remain within two standard deviations of its average 95% of the time.  On the hourly chart, traders likely noticed the breach of the upper Bollinger band during the 16:00 UTC hour, in conjunction with a rising Relative Strength Index indicator. RSI measures an asset’s momentum, providing signals when an asset’s price may be approaching overvalued or undervalued status.  Also of note is that trading volume during that time frame began to decline relative to its average, implying that intraday bullish sentiment is beginning to turn.  Moving from the hourly to the daily chart paints a broader scale look at the results of intraday action. In this case, BTC’s price is moving toward the midpoint of its Bollinger Bands, while the RSI reading of 47 is relatively neutral.  The combination of factors on both larger and smaller time frame charts speaks to an asset poised to oscillate between slightly above to slightly below its average price, with traders looking to benefit in the short term on the price swings.  Derivatives markets seem to be implying the same, as funding rates for bitcoin have been alternating between positive and negative over the most recent week. Funding rates represent payments between buyers and sellers of futures contracts and can be used to measure market sentiment.  When rates are positive, buyers are likely driving the market. The opposite is true when funding rates are negative. Currently, BTC funding rates are positive but just slightly over zero, and less positive than the day before.

The economy was &apos;stimulated&apos; in Roman times by creating more coins out of less pure metals. During World War II, the Federal Reserve lent the Treasury a hand by capping interest rates, and before that, various attempts were made to promote growth by purposely devaluing the currency.Today, economists believe they have perfected the art of monetary policy, and indeed, it seems like the whole market hinges on the words of those in charge of the Fed.While the Federal Reserve ha...",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4543682-bitcoin-dont-fight-fed-win-no-matter-what?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3374023.jpeg

42421102,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSiD,1664399141,"Kraken's Incoming CEO on Jesse Powell's Departure, IPO Plans and Crypto Winter","The reins of power are changing hands at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.  Dave Ripley, the company's chief operating officer who was tapped as chief executive, sat down with CoinDesk TV to discuss the departure of founder Jesse Powell, who led the exchange since its establishment in 2011. Ripley will transition to the CEO role after the company finds a COO replacement.  For years, Kraken has served as an institutional on-ramp into crypto in the U.S. and a bastion of the industry’s anti-state ethos. In 2015, for instance, the exchange decided to exit New York State rather than apply for the onerous “BitLicense.” Under Powell, who will stay on as board chairman, Kraken championed a “decentralization first” mentality as it hired prominent bitcoiners, funded industry research and lobbied governments.  Read more: Kraken’s Jesse Powell to Step Down as CEO of Crypto Exchange  “With all of the dynamic aspects of crypto it’s tough to say nothing will ever change. But the one thing I can say for certain [is we] will be steadfast and unwavering on our mission, our values and our culture,” Ripley said.  Earlier this year, Powell came under fire for supposedly fostering a toxic workplace culture, where women, BIPOC and other diverse employees felt out of place. The exchange, most recently valued at $10.8 billion, is working to find a balance between its early “pirate” values and an increasingly professionalized industry.  In the interview, Ripley also discussed what the crypto winter could mean for investors, the possibility of Kraken becoming a publicly traded company and bitcoin maximalism. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.  Why did Jesse Powell really step down? What happened? What’s going on over there?  It’s been a while for him – 11 years since the founding of Kraken – and he’s interested in taking a step up, as we’re referring to [it], to become the chairman of Kraken. I think the company’s at a different level of scale. He wants to focus on a couple of more narrow areas going forward, mainly industry advocacy, which is broader than Kraken itself, [as well as] thinking harder about product innovation.  We’re in the middle of a downturn in the markets. As you step into this role, how are you approaching that?  This isn’t our first bear market by any means. At this point, I think we’re built for this. It’s not our first rodeo. ​​We’ve done a lot of things over the history of Kraken to prepare for the volatility and dynamic aspects of the crypto market and we’re feeling pretty confident about this market. We’re in a great position. We have an incredible team, we have a scalable product in operational business, we have a strong balance sheet. We've continued to hire throughout this year and we’re continually reassessing hiring plans in moderating growth appropriately to match what's best for the business. We're in great shape to further strengthen and fortify the business during this period.  There have been some loose timelines about perhaps entering the public markets along with fellow crypto exchange Coinbase. Where do the IPO plans stand given market conditions? Given this change of leadership, is that still on?  No specificity on IPO plans that we can share. We haven’t done a huge amount of equity fundraising in Kraken’s history. We’ve done some. And we do have our eyes set on this being a meaningful part of the business going forward. Both private and public funding are out there for us. We are definitely gearing up to engage more and more with external investors in the coming years.  Jesse [Powell] set a very loud tone about what he wants Kraken to be like. Is that going to change with you … or do you expect it to stay the same? What’s your take on company culture?  With all of the dynamic aspects of crypto it’s tough to say nothing will ever change. But the one thing I can say for certain will be steadfast and unwavering on our mission, our values and our culture. I was incredibly involved in defining how we really see our mission and vision going forward. This is frankly a source of our success and a source of our potential success moving forward as well.  We’ve seen a number of mergers and acquisitions in the space and we’ve seen exchanges look to NFTs [non-fungible tokens], as well as offering banking services. Through this bear market, what is your vision for the company as you step into the CEO role?  We’re bullish on the crypto space. We think innovation is going to continue. We’ve seen significant breakout innovations, including DeFi [decentralized finance] then followed by different use-cases for NFTs and we’re really bullish about the potential use cases out there.  In the coming years, we’re going to enter an interesting period where a number of these different use cases reinforce each other and that’s where we hit escape velocity. Where does Kraken sit in all of this? We’ve historically been a bridge from the traditional finance world to crypto and we’re looking to continue that as our main contribution to the ecosystem. We’re going to look to build that bridge deeper and deeper into the most exciting and interesting use cases in crypto.  Are there any sights set on acquisitions?  We do, but we can’t disclose all of the specifics or company names for an M&A. Generally, where we’ve focused on [mergers and acquisitions] more recently, has been on the new product and technology and innovation side. Our biggest acquisition today was Staked [a non-custodial staking services platform]. We jumped out fairly early in the staking services space and that acquisition helped fortify our technology and our infrastructure. We’re going to be launching an NFT marketplace in the not too distant future, [which] would be another area where we’re looking for M&A opportunities.  How is Kraken navigating the murky waters of regulation?  We invest enormously in this space and we have a legal team led by Marco Santori. We’ve also built out a policy team recently [and] this group works out the forward-looking engagement with both regulators and lawmakers and that team is now 10+. Marco’s team overall is 50+. As we get to market with different types of products and services, we have our core compliance team [that] is close to 300 [employees]. We have another 300+ across operations, working in and around compliance.  Where we sit in the ecosystem, being a bridge from TradFi to crypto, it’s fundamental for us and it’s critical that we have this and do this as we see more regulators coming into the fold. We’re looking to proactively engage with all of them and we have been.  Read more: I Don’t Understand Bitcoin Maximalism / Opinion  Are you a bitcoin maxi? Does bitcoin maximalism prevail at Kraken, culturally? Where does Kraken fit within the broader exchange ecosystem?  Affectionately, we call our team “Kraken Knights” and we have a number of Kraken Knights that sit on both sides, that are [either] bitcoin maxis and some that aren’t.  Kraken, as a company, we’re very supportive of being multi-token. We list about 200 tokens on the platform. We view ourselves as being impartial to these various different technologies and that’s where we sit as a company in this space. Our culture and values are predicated on what we refer to as crypto values: economic freedom, inclusion, equality, global perspective.  A lot of those values are pervasive among bitcoin, but then more broadly across crypto. Given that we have that view on the space and we have a lot of people that have been in crypto for a long time, we do have a lot of OG crypto individuals as clients, but I don’t know if we necessarily have more bitcoin maxis as clients. Perhaps, that could be.

42422241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jGNh,1664399012,The Fed May Not Be Able to Pivot Even If It so Desires,"With the global economy teetering and markets in turmoil – the recent crash of the British pound and bond market being the latest examples – central banks are facing an acute dilemma they haven’t dealt with for a long time: choosing between price stability – tightening monetary policy to keep inflation from spiraling out of control – and financial stability – keeping financial markets from seizing up.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has pledged to keep hiking interest rates until inflation returns closer to the bank’s target of 2%. But that might mean the nearly unthinkable prospect of pushing the financial system into the kind of serious, panic-level trouble reminiscent of the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.  American markets are undeniably in stress right now. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are down more than 50% for the year, the Nasdaq 100 has lost 30% of its value and the S&P 500 has shed 22%. Supposedly a place to hide during asset crashes, the bond market – as represented by the “risk-free” 20-year U.S. Treasury bond – has underperformed the S&P, losing 30% in 2022.  Historically, the Fed has made it a priority to come to the rescue of financial markets because, after all, the U.S. central bank was formed in the early 20th century with the goal of reducing the threat of bank runs. The Fed’s price stability mandate – though implicit throughout the bank’s history – wasn’t explicitly put into law until 1977. Might the Fed prioritize inflation over market stability this time around?  “The general thesis is whenever the United States economy gets in trouble or the financial system is stressed, that the Fed can print money and solve the problem and we don't have to worry about anything,” said Dick Bove, chief financial strategist at Odeon Capital. “But I think what we’ve learned is that you can’t be doing what we’ve been doing.”  “They’re not going to give up the American economy with massive inflation just so Wall Street can be happy,” he added.  Seeing the panicky meltdown in its country’s bond and currency markets, the Bank of England on Wednesday took steps to restore stability, announcing its intention to buy as many long-dated gilts as necessary in order to halt the shocking rise in rates over the past few weeks.  Though not selling off in as breathtaking fashion as the U.K., U.S. bond yields have also climbed sharply, with the 10-year Treasury yield briefly touching 4% on Wednesday, the highest level in more than a decade.  With a long road still ahead for Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to bring the current inflation level of 8.3% back to near its 2% target, U.S. markets could get a lot worse. Might the Fed need to do a pivot a la the Bank of England and return to outright purchases of bonds?  Bove believes the U.S. is at a “transitional point” at which the old playbook – the Fed aggressively easing policy to paper over a crisis – won’t work anymore. He predicts that if the Fed starts printing money to help the markets, inflation will take off “like a rocket.”  Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global, said the Fed seems to be willing to put markets through some short term pain in order to get to long term stability.  “It's hard to know what the Fed is thinking during these times, but my impression is they certainly don't want to have a global market meltdown,” she said.  For its part, Fed officials keep reiterating they won’t pivot to easier policy because of shaky markets and the recent dot plot shows continued rate hikes into 2023. Market participants aren’t so sure, with a glance at the fed funds futures market showing no rate hikes priced in for all of 2023 (no rate cuts are priced in either).  “It could be that they’re talking the talk,” Bovino said. “Part of this is kind of forward guidance, trying to get markets to agree that [the Fed plans] to do something like this, and they want to be credible.”  Current high inflation is partly the Fed’s fault  The Fed’s balance sheet footings remained stable at just under $1 trillion until the global financial crisis in 2008 forced the central bank to more than double them to just over $2 trillion. There was a more dramatic bump during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Fed in very short order added another $3 trillion to its balance sheet with little more than a few keyboard clicks.  Assets on the Fed’s balance sheet eventually topped out just shy of $9 trillion earlier this year, and have slowly come down to $8.8 trillion at last check.  Many economists say it’s partly because of the central bank response to those two panics that the U.S. is seeing prices running at a four-decade high.  As for bitcoiners, they hardly need to be reminded the original crypto came into being as a response to the bailouts of the global financial crisis. “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” read the message embedded by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin’s first-ever block (the Genesis block) in January 2009.  “If they hadn’t been so stupid the way they did policy prior, then we would be in much better shape,” said Steven Blitz, chief economist at TS Lombard. “The equity market would never have gotten that high and the bond yields would’ve normalized a year ago.”  Meanwhile, on the fiscal side, U.S. public debt topped $30 trillion in 2021, now well above U.S. economic output (GDP was $23 trillion in 2021 and is expected to be about $25 trillion in 2022). The debt has been an ongoing issue for decades, but responses to the global financial crisis and the pandemic accelerated the trend.  “They just can't keep increasing debt,” Bove said. “At some point you reach a point where the debt becomes so enormous that it just can't be paid back, the United States cannot pay back its debt.”  Bove said investors appear to be betting the Fed will stop tightening monetary policy if financial markets start to founder – similar to the Bank of England’s capitulation.  The Fed is “not frightened that the world is coming to an end,” Blitz said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/28/the-fed-may-not-be-able-to-pivot-even-if-it-wanted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78870329b9df2a75eac8dc9013eb6bd704d3cb37-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394496,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw95tl,1664398030,Crypto Ponzi Schemes: How to Identify and Protect Yourself From These Scams,"We’ve all heard the stories of people becoming multimillionaires through investing in cryptocurrency. When you hear these tales of people who – just a decade ago! – put a little money into a new digital asset called bitcoin and saw the kind of exponential growth that minted new millionaires, it’s natural to want to get involved in what seems like an exciting new asset class. To put the growth in context, it took just 12 years for bitcoin to reach a $1 trillion market cap, a milestone it took Microsoft 44 years, Apple 42 years, Amazon 24 years, and Google 21 years.  See Also: What Makes Bitcoin’s Price Go Up … or Crash Down?  There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about cryptocurrency’s future even amid the current “crypto winter” we’re in. There are also reasons to be skeptical, and many in traditional finance are vocal about their doubts. Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, said that “crypto is an investment in nothing” and has compared the crypto asset class to ""some venereal disease."" Just this month, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, called “crypto tokens 'decentralized Ponzi schemes'.”  On the other hand, large institutional investors like Fidelity are adding bitcoin to the offerings in corporate 401(k) and are considering allowing individual customers to trade it. BlackRock has recently partnered with Coinbase to offer crypto to its institutional clients.  To take a step back and help navigate these polarities, it might help to define exactly what a Ponzi scheme is.  What is a Ponzi scheme, anyway?  A Ponzi scheme is a financial fraud disguised as a sophisticated investment opportunity that promises to generate outstanding returns for investors. In reality, a Ponzi scheme is an illicit fraud that distributes payouts to early investors with funds from more recent investors. The money is never invested as promised, but instead goes directly to pay out those “guaranteed high returns” to early investors until the pool of new investors dries up and the scheme falls completely apart. Late-stage Ponzi schemes are often fraught with problems with slow withdrawals, problems “accessing funds” and the eventual disappearance of the con artists with any remaining assets.  Ponzis are notorious for enticing victims by leveraging their mastery or superior knowledge of a “new technology” as a selling point for targets. The con-artists running them often have extraordinary sales skills. Ponzi schemes prey on the almost insatiable desire of people to “get rich quick.”  Crypto is a prime target for the masterminds of Ponzi schemes. Average investors do not fully understand the technology that crypto uses or how to evaluate a cryptocurrency as a sound investment. Unlike traditional investments where investors can dig into earnings, third-party research reports (i.e., Morningstar), audited documents and other required regulatory material, many crypto projects are unregulated and having anonymous founders is not unusual in the space.  This leaves a wide opening for scammers to present themselves as experts who can take care of that “difficult” tech and learning curve for you. They promise sky-high returns and they’ll also assure you that you don’t need to understand the “how” of those profits. They’ll point to impressively built websites and talk up the intelligence of the team behind the project.  Warning signs of Ponzi schemes  Investors are faced with a difficult situation: They have a desire to invest in the asset class and participate in the growth of crypto, yet face a tremendous learning curve in order to safely do so. This creates a dangerous situation for well-intentioned investors that scammers are eager to exploit. But there are some common warning signs to look out for to avoid getting caught in a Ponzi scheme.  Some things to look out for include:  Very high returns with promises of little or no risk: Investors need to be very suspicious of “guaranteed returns” or promises of high returns with little risk. All investments carry certain amounts of risk and investors must be wary when presented with an opportunity that sounds too good to be true.  Low volatility on returns: Ponzi schemes promise very consistent returns over time. Markets are volatile by nature. While returns can appear smooth over long periods of time, short-term performance is variable month after month. Red flags should pop up when promises of consistent returns are stated regardless of market conditions.  Proprietary or secretive strategies: When a strategy is able to generate returns exclusively through a sophisticated or secretive strategy, investors should be concerned. If it is difficult to understand the methodology of an underlying investment strategy the investment should be avoided.  Lack of liquidity: Certain assets are illiquid by nature (startup investments, real estate, etc.) but cryptocurrencies are very liquid. If a crypto investment is illiquid, the investor should understand exactly why that is and have a clear understanding of when the investment will be available for liquidation.  No matter the technology behind it, investors must clearly understand what they are investing in and how the investment works. Cryptocurrency investing presents a unique opportunity to invest in technology and companies that will disrupt many industries and has the potential to generate significant returns for investors. Just like any disruptive and technology-based asset, investors need to be prepared for extreme volatility, periods of low or negative returns, and make sure that their exposure to these speculative investments is appropriate for their desired risk. With crypto, doing your own research is key to keeping you and your money safe.

42421110,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSpR,1664397315,Why Would Anyone Take a College Course on Urbit?,"The problem with teaching crypto in a university setting is your lesson plans can quickly become out of date almost the moment you write them, Neal Davis, a professor on leave from the University of Illinois, said. That’s probably true for most things in tech.  “The problem that crypto education faces is that it's a very fast-moving field and things are going to rot very quickly,” Davis said. Still, if academia wants to have any relevance at all within this fast-emerging industry, it needs to find ways to stay up-to-date.  This interview is part of CoinDesk's ""Education Week.""  “You know, go build a DALL-E [AI-generated digital art platform] course – Stable Diffusion is everywhere,” he added, referring to the artificial intelligence tools that were announced last month. Davis might also add Urbit, the controversial computer infrastructure platform, to that list.  And indeed, he did. In 2020, Davis became the first U.S. professor to teach a computer science class dedicated to Urbit. Urbit is a wildly ambitious attempt to rebuild the internet from the ground up.  Unlike the server-client paradigm that dominates modern computing, Urbit uses public key cryptography to enable anyone to run their own servers. If decentralized finance (DeFi) is removing middlemen from finance, Urbit wants to remove middlemen from anything you can do with a computer, from email to logins.  The system, under active development since 2013 by the San Francisco-based organization Tlon, has seen an accelerated pace of activity in recent years. Its developer pool now counts hundreds of coders, and Tlon’s leadership and other Urbit ecosystem startups are now directly targeting DeFi projects and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to use their software offerings.  See also: DAOs Are the Real Meritocracies | Opinion  That said, Urbit is still very much a niche interest. But Davis said there is value for students to learn an entirely new way of computing. “Hoon is only useful on Urbit,” he said, referring to the network’s bespoke programming language, as are other concepts and tools on Urbit. (Davis is on sabbatical from the University of Illinois to work to work full time teaching “Hoon School” through the Urbit Foundation.)  “Some of those will no doubt prove extremely fruitful and others pointless, but the trial is well worth the effort,” he said. “It's for the tinkerers and hackers, it's for the freethinkers and the poets.”  And what Davis’ eight graduate students learned two years ago is likely still relevant. Not only is Urbit challenging the for-profit, proprietary software model pioneered in the valley, but it’s also taking a deliberately slow approach to network design to ensure the system remains stable. Urbit’s core software releases count backwards to zero, at which point the “kernel” will reach absolute zero and be frozen in time.  CoinDesk recently sat down with Davis and talked about other experimental computing models, how decentralized tools could be changing academia and the months to come for Urbit. A lightly edited transcript of the conversation follows.  What initially attracted you to Urbit?  I've always been a collector of computational curiosities, I suppose. The margins of computing from the very early days onward. The early computers that were in Base 10, not binary. Soviet “water computers.” Analog computing has a long and very interesting history. So I've always been compelled by many of the alternative paths that computing could have taken. The things that could have been and the things that may yet be have a lot to teach us about the way that computing works. Some of these things are languages like APL [A Programming Language] or competing architectures like the Mill architecture, which is an alternative chip design – an alternative CPU. And, of course, Web3 and the like have developed many very interesting proposals.  ​​I had encountered Urbit around 2016, shortly after it was leaked to the public. Probably on social media [Editor's note: Hacker News]. I gave it a shot, tried to make things work and as it turns out at that time unless you knew someone at Tlon you probably weren't gonna be able to figure out the project. The docs were to a large degree inside baseball – by Tlon developers for Tlon developers – which makes sense because it wasn’t yet voiced to the broader world.  And so I tried it for a couple days, then set it down and moved on. And then sometime in mid 2019 Tlon announced that they were going to do the Hoon School [to teach Urbit’s native functional programming language]. So I signed up for that, and then started digging into the system. It turns out there's all sorts of very intriguing ideas. They're building things like Kelvin versioning: The idea that you're drawing your system towards some sort of crystalline – if not perfection, then – stasis.  See also: Autodidacts, Welcome!  Urbit is more of a specification than an operating system, in some sense. And while the computing paradigm is not completely unique across the way that we do things – like subscription driven computing – it's moderately uncommon in broader computing, web front ends, SSE [server-sent event] streams, and these sorts of things. This was an area in the late 1970s and 1980s that, to some extent, never bore fruit. And it turns out that actually we built a system that uses something like “dataflow computing,” as they would have recognized it back then.  But there's a lot of other parts of the system that most people never really dig into – the memory model [the Loom] is very innovative, a very interesting way of handling persistent and transient memory. In a way that solves some of the issues that you have with conventional operating system paging paradigms and so forth. It’s like discovering a door that you didn't know was there. There's a whole house behind this door, and it’s much stranger and more intriguing than you may have thought.  Where does teaching Urbit fit into the paradigm of computer science education?  When the grad committee [of the University of Illinois] approved the class in 2020, I felt a little bit like the dog that caught the car and had to figure out what to do with it. What I ended up building – the structure of that grad seminar – was trying to take a technical and critical look at what Urbit was attempting as an operating platform. How well does it implement this idea? Are there broader lessons or applications that we can gain from examining this arcane structure, or how it’s being built?  I was trying to expose them to the edge of the strange and interesting things [in computing] that populate everything around you, but most of the time you don't notice? Developers are enculturated into a certain way of approaching computing, and very few people step very far outside of that standard way of doing things.  But there's a lot of things that are untenable about continuing down the current road. I mean, one of the common criticisms that [Urbit creator Curtis] Yarvin and others have made is that the software stack from top to bottom has become illegible.  There's an anecdote about the MIT [computer science] department, which used to teach everything from the structure and interpretation of computer programs in [the early programming language] Lisp to the things that were happening on the metal [Editor's note: computing hardware, including chips]. And at some point later on, they switched to Python (because all the libraries were in Python) when the stack had become illegible enough. Some of this is on the hardware side or because increasingly convoluted optimizations made it hard for you to see what's happening in the actual execution.  You may be writing something that you think is straightforward, but because it passes through different layers of libraries and interpreters and operating systems and handlers, you don't actually know what this is gonna look like by the time it gets to the chip. And so it's easy to lose touch with the concrete, fundamental ground of computer science. Computer science is wonderful because it's this marriage of these extremely abstract highfalutin ideas about mathematics and the physics of pushing bits around a wafer of silicon.  What’s your take on the world of cryptocurrency – is there CS innovation happening there worth studying at a university?  So to start at the end, I don't know what the course situation looks like at this point. The problem that crypto education faces is that it's a very fast-moving field and things are going to rot very quickly.  There are probably certain technologies that could stay up to date on. Like if you're learning [Ethereum programming language] Solidity, Solidity doesn't evolve very fast as a language. You can talk about the EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] architecture – but Ethereum is just switching to proof-of-stake and this changes some aspects of the ways that we think about the blockchain as a distributed virtual machine.  It’s like discovering a door that you didn't know was there. There's a whole house behind this door, and it’s much stranger and more intriguing than you may have thought.  There are a lot of small projects that have some uptake and some interesting ideas. And maybe these interesting ideas will make their way into other blockchains or maybe they'll be forgotten. So you have this problem of writing a course on blockchain and Web3 technologies that would actually be helpful. If you found a book on Ethereum from 2018, how much value would that help you today?  It might be more of a historical curiosity.  Stepping further back: The roots of blockchains are actually in Bell Labs in the late 1980s, when Scott Stornetta was working on the almost theological problem of memory. The way he phrased it was “can one man make a witness of the truth against the world in such a way that the entire world cannot conspire to overcome it?” That’s a very interesting question. And I don't know that he succeeded in that original sense but there’s still a company, Surety, that publishes a hash using their system in the New York Times every week.  See also: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: Where In the World Is the Most Research Being Produced?  But sometimes experiments are worth running, even if they don’t get anywhere. Satoshi Nakamoto took the blockchain idea and coupled it with a distributed consensus algorithm that actually made it viable to do in a distributed way. Like Urbit [IDs] bitcoin is pseudonymous; it's not really an anonymous set of transactions like zcash, there are persistent and public identities [like a blockchain address]. But it's enough to set off this whole revolution in the way that we're thinking about what kinds of knowledge should be publicly available.  So are they worth studying? I think what blockchain related technologies really accomplished was a complete parallax shift that many have not grappled with yet, in the ways that a lot of things that were formerly open only to governments have now been pushed to the protocol layer. Like, in a sense, fiscal policy matters less and less every passing year as more and more things move to decentralized finance chains. You can argue whether this is pragmatic or useful, but what we're getting with blockchain is a way that's fundamentally reordering human knowledge and human modes of communication. In a way it’s fulfilling what the internet started – the telos of fully distributed computing. So there's all these interesting, technical details that are worth trying out and worth studying.  So what’s the university's role in that world?  That's both a political question and a meta-political question. There's a pragmatic question of how universities will react in the near to medium term to the explosion of distributed [everything]. One thing that's happened in this regard is that they have, I think, expanded their credentialing. They have a monopoly on credentialing in most countries in the world. There's been a lot of moves towards things like making college free for everyone or expanding the number of professional degrees offered. It started with the MBA, but there are a lot of others now – Master's of Engineering, Master's of Professional Administration, Master's of Administration. They definitely have a strong edge over most upstarts [Editor's note: like soulbound tokens] to the extent that they want to continue to be powerful, large, relevant bodies.  I also think they should be taking seriously the idea of putting a lot of their endowment into cryptocurrency – the serious ones with a chance of being around in 1,000 years. Universities have been around for as long, so it's a safe bet that they'll figure out a way to still be around.  See also: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  There's a lot of steps that institutions seemingly should be averse to, that are the right move ultimately, when talking about how the internet reorganized access to information. MIT’s OpenCourseWare is 21 years old now – they put essentially all of their science and engineering content online for free. The effect was not to depress the value of college education. It buoyed MIT, because it was MIT saying, “we have the best content in the world and we're willing to show you how good it is.”  Any advice for professors interested in running a course like you did?  So I would strongly encourage professors to find the time to build new classes on technologies they find interesting. I picked Urbit as my platform because I find it interesting, but there's a zillion platforms that are being built and evolving rapidly.  The academy tends to be late to things, when the material is three or four years old and the world has moved on. There should be a lot more experimentation, particularly using the grad and undergrad seminar framework that most universities have, that don't require as much bureaucratic overhead. Build these things, get them out there. I encourage them to make their courses public, because that's going to be a big boost for them professionally by showing they’re working on interesting things that are active and relevant. You know, go build a DALL-E [AI-generated digital art platform] course – Stable Diffusion is everywhere. But I doubt it’ll actually make it into many classes this semester.

A Terraform spokesperson claimed that its luna cryptocurrency wasn’t a security, meaning it wasn’t covered by South Korea’s capital markets law.  “We believe that this case has become highly politicized, and that the actions of the Korean prosecutors demonstrate unfairness and a failure to uphold basic rights guaranteed under Korean law,” the spokesman said.  Luna and its associated algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD collapsed in value in May, causing thousands of investors to lose billions of dollars.  Earlier this week, Interpol reportedly issued an international arrest request known as a red notice for Kwon. The spokesman who wrote to the Wall Street Journal declined to identify Kwon's location, citing ""ongoing physical security risks to him and his family"" and noting there have been attempts to break into his residences in South Korea and Singapore.  Kwon has yet to issue a statement via Twitter, but in prior tweets he has maintained that Terraform Labs is defending itself in multiple jurisdictions.

Facebook alone takes in a quarter of all U.S. online ad spending, he said.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.  “A creator can have millions of followers and billions of views but, still, social media platforms get the majority of that benefit,” Dwek said.

Via a partnership with e-learning platform Invisible College, it is looking to combine online education with the use of the internet as a way to enable “any individual to learn that you can make a living off the internet,” said Dwek.  The trend has been growing widely on social media, and creators are becoming aware the audiences they build on social media platforms can lead to other business ventures, according to Dwek. “It shouldn’t just be the biggest creators in the world.”  Headquartered in Singapore, Nas Company is looking to widen that access for creators including those “interested in marketing, operations, partnerships or want to get into the space to be an investor or part of the ecosystem.” It is gearing its efforts across different media rather than only focusing on developers, according to Dwek.

42422242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jGRh,1664393400,Native USDC on Cosmos to Fill Vacuum Left by Terra’s UST Stablecoin,"The collapse of Terra in May left a vacuum in the Cosmos ecosystem, where Terra’s UST stablecoin – which was algorithmically pegged to the U.S. dollar – was used heavily across Cosmos’ interconnected family of blockchains. Now, with the help of the stablecoin issuer Circle, Cosmos is replacing code with collateral.  Circle said on Wednesday that it plans to launch its USD coin (USDC) stablecoin – the second-largest dollar-backed stablecoin by market capitalization – natively on Cosmos in early 2023. The announcement came alongside news that Circle would begin issuing USDC natively on four other ecosystems in addition to Cosmos.  Cosmos’s fledgling decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem previously relied on the promise of Do Kwon’s digital dollar, and the algorithm that supposedly backed it, to build up its on-chain lending, borrowing and exchange markets. When UST came crashing down, its role was assumed by various different stable currencies – the most popular being wrapped USDC, a synthetic version of the centralized USDC stablecoin issued on the Ethereum blockchain – but these alternatives didn’t offer the same security to users that a natively issued stablecoin could.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  There’s currently $18 million wrapped USDC sitting in liquidity pools on the Osmosis blockchain, which is home to the Cosmos ecosystem’s largest decentralized exchange.  Each wrapped USDC token was initially minted on Ethereum to represent $1 in Circle’s treasury. Moving those tokens from Ethereum to Cosmos today means using a cross-chain bridge – a kind of technology that locks up tokens on one chain and reissues them on another.  “When it’s wrapped tokens, you're ultimately trusting the security of the bridge and the security of that intermediary,” Jelena Djuric, ecosystem lead at Cosmos research and development shop Informal Systems, told CoinDesk. “It's gone through all of these hoops to get to this wrapped point.”  Cross-chain bridges have fallen prey to numerous multi-million dollar hacks – the most recent being the $190 million Nomad bridge attack, which rendered some wrapped tokens on Cosmos and other ecosystems virtually useless.  Eliminating the blockchain bridge risk  Starting in early 2023, Circle will begin minting a version of its dollar-backed currency directly onto its own Cosmos blockchain.  From there, other Cosmos chains, like Osmosis and the upcoming dYdX chain, will be able to use USDC sans bridge, so long as they enable Cosmos’s inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) – software that allows independent Cosmos chains to send assets back and forth.  The news this past June that dYdX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, would be moving to a standalone Cosmos blockchain was evidence that Cosmos – and its vision for interoperable, “sovereign” app-chains – is beginning to breach the mainstream. But as the Cosmos ecosystem matures, its embrace of fully collateralized stablecoins suggests it is no longer aiming to do so with fully decentralized money at its core.  DYdX’s move from Ethereum to Cosmos may have even played some role in expediting Circle’s Cosmos expansion plans.  “[DYdX] are actually the largest consumer of USDC in the crypto market, because all of their perpetual swaps or future contracts are actually held up in USDC until that contract is triggered,” explained Djuric. “I think [dYdX] just trusted that because there's so much organic demand for their platform and thus, by extension, demand for USDC, [USDC issuance] was just like a natural kind of thing that they knew they would have to focus on.”     CORRECTION (Sept. 28, 19:42 UTC): The USDC token will be issued onto its own Cosmos-based blockchain.

Circle also unveiled a tool called Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol to enhance USDC transactions between different blockchains.  The firm disclosed the plan Wednesday at its Converge22 conference in San Francisco.  According to a statement, USDC will begin to circulate on the Arbitrum One, NEAR, Optimism and Polkadot chains by the end of this year, with plans to enter the Cosmos ecosystem sometime in early 2023.  Circle’s expansion comes as competition among stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a government-issued currency such as the U.S. dollar – is heating up. Stablecoins are a $150 billion asset class within cryptocurrencies and serve as an important bridge between traditional finance and the crypto space for transactions and trading. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin of its kind and is widely used on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.  Read more: How Does USDC Work?  USDC’s market position, however, is being challenged. It has lost considerable market share recently and its circulating supply has dropped to $49 billion from $55 billion since August. A slew of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are crafting or have already issued their own native stablecoins, while rival top issuers Tether and crypto exchange Binance both stepped up to expand their own stablecoins, USDT and BUSD, respectively.  Circle aims to bolster USDC’s availability across crypto networks, according to Joao Reginatto, Circle’s vice president of product.  “Extending multi-chain support for USDC opens the door for institutions, exchanges, developers and more to innovate and have easier access to a trusted and stable digital dollar,” Reginatto said in a statement.  As a result of the expansion, USDC will be available on 14 blockchains, having been issued previously on Algorand, Avalanche, Ethereum, Flow, Hedera, Polygon, Solana, Stellar and Tron. Its main rival, the $68 billion USDT, circulates on 13 chains and looks to expand to Polygon, according to Tether's website.  The transfer protocol will work via a mint-and-burn mechanism and be facilitated by bridging contracts. When someone sends USDC from one chain to another, the tool will destroy (burn) the transferred amount on the original chain and create (mint) the same amount on the destination chain.  The tool will debut on the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains first, then will expand to the rest of the chains where USDC circulates.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, students can take a mandated or extracurricular part of their fall 2022 curriculum in Circle's courses, on such topics as Bitcoin and blockchain technology, Ethereum and tokenization, and Web3 and applications. Also, students with excellent academic performance may get earlier access to apply for Circle internships and employment.  The new program is part of Circle Impact, the company’s initiative to improve financial inclusion and economic prosperity. Earlier this year it cooperated with Bowie State University in Maryland and Rhodes University in South Africa to offer a module in digital financial literacy for business students as part of the spring 2022 semester.  “Launching Circle U in partnership with these esteemed academic institutions is a step toward helping to provide equitable access to education that can equip students with the necessary knowledge to become sophisticated actors and builders in this industry,” Mercina Tillemann Perez, vice president of Circle Impact, said in the release.

CCIP will enable SWIFT messages to instruct on-chain token transfers, helping the interbank network to be able to communicate across all blockchain environments.  This will help accelerate the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) blockchains and benefit various institutions across capital markets, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said at the SmartCon 2022 conference in New York City on Wednesday.  SWIFT’s Strategy Director Jonathan Ehrenfeld Solé said that one of the reasons working with Chainlink on CCIP has been successful is that there is “undeniable interest” in crypto from institutional investors. Traditional finance (TradFi) players want access to various digital and traditional assets on one network that can connect different types of asset classes, Solé said.  The partnership between Chainlink and SWIFT in cross-chain interoperability will help bridge the gap between traditional and digital assets for TradFi institutions, he added.

42411720,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfWqn,1664389950,The Quick and Comprehensive Guide to Blockchain for Corporate Executives,"If billion-dollar corporate investments are anything to go by, blockchain is one of the most promising technologies of the century. While it may seem difficult to understand at first, blockchain technology can be easy to grasp with the right approach, even for those who consider themselves not “tech-savvy.”  More than three-quarters of executives around the world think blockchain-based assets will be a ""strong alternative to or replacement for"" fiat in the next five to 10 years, according to audit firm Deloitte’s 2021 Global Blockchain Survey.  This article is part of Education Week. Read CoinDesk's third annual Best Universities for Blockchain Ranking.  But blockchain offers more than financial assets like cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Companies also use it in supply chains, credential verification and ticket issuance.  The decision to explore and invest in blockchain “could prove as valuable as capitalizing on the internet 20 years ago across many industries. The incumbents who scoffed at the internet quickly became market laggards,” Zachary Schwartzman, blockchain investor and former Internet Analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CoinDesk.  Here’s our guide to make sure you understand the real-world applications of the technology and how it can benefit your company.  Understand enterprise blockchain and its applications  First things first: Get up to speed with the basics of blockchains. Next, start to unpack what blockchain can offer for your business.  Patrick McCorry, a researcher at blockchain developer tool provider Infura, told CoinDesk that it’s crucial for everyone interested in blockchain to understand that blockchain is a “cryptographic audit trail that allows anyone to compute a copy of the database.”  So maybe think of blockchain – a system of digital ledger – as a more complex, secure and interactive version of Excel. That’s why it’s so useful for payments; it’s just a matter of change in balances on the database ($10 less for you, $10 more for me). But there are also other uses, as companies around the world adopt it for their purposes.  “While in many ways still in its infancy, blockchain technology has already demonstrated some real-world use cases for corporations and enterprises. In the payments and supply chain management spaces, for example, digital ledgers provide powerful means for decentralized tracking around the globe or creating shared databases to better record and monitor transactions in real-time,” Steve Bassi, co-founder and CEO of PolySwarm, told CoinDesk. PolySwarm is a decentralized, crowdsourced threat-intelligence-security provider.  Brendan Playford, co-founder of Masa Finance, a decentralized financial data platform, told CoinDesk that one important use case for blockchains lies in helping “the end-to-end tracking and product-verification, from the manufacturing floor all the way to the consumer, ensuring both quality control and authentication.”  The real-world applications of that kind of tracking and authentication of products are easy to envision. For instance, a consortium of luxury brands including LVNM, Prada and Cartier has already launched a consortium blockchain to tackle counterfeit goods. Even whiskey and watch brands are leveraging blockchain to fight fakes.  That all said, another equally important question your company needs to ask is …  Do you really need blockchain solutions?  It’s nice to experiment with innovations and apply new shiny technological solutions. But don’t make the mistake of creating imaginary problems that blockchain can solve. Or deciding that it’s necessary to migrate something to the blockchain just to “get on the blockchain” when current processes are working well.  Jae Yang, CEO and founder of compliance software company Tacen, told CoinDesk that blockchain could be useful as it eliminates the need for trusting counterparties. But, he said, “most companies don’t really need blockchains. It depends on whether there could be a high probability over the dispute of records, such as land titles or loan agreements.”  For businesses that regularly deal with those issues, when a dispute arises the blockchain will already have everything related to it on record, eliminating the need for going through terms and bureaucracy.  “For supply chain questions, if it’s all vertically integrated at your company, then what’s the point of having a blockchain-based system here? There has to be an incentive here. If it’s just a few parties you’re dealing with along the supply chain, then maybe you don’t need a blockchain,” he suggests.  Decide whether to prioritize decentralization  If you’ve decided that a blockchain solution will truly benefit your company, the next thing to figure out is what to prioritize in that solution.  The main consideration here is usually to decide if decentralization or efficiency is more important, as one often comes at the expense of the other. This prioritization is one reason why some companies choose to utilize a private, consortium or hybrid model of blockchain.  You can read more about the pros and cons of each here: What are the four types of blockchains?  “The issue facing companies more and more now is the blockchain trilemma – decentralization, throughput and security. Right now public blockchains haven’t fully solved for the trilemma, so companies that want to incorporate some form of blockchain-based supply chain management system or payments system are going to have to make some compromises,” Jack Saracco, co-founder and chief business development officer of digital bank Ping, told CoinDesk.  Some companies prefer decentralization, Saracco explained, but many others naturally want to prioritize high performance that results in greater throughput. Other companies want to avoid solutions involving high fees and slow transaction times. Finally, some companies need to preserve private data on the blockchain and so will need to sacrifice decentralization in favor of security.  Once you’ve figured out your priorities, you can make a blockchain choice – and no, you don’t need to build it yourself.  You don’t need to build your own blockchain  Companies like proprietary software. Although private custom-made blockchains were briefly popular among companies in the last decade, there’s been a shift to embracing public blockchains.  “There was a time when you saw a lot of public companies trying to manage supply chain issues using permissioned – or private – blockchains, and that push sort of faded away,” Masa Finance’s Playford told CoinDesk. “Increasingly, it has become clear that public blockchains are close to providing the necessary trustless infrastructure and transaction efficiency necessary for enabling enterprise applications.”  Ismael Fleing, co-founder of luxury conglomerate Arity, told CoinDesk that the blockchain industry has “an excellent mindset of collaboration,” and his company chose to collaborate with a technical partner. “There is already progress made by a lot of companies on this technology; you don't have to build your own blockchain to be able to use its benefits. … That's what we did with Everledger; they focused on the making of the technology and helped us understand the technicalities of the blockchain so that we could focus our ideas.” Arity uses blockchain to provide traceability and to show customers the stories behind their unique pieces of jewelry, immortalizing them on the blockchain.  Find and promote technically minded employees  Who should be the blockchain person at your company?  Schwartzman suggests that companies “elevate the smartest technical employee who has spent their weekends learning about crypto economics and various implementations of permissionless chains (i.e., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Starkware, etc.) to their senior management teams.” This is because blockchain – and the crypto industry at large – takes serious time to grasp, and those already committed to it will be the most appropriate employees for this task.  Composability of data enabled by permissionless blockchains like Ethereum and layer 2, or companion, blockchains will offer the most business value derived from blockchain technology, Schwartzman believes. “Therefore, technical executives should spend time learning about permissionless blockchains,” he told CoinDesk. “I could be wrong, but I have yet to see permissioned blockchains marketed for enterprises and championed by external consultants drive business value that a shared database couldn’t.”  Get your hands dirty  How should you – or your designated employees – go about learning more about the blockchain? Nothing beats practical experience.  “Do stuff. Create a wallet, burn ETH, mint stuff and live on Twitter, Discord and Reddit,” Dimitri Tsamados, a technology growth company expert and partner at Eric Salmon & Partners, told CoinDesk. He also recommends a blockchain course, like the one offered for free by the University of Nicosia. Companies could also benefit from incubators like Outlier, he said.  For aspiring startup builders, there’s plenty of high-quality resources available. Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has made course videos from its Crypto Startup School 2020 available to all.  The industry lives both on the blockchain but also in many conferences around the world, where companies can make connections and learn more about the industry. McCorry suggests attending at least one conference. The connections and ideas that come out of in-person panels, roundtables and casual conversations amongst attendees are invaluable for any executive who wants to understand not only the technology but the culture and energy in cryptocurrency and blockchain.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/the-quick-and-comprehensive-guide-to-blockchain-for-corporate-executives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f472e47deac65d4d805677ec8ad478c21b183ce6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411719,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfWu6,1664389886,How to Teach Yourself Blockchain: A Guide for Budding Builders,"A new form of the internet called Web3 is being built right in front of our eyes. It’s being built on permissionless blockchains where anyone can deploy a smart contract they’ve written. Indeed, some of the greatest developers in this nascent industry are anonymous people – no college degree or corporate work experience is required here.  Perhaps you’re already a Web3 user, participate in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), vibe in non-fungible token (NFT) communities and trade crypto. You’ve seen what it’s like and now want to take a step further to help build better stuff – you want to be a builder, or a dev (short for developer).  This article is part of Education Week. Read CoinDesk's third annual Best Universities for Blockchain Ranking.  The other great thing about Web3 is that it welcomes autodidacts – those who eschew formal courses or training and learn on their own by doing. If you’re interested in becoming a blockchain dev, everything you need to get started is available online.  To help you get started, we’ve asked developers, teachers and learners for their best tips.  See Also: Autodidacts, Welcome!  Understand what blockchain is and does  Start with the fundamentals and understand what blockchain is, and what it can do – also importantly, what it can’t do.  “I think it's important for everyone to realize that at the heart of a cryptocurrency there is a single database – account balances, smart contract code, etc. – and a ‘blockchain’ is just a cryptographic audit trail that allows anyone to compute a copy of the database,” Patrick McCorry, researcher at blockchain tool developer Infura, told CoinDesk.  McCorry started a cryptocurrency course “because there are bystanders who are willing to make the jump into our space, but they are lacking the mental models and wider context on how the technology works.” The course is sponsored by his employer Infura and is available for free.  CoinDesk also has articles to help get you started:  What Is Blockchain Technology?  How Blocks Are Added to a Blockchain  Other top-notch resources include UC Berkley’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) school with plenty of free online material, including this YouTube video that lays out the basics.  Familiarize yourself with blockchain peculiarities  Now that you understand what blockchain is, your next move should be figuring out the unique but crucial stuff related to this technology – stuff that you may not be familiar with from Web2, the internet dominated by companies like Meta and Google.  “Understanding concepts like wallets, blockchain explorer, blockchain oracles and more that don't exist in a Web2 architecture are a crucial part to get involved in the blockchain,” Francesco Ciulla, a developer who helps others learn Web3, told CoinDesk.  The best way to learn about them may be just trying them out yourself. Here’s CoinDesk’s guide on how to choose and set up your first crypto wallet to get you started.  Get started with coding  It’s possible to be a builder in crypto with no prior coding experience. But most devs suggest that you grasp the fundamentals of Javascript before jumping onto crypto’s most popular language, Solidity.  Austin Griffith, who works for the Ethereum Foundation helping new devs, says the best way to learn is to start with Javascript and Website Development. There are myriad free resources available online for both.  Next, you can move into Ethereum development using Griffith’s SpeedRunEthereum. But for those who don’t want to speed-run things, he also has a slow curriculum “that takes you through becoming a power user and learning to script before learning to build apps,” he said.  “I think after someone crushes the speed run it's all about exploring the ecosystem and getting in the routine of shipping small prototypes publicly,” Griffith added.  Ciulla, who has recently switched from Web2 to Web3, wrote a step-by-step guide on how he made the transition and highly recommends at least one JavaScript course to get some basics before getting started with an introductory course about Solidity.  ChainShot, recently acquired by blockchain tool developer Alchemy, offers an online bootcamp to help you fast-track your Ethereum developer journey. There are also self-paced courses to learn all the basics of Ethereum and build simple DeFi protocols, and they are all free.  If you really don’t want to learn how to code but still want to build, there are options we’ll cover later.  Build in public  Blockchains are systems of public and decentralized ledgers (Ethereum and Bitcoin are two prime examples), and emphasis on open source, collaboration and transparency defines the blockchain culture. There are private and other types of blockchains but the majority are public, and it’s where you should focus when you start building.  Building in public by launching projects for everyone to see and contributing to other open-source projects is not only aligned with the ethos, it’s also a good step to accelerate learning.  “The space is big and it moves fast. Things are really decentralized too. Iterating in public is a good combo move for a builder to explore new things, see what they are good at, and see what things actually resonate with users,” Griffith said.  For his part, Ciulla has kept a GitHub Repository of everything he’s learned from day one.  Learn from those building in public  Konrad Kopp, developer of wallet security protocol Signet, taught himself how to code through online resources and an in-person ChainShot bootcamp. He told CoinDesk that what excites him most about building in Web3 is the inherent transparency of blockchains and the open-source nature of work – and that can be immensely useful.  “It’s super easy to actually look at other people's code base and play around with them yourself to see how exactly they work,” Kopp said. “And this code is not just projects by random people or tutorials but actual code used in production by the biggest Web3 companies and protocols.”  How does decentralized exchange Uniswap work, technically? Exactly like this. What’s the code logic of lending protocol Aave? You can see it right here.  When you’re stuck while learning, you can look at examples that exist and already process billions of dollars in DeFi. “I think by far the best way that I’ve found for learning to code is to pick something you want to build out and just go for it. Break it down into components and build them as much as you can by yourself and where you can’t, try to find code that does something similar and that you can take apart and play around with,” Kopp said.  And when you have a particular coding question, just go to online developer forum Stack Overflow like all developers. Though it’s a smart move to first Google your question since it’s likely been asked – and answered – before.  Join a community of developers  Learning passively from others by reviewing their code isn’t your only option. You can also try joining a community of like-minded individuals striving toward the same goal of becoming better devs.  Popular developer DAOs include LearnWeb3, Developer DAO, Odyssey DAO and Women Build Web3.  If you don’t want to code but still want to build …  Don’t fret.  Maybe you’re an artist who doesn’t want to get into coding just to launch an NFT collection and build a community around it. You still have options in Web3.  Bueno is a no-code NFT launch platform developed by artist Pablo Stanley.  And if you don’t want to learn how to interact with blockchain explorers like EtherScan, then you can use Formie that turns any smart contract into human-readable forms.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-teach-yourself-blockchain-a-guide-for-budding-builders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9e95f9f66243c9bed5bec27bf32e76acc6eebcf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Ethereum Merge has been a long-awaited upgrade of the digital framework of the world&apos;s second-biggest cryptocurrency that an inefficient energy-sapping system has long been plagued by. By swapping proof-of-work (PoW) for proof-of-stake (PoS), a seriously difficult and time-consuming task like a digital version of switching the engine of a car, Ethereum has now achieved energy efficiency and can class itself as one of the few environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies that now consumes around 99.9% less energy. To put this into perspective, this transformation is equal to the country of Finland closing down its national power grid, according to Digiconomist.

This type of marketing has been around for many years, but it has only recently been adapted to the cryptocurrency industry. There are many benefits to cryptocurrency network marketing, including the ability to make money without having to invest any money upfront. Additionally, this type of marketing allows you to get involved with an industry that is growing very rapidly. If you are looking for a way to make money that does not require a lot of risk or investment, then cryptocurrency network marketing may be the perfect opportunity for you. How do cryptocurrency networks work? Cryptocurrency networks are decentralized, which means they aren&apos;t subject to government or financial institution control. Transactions are instead verified by a network of computers, called nodes, that all have a copy of the cryptocurrency&apos;s transaction history. When someone wants to make a transaction using tron, for instance, they broadcast it to the network. Nodes then verify the transaction - usually through a process called mining - and add it to the blockchain. The blockchain is a public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions that have ever been made. Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or removed.

42411355,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIJK,1664383495,The Problem Tornado Cash Raises About Base Layer Censorship on Ethereum,"On an otherwise quiet day last month, the crypto industry woke up to big news – the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added 45 public Ethereum addresses to the sanctions blacklist, including addresses where the Tornado Cash byte code, or smart contract, was stored, potentially rendering interactions with those addresses a violation of law. Up to this point, all addresses included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) had been wallets purportedly belonging to known “bad actors,” making the Tornado Cash sanctions an unprecedented expansion of sanctions law.  In essence, Tornado Cash is a mixer that decouples the sender and recipient of crypto to protect users’ privacy in an otherwise public network. But “Tornado Cash” is not a company or an entity; it’s a decentralized, immutable, non-custodial smart contract. Therefore, industry participants were quick to argue that OFAC overstepped its authority when it added a smart contract address to the SDN List, given that its statutory power is limited to sanctioning “persons” or “entities” – and a smart contract is clearly neither. A recent lawsuit also makes clear the catastrophic implications that the Tornado Cash sanctions had for a variety of actors, including people who are trying to preserve their privacy while making donations to Ukraine.  Rodrigo Seira is crypto counsel at Paradigm. Amy Aixi Zhang is policy counsel at Paradigm.  But the most pernicious result of the OFAC sanctions is they have the potential to be misinterpreted by “base layer” participants – which includes validators and other actors such as builders, pool operators, relays, searchers and sequencers – as requiring the censorship of blocks involving sanctioned addresses. This basically means that base layer participants would either exclude any sanctioned addresses in blocks they propose, or refuse to attest to any blocks that include such sanctioned addresses. Either action could result in the respective network becoming censored by default or “forking” into two incompatible versions.  Simply put, this is not the right way to interpret the law. Crypto’s “base layer” is not legally required to monitor or censor blocks involving addresses on the SDN List in order to comply with sanctions just as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that enables the transfer and interoperability of email would not be responsible for monitoring spam or illegal activity.  See also: In Crypto, Base Layer Security Isn't Enough - CoinDesk | Opinion  Sanctions are a legitimate tool of the U.S. government, and OFAC, the regulator tasked with enforcing sanctions, has broad statutory authority to which U.S. courts have historically deferred. But the function of crypto’s base layer – publicly recording the order of data blocks – does not entail the type of financial transactions and other activities that are prohibited by sanctions. Critically, sanctions require U.S. persons to employ compliance programs that are “risk based” and tailored to the specific activities in question, not to completely shut down all activity if there is a chance of a sanctions violation.  When OFAC designates a party to the SDN List, U.S. persons are prohibited from transacting with them and required to “block” their property. However, crypto’s base layer is not transacting with sanctioned parties – whether a transaction is confirmed on a blockchain network depends on the broader, global network consensus, regardless of the actions of any individual participant.  Crypto’s base layer participants are also not able to “block” the property of a sanctioned party in the manner that a bank can freeze an account. At no point is any base layer participant in “possession or control” of property of a sanctioned person. Therefore, censorship as applied to crypto’s base layer amounts to an inability to report a transaction; not an ability to “block” it.  See also: Crypto Donations Are About More Than Censorship-Resistance | Opinion  Sanctions also prohibit U.S. persons from “facilitating” transactions with designated parties, including providing “services” to such parties. OFAC has applied these prohibitions broadly when a U.S. person “assists” or “supports” transactions involving sanctioned parties. Nonetheless, construing the actions of crypto’s base layer as “facilitating” transactions or providing “services” would be at odds with prior OFAC regulations and enforcement history.  The public recording of the order of data blocks by crypto’s base layer is no more “facilitating” a transaction with sanctioned parties or providing “services” than the existing communications infrastructure that routes financial messages daily around the world, whether through internet service providers, routers, network switches, email and chat programs, and other network protocols.  Read more: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky | Opinion  OFAC regulations have also stated that “facilitating” does not include activities that are of a purely clerical or reporting nature, which is the core function of crypto’s base layer. Further, the fact that crypto’s base layer infrastructure has been decentralized by distributing basic functions to independent participants makes each individual actor’s actions even less likely to meet this threshold.  OFAC’s recently released FAQs on Tornado seem to support our interpretation of the scope of compliance obligations by focusing on transactions between parties sending digital assets to sanctioned addresses, as opposed to the activities of the base layer. They state that “interacting with open-source code itself, in a way that does not involve a prohibited transaction with Tornado Cash, is not prohibited.”  Requiring the base layer to censor blocks would be an unwarranted expansion of sanctions law. It would also be counterproductive and potentially harm national security interests, which is contrary to both OFAC’s stated goals and U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent executive order. The requirement to censor blocks under the threat of sanctions liability is likely to lead many participants of crypto’s base layer, including important on- and off-ramps, to go offshore. This would limit the U.S.’s ability to influence the development of the technology and result in U.S. regulators having less visibility into transactions.  Censorship at the base layer would also undermine the utility of blockchain technology. Like the telephone network, crypto’s base layer is at its core a communications protocol and part of the technological infrastructure that should be considered a public good. Its key function – publicly recording the order of data blocks – is similar to the role we expect the core internet infrastructure (like TCP/IP) to play, to freely and accurately disseminate information through the network. To maintain its utility, crypto’s base layer must also maintain its neutrality and lack of bias.  Our more extensive analysis on this topic can be found here.

42411361,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIZr,1664381311,Why Is the Dollar Crushing Global Currencies if Inflation Is so Bad?,"While the declining domestic buying power of a dollar dominates headlines in the United States, American inflation is having a surprising impact around the globe: Nearly every major currency has fallen dramatically against the dollar over the past six months. That seems like a challenge to the relentless focus on monetary supply that is widespread among cryptocurrency adherents.  China’s yuan has lost 12% against the dollar since April, and traditionally stronger currencies including the euro and yen have seen similar drops. Controversial financial decisions by new U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss have driven the British pound down even more sharply in recent days, for a cumulative 18% drop since April.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These moves may be particularly surprising for those whose financial thinking has been shaped by discussions in cryptocurrency circles. You might argue the tail has wagged the dog on crypto’s understanding of inflation: Bitcoin’s fixed supply has been aggressively marketed as a long-term inflation hedge, leading to an emphasis on so-called monetary inflation. Monetary inflation occurs when more monetary units compete for the same amount of real-world goods, driving prices up. Or, as a coronavirus pandemic-era meme elegantly simplified it, “money printer go brrrrr.”  But if the money supply were the beginning and end of the American inflation story, the dollar should be losing value against world currencies. The U.S., after all, had the second-largest fiscal response to the COVID-19 crisis of any industrialized nation, much of it debt financed. But if America has been borrowing and printing more money than Japan or China, shouldn’t the yen and yuan be gaining relative value on global markets?  Answering this seeming conundrum points to a more nuanced view of inflation than bitcoiners’ Austrian Economics-driven monetarism on several levels. Data from the Economic Policy institute shows that inflation has been similar worldwide over the past year-plus, with little correlation to either pandemic spending or post-pandemic recovery as measured by unemployment levels.  See also: US Inflation Data Could Test Bitcoin's Rally  Based on that data, EPI argues that supply chain disruptions, rising commodity costs and shifting consumption patterns are more to blame for inflation than the money printer. That is, the problem isn’t too much money but too few goods, in the wrong place.  Flight to safety  Meanwhile, what’s directly hammering dollar exchange rates is a more technical second-order impact of rising prices in the U.S. As Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve raise interest rates to fight domestic inflation, American dollars and Treasury instruments become far more attractive investments. That’s part of why U.S. stocks are dropping, and the same dynamic is encouraging investors worldwide to swap from yen, euros, pounds and yuan into dollars to reap the 4% low-risk yield on the two-year Treasury bond.  That’s where a third factor enters the explanation – and one with serious lessons for those thinking about finance in crypto.  There are other currencies offering much bigger bond yields than the U.S. – Turkey’s two-year yield is over 13%, for instance. But as depositors in LUNA’s Anchor protocol found out when that system collapsed in May, yield ain’t nothin’ but a number. Thirteen percent on Turkish lira is still a hard sell versus 4% on U.S. dollars because of the greater global faith in the fundamental productivity of the U.S. economy, and the responsible management of the U.S. currency.  While U.S. dollar bonds are considered to bear near-zero risk of default, bondholders of countries with either wobbly real economies or questionable financial leadership must add the risk of default into their calculus.  The current looming fear of a global recession only accentuates that dynamic: Even in the absence of inflation and U.S. rate hikes, we would probably be seeing greater dollar strength merely as a function of the “flight to quality” that consistently follows economic uncertainty.  See also: Bitcoin and Today's Wicked Inflation Share a Common Ancestor | Opinion  This is a vital take-home for an industry and investors fundamentally oriented around building new currencies. The bull market saw a lot of competition to offer depositors the highest percentage return, often in manufactured tokens like LUNA, CEL or MIM. But those tokens, not entirely unlike the lira or now even the pound, were built on shifting, uncertain foundations by leaders who were not trusted by close observers.  Those deep and holistic structural weaknesses, not merely their numerical supply, was ultimately what led to collapse. When the going gets truly rough, in other words, faith in a currency may have more to do with quality than quantity.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42373700,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUtcp,1664379388,EU Set to Ban Russian Crypto Payments After ‘Sham’ Referenda,"The European Union will tighten restrictions on Russians’ crypto investments within the bloc as it seeks to respond to “sham” independence votes being held in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, CoinDesk has been told.  A previous cap of crypto holdings of 10,000 euros ($9,600) will be scrapped, a person briefed on the sanctions package told CoinDesk, potentially meaning Russians won’t be able to hold any assets in EU crypto wallets.  In April, the EU announced that it would restrict Russian payments to European crypto wallets to 10,000 euros as it sought to stop digital assets being used to bypass restrictions on large bank transfers. The new measures mean that figure could now be reduced to zero.  “The sham referenda organized in the territories that Russia occupied are an illegal attempt to grab land and to change international borders by force,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Wednesday, following votes held over the last five days in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  Von der Leyen announced a price cap on Russian oil, a ban on exporting aviation items and electronic components and restrictions on importing Russian goods that she said would deprive the country of seven billion euros.  Full details of the package have not yet been published, as they are still subject to agreement by EU member states.

Tribe Capital, Defy, Exor, Stratos, Framework, Morgan Creek Digital and SiriusPoint participated in the round, alongside a number of angel investors.  Built on the Avalanche blockchain, Re’s protocol allows retail investors and cryptocurrency holders a way of backing insurance policies. The reinsurer works with underwriting teams, known as syndicates, to evaluate the financial merits of insurance programs brought to the protocol, it said.  “We’re building a decentralized global insurance transaction layer that settles any kind of insurance risk in a way that’s transparent to regulators, partners and investors,” CEO Karn Saroya said in a statement.  Re has assessed more than $300 million in potential premium from insurance programs, it said, and will use the new funding to expand its reinsurance underwriting pipeline. The company is looking for underwriters and actuaries to apply for syndicate roles on the protocol, and has already appointed Joe Gaito and Jason Hoffman of Freedom Re Underwriters as its first independent syndicate.  David Hampson, former CEO of Willis Programs – a unit of global insurance broker Willis Group Holdings – has joined the company as a strategic adviser and independent board member, Re said.  “For members who provide capital, they earn uncorrelated yields that are comparable to high yield fixed income,” Saroya said.

42421092,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSXt,1664378088,Tron Founder Justin Sun Thinks Crypto Could Learn Something From TradFi,"PARIS — Justin Sun, founder of the blockchain network Tron, said he traded in his T-shirts and flip-flops for crisp suits in an effort to look more responsible, just like the folks from traditional finance.  “We need to learn from traditional finance,” Sun said during a recent interview with CoinDesk in Paris, where he was attending the Binance Blockchain Week conference. “We want our 100 million customers to know that we really take their money and their data seriously.”  After a market crash where crypto prices have fallen and some big industry players filed for bankruptcy, TradFi now has reason to boast of the merits of legal safeguards that don’t exist in crypto.  In this environment, Sun has been arguing over the last few months that his algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, is safe. An algorithmic stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that has its price pegged to another asset like the U.S. dollar by a pre-programmed mechanism or “algorithm” that balances supply with demand. Sun launched USDD just days before a similar U.S. dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, terraUSD (UST), collapsed.  Stablecoin strategy  Sun brushed aside fears that a UST-like collapse could hit Tron’s stablecoin. He cited to CoinDesk USDD’s slower-growth model as a reason for it being comparatively secure. He also pointed out the stablecoin is more transparent because the website USDD.io allows users to check the stated reserves and collateralized rates backing USDD.  “At the time, UST had an $18 billion market cap and a trading volume of only $100 million, which is very fragile,” Sun said, referring to the Terra collapse in May. USDD is “very healthy” by comparison, he said.  And unlike Terra, Sun said he can also act as a backstop for USDD, ensuring the peg remains stable with his own funds if need be. “We only have a $700 million market cap but right now our daily trading volume is already above $100 million,” Sun said. “In the future we will gradually increase the market cap of USDD based on volume and adoption.”  USDD had a market cap of around $739 million and a 24-hour trading volume of around $76.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap data at press time.  Sun told CoinDesk he is a big believer in the adoption of stablecoins.  “Most talk about cryptocurrency as full of volatility and its only use case is trading,” Sun said. “But stablecoins offer lots of use cases like payment settlements, and so I want to spend a lot of my time pushing the stablecoin agenda.”  Read More: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Fork Stumbles as Justin Sun's Poloniex Supports Rival Fork",NEUTRAL,USDD,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDD,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/28/tron-founder-justin-sun-thinks-crypto-could-learn-something-from-tradfi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b65ee1a1c1f12f85c85f36e75fa2660148a79b3a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The BIS is an association of 61 central banks from around the world and has innovation hubs set up in multiple locations focused on exploring the applications of new financial technologies including CBDCs, which are digital versions of countries' sovereign currencies.

Project Icebreaker will test near-instant retail CBDC payments across borders at lower costs. A final report on the project is expected in the first quarter of 2023.

The startup also announced a $10 million investment from DIGITAL, an investment firm backed by Steve Cohen. The hedge fund billionaire owns the New York Mets baseball team, oversees Point72 Asset Management and has invested in crypto since 2018.  Web3 game assets are typically non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to take items like weapons and armor into the ecosystems of other games. The AQUA marketplace provides a community-driven place for players to buy and sell those assets.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  The blockchain-agnostic AQUA marketplace will highlight featured games and already has partnerships with three titles, including God’s Unchained and Guild of Guardians. New titles will be added every month.  “You can definitely go to OpenSea or a general purpose marketplace and purchase gaming assets,” AQUA CEO Sean Ryan said during an interview with CoinDesk. “But we want gamers who are interested in, ‘How do I play this game? What do I do with these assets? How do I find other people to play with?’”  AQUA was founded by gaming industry veterans Ryan, who formerly headed games partnerships at Facebook, and John Cahil.

42373699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUtgb,1664373566,Blockchain Data Provider Chainlink Launches Programs to Reduce Costs Ahead of Staking of Its Token,"Chainlink, a provider of price feeds and other data to blockchains, is reducing the network’s barriers to entry for early-stage projects and reducing costs for existing participants ahead of the introduction of staking of its native token at the end of this year, the company said at this week’s SmartCon developer event held in New York  The smart contract oracle network that powers much of decentralized finance (DeFi) is offering a “Build” program where up-and-coming teams donate 3% to 5% of their native tokens to the network in return for access to Chainlink data. And for those already initiated, the “Scale” program aims to reduce on-chain transaction costs associated with smart contract oracles to near zero.  Chainlink has been a key factor in the roller-coaster growth of DeFi, which reached over $250 billion in total locked value (TVL) late last year, but currently languishes at around $55 billion thanks to harsh bear market conditions. Yet, some crypto market watchers have observed a disconnect between Chainlink’s role as a cornerstone of DeFi (its oracles have played a part in over $6 trillion of transactions so far this year, according to Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov), and the market cap of its native token LINK.  The Chainlink community hopes any disparity can be addressed by its new programs, as well as the introduction of LINK staking and rewards. Chainlink staking is slated to get underway in December, according to Nazarov.  Regarding the ongoing crypto winter and DeFi’s resilience within it, Nazarov said TVL is down because of the drop in value of underlying assets, but usage remains high.  “The economic activity in DeFi is still at a very high level,” Nazarov said in an interview. “It's actually the same as it was before and in a certain way crypto might even be more attractive because the scarier the world gets, the more attractive crypto is.”  Read more: Galaxy Digital Offers Crypto Price Data on Chain Via Chainlink",POSITIVE,LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/28/blockchain-data-provider-chainlink-launches-programs-to-reduce-costs-ahead-of-staking-of-its-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e14e8aa5f44c4d90d1f39a9f79e6c76cbf3678a9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Traditional markets were reacting to the Bank of England’s surprise plan to buy bonds.  Market Moves: Bitcoin has outperformed traditional markets in recent days for several reasons, including the absence of large sellers.  Chart of the Day: The options markets point to signs of a deeper sell-off in bitcoin.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  After breaking above $20,000 on Tuesday, bitcoin (BTC) has lost ground again and is trading at around $18,500. Still, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is up over the past seven days. Analysts aren’t citing any true catalyst for Wednesday's decline yet.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures and European indexes are dropping, indicating another painful day. This follows the S&P 500’s hitting a two-year low on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, the Bank of England said it will buy bonds to stop the spread of a financial crisis. This move caused an immediate reaction for bond prices in the U.K. The pound rallied, but remained slightly lower against the dollar on the day.  The rest of the crypto market was mostly trading in the red, erasing Tuesday’s gains. Cosmos’ ATOM was down 10%, Algorand fell 7%, and the token for the Near protocol dropped 6%.  In the news, cryptocurrency lender Nexo acquired a minority stake in Summit National Bank, a financial institution regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

It was also announced that the Bahamas-based crypto exchange is moving its U.S. headquarters to Miami, only four months after cutting the ribbon on its headquarters in Chicago.

Market Moves  Bitcoin Steady Under $20K in Face of Traditional-Market Turmoil, Here's Why  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin has outperformed almost every traditional asset in recent days. Observers said the cryptocurrency has stayed resilient in the face of renewed turmoil in traditional markets for several reasons, including the absence of large sellers, continued holding by long-term investors and quarterly options expiry.  Since the Federal Reserve raised U.S. borrowing costs by 75 basis points a week ago, the dollar index has rallied 4% while the S&P 500 has dropped by 6.4% and the British pound has crashed to an all-time low against the greenback. Bitcoin, however, has remained locked between $18,000 and $20,000.  ""I think what we're seeing is more a lack of large sellers, rather than a plethora of large buyers,"" Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder of digital assets investment platform Eaglebrook Advisors, said. ""There are no large sellers left. Forced selling has already occurred.""  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  U.S. Long Bonds Offer 4% Yield  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's six-month put-call skew continues to climb, indicating persistent demand for downside protection, even as the cryptocurrency remains resilient in the face of traditional market turmoil.  The put-call skew measures the richness of puts relative to calls.

42373707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUto9,1664371848,Bitcoin Off Lows as Bank of England's Bond Market Intervention Raises Hopes for Fed Pivot,"Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from daily lows after the Bank of England (BOE) said it will take steps to address the liquidity crunch in the government bond market.  The announcement raised hopes that central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, are nearing their pain threshold concerning the market turmoil and might soon abandon the policy tightening that has roiled crypto and traditional assets this year.  The BOE on Wednesday morning said it will begin to buy long-dated gilts in unlimited quantities starting on Wednesday to stabilize the U.K.'s bond market, which has recently turned volatile on concerns that the government's plan to cut taxes will put its finances on an unsustainable path. The bank also said it was suspending planned bond sales under its quantitative-tightening program.  Bitcoin bounced from its daily low of $18,550 to reach $19,100 following the BOE's intervention. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.K. government bond fell by 28 basis points to 4.12%, and the pound slipped nearly 1% to $1.06.  Bond purchases are typically associated with quantitative easing (QE), whereby central banks freely conjure money out of thin air by creating reserves on their balance sheet and then use those new reserves to snap up securities from the open market, thereby injecting cash into the system.  The BOE, Fed, and other major central banks poured billions of dollars into the financial system via QE in the aftermath of the coronavirus-induced crash of 2020, triggering an unprecedented bull run in crypto and traditional markets. Now, however, rampant inflation has forced those central banks to reverse course, sending asset markets across the spectrum sharply lower in 2022. Bitcoin has plunged to less than $20,000 from just shy of $70,000 late in 2021.  While the BOE's latest pledge to buy unlimited long-duration bonds looks like a new bout of QE, the bank has made it clear that the move is only a temporary one mainly aimed at restoring orderly conditions. It's promised to unwind the purchases once the market stabilizes. Meanwhile, some in the crypto community wonder whether the Fed will follow suit.  For now, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – at least publicly – showed little concern, saying late Tuesday that financial markets were functioning well and claiming to see no signs of liquidity worries.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/28/bitcoin-off-lows-as-bank-of-englands-bond-market-intervention-raises-hopes-for-fed-pivot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/392f35470f4c38d4a247bb9780d8c8a3a3396497-1710x840.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUtaJ,1664371136,Bank of England Deputy Governor Says Existing Financial Regulations Should Extend to Crypto,"Financial regulations should be extended to crypto before the industry becomes large enough to potentially threaten broader financial stability, according to Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England.  Cunliffe has previously said that regulators should accelerate efforts to establish clear rules for crypto. The crypto market turned heads when it reached nearly $3 trillion in market capitalization last year.  But “the greater impact on the financial system may well come from the transfer of technologies developed in the crypto world to the ‘real’ world,” Cunliffe said in London Wednesday at the Operations, Post Trade, Technology and Innovation Conference, which was organized by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe.  The promise that this technology can make operations faster and more streamlined has prompted the traditional financial sector to experiment with it, he added. Several years ago, London-based bank HSBC said it was “investing in and developing this technology because it helps to improve efficiency.”  While Cunliffe listed a range of opportunities that the distributed ledger technology (DLT) and smart contracts that underlie crypto could bring to traditional asset trading, he said that doesn't mean regulators should wait to regulate the crypto industry.  “Regulators need to begin extending existing standards and regulatory regimes to crypto before, not after it becomes systemically important,” Cunliffe said. “And done carefully, the development of regulatory regimes helps, not hinders, innovation by reducing the risks of confidence destroying crashes and by giving innovators a framework within which to innovate.”  The crypto markets tumbled from their peak last year to $927 billion as of Wednesday after a series of crypto firms such as stablecoin issuer Terra collapsed earlier this year.  The U.K. already has some plans in motion to supervise the growth of crypto and distributed ledger technology, including a regulatory sandbox it plans to run next year that will let companies test blockchain-based financial services.  Read more: UK Crypto Industry Welcomes New Stablecoin Rules, Awaits Guidance  Opportunities and risks  Cunliffe highlighted the opportunities of using DLT technology for trade and post-trade settlements, which encapsulates all the processes that follow a trade. For instance, DLT allows both equities and debt instruments to be combined in a single ledger to facilitate instant trades. Smart contracts, which are can be programmed to execute different functions, offer “the potential to add layers of additional functionality and features,” Cunliffe said.  “But recognizing the opportunity does not mean that we should ignore the risks, any more than we ignore the risks in the existing structures,” Cunliffe said.  The resiliency of DLT-based systems in wider applications has yet to be determined because “the technology most widely used in existing cryptocurrencies cannot simply be copied and pasted for wide scale use in capital markets,” the deputy governor said.  Instantaneous settlements would also take away the window for error before a trade is completed, which could end up worsening systemic risk, Cunliffe said. Another obstacle is figuring out how the technology would allow interactions between platforms, something the Bank for International Settlements, an organization of central banks, has been exploring since 2020.  To combat these risks, Cunliffe implored both local and international regulators to do more to help regulate the sector.  Given the “cross-border nature of many financial infrastructure services,” there is a role for international standard setters to play in setting up the appropriate norms, Cunliffe said.

The capital will go toward building out the first flagship product, Backpack, a wallet for executable non-fungible tokens (xNFT).  NFTs are typically digital assets such as an image or song where an underlying smart contract proves the uniqueness of that asset. With xNFTs, the user owns the right to execute some type of tokenized computer code – essentially, the user owns the right to launch an application. The ability to launch multiple types of apps in one place could simplify onboarding, a common pain point in the crypto industry.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Explaining the purpose of xNFTs, Coral founder Armani Ferrante traces decentralized ownership from smart contracts to their resulting protocols and then up to the user interface (UI) layer such as applications and websites, which largely remain centralized. Backpack aims to decentralize the UI layer, starting with a wallet.  “We can move from smart contracts, go up the stack to the UI layer, where we can have decentralized ownership of code and provide all the developer tooling to make that happen,” Ferrante told CoinDesk in an interview, noting that the tooling includes smart contracts and the necessary app store. “Backpack serves as the native system, analogous to the iPhone, that allows people to use and interact with all of these applications in a native and secure way.”  Other participants in the round included Multicoin Capital, Anagram and K5 Global, among others.  Backpack will launch into private beta on Sept. 26. About 10 of the largest projects on Solana already have projects in development using Backpack’s xNFT technology, including NFT marketplace Magic Eden, cross-chain bridge Wormhole, decentralized finance protocol Solend and the developer framework Anchor, which Coral also created.

The company hopes the partnership will help “DeFi users and developers access and build upon reliable institutional-quality market data,” Flowdesk said in a Wednesday press release.  The two entities will use Flowdesk’s trading infrastructure to provide crypto trading pairs data to Pyth’s oracle tool. Pyth's specialized oracle solution sources crypto-related market data originating off-chain and streams it for smart contracts.  “This aligns with our mission to bring the best of crypto finance to our clients, always putting their interests first, with the highest level of transparency, compliance and ethics,” Flowdesk CEO Guilhem Chaumont said in the press release.  Pyth’s network of over 65 trading firms, market makers and exchanges publishes data directly on-chain to the network. The information is then aggregated and made available for both on-chain and off-chain users.  Pyth is currently publishing data for nearly 90 price feeds across asset classes. This information will soon be available on different blockchains via the Wormhole cross-chain messaging protocol.  “Flowdesk has established itself as a top player in trading infrastructure, particularly for crypto, which makes them a fantastic partner for Pyth, a project we believe to be at the core of DeFi infrastructure going forward,” said Stephen Kaminsky, special projects at Jump Crypto.  Both Pyth Network and Wormhole, another Jump-backed infrastructure project, announced last week that they will be launching on Aptos, a layer 1 blockchain protocol founded last year by two ex-Meta employees.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING | PYTH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/28/market-maker-flowdesk-to-join-with-jump-backed-pyth-network-to-improve-access-to-blockchain-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54621a055859c64fa4c7f495f8e589eb6f6bf544-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Running on the network at total capacity, it will open up many opportunities to tokenize anything from real-world assets to fan tokens natively on the Layer 1 blockchain without fees. IOTA&apos;s Shimmer Network Introduced in 2021, the Shimmer Network is a staging network of the IOTA blockchain. It is a Layer-1 innovation network that will eventually increase incompatible virtual assets. Like IOTA, Shimmer is also a DAG-grounded correlated settlement layer with higher L2 anchoring capacity. It will serve as a free base layer and bridge for innovators to produce new, cutting-edge inventions. The Stardust module is the project&apos;s focal point. It enables the development of smart contracts and the opportunity to execute NFTs and other forms of tokenization. The Shimmer Network may, in the future, choose to anchor DeFi apps. The SMR coin will offer monetary benefits for using the Shimmer Network upon its introduction. It is still uncertain whether SMR will be quickly accessible for trade in other markets. IOTA: An Alternative To Blockchain IOTA is an internet of things ledger built on the Directed Acyclic Graph Tangle technology (DAG).

The investigation is related to a February 2021 complaint filed by regulators in India's eastern city of Kolkata against Aamir Khan, the app's creator, and others.  Earlier this month, the ED searched six locations and recovered more than $2 million in cash at Khan's residence.  The agency alleges that Khan and others launched E-Nuggets to collect money from the public in return for rewards on commissions but said Khan stopped withdrawals suddenly on different pretexts before he wiped out all data from the app's servers, including profile information.  Khan was transferring some of the money overseas via a cryptocurrency exchange, according to the ED. One dummy account was supposedly opened on Indian exchange WazirX, from where crypto purchased was then transferred to an account in Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange. A balance of as many as 77.6 bitcoins worth roughly $1.5 million has been frozen in that Binance account.  “The transparent nature of blockchain means that the transactions are publicly available and traceable – which is not an option with traditional financial transactions,"" Binance said in a statement to CoinDesk. ""Every day, Binance assists a large number of law enforcement investigations to detect criminal activities. We can confirm that Binance froze the funds at the request of the Enforcement Directorate. It’s our position to cooperate fully and collaboratively with all legally valid requests and inquiries.""  Khan's whereabouts and contact information weren't immediately known.  WazirX didn't immediately return requests for comment.  India's ED has been conducting several search operations related to an ""illegal loan apps"" scam with China links.

42373692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUtXn,1664366378,ECB Official Defends Amazon’s Role in Testing a Digital Euro,"A European Union official defended the bloc's decision to give Amazon (AMZN) a prime role in testing a digital euro.  The U.S. retail giant was one of five companies selected by the European Central Bank to develop a user interface for a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) earlier this month, ahead of a September 2023 decision over whether to actually issue a digital euro.  “The prototyping experiments for the front end are driven by technological considerations,” Jürgen Schaaf, an adviser to ECB senior management on payment issues, said Wednesday in a panel discussion in London that was hosted by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe. “The companies that have been chosen for that five were the most appropriate in terms of the needs that we have for technological tests and experiments.”  Read more: ECB Picks Amazon, Nexi, 3 More to Prototype Digital Euro Apps  Amazon, which will look into the use of CBDC’s in e-commerce, is the only non-EU company included among the five selected. Others include payment companies Nexi and Worldline, Spain’s CaixaBank (CABK), and the European Payments Initiative, a consortium of euro-area banks.  The results of the prototypes won’t automatically feed into the subsequent experimental phase, Schaaf said, suggesting Amazon won’t continue to have favored access.  Ensuring Europe’s resilience and autonomy is one of the stated goals of the digital euro, in a payments market that is dominated by non-European companies like Visa and Mastercard. Schaaf cited the risks if financial sanctions imposed from abroad put the brakes on the EU economy by limiting transactions, but said he didn't want to see a ""political"" exclusion of U.S. companies.  “Our wish to strengthen our monetary autonomy with a digital euro does not mean that Europe would shut down all its gates for retailers from abroad,” Schaaf said. “There’s no protectionist intention behind that.”  The EU is one of a number of jurisdictions across the world contemplating a CBDC, and if agreed to, the digital euro could be issued in 2026.

42393761,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmUB,1664364600,Stanford Proposal for Reversible Ethereum Transactions Divides Crypto Community,"A group of Stanford University blockchain researchers divided the crypto community last week with a research proposal that would entertain the possibility of creating reversible transactions on Ethereum.  The proposal was welcomed by those who believe crypto’s status quo – where theft is rampant and a typo can cost you $36 million – poses barriers to mainstream adoption. But it was panned by others for its suggestion that a “decentralized set of judges” should be used to arbitrate transaction disputes.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Implicit in the proposal was a question: In an industry where the next $100 million theft is an inevitability, does protecting users require compromising on core principles?  A key tenet of blockchains like Ethereum is the concept of immutability – the idea that transactions cannot be reversed once they are finalized. Immutability is heralded as an important feature for cryptocurrencies because it curtails the ability of banks, governments and other central authorities to come in and alter a chain’s ledger.  But immutability can also be a major user-experience bummer: If you get scammed, are the victim of a hack or just screw up and send funds to the wrong address, you have zero recourse to recover your losses.  In terms of on-chain thefts, the Stanford researchers noted in their paper that “in 2020, $7.8 billion was stolen, and in 2021 that amount doubled to $14 billion.” According to these researchers, “Had there been a way to reverse the offending transaction(s) – as in traditional finance – the damage could have been greatly reduced.”  But not everyone is convinced.  A modest proposal?  Ethereum builders tend to create new tokens by writing code that follows certain predefined standards. These standards act like templates; developers can clone a token template, change a couple of parameters and build out a brand-new cryptocurrency that is automatically compatible with most mainstream Ethereum apps.  Read more: What Is the ERC-20 Token Standard?  The Stanford proposal extends the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards used by most Ethereum-based currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The new standards, ERC-20R and ERC-721R, would allow for transactions to be wound back if they are disputed within a brief window of time.  “Within the short dispute period, a sender can request to reverse a transaction by convincing a decentralized set of judges to first freeze the disputed assets, and then later convincing them to reverse the transaction,” the researchers explained in their paper.  When one of the researchers, Kaili Wang, posted a tweet thread describing the proposal, she set off a firestorm across Crypto Twitter.  On the critical end, it was the mention of a “decentralized set of judges” that seemed to strike a nerve with the largest number of tweeters.  Many contended that a system like the one proposed in the paper simply wouldn’t work. “Decentralized court systems using your proposed justice model already exist (e.g., Kleros) and unfortunately they are rife with corruption [...] astroturfing and manipulation by founders or early token holders,” tweeted FatMan, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth with a large following.  Others thought the involvement of human judges undermined the entire point of decentralized finance (DeFi), where code is supposed to remove the requirement that transactions be “permissioned” by central authorities.  “All comes back to whether we want permissioned or permissionless defi,” tweeted Evgeny Gaevoy, the CEO of the crypto market maker Wintermute. “In my opinion, permissioned defi is an oxymoron. Might as well get back to databases run by legacy banks.”  “Recent events haven't changed my opinion on that at all,” added Gaevoy, whose company lost $160 million to an exploit earlier this month after losing $15 million to a separate exploit back in June.  In addition to raising some technical nit-picks, Luke Youngblood, the co-founder of the decentralized finance firm Lunar Labs, framed his criticism of the proposal through a regulatory lens. “It also creates a regulatory/censorship choke point where governments and other regulators can potentially reverse crypto transactions, so it violates the censorship resistance and immutability that blockchains offer,” he said in a message to CoinDesk.  Setting the record straight  The researchers noted in email correspondence with CoinDesk they were surprised by the level of engagement their paper received. “It is just early-stage research,” they said.  “The intention was to have a constructive discussion of this approach to preventing theft,” they continued. “This work is certainly *not* a fully-fleshed [token] standard. Far from it.”  Many critics, moreover, seemed to misinterpret the proposal, according to the researchers.  “One misunderstanding, which surprised us, is that people thought the proposal is to make all transactions reversible on [a layer 1 blockchain], or to replace the regular ERC-20/721 standards,” they wrote. “This is not the case. The paper is simply a proposal for a token standard that people can use or not, just like any other token standard.”  The researchers admit, however, the challenges of designing a fair system for arbitrating transaction disputes.  “If there is no way to architect a judicial system, then this proposal will not work,” they said. “Designing a fair judicial system (or proving that one does not exist) is an open question for the community to think about.”  Even as the proposal received criticism in some corners of the crypto community, it also earned a considerable amount of support.  Emin Gün Sirer, the creator of the Avalanche blockchain, called the proposal a “Great idea” – noting that it was similar to one that he’d suggested previously and suggesting it “should be deployed more widely.”  Regarding criticism around corruptible judges, Daniel Goldman, an engineer at Ethereum scaling company Offchain Labs, noted, “Those outcrying against this seem unaware of how many widely used ERC-20 tokens today have centralized admins with *complete* power to arbitrarily rug its holders (mint, burn, freeze, etc.) and get little-to-no pushback for it.”  Goldman’s characterization of the Stanford proposal sounds almost like a “clean needles” program for permissioned DeFi. If “decentralized” finance applications already build human control levers into their products, it’d be better that those levers be clearly specified.  “They aren't talking about replacing the ERC-20 standard itself (AFAIK, nobody is); if you're not a fan of centralized/governable ERC-20s, don't use them!” Goldman tweeted. “... [H]ell, even having a ‘literally centralized’ standard would be a net win for the sake of transparency; anyone who's done the work of inspecting token contracts to figure out how centralized they are (👋) knows how tricky and annoying it is.”  Brent Xu, the founder of the blockchain Umee, took issue with the tenor of the criticism surrounding the proposal. “Considering that you guys struck a huge nerve in Crypto Twitter shows that this idea is worth exploring,” he tweeted. “The community needs to continue to explore the flaws and merits of a design before immediately casting it aside.”  Above all, the researchers suggest that before coming to conclusions people should do them the favor of reading the paper.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/28/stanford-proposal-for-reversible-ethereum-transactions-divides-crypto-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69ed6291229e61958269c6fefc9b358924b94284-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373710,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvUttB,1664363703,"Chinese Investors Could Snap Up Cryptocurrencies as Yuan Slides, Hedge Fund Says","As a bitcoin (BTC) propounder would say, the reason bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were invented – to hedge against fiat currency volatility – is upon us and now is the time to snap up digital assets.  Chinese investors may do just that, according to Patrick Tan, CEO of Novum Alpha, a quantitative digital asset trading firm with MAS-regulated funds catering to accredited and institutional investors.  ""Decades of decay look set to culminate in the probable devaluation of the Chinese yuan,"" Tan wrote in a note published Monday. ""Just as ordinary Chinese were quick to circumvent strict capital controls with cryptocurrencies, they may do so again to combat a rapidly devaluing yuan.""  The Chinese yuan (CNY) slipped to 7.2244 per U.S. dollar (USD) early Wednesday, the lowest since 2008, taking the year-to-date decline to nearly 14%, according to data sourced from charting platform TradingView.  The yuan has depreciated nearly 5% this month alone, courtesy of the growing gap between domestic and overseas interest rates. While the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are raising rates to tamp down inflation, the People's Bank of China is doing the opposite to support the economy amid cooling inflation.  ""At the time when central banks are tightening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is doing its own thing, the PBOC is not quite the same, easing monetary policy and removing the shine off the yuan,"" Tan noted.  A sudden and sharp devaluation of a fiat currency makes imports costly and often ends up importing inflation into the economy. That, in turn, reduces the monetary unit's purchasing power and weighs over consumer spending, putting downward pressure on the economy.  Crypto pundits believe decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are better than government/central bank-owned fiat currencies, as BTC's pace of supply expansion is halved every four years. Meanwhile, governments and central banks can exponentially increase the supply of fiat currency to inflate asset prices artificially. That's what the Federal Reserve and other central banks did following the coronavirus-induced crash of 2020. And the resulting money supply bubble reportedly fueled the prevailing rampant global inflation.  Market participants have long argued that the CNY slide leads to an increased flow of capital into bitcoin. As seen in the chart below, past instances of CNY weakness have coincided with BTC strength.  This time, the CNY decline is accompanied by housing market jitters, providing Chinese investors with a solid reason to seek shelter overseas via cryptocurrencies.  ""It's not just a capital flight that may motivate the Chinese to take up cryptocurrencies against a rapidly sliding yuan, it's the potential collapse of confidence in an asset that most Chinese have only known to go up – real estate,"" Tan said. He added that real estate forms the bulk of familial and generational wealth in China.  House prices in China have been falling since the property giant Evergrande Group said a year ago its cash flow was under pressure. Home buyers are now occupying unfinished properties, according to Reuters.  Per Tan, China has yet to experience a real estate bubble burst, which could trigger a flight to safety. ""If and when it happens [bubble bursts], the possible flight to other assets could involve cryptocurrencies in some way as well,"" Tan noted.  Note that the potential flow of capital into cryptocurrencies could be aimed at merely moving money overseas without using a traditional banking channel.

The XTZ price action displays growth in bearish influence over the short-term consolidation range between the $1.39 and $1.68 marks.

The registration is mandatory for all companies looking to provide digital asset custody and trading services, including ""buying or selling digital assets in legal tender"" in the country.  ""Crypto.com was subject to rigorous review, particularly around anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, in order to receive regulatory approval,"" the announcement said. The exchange has recently secured in-principle approvals in Singapore and Dubai, as well as registration approvals in the U.K., Italy and South Korea.  France is becoming a go-to location in the European Union for crypto companies. In early September, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao called Paris ""the financial hub for crypto in Europe.""  In recent months, cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Luno have also registered with France's AMF. Luno's parent company, Digital Currency Group, is also the parent of CoinDesk.

Speaking at the Token 2049 conference in Singapore, Novogratz appeared to play down some of the more serious accusations leveled at Terraform Labs’ co-founder Do Kwon, who is being sought by South Korean authorities on allegations of fraud. The authorities are also looking to freeze tens of millions of his assets. Galaxy Digital was an investor in the project and Novogratz is keeping a tattoo of the luna cryptocurrency as a mark of humility.  Novogratz pointed out that everything Kwon and Terraform Labs built was public, given the nature of blockchain technology.  “It’s not like he was hiding how it worked,” he said. “There were other things in crypto I was more frustrated with, like Three Arrows Capital,” Novogratz said, referring to the failed crypto investment fund now being managed by court appointed liquidators. “Celsius, that was irresponsible,” he said. Celsius Networks’ CEO Alex Mashinsky resigned Tuesday as the company faces claims on its assets from creditor groups.  Novogratz also said that despite the bear market in crypto, and his belief that the traditional economy is on the precipice of a 2008-style collapse led by the bond market, there are still bull-market vibes at the conference in Singapore.  “Everyone is at the conference having fun, but they don’t know the world is collapsing,” he said.

The digital version of a euro should be ""borderless"" and it should be ""regulated and properly supervised"" Lagarde said, responding to a question while speaking at the Atlantic Council's Frankfurt Forum on U.S.-European GeoEconomics on Wednesday.  ""But it can facilitate cross-border payments in a big way, which is why between the United States authorities, the European authorities and others beyond that, we need to compare notes,"" Lagarde said.  The ECB is halfway through a two-year investigation into a digital euro for retail payments, and although it has yet to make a decision on issuing one, the EU Commission responsible for proposing new legislation, is preparing a digital euro bill. The ECB has also picked five payments providers to work on prototypes for digital euro apps.  Although Lagarde did not directly address the implications of a digital euro potentially being adopted by a country as an official currency – in the same way that El Salvador and Ecuador use the U.S. dollar – the ECB has previously addressed the risks of currency substitution associated with a digital euro when used beyond EU borders.  ""Similar design features would have to be applied to the use of a digital euro by non-residents. This would stop a digital euro replacing other forms of investment and facilitating currency substitution in countries outside the euro area,"" Fabio Panetta, an ECB executive board member, said in a 2021 speech. ""In any event, international cooperation on design, cross-border use and interoperability would be key to reap the potential benefits of CBDCs for cross-border payments, while addressing risks to the international financial system.""  Responding to a question on why EU residents would be interested in a digital euro when digital payments are already widespread in the bloc – where cash usage is on the decline – Lagarde reiterated the ECB's stance that a central bank digital currency should be something the ECB should be ready to make available if people want it.

Over the past day, ADA moved down by 0.6%, indicating that the altcoin was rangebound. In the past week, Cardano price has depreciated by 3%. The bulls had helped the coin to soar close to the $0.46 level as demand for the coin returned briefly on the chart. There has been rigid resistance to the altcoin at the $0.48 price mark. The technical outlook of the Cardano price has remained bearish as selling strength mounted on the chart. The support zone for the coin stood between $0.44 and $0.40 on the chart. If buying strength returns, the coin may try to move close to $0.46 before attempting $0.48. At the present time, ADA is trading 86% lower than its all-time high. With increased and sustained demand, ADA should be able to manage to move above $0.48, which could cause the altcoin to invalidate its bearish thesis.

42393951,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdE3F,1664358130,Is Peter Thiel’s Pro-Dropout Fellowship Mostly an Advertisement for Himself?,"This month saw a bright flare in the currently otherwise dim landscape of big tech industry deals, when design software company Adobe announced on September 15 that it would acquire competitor Figma for a whopping $20 billion. It would be the highest price ever paid for a private software company – though also the highest multiple to earnings ever paid, which has generated some skepticism among stock analysts.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.  But the sale is an unambiguous win for at least two parties: 30-year-old Dylan Field, who founded Figma in 2012, and the Thiel Fellowship, which gave Field $100,000 that year to help build the company. Field was just 19 years old at the time and, according to his application for the Thiel Fellowship (then still mostly known as the “20 Under 20” program), had recently “stopped out” of his education at Brown University.  The tech and business media are largely reporting Field’s story as vindication for the core premise of the Thiel Fellowship: That a college education is not just useless for many people, but an active hindrance. There have been other success stories for the Fellowship, not least of them Vitalik Buterin, who was awarded a Thiel Fellowship in June 2014, shortly after the release of the Ethereum white paper. Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, had dropped out of the University of Waterloo the year before to focus on developing the smart-contract network.  Despite such headline-grabbing cases, though, a deeper look at the Thiel Fellowship raises questions about its effectiveness as a model alternative to universities.  “This worked out very well for Peter Thiel,” says reporter Max Chafkin. “For the Thiel fellows, your mileage may vary.”  Chafkin is a staff reporter at Bloomberg, and also the author of “The Contrarian,” a book about Thiel’s life, career and political activism. Chafkin talked to many former Thiel fellows for the book and found that despite the Fellowship’s selection of candidates with elite backgrounds, some still felt set adrift by the program’s lack of structure and support. Chafkin’s book ultimately depicts the Thiel Fellowship as more of a public relations coup by Thiel than a sincere philanthropic effort.  Critics of the Fellowship also cite broader socio-political concerns. By seeming to validate skepticism of education, they say the Fellowship advances Thiel’s libertarian, anti-government ideology, including a longstanding opposition to providing more educational opportunities for women and people of color. The initial class of Thiel fellows that included Dylan Field was made up of 22 men and only 2 women.  Thiel’s avowed skepticism of college feeds into a growing opposition in the U.S. to public education, with potentially worrying implications for American democracy and social mobility. Former Harvard president and Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers, hardly a socialist, has called the Fellowship “a very dangerous idea.”  Read Autodidacts Welcome!  It may also, Chafkin and others warn, lead young people weighing their post-high school choices down a primrose path to failure.  Freedom to learn … or freedom from learning?  The stories of Figma and Ethereum look like an affirmation of Thiel’s core argument that, at least for some people, higher education is a waste of time. The Fellowship touts itself as the perfect option for “young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom.” Thiel himself has argued for more than a decade that the current higher education landscape is a “bubble,” with degrees sold for inflated prices on the basis of empty promises.  But looking beyond the headlines, Chafkin formed a much more nuanced impression of the actual results of the Thiel Fellowships. The successes, he concluded, were the exception rather than the rule.  “It’s very similar to the success rate of a venture capital firm,” Chafkin says. “Maybe a little bit lower."" The target success rate for venture capital-funded startups is generally one in ten. Though they're not entirely comparable, that would be a far lower success rate than traditional education, with about half of university graduates quickly landing a full-time job.  ""You have a few [Thiel Fellows who are] billionaires, and you have some people who have gone on to really successful careers,"" Chafkin says. ""And then you have people who went back to school, who had a bad experience or just decided it wasn’t for them. They kind of look at it as a weird vortex they got sucked into when they were young and misguided.”  A core flaw in the program, according to Chafkin’s reporting for “The Contrarian,” is the nearly complete lack of any supervision or training. The Thiel Fellowship is sometimes compared to early-stage venture accelerator Ycombinator, but Ycombinator is highly structured, including regular check-ins where participants report their progress. The Thiel Fellowship, at least for its first several years, had no such requirements. Access to Thiel himself was limited, and often perfunctory.  “It was, ‘Here’s a house, do your thing’,” Chafkin quotes one fellow saying.  This is particularly striking given the scope of some of the earliest fellows’ ambitions. One wanted to pursue asteroid mining and another aimed to expand the human lifespan by 300 years. Any random civilian, not to mention rocket scientists and biologists, would probably argue those goals would require years of rigorous science training.  It’s little surprise, then, that even the best results of the Thiel Fellowship have been inconsistent with Peter Thiel’s own stated ambitions in another crucial way. At his venture firm Founders Fund, Thiel famously declared that he was interested in “atoms, not bits,” and that Silicon Valley’s focus on software has meant that we “wanted flying cars … [I]nstead, we got 140 characters” (a reference to Twitter).  Yet, despite this declared mindset, the Thiel Fellowship’s biggest successes have all been in software. Thiel wanted asteroid mining … Instead, he got an updated version of Photoshop.  Even the program's single clearest benefit seems to undermine the Fellowship's core premise. According to Chafkin, “All the buzz around the program meant that Thiel Fellows could land at least a meeting with pretty much any investor or tech company.” And more than a few leveraged those meetings to secure venture capital funding for their Fellowship-backed projects.  In other words, as Chafkin writes in “The Contrarian,” the Thiel Fellowship “wasn’t an attack on a credentialing system; it was another credential.”  More damning still, the Fellowship seems parasitic on the very old-guard credentialing systems Thiel professed to oppose: A critical mass of those selected for the program over the years have been plucked from the rolls of elite universities like Stanford, Brown, MIT and Yale.  Chafkin argues that this pre-selection bias helps pump up the reputation of the Thiel Fellowship when participants are successful, but actually undermines the idea that the Fellowship itself is helping improve recipients’ outcomes.  “You have some successes that have less to do with [getting] the Thiel Fellowship, and I would put Vitalik in that category,” Chafkin says. “They wanted to give him money, and he took their money. He hasn’t been a huge part of that community, and it’s not a huge part of his entrepreneurial success story.” Crucially, Buterin conceived Ethereum before being offered the fellowship.  Even pre-selecting for elite credentials and connecting participants to venture capitalists has produced some embarrassing flameouts. In a particularly staggering example, the most recent class of Thiel Fellows, announced in January, included Ryan Park, a South Korean developer. Park was credited with creating Anchor, the decentralized finance protocol that just four months later played a key role in the collapse of the Luna system, wiping out billions of dollars of deposits, much of it from mom-and-pop retail. Luna head Do Kwon is currently an international fugitive.  That kind of spectacular, damaging failure is not new for the Thiel Fellowships. One of the first Thiel Fellows to secure venture capital funding was Andrew Hsu, a 19 year-old Stanford Ph.D dropout and putative CEO of an educational games company called Airy Labs. But Airy Labs collapsed almost immediately, with former employees alleging that it wasn’t Hsu but his parents and siblings who had actually run the company.  As one critic quite reasonably asked, “How can a child with no basic education and no business experience be expected to manage 20 employees and millions of dollars?”  The Airy Labs case was reportedly one reason the Thiel Fellowship soon pivoted to focus on recipients in their early 20s instead of those in their teens. In other words, the anti-college Thiel Fellowship has, for the majority of its existence, focused largely on candidates who had actually attended quite a bit of college.  Advertisements for himself  Given all of these inconsistencies and failures, you may find yourself asking – why exactly does the Thiel Fellowship exist?  Amazingly, according to Chafkin, it has a lot to do with two people who likely have a dim view of Thiel: writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher.  Thiel announced the Fellowship at a Techcrunch Disrupt conference shortly after the release of 2010’s “The Social Network,” a movie about the rise of Facebook written by Sorkin and directed by Fincher. Thiel’s reputation largely hinges to this day on his early investment in Facebook, but the film depicted him in the worst possible light: as uninteresting.  “In the movie, Thiel is kind of this boring, stuffed-shirt guy who makes it all happen,” says Chafkin. “Thiel especially was looking to kind of rebrand that.” Thiel was also in the midst of serious problems at Clarium, his attempt to pivot from venture capital to running a hedge fund. That partly helps explain how hastily the Thiel Fellowship was conceived – on the flight to the conference where it was announced.  The Fellowship's true goal may have been ruffling the feathers of coastal elites with anti-college rhetoric, rather than helping young people. Thiel’s rebranding strategy continued over the following decade to tap into the same cultural currents that gave us Donald Trump, who Thiel would later support in his run for U.S. president. Instead of trying to clean up his image, Thiel leaned into his more trollish tendencies, making a series of statements and actions seemingly tailored to offend conventional American values such as egalitarianism, free speech, and upward mobility.  Thiel even played this angle up in discussions of the Thiel Fellowship, declaring that “to question education is really dangerous. It is the ultimate taboo.” A taboo-breaking image also provided some cover for Thiel’s failure at Clarium – being a contrarian is certainly a more appealing rationalization of 90% losses than simply being wrong.  “I treat the Thiel Fellowship largely in that context,” says Chafkin, “As a sort of brand-building exercise for Thiel.”  Thiel would continue down that path with a series of campaigns that the right people – that is, coastal elites and media types – regarded as scandalous or absurd. Those included his legal campaign to destroy the gossip website Gawker, the aforementioned support of Trump, and his more recent backing of neoreactionary monarchist Mencius Moldbug, aka Curtis Yarvin.  Those efforts do certainly reflect Thiel’s heartfelt political commitments. Thiel was raised by conservative Christians and has been a conservative of one stripe or another his entire life – Including a youthful enthusiasm for President Richard Nixon’s invective against the social upheavals of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  But Chafkin believes these public stances also help Thiel build a platform that ultimately benefits him as a businessman. Thiel’s greatest successes have come from betting on young entrepreneurs, and he was clearly correct that a sort of paleo-libertarianism was becoming more attractive to that group – particularly to young men.  “Thiel is really good at seeing these political and cultural moments happening and capitalizing on them,” says Chafkin. “Thiel was backing [libertarian] Ron Paul for president in 2012 at the same time as the Fellowships, and I think they were connected. There was this thing happening on the internet with disaffected young people. He was basically attempting to capitalize on that, to insert his ideas into that discourse and use it to grab followers.  “He was saying, here’s an ideology, and if you really follow it all the way you can get rich too.”  As long, that is, as you let Peter Thiel hitch a ride on your coattails.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

The motivating force underpinning the launch of SAFE was “to effectively decentralize” Safe, which was previously known as Gnosis Safe.  “As a public good and fundamental infrastructure of Web3, we know that only decentralized governance can guarantee the long-term neutrality of the project. SafeDAO will foster a thriving ecosystem building on top of Safe Protocol and balance the different interests of its stakeholders,” Lukas Schor, co-founder of Safe, said.  The DAO will govern the underlying protocol, which has close to $40 billion in all its Ethereum contracts.  Historically, many DAOs conduct airdrops to distribute their governance tokens, including Uniswap, Compound, Ethereum Name Service, dYdX and, most recently, Optimism. In this instance, SAFE will be claimed.  A pre-identified group of stakeholders are eligible to claim the tokens between Sept. 28 at 11:00 CET and Dec. 27 at 12:00 CET. The stakeholders include over 43,000 Safe users, 140 plus ecosystem contributors (Safe Guardians), over 60 strategic backers, core contributors and GnosisDAO. The unclaimed tokens will be returned to the DAO’s treasury.  Some 190 million SAFE tokens (about 19% of the total supply) will be allocated to key stakeholders. “No single known entity or person holds more than 10% of the initial voting power,” the press release said.  Safe, one of the largest decentralized custody and digital asset management platforms, features a smart contract wallet that needs a minimum threshold of people to authorize a transaction before it can go through. While Safe smart contracts mostly dominate on the Ethereum blockchain, they also run on several other blockchains, such as Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Gnosis Chain, Optimism and Polygon.",POSITIVE,SAFE,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | ENS | SAFE,Sage D.

42416166,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuaZmp,1664355304,Bitcoin Steady Under $20K in Face of Traditional-Market Turmoil; Here's Why,"Bitcoin (BTC) has outperformed almost every traditional asset in recent days. Observers said the cryptocurrency has stayed resilient to renewed turmoil in traditional markets due to several factors, including the absence of large sellers, continued holding by long-term investors and quarterly options expiry.  Since the Federal Reserve raised U.S. borrowing costs by 75 basis points a week ago, the dollar index has rallied 4% while the S&P 500 has dropped by 6.4% and the British pound has crashed to an all-time low against the greenback. Bitcoin, however, has remained locked between $18,000 and $20,000.  ""I think what we're seeing is more a lack of large sellers, rather than a plethora of large buyers,"" Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder of digital assets investment platform Eaglebrook Advisors, said. ""There are no large sellers left. Forced selling has already occurred.""  Alfred said bitcoin is not structurally correlated to traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and the dollar index over long periods. That means there is no reason to keep selling the already battered cryptocurrency even as traditional markets swoon.  Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 in November and has been heading generally lower ever since. The price slid 56% in the second quarter alone as Terra collapsed, destroying billions of dollars in investor wealth.  Large market participants appear to have stopped selling, as evidenced from the relatively consistent number of bitcoin held by funds.  Data tracked by ByteTree Asset Management shows the number of coins held by the U.S. and Canadian closed-ended funds and Canadian and European exchange-traded funds (ETF) has ranged between 833,000 BTC and 842,000 BTC since mid-June.  According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, bitcoin's relative stability stems from the ""full detox of speculative interest"" and long-term investors refusing to cave in and sell in a weak macroeconomic environment.  ""The dominance of mature coins being spent has collapsed from an exuberant 8% at the height of the bull in Jan 2021, to a distribution of just 0.4% of all volumes,"" Glassnode's analysts wrote in the latest edition of the firm's weekly newsletter. ""This suggests that the cohort of investors with older coins remain steadfast, refusing to spend and exit their position at any meaningful scale.""  Glassnode defines mature coins as those that have remained dormant for at least six months.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the quarterly options expiry, due this Friday, might also be helping the cryptocurrency stay relatively resilient.  ""Ahead of the expiry, the spot price tends to be as close as possible to the max pain,"" Ardern said, adding that the max pain for bitcoin is $22,000.  The max pain is the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthlessly. According to theory, the max pain point acts as a magnet for spot prices as expiration approaches because option sellers, mostly institutions, sometimes try to push prices closer to the max pain to inflict maximum loss on options buyers.  One theory is that the recent decline in fiat currencies like the Chinese yuan, British pound and the Japanese yen may have spurred demand for bitcoin. In the past, Chinese investors have taken the crypto route to move money into overseas assets to bypass domestic regulation and currency devaluation.  While it's difficult to prove that the European investors are doing the same right now, circumstantial evidence supports the narrative.  ""Flows into digital asset investment products remained tepid last week ($8.3 million), but with some notable regional differences,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at Tagus Multi-Strategy Fund, said in a daily market update. ""North America saw $9.4 million of OUTflows, while Europe saw $15 million of INflows. Could this be the first clue to the recent resilience in crypto markets? Too soon to say.""  While bitcoin has managed to stay resilient so far, its immediate prospects remain tied to macro factors and traditional markets. In other words, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to a deeper sell-off in the S&P 500, rising yields and continued dollar liquidity squeeze.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/28/bitcoin-stays-resilient-in-face-of-traditional-market-turmoil-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e026480eb22aba3814d43779c207e0e5bf5e2d77-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416155,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuaYtT,1664352327,Ethereum Project Ribbon Finance Launches Crypto Options Exchange to Boost Growth,"SINGAPORE — Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ribbon Finance, known for its on-chain structured products, said it is launching an options exchange to boost demand for its services among savvy crypto traders.  Announced at Token 2049 in Singapore, Aevo will allow users to initially trade ether (ETH) options, with plans to launch options for bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens in the coming months.  Ribbon founder Julian Koh said he expected the options exchange to see over $100 million in daily trading volume in the next few months, adding that the Ethereum ecosystem had “gained momentum” after the Merge event earlier this month.  “With the majority of TVL in our platform coming from the Ethereum ecosystem, we have always regarded it as our home ground, and have strategically launched Aevo while the Ethereum network continues to build momentum after the Merge,” Koh told CoinDesk, using an acronym for total value locked, or the amount of crypto tied up in DeFi projects.  Ribbon locked over $75 million worth of various cryptocurrencies as of Wednesday. At its peak, in May, It held over $300 million, though the value of assets held on its platform fell as the broader market declined.  Ribbon is known in crypto circles for its Decentralized Option Vaults (DOV) product, which allows users to generate yield through different strategies that involve financial instruments such as options, derivatives and other fixed-rate crypto products.  The DOV for USD coin (USDC) on Ribbon pays some 25% in annual yields to users, compared with rates of less than 4% on lending protocols like Aave or Compound.  Crypto options trading has been a rare bright spot in the bear market, building momentum even as crypto prices have plunged, as previously reported. Some $10 billion worth of options products has been traded so far in September, data show.  Earlier this year, fund manager Darius Sit of QCP Capital called options trading the next growth driver in the crypto sector, explaining at the time that such products were much more familiar to institutional investors and that they were much more likely to use options rather than niche DeFi products to trade cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/28/ethereum-project-ribbon-finance-launches-options-exchange-to-boost-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/089af838eff727792daee455f56812c0960a1551-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416159,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuaZ8Z,1664346600,Industry Offers Cautious Welcome to EU’s Landmark Crypto Law MiCA,"The European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) could prove transformative, CoinDesk has been told, even if some in the industry wonder whether it will meet its goals of offering a single, clear rulebook for the 27-nation bloc.  MiCA would require crypto companies to register with the authorities, to hold sufficient capital to steady stablecoins and to offer clear and fair information to budding investors – and its text is, after many years, now almost finalized.  The world of crypto moves faster than legislators do, and this law has had quite the journey.  Originally designed to regulate crypto actors such as issuers and wallet providers in an era where initial coin offerings, including scams, were rife, the draft bill evolved alongside innovations in the sector.  Between conception and completion, new provisions were inserted or contemplated to deal with the defunct Facebook-backed currency project Libra, later renamed Diem; the energy use of bitcoin mining; the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFT); decentralized finance (DeFi); and algorithmic stablecoins like the now-doomed terraUSD (UST).  It’s still not settled. A draft that leaked last week was viewed by some negotiators as the final version – but, at the last minute, it was opposed for not sticking to the political deal struck at the end of June. (While negotiations are being held in secret, three sources briefed on the talks told CoinDesk that objections came from France. One of them said countries other than France were also involved, but declined to say which.)  Rosy  The law’s architects are still keen to trumpet its benefits – notably, allowing a single framework under which companies can operate across the bloc of 500 million consumers.  “Legal certainty was one of the main reasons why we need MiCA,” said Stefan Berger, the lawmaker who negotiated the law for the European Parliament, in a written interview. “We now have a legal framework that can be relied on as an investor but also as an issuer and offeror … order is created in the Wild West of the crypto world.”  By and large, the industry seems to agree with his rosy assessment. The law is overall positive, Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative, told CoinDesk in an online interview.  Having the new law “is a drastic change” from the status quo, she said, referring to “the new world after MiCA” in which the crypto community will need to “grow up” and consider legal compliance as they develop projects.  “Overall, I would say, MiCA is positive,” she added. “It’s unifying Europe, and we're going to have mostly the same rules for all service providers.”  But that high-level view masks plenty of detailed gripes. While a boon for crypto services such as wallet providers, lawmakers haven’t quite achieved their vision of legal clarity for everyone – particularly in newer areas of Web3 technology, CoinDesk was told.  “The NFTs bit [of the law] is unnecessarily complicated,” Blockchain for Europe’s Robert Kopitsch said in an online interview. “Depending on who you ask, you get a different answer, which is never a good thing.”  EU governments wanted NFTs to be exempted from the regulation entirely – but lawmakers at the European Parliament argued that, in reality, many so-called NFTs on the market were in fact traded like financial products, and capable of similar kinds of mis-selling and market abuse.  The current legal compromise means any assets issued as part of a series will likely be deemed fungible, meaning that in practice the bulk of self-proclaimed NFTs will be caught by the regulation. Worse still, it could mean individual national enforcers could take inconsistent views about whether a particular asset needs to issue a white paper.  In other areas, like caps on the use of non-euro stablecoins – introduced by governments panicking that a Libra-style payment system could usurp their own currency – the final compromise text seems to have found better favor.  The law would also see the use of many stablecoins limited to 1 million transactions per day. A compromise that would see that figure only capturing real-world payments rather than trading activity is “quite a good end result” given the even more restrictive proposals being discussed, Patrick Hansen, crypto venture adviser at Presight Capital, told CoinDesk in an online interview. That view may still change, since the scope of the cap is what prompted France's objection.  But Kopitsch argues that for stablecoins not tied to a fiat currency, the conditions attached are so arduous as to not make them worth pursuing.  “Let's assume you have a gold-pegged stablecoin, and it has to be redeemable at all times at the purchase price. That's impossible. Nobody will issue such a token,” Kopitsch said. Those passing the law “just should have been straight and said we’ll just ban anything that looks like it, instead of making it pretty much impossible to launch.”  Global impact  Compared to Markezic, Hansen is less fulsome about the impact MiCA will have – but even he reckons there will be wider global repercussions.  “I don’t think it ushers in a new era of crypto markets overall,” Hansen said, but he added that he “wouldn’t be surprised to see that piece of regulation like MiCA having a lot of influence around the world,” given the desire to avoid creating loopholes via regulatory divergence.  That view appears shared by Binance boss Changpeng Zhao, who recently characterized the law as a global standard for others to copy – and by Berger himself.  “There is a lot of international interest in MiCA coming from my U.S. colleagues,” said Berger, who recently visited New York City. “It would be desirable if in the future we had not only a European MiCA, but a global MiCA.”  Sandali Handagama contributed reporting.

42416146,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuaYPH,1664342105,S. Korean Crypto Project Klaytn Will Offer Gas Fee Rebates to Gaming Firms,"SINGAPORE — South Korean crypto project Klaytn would provide rebates on gas fee payments made by gaming companies building on its network, it said on Wednesday during the ongoing Token 2049 conference in Singapore.  Gas fees refer to payments made by users to execute blockchain-based transactions or commands. Fees on networks like Ethereum have reached over $3,000 per transaction during times of network congestion, which may push potential users away from the network toward cheaper options.  The feature addresses a crucial pain point for blockchain games in onboarding new users: The need to acquire tokens to foot gas fees before being able to play.  Under the new gas fee rebate program, selected game companies will be eligible for a 100% offset of their gas fees incurred from January 2022 onwards for up to $100,000 worth of KLAY per month. Names of these companies were not shared with CoinDesk at writing time.  The grant is derived from the Klaytn Growth Fund, a fund that invests in companies built on Klaytn and has previously committed some $20 million towards blockchain research at Asian universities.

Members of Ooki DAO – which operates a protocol that offers illegal, off-exchange tokenized margin trading and lending services – were notified of the lawsuit when a CFTC paralegal posted the complaint and other documents to an online discussion forum meant for DAO members to discuss governance issues, a CFTC attorney claimed in a court filing. The documents were simultaneously submitted through a help chat box on the DAO’s website.  The CFTC wants the District Court of the Northern District of California to approve the use of the chat bot and forum posts as proper service of the lawsuit to the defendants, which includes every voting member of the DAO.  The lawsuit, announced last week, is the first to be brought against members of a DAO by the CFTC, and could have wide-ranging consequences for DAO regulation in the future. Charges were also filed and settled against a blockchain protocol, bZeroX – which the CFTC claims operated the same service before handing over the reins to Ooki DAO – and two of its founders, who settled for a $250,000 monetary penalty.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of a Regulator-Proof Protocol  Now the pseudonymous members of Ooki DAO face their own lawsuit. The CFTC is seeking disgorgement, trading and registration bans, injunctions against further violations of the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA) and civil monetary penalties.  However, the CFTC’s inability to find a non-doxxed member of the DAO to serve the lawsuit on indicates that reaching a resolution will be more complex than it was in the case of bZeroX’s founders. A member of the DAO has approximately 21 days to respond to the lawsuit to avoid a default judgment on the CFTC’s behalf.  The CFTC’s motion for alternative service asks a court in the Northern District of California to authorize its unorthodox methods for delivering the complaint and summons to Ooki DAO, because “by choosing to organize itself as a DAO, the Ooki DAO has structured its business in a way that has erected significant obstacles to traditional service of process.”  The motion argues that, even though no one from the DAO has responded to the CFTC’s requests to get in touch, discussions of the lawsuit in the Ooki DAO Telegram chat and “at least 112 views of the CFTC’s post in the Online Forum regarding the action” are enough to indicate that the DAO was properly served.

42416167,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuaZhn,1664330471,Ethereum Merge Vaults Cryptocurrency Past Bitcoin in Hard-Money Allure,"Ethereum won plaudits and the spotlight two weeks ago for smoothly pushing through its much-hyped Merge, a historic shift to a different “proof-of-stake” blockchain system designed to drastically reduce energy consumption – roughly 99% by some estimates.  Now, the second-biggest blockchain appears to be proving itself on another promise of the Merge: greater inflation-resistance, a characteristic that’s usually more closely associated with Ethereum’s bigger and better-known rival, Bitcoin.  In the days since the Merge, the annualized net issuance rate of Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), has fallen to a range of 0% to 0.7%, estimates Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock. That compares with about 3.5% prior to the Merge. The net issuance rate, also referred to as the inflation rate, is essentially the new supply divided by the existing supply.  The website Ultra Sound Money puts the annualized inflation rate at 0.19%, based on data showing that some 8,100 ETH have been added to ether’s total supply since the Merge.  In a world where central banks worldwide are struggling to contain inflation – in the face of trillions of dollars of money-printing and severe supply-chain bottlenecks – Ethereum’s reduced issuance rate might help to bolster its appeal among investor in crypto and traditional markets alike.  For comparison, Bitcoin’s net issuance rate is currently about 1.75%, according to Woobull.com. The Federal Reserve has doubled the size of its balance sheet since March 2020 to about $8.9 trillion.  “The level of new tokens coming onto the network has substantially reduced.” Simon Peters, a market analyst at the trading firm eToro, wrote in a note Monday.  The decline in Ethereum’s inflation rate comes from two factors: a reduction of new issuance as a result of the change in the underlying blockchain system, and a separate mechanism known as EIP 1559, where fees paid for transactions on the network are “burned,” or eliminated from circulation.  Before the Merge, the issuance of ether’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining rewards was around 13,000 ETH per day, according to the Ethereum Foundation.  After the Merge, mining rewards disappeared and staking rewards would theoretically amount to around 1,600 ETH per day – for a 90% drop in new issuance.  Typically, the amount of ETH burned depends on the base fee adjusted by the crowdedness of the data blocks on a given day. When there are more transactions, there is a higher base fee.  For ETH to flip to actually becoming deflationary at the current pre-burn issuance rate, the base transaction fee would have to be at least 15 gwei, according to Daniel Kostecki, senior market analyst at the investment company Conotoxia. The transaction fee was around 10 gwei as of press time, according to Ultra Sound Money.  The net inflation rate is still “higher than the deflationary ETH many anticipated,” IntoTheBlock’s Outumuro said.  The ether price slid about 5% in the past 30 days, trading just above $1,300 Tuesday as the broader macroeconomic environment has been struggling with high market volatility.  Ironically, according to Alexandre Lores, director of blockchain market research at Quantum Economics, future updates to the network might reduce fees, which could result in “a greater and inflating supply.”  “However, I expect that network growth will balance out this factor long term,” Lores said, “and I am bullish on Ethereum as the premier decentralized application layer network in the world.”  Of course, Ethereum’s transition to the proof-of-stake system brought downsides – notably the risk that the new “staking yields” on the cryptocurrency might draw extra scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – because ether might start to resemble a bond.  The newfound inflation resistance “may still be overshadowed by investors' fears about the SEC, which may finally recognize cryptocurrency as a security,” Conotoxia’s Kostecki said. “This could affect all projects that work on the basis of ETH technology.”  Even so, Kostecki said, Ethereum’s backers, led by Vitalik Buterin, are likely pleased with what the early data are showing in terms of the cryptocurrency’s supply rate.  “Investors’ confidence could be growing,” Kostecki said.  “If Ethereum becomes deflationary, we could see a lot of institutional money invested into ETH in the next couple of years,” said Maximiliano Stochyk Duarte, head of marketing at ChainPort and crypto investor since 2014.  “BTC will still be the best crypto for storing value without the huge volatility that the whole market has, but I think both ETH and BTC can play together if we want mass adoption,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/28/ethereum-merge-vaults-cryptocurrency-past-bitcoin-in-hard-money-allure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4f60da5dd0a3098279d42375ad2fa16a2353a14-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Rise and Fall  By James Rubin  In topsy-turvy Tuesday trading, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose early before crumbling.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just over $19,100, down about a percentage point for the previous 24 hours. BTC had surged above the psychologically important $20,000 threshold during morning hours (UTC) for the first time in nine days before clattering downward to more lately familiar levels.  Bitcoin's rise and fall came as investors initially may have tried to anticipate cryptos' historically bullish October by adding to their holdings. And two unexpectedly strong economic indicators may have also buoyed their spirits before. But investors later recoiled over inflation and recession fears that have plagued asset markets of all stripes for months.  Ether was recently changing hands at approximately $1,330, also flat from the previous day and its highest perch in more than a week. Most other major cryptos spent the day in red territory, with UST recently off about 7% and XRP down more than 5%. Celsius Network’s native token CEL spiked late Tuesday after reports that FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried could bid on the bankrupt crypto bank’s assets. The token had nosedived earlier Tuesday after the surprise departure of Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was recently down slightly and about where it has stood for much of the past week. The Fear & Greed index, a measure of market sentiment about crypto, remains in extreme fear territory.  Stocks  Crypto price patterns dovetailed with equity markets that jumped earlier in the day before tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which entered bear market territory a day earlier, meaning it fell at least 20% from its previous high, closed a few fractions of a percentage point lower. The S&P 500, also dropped slightly, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.2%.  Investors remain worried about inflation and continued central bank hawkishness that seems increasingly likely to throw the global economy into recession. Unexpectedly strong reports on durable goods orders, which sank less than projected, and housing starts, are likely to embolden the Federal Reserve to continue its recent policy of aggressive interest rate increases.  Fed Comments  In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, reiterated the bank's commitment to restore ""price stability.""  Earlier in the day, at an event hosted by the French central bank Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that regulation of decentralized finance (DeFi) needs to be done “carefully and thoughtfully,” given its limited impact on the real economy. “The DeFi winter … didn’t have significant effects on the banking system and broader financial stability” due to the lack of links between them, Powell told a panel.  As bitcoin climbed above $20,000 on Tuesday, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya called its resiliency ""impressive."" But Moya was less than sanguine about any significant prices increases in the near future. ""Bitcoin doesn't have a catalyst to extend much higher, but a stabilization is a welcome sign for long-term bulls. ​  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +3.6% Computing  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −7.2% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP −5.6% Currency Cosmos ATOM −4.3% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  How Chinese Universities Teach Blockchain  ByXinyi Luo  Oct. 24, 2019, marked the beginning of a tectonic change for blockchain education in China.  Speaking before the politburo of the Communist Party of China in Beijing on that day, President Xi Jinping said the country needs to ""seize the opportunity"" afforded by blockchain technology. These words would set forth China’s ambitious agenda to take a leading role in the global development of this emerging technology.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week  The universities of China received the message loud and clear. In 2020, 14 Chinese colleges established blockchain technology undergraduate degree programs, following Chengdu University of Information Technology, which had established the country’s first College of Blockchain Technology months before Xi’s speech.  But Xi’s ambition had and continues to have an inherent contradiction. While blockchain technology is admired by the Chinese, its most popular application, cryptocurrencies, is now illegal. In the past decade, China has banned crypto transactions (2013), initial coin offerings (2017), crypto mining (incrementally from 2019-2021) and – the final blow – cryptocurrency trading, in 2021. As a result, the very idea of blockchain is different in China than anywhere else in the world.  ""When discussing blockchain, we cannot see it from a cryptocurrency perspective,"" said Jianhai Chen, associate professor in the ​​College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University. It is ranked 24th in CoinDesk’s 2022 Best Universities for Blockchain. Instead, he threads a needle to teach blockchain for legally approved uses only. “What we want to do is to use blockchain technology to empower industries and solve existing problems,” Chen said.

However, the bulls have lost steam on the chart. The coin gained nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, but most gains were reversed at press time. In the last week, BTC made no progress in terms of price movement. Technical indicators were yet to reflect the minor bullish spell as the indicators remained bearish at the time of writing. On one hand, sellers continue to dominate the market and, on the other hand, the bulls continue to defend the two crucial support levels of the coin. The current support zone lies between $19,000 and $18,600. If the bulls make a comeback, then the coin can again touch the $20,000 mark. A move above the $20,000 mark will help Bitcoin price propel above the $25,000 mark. The global cryptocurrency market cap today is $980 billion, with a 1.0% positive change in the last 24 hours.

This also signified increased demand at the lower level for the coin. The overhead resistance for the coin stood at $19,600. If the coin manages to move above the $19,600 mark, it could move to trade at $20,000 again. For that to happen, the buyers need to assert dominance on the chart.
