42379417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ijv,1491592259,Did One Tweet Make Litecoin's Price Drop 20%?,"Litecoin prices fell roughly 20% in less than 24 hours, and the culprit is apparently a single tweet.  The digital currency declined to as little as $9.19 at 12:29 UTC today, after reaching a high of $11.45 yesterday. According to data source Coinmarketcap, this represented a 19.7% loss for the digital currency.  Yet, analysts suggest the price movement is the latest example of how cryptocurrency prices can be impacted by relatively minor events, in this case, speculation about the future of an upgrade to the litecoin protocol.  First developed for the bitcoin network as a way to increase the capacity of network transaction blocks, there are now high hopes litecoin could be a useful proving ground for Segregated Witness, a blockchain scaling solution.  Developers, for instance, have expressed their interest in testing SegWit on litecoin as a way to ease concerns about its deployment on bitcoin, and traders have responded in turn.  The tweet that analysts identified as triggering this sharp drop, however, shook confidence in this outcome.  In the message, Wang Chun, co-owner and chief administrator of mining pool F2Pool, expressed his concerns about Segregated Witness and warned that he may need to pull his mining pool's support for the proposal.  At issue is that F2Pool accounts for roughly 35% of the network's mining power.  Still, less than two hours later, litecoin creator Charlie Lee tweeted that he had spoken with Chun, who would continue to signal for SegWit.  Though with the scare over, it seems markets were still affected.  Over the last several days, the litecoin network has repeatedly approached the key 75% support level it needs to activate SegWit, and as such, the tweet sparked concerns the technical proposal might not be activated.  At the time of report, 67% of miners were signaling their support for the change, including F2Pool.  Trend forming  Going forward, analysts said the blockchain asset will likely experience continued volatility on the outcome of this upgrade.  ""Litecoin's jumps and drops lately all seem to be tied to speculation as to whether it will manage to activate SegWit,"" algorithmic programmer Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.  Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, offered a similar sentiment, stating that a lot of litecoin's price movements had to do with SegWit activation.  The drama takes place as the price of litecoin has enjoyed sharp increases over the last several trading sessions, with data suggesting it has surged roughly 175% from its peak to trough over the last week.

42379416,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iif,1491580424,"Blockchain Low Among Corporate Investment Priorities, PwC Finds","'Big Four' consulting firm and accountancy PwC has published a detailed report on the current state of blockchain at large companies.  The report provides unique insight into the blockchain industry in it's very specific sample-set: companies with 500 employees or more, but from the legacy banking sector and financial technology startups.  If you read between the lines though, the message is clear: it's go time.  While investment last year was at an all-time high, future plans to invest show other technologies taking precedent. The technology is moving out of the lab, and dividends will likely be be expected soon.  From the report:  ""The technology is moving from hype to reality and we will likely see business use cases becoming more common.""  Seventy-seven percent of respondents said they expect their companies to incorporate blockchain into their production by 2020.  But a separate section about upcoming investment plans paints a different picture.  While half of all financial technology companies intend to focus on blockchain in the next 12 months, only 19% of large banks made the same claim.  On a list of future investment areas related to technology among the same-sized companies, blockchain was near the bottom, with only 20% of respondents saying they would invest in the next 12 months.  At the top of the list was 'data analytics' with 74% of respondents expecting to invest during the same period, followed by 'mobile' with 51% and 'artificial intelligence' with 34%, respectively.  Other interesting takeaways from the report include that 90% of payment companies are ""heavily invested"" in blockchain and plan to adopt the technology as part of a production system by 2020.  Twenty-four percent of the respondents identified as ""very or extremely familiar"" with blockchain, an increase of 7% since last year, with North American respondents being the most familiar across regions.  While 77% expect some sort of live implementation of blockchain by 2020, 55% say it could happen as soon as 2018.  As with the other so-called 'Big Four' accounting firms, PwC has been positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain industry.  In November, the firm released details about Project Vulcan to study bitcoin, and last month, it joined the Crypto Valley Association in Switzerland.  Going forward the report finds that the most likely business use cases for early blockchain implementations were payments infrastructure, fund transfer infrastructure and digital identity management.  The report concluded:  ""We have also seen growing interest in the technology from insurance companies in areas such as personal and marine insurance, including claims processes.""

42379410,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87iW5,1491570004,The 'Big Block' Bitcoin Movement is Embracing Bcoin,"Over the course of bitcoin's two-year scaling debate, a few major alternatives have grown to challenge the network's most popular and longest-running software, Bitcoin Core.  Among the more notable efforts have been Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, which prioritized support larger block sizes as a method to support more transactions. However, a side effect of their ambitious aims was that network users would need switch implementations to enact the changes, and not everyone has wanted to do so.  The development exposes one of the more curious aspects of the scaling debate, as alternative solutions have needed to propose both a technical change – and build their own developer team – as part of their bids to put forth differing ideas.  One of the main criticisms of Bitcoin Unlimited, one recently popular alternative that allows miners and users to flag support for the block size they want, is that the code is buggy – or, at least, not yet mature. For example, in March, attackers were able to exploited two such bugs, causing most of the network nodes running the software to temporarily shut down each time.  In this light, the emergence of an implementation called 'Bcoin' (built by bitcoin startup Purse) to the debate could be a notable development in the scaling saga.  The software project got a recent boost this week when it introduced its own take on an old scaling idea, 'extension blocks' (or 'e-blocks'), which the company painted as a way for getting around today's block-size standstill.  The idea is controversial, as evidenced by complex technical discussion following the announcement, with some developers arguing that e-blocks would be an insecure addition.  Still, e-blocks have still seen a strong showing of support, in large part due to the perceived proficiency of its team. And, notably, Bitcoin Unlimited supporters have so far had favorable things to say about the project.  Haipo Yang, chief executive of mining firm ViaBTC, for instance, told CoinDesk that he supports Purse's concept and the Bcoin team.  Yang said:  ”I think that extension blocks will be the solution that moves forward.”  'Promising' option  Overall, the argument is developing that Bcoin, an alternative Node.js implementation that launched in September, boasts a stronger technical team than that of Bitcoin Unlimited and other so-called 'big block' teams.  Purse CTO and Bcoin developer Christopher Jeffrey, for example, has been praised for architecting the software, as well as an in-progress Lightning implementation called Plasma that could be layered on top.  Meanwhile, Joseph Poon, Lightning Network co-creator, helped author the specification for the Bcoin implementation’s recently introduced flagship tech.  One example of trust in the competence of the team, supporters argue, is that mining pool BTC.com has already mined one block while running the software in March – allegedly a first for a client not based on bitcoin's original code implementation.  Purse has released a specification draft and reference implementation code that implements extension blocks on top of Bcoin.  That's not to say that Bcoin wants to offer a replacement for Bitcoin Core, as has been suggested for other implementations. When first introduced, it was described by the company as a bitcoin alternative with cleaner code that could co-exist alongside other software versions.  Divisions remain  Despite Yang's confidence, however, not all Bitcoin Unlimited supporters are going all in on extension blocks.  Former Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens, for example, criticized the solution for its complexities, telling CoinDesk Bcoin's idea was ""way too complicated"".  ""People need to get over their fear of hard forks,"" he said.  Still, many are saying positive things about the solution, even if they're possibly more focused on other scaling options.  ""I like extension blocks, but I think there is almost no risk from making the actual blocks bigger, too,"" bitcoin investor and Bitcoin.com operator Roger Ver, one of the most vocal advocates for Bitcoin Core alternatives, told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin Unlimited developer David Jerry Chan went so far as to compare the tech favorably to other available solutions.  ""I see the proposal as a reasonable and better alternative than SegWit,"" he said.  Chan went on to say that Bitcoin Unlimited developers are still discussing the proposal, and there's no ""official opinion"" from the team as yet.  As far as potential setbacks go, however, one of the criticisms of Bcoin is that it needs time to review, no matter the merits of its team. (SegWit, for example, was reviewed and tested for roughly a year before release.)  On the other hand, Purse CEO Andrew Lee has argued that the Bcoin code is already live, so it could take less time to review.  Indeed, according to the technology announcement, the next steps are to deploy it on the bitcoin test network, get further review, and wrap up the specification.  Yang agreed, concluding:  ""We have already waited more than one year. We can wait three months.""

42379415,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ig9,1491567320,10 Insurance Firms Test Blockchain for Insurance in China,"A group of insurance companies has completed a new blockchain trial in China.  In a Sina Finance report, the news agency revealed that the Shanghai Insurance Exchange had initiated a blockchain trial centered on insurance businesses in the country. For the project, nine insurance companies partnered with the exchange, including Cathay Life Insurance, Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance, AIA Group, China Continent Property & Casualty Insurance and Minsheng Life Insurance.  Founded in 2016, the Shanghai Insurance Exchange is the country's first insurance asset trading platform.  The test was reportedly aiming at making use of the security and traceability features of blockchain, and to solve the credibility issues facing insurance firms.  In statements, Wang He, vice president of People's Insurance Company of China, noted that he believes insurance is a natural fit for blockchain given the sector's reliance on disparate systems that include many participants with the need to share information.  The VP further addressed that those seeking to leverage blockchain need to work with other technologies such as big data, biological recognition and artificial intelligence as it moves toward commercialization.  The report further referenced the growing interest among China's domestic insurance companies in blockchain, noting past tests by Sunshine Insurance, Ping An Group, Zhong An online property insurance and Taikang Life.

42379414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ib7,1491564913,An Open Letter to Decentralized Protocols Looking for Growth,"Jeremy Epstein is the CEO of Never Stop Marketing, a strategic marketing and consulting firm that focuses exclusively on helping blockchain-based technologies bring solutions to market faster and with less risk. Clients include OpenBazaar, Storj, and Fermat.  In this open letter to firms starting out in the decentralized protocol industry, Epstein offers his advice on the importance of marketing, arguing the protocol is the brand.        Dear teams developing protocols (within the blockchain tech stack),  One of the most exhilarating parts of doing what you are doing is the fact that you really are going to disrupt the way business is done... and the world works.  'Traditional' businesses, organizations and governments are not ready for what you are about to unleash on them. Frankly, even if they were ready, I'm not 100% sure they'll be able to adapt in time. Some will. To their credit, they will identify the threat and seek to reinvent.  Most won't be able to. Granted, this may play out over 10, 20, 30 or more years, but the genie of the Age of Decentralization has been let out of the bottle and it's not going back in.  Having studied marketing for 20-plus years, my request to you is to not 'throw the baby out with the bath water'.  There is a ton that can be learned from the way that 'traditional' brands and companies have operated. You should learn from them.  The one I want to focus on is that, in the Age of Blockchains/Decentralization, the protocol is the brand.  The distributed apps that hang off the protocol are all part of the ecosystem, but the brand is the protocol and vice versa.  I knew this, but it was driven home the other day when I was talking to Brian Hoffman, CEO of OB1 and project lead for OpenBazaar.  He lifted up his hoodie to show me a slick looking bitcoin T-shirt.https://teespring.com/shop/coin-center-bitcoin-t-shirt  He then said, ""You know, I think pretty much all I own now are bitcoin T-shirts. It's like a brand to me. It's the only one I care about.""  Granted, Brian is way early on the adoption curve, but he's the kind of passionate believer (like many others) who are driving the growth of bitcoin and evangelizing it.  What Satoshi did in his white paper was both outline a technical vision and simultaneously lay down a brand manifesto. Not quite Jerry Maguire, but inspired, passionate, and visionary.  You see this in some of the writing from ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Fermat's Luis Molina as well, but instead of sitting down, writing, and hoping for magic to strike, you can approach it like a brand manager would.  Build a Brand Platform. Now. Before You Need It.  And before you have to figure out how to get others to buy into your vision.  It's a long process, that requires work and deliberate thought, but great brands are eternal. They have a set of core values, a vision, a mission, a belief system. All of these are evident to everyone who works at the brand (traditionally) and for customers who engage with the brand (more or less).  In a blockchain/decentralized world where the protocol is the brand, you can lay down the same articulated vision using the same formula. (This isn't to say that a dapp developer isn't building a brand, s/he is. But, it's a brand that is – to some extent – dependent on the protocol brands it supports. A topic for a future article, perhaps...)  A brand platform is basically the 'genesis block' for the marketing of the protocol. It's the origin of how people will perceive you.  Just like the first line of code determines the second line and so on, your initial decision about how you want to be perceived is a marketing decision. Make it conscious. Make it intentional.  Don't short-change your marketing and make the same mistake that Des Traynor of Intercom did.  If you want a quick primer, you should familiarize yourself with Simon Sinek's ""Start With Why"". It's a classic.  You can also join nearly 100 other companies at the Decentralized Marketing Network to learn how to be a better marketer.  The bottom line is, if you are building a decentralized protocol, you are building a brand. Find someone to teach you how it is done and then go from there.  Sincerely,  A marketer who wants you to succeed  Typeface blocks image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Jeremy Epstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/04/07/an-open-letter-to-decentralized-protocols-looking-for-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e473fdf3f660625793b611396170a63a1116771-1500x920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42379411,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87icN,1491559143,Music Groups Band Together to Build Blockchain Rights Solution,"Three societies tasked with protecting the intellectual property rights of musicians, writers and other content creators have joined forces to build a blockchain solution to prevent piracy.  Powered by Hyperledger's open-source Fabric distributed ledger, and managed by IBM, the nascent platform is being designed to create a tangible connection between the time content is created and the time it is consumed.  Founded by the American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers; the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers of Music; and PRS for Music, the joint project has the potential to help prevent online piracy by tracking more sophisticated data about music content on the blockchain.  In the face of generations-old concerns for the compensation of musicians and composers, however, it is worth noting that the blockchain solution currently being developed only has potential to help artists according to the rights granted by their contracting companies.  The chief executive of PRS for Music, Robert Ashcroft, explained in a statement how real-time reporting of data about the digital consumption of content could empower a diverse set of stakeholders and lead to new business models.  Ashcroft said:  ""If blockchain can help us achieve this, it will unlock opportunities for developers of new digital applications, increase accuracy of royalty payments and release value for rightsholders.""  Similar to blockchain consortia in other industries, the goal of this joint music initiative is to create and adopt a shared, decentralized database that streamlines the flow of data.  Unlike those consortia, however, the information the group wants to track is metadata about artistic works with real-time updates and more advanced tracking capabilities.  Although still in the early stages of development, the improved ability to track the ownership of legally protected creative works could eventually help confirm the legal owner of a work, and the origin of disputed works.  Boosting artists  The formation of the joint initiative is the largest movement yet by what might be considered members of the legacy creative infrastructure providers.  Since 2006, earnings for the US music industry alone have declined by about $5bn, largely due to the shift to the online streaming of music, according to The New York Times.  Of the total industry revenue, musicians earn on average about 20%, and one study found that 77% of the recorded music revenue went to just 1% of musicians.  To help even that disparity, a number of blockchain startups have already responded to calls for a shared, distributed ledger to track artists' intellectual property, and give them more control over their creations.  Startups like dotBlockchain Music (dotBC), Mycelia, MusicChain and Ujo Music have all, in their own way, set their sights not just on preventing piracy, but cutting out unnecessary middlemen.  Growing interest  However, based on today’s announcement, it would appear the music industry has come along way since the early days of blockchain adoption.  Once considered to be largely resistant to the transparency afforded by blockchain development, industry firms are now openly exploring the technology.  In April of last year, PRS for Music hosted a debate about blockchain technology, and two months later, SACEM was one of several legacy music companies to join the Open Music Initiative – aimed specifically at using blockchain to better serve musicians.  The least active of the three partners appears to be the historically litigious ASCAP, which has an online presence mostly limited to linking to articles about blockchain's dubious potential.  Back in March, though, the group’s newly appointed CEO made a provocative statement first intimating at a potential change in tone.  Describing her interest to increase international collaboration on technological solutions, Elizabeth Mathews concluded:  ""If we work on these proof of concepts in areas like blockchain technology and others, the benefit will far outweigh the status quo.""

The operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Montreal Stock Exchange and more, revealed it has completed a proxy prototype for stockholder voting, using an unspecified blockchain platform.  As told to CoinDesk, however, the prototype is being constructed with technology from the Linux-led Hyperledger blockchain project.  TMX spokesperson Shane Quinn said:  ""The prototype is based on the Hyperledger platform and will feature all of the data confidentiality requirements that the TMX is governed by.""  Called the E-Proxy Voting System, the prototype is designed to increase stockholder engagement by making voting more secure while at the same time improving remote access.  External parties were simulated during the test, though live users, including regulators, could be added to the system in the future.  While technical details about the prototype remain sparse, today’s news comes slightly more than a year after TMX Group announced it had hired ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio to explore blockchain technology.  The prototype was developed in partnership with consulting firm Accenture, and is being positioned as part of a larger plan to boost the efficiency of everyday operations across a wide range of services.  The announcement further comes amid an uptick in the use of blockchain solutions for proxy voting, with Broadridge revealing this week it has been working to develop its own global platform for the same use case.
