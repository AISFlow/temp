For Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm led by early internet pioneer Marc Andreessen, the move represents its latest major backing in the bitcoin ecosystem. The investment follows the firm's December investment in US-based bitcoin financial services provider Coinbase's $25m Series B round.  TradeBlock, rebranded from The Genesis Block, began last year as a site where its co-founders Greg and Jeff Schvey could share their analyses and opinions on cryptocurrency market data. When the company hit peak demand for more specific data analytics, Greg told CoinDesk, the business began quietly incorporating its data products and services for some clients.  With $2.8m in new funding, TradeBlock is now focused heavily on improving its order management system for over-the-counter trading.  Greg told CoinDesk:  “We look at block chain technology as a protocol through which any titled asset can be transferred.”  Andreessen Horowitz has to date invested less than $50m in bitcoin companies according to its own estimates, but aims to increase this figure with strategic investments.  Leading market analytics  Armed with this new capital, TradeBlock is looking to empower its customers with improved offerings. Greg specified that TradeBlock works exclusively with institutional clients, and aims to increase their efficiency in “analyzing, understanding and transacting within the new technology”.  With bitcoin, he explained, the underlying protocol itself is open source and by the way it works, has to be publicly available. This means that, for those with the tools to access it, bitcoin already provides a wealth of free data.  However, Greg maintained that no one in the ecosystem is providing analytics the way TradeBlock does, saying:  “The data is out there. The block chain itself you can just download. No matter how much work you wanna put into pulling out intel on your own, there’s a host of places you can go and get indexes and charts on the block chain but if you want to get analytics on it, I’m not immediately aware that anyone else is getting it quite like that.”  Venture capital in the ecosystem  The move comes amid a surge in investment in bitcoin companies and service providers, with second-quarter investments topping $70m.  TradeBlock is the first proprietary research company in the ecosystem to publicly receive venture capital investment. In February, about 30 bitcoin companies had – almost all of which fell under the exchange, financial services, mining hardware, payment processor and wallet categories.  Greg noted this upswing in investment interest, saying that TradeBlock has seen “significant interest from historic Wall Street firms and hedge funds” as opposed to existing players in the bitcoin space.  However, the round was also joined by bitcoin industry leader and venture capital Barry Silbert, who recently invested in Argentina-based fiat-to-bitcoin processing service BitPagos.

42377472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71A7p,1405539016,"Trucoin Opens MasterCard, Visa Bitcoin Buying Services in US","Bitcoin brokerage provider Trucoin has announced the introduction of its first service offerings to customers in Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina and Texas.  Consumers in these eight US states can now receive instant access to the platform, which boasts social login integration for Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+ as well as previously advertised MasterCard and Visa payment options.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Trucoin president and cofounder Chris Brunner, suggested that company officials have been seeking to provide services to the US market for roughly three years, but that legal compliance requirements were a consistent roadblock.  However, Brunner indicated that Trucoin is now putting this challenge behind it with the goal of serving the US market more broadly, stating:  ""We made the decision early on to do everything in a legal and compliant way and that's what we've done. [...] We've partnered with one licensed money transmitter and we operate as a delegate of those money transmitters. We will be adding 25 states in the next two months.""  Trucoin, backed by licensed money transmitters money service business specialists National Check and Currency and Presto Financial Services, launched in April with the goal of becoming ""the fastest way to buy bitcoin in the world"".  The former BitcoinDeals.com founder suggested this backing is key to separating its services in the market, as the brokerage service meets not only the federal registration requirement for money service businesses (MSBs), but the state-specific licensing requirements in the eight states it now serves.  The formal launch follows an uptick in bitcoin buying services in the US market. For example, California-based expresscoin recently launched with a focus on unbanked consumers.  Ease of use  Though compliance has been Trucoin's major concern to date, Brunner indicated that the company is seeking to offer more to consumers by releasing a consistently reliable avenue to bitcoin buying. Enabling this convenience is Trucoin's decision to offer credit cards as a payment option.  Brunner characterized the decision as one that would better position Trucoin to cater to the ""average joe"" bitcoin user, stating:  ""We've put a great deal of effort into putting in place a fraud mitigation system that allows us to accept debit and credit cards, so for new customers it takes less than two minutes to set up. There's no waiting for a human to manually review your account in almost every case, and once you're a customer you're able to make purchases in seconds, as many times as you want.""  Brunner added that most people in its target states would be able to access the service promptly.  Upcoming announcements  The official launch comes roughly one month after Trucoin opened its buying service to an invitation-only private beta and before the service aims to increase its total to 33 states.  Trucoin VP of marketing and communication Brent James, suggested the company doesn't have a firm date for the launch, and that it won't issue a date until it is confident it can follow through on its promises.  James said:  ""That's another reason you'll hear us use the term beta, we want to tread lightly and do things in what we feel is the right way, in a prudent way.""  Trucoin hopes that its commitment to product will in turn increase its profile among buyers, as it will primarily seek to promote itself through word-of-mouth referrals.  Reddit community weighs in  Trucoin's launch also generated significant attention on reddit, with users seeking to learn more about the validity of the company and its services. There, the company received a notable vouch of support from Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen.  Some reddit users, however, advocated for an alternative to social network login, which requires users to part with this data. Trucoin said that social login has been mandated as it is the fastest way for the company to maintain know your customer (KYC) compliance.  Company representatives also provided hints at what users can expect from the service in the coming months, including the ability for users to pay off credit card balances in BTC.  The company also engaged with reddit users prior to today's launch, where it revealed it purchases its bitcoin from exchanges and will retain some customer data for seven years in accordance with US law.  Global goals  Though it is starting its push in the US, Trucoin's ultimate goal is to service 100 countries, providing services in 10 languages through a single bitcoin brokerage system. While a lofty goal, Brunner suggested that with his firm's commitment to compliance, it's ""something that's going to be possible in the near future"".  ""We'll be launching several countries at a time in a way that ensures a quality experience for our customers,"" Brunner said.  He concluded: ""We're really trying to deliver first and talk about it later.""  For more information on Trucoin, visit the company's website.

42377469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71A6Z,1405532436,GHash Commits to 40% Hashrate Cap at Bitcoin Mining Summit,"UPDATE (16th July 22:55 BST): Updated with comment from bitcoin core developer Peter Todd and Peernova president Emmanuel Abiodun. The draft summary of the summit can be found below.      A summit meant to address the threat of 51% attacks against the bitcoin network has resulted in a renewed industry commitment to protecting the digital currency's transaction processing network from majority control by any one entity.  Organized by controversial bitcoin mining pool GHash.io and held as scheduled following the most recent CoinSummit London conference, the meeting involved representatives from notable bitcoin companies such as enterprise mining services provider Peernova, mining hardware manufacturers KnCMiner and SpoondliesTech and the Bitcoin Foundation, as well as other key members of the bitcoin community.  According to documents obtained by CoinDesk, all participants agreed that the consolidation of mining power – and the associated threat of 51% attacks – is something that all parties have a vested interest in avoiding. Participants further concluded that short-term remedies are best suited until a permanent fix is discovered and implemented.  Notably, GHash.io, one of the largest mining pool operators in the ecosystem, has agreed to do all it can to limit its share of the total bitcoin network to 39.99%. This includes asking miners to shift hashing power away from their pools when the hash rate reaches that amount.  A policy of this kind will be recommended to all operators within the bitcoin mining ecosystem.  Though the findings stop short of a conclusive solution, GHash CIO Jeffrey Smith said that temporary ways to mitigate the risk of a 51% attack are the right choice at this time, saying:  ""None of the existing technical solutions against the 51% attack threat is able to solve the problem in a long-term perspective, taking into account interests of existing mining pools, individual miners and bitcoin community. Thus, bitcoin adherents should focus on temporary acts until the lifetime solution is found.""  The company has taken steps in recent months to assuage community concerns about any role it could have in a 51% attack. In June, the company declared in a statement that it supports decentralization within the mining network and would never participate in fraudulent behavior.  Action committee to commence  Though no lasting solution was found for the 51% threat, the summit did result in a framework that could help the bitcoin industry work toward an eventual solution.  A new committee is expected to be organized by GHash.io and its digital currency exchange arm, CEX.io, that direct funds and coordinate efforts on a permanent means to address the problem. The funds will provide a vehicle for ""accelerating and motivating developers to find a technical solution to the 51% threat by accumulating funds and directing them to this process"".  The document reads:  “The committee will drive closer communication and cooperation between developers working on the bitcoin protocol and solving the 51% issue, and businesses, highly interested in expanding the industry and promote bitcoin to a broader audience.”  GHash.io and CEX.io will manage the committee, which will consist of representatitves of pool operators, bitcoin companies and other members of the mining community. According to the document, those who attended the summit in London are expected to continue developing a structure for the committee in the months ahead.  Bolstering network confidence  The threat of a 51% attack – the theoretical power of one entity within the bitcoin network to successfully broadcast fraudulent transactions and disrupt legitimate ones – has long been a source of concern for some members of the bitcoin community.  Some of the fear has been directed at GHash.io itself. This owes to the pool’s outsized hashing power, which some are worried could be used to manipulate transactions in the network. Others who attended the meeting characterized it as an informal effort to open up lines of communication between interests in the space.  BitGo  co-founder and CEO Will O'Brien told CoinDesk that one of the outcomes of the meeting is that the community itself needs to play a role in finding a solution. O'Brien told CoinDesk:  ""It's incumbent upon the industry leaders themselves to make changes that build confidence among the broad bitcoin community, investment community, and the press. We cannot and should not rely on one or more trade organizations to set the rules. Bitcoin is decentralized, and we must build solutions that support that original framework of decision-making.""  Peter Todd was less convinced that the meeting had a decidedly positive outcome. He remarked that the gravity of the situation - both in the short-term and in the long-term - may not be fully appreciated by the GHash.io leadership, saying:  ""Talking to the community is a great first step. That said I didn't get the impression that GHash.io really understood the magnitude of the problem. In particular, they seemed much more focused on getting the bitcoin community to trust them, rather than putting themselves in a position where we don't have too.""  He noted that a particularly damaging impact of the centralization of hashing power is a growing fear among investors about the ramifications of a potentially monopolized network.  Todd told CoinDesk that the issue poses a ""serious long-term obstacle to investment"", but pointed to efforts to develop solutions that he said were promising. Only funding and support, he concluded, will determine how quickly and successfully a fix to the 51% vulnerability is created.  Peernova  president Emmanuel Abiodun said that, ultimately, the cooperation that began in London will lead to greater transparency in the mining space and a push toward more decentralization. He also said that a new mining pool being developed by Peernova would abide by a similar cap like the one being sought by GHash.io.  He told CoinDesk that it's a matter of ensuring the transaction network remains healthy, saying:  ""The hundreds of millions of dollars being put into bitcoin by VCs are worth peanuts if we do not have the secure infrastructure miners are putting into place today. VCs need to engage more with miners and not make the same mistakes that were made in the video streaming industry in taking infrastructure for granted.""  Industry-wide issue develops  Members of the bitcoin community have been clamoring for a fix to both the risk of a 51% attack and the conglomeration of hashing power around several large operations. By limiting itself to just below 40%, GHash.io is acknowledging the need to address what has been called by many a growing problem for the network's long-term health.  The summit - and the proposed committee - also demonstrates a willingness to engage among the bitcoin industry’s major players. As well, the presence of bitcoin core developers and companies outside of the mining sector will no doubt enhance the profile of efforts to develop a fix to the 51% attack issue.  GHash.io, as well as other summit attendees, have called on the community as a whole to help realize a solution to the problem. The group has asked for companies to take part in the proposed committee as well as assist in funding research and development that enhances the security of the bitcoin network.  Still, the topic has been much debated in the industry, with some contending that no solution needs to be found to the 51% attack risk.

42377471,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71AAL,1405524207,Keybase Project Plans to Make Cryptography as Easy as Twitter,"A new project called Keybase is attempting to make cryptographic keys, like those used for bitcoin wallets, easier for everyone to use.  One of the most important elements of bitcoin is arguably the cryptographic key pair, and every wallet has two keys: a public one as an advertised address, and a private one that controls it.  Yet, the system is not perfect. Key pairs are confusing for many users and there isn't yet an effective, decentralized way by which keys can be linked to an identity, thus proving ownership.  Keybase  believes it can help make using keys more secure and understandable by providing what's known as public key infrastructure (PKI) for cryptography.  Chris Coyne, who runs the Keybase project along with colleague Maxwell Krohn, said:  ""In 2014, you know people by their online presence. You know them by their Twitter name, their personal website, and so on. Keybase is a protocol for people to sign statements and announce them to the public.""  The idea  The concept for Keybase came from the desire to make public key cryptography more social media friendly. While a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University, Krohn said he tried to come up with a viable PKI-related Facebook project, but couldn't find one interesting enough.  ""The dream of a working PKI is as old and important as the idea of public key cryptography itself,"" said Krohn.  Coyne said Keybase also drew from his experience with problems using bitcoin. When downloading Bitcoin-QT, the currency's basic wallet, for the first time, he realized how difficult it was to find out who actually signed the underlying code.  However, with Keybase, Coyne said:  ""In one command, [I] get a verified summary – it was signed by this Twitter account, that GitHub account.""  And when the price of bitcoin started to rise to higher levels, Coyne realized the need to publicly verify addresses to which people send BTC.  Social networking and cryptography  A Keybase profile looks like any other social media profile. The attached cryptographic keys can be used for communication, code signing, bitcoin – the technological applications are numerous.  To endorse proof, Keybase requires verification. Members can post a tweet linking back to their profile, or create a GitHub public gist with identifying information.    Verifying myself: I am danielcawrey on Keybase.io. DBcSyQ6EK1uAQxNoZipM_gEpdqetUU2Kx0IF / https://t.co/WqVzgCHX86      — Daniel Cawrey (@danielcawrey) July 15, 2014      In order to maintain proof, Keybase regularly checks to ensure verifications still exist. Furthermore, all of the Keybase information is stored on a bitcoin address as unspent transactions, creating public proof that anyone can see via the block chain.  ""Anyone can write a client that polices Keybase,"" said Coyne. ""And if it ever catches a lie, it will be provable, since all these statements are signed by Keybase, with its public key.""  Winning over the developers  Technologies like Keybase could be a way to access the full spectrum of what cryptography can do for people.  ""This is all very powerful stuff, but the general public has almost no access,"" said Coyne.  The Keybase idea is reminiscent of Coinbase's recent launch of Payment Pages, a way to put a face and a name – a profile – to bitcoin wallets.  However, unlike consumer-focused Coinbase wallets, Keybase has no illusions that it first needs to influence the developer community in order for its idea to take off. That's why its website is designed to encourage coders to develop around Keybase's concept to begin with.  ""Without a good way to map identities to public keys, most interesting crypto-based systems can't get off the ground,"" said Krohn.  Attaching monetary value to a cryptographic system like bitcoin might be the answer to further adoption for Keybase. If there's a way to make the system easy for anyone to use crypto, Keybase may be on to something.  Coyne said:  ""We expect our first killer app might be with cryptocurrencies.""

42377463,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX719xl,1405516826,Hackers Offer Stolen CNET Database for Bitcoin in Publicity Stunt,"A group of Russian hackers that managed to steal CNET’s user database has made that information available for bitcoin, in what seems like a publicity stunt.  The group, which calls itself 'wOrm', says the database contains the accounts of more than a million users, including their usernames, emails, passwords and other information.  The asking price for the source code and the database was 1 BTC, roughly $615 at the time of writing. However, CNET was later told that the group has no plans to decrypt the passwords or to complete the sale of the database.  The offer, which was apparently made to gain attention for the group's ""altruistic"" work, was quickly rescinded. WOrm has previously carried out similar attacks on websites belonging to the BBC, Adobe Systems and Bank of America.  CNET admits breach  CNET confirmed the attack and admitted that several servers were accessed and compromised. The security flaw that allowed the breach has since been patched, but the hackers managed to steal a significant amount of data before the attack was detected and addressed.  The hackers say they exploited a hole in CNET’s implementation of the Symfony PHP framework. Although the group initially offered to sell the database, it insists its main motivation is security awareness.  ""We are driven to make the Internet a better and safer [place] rather than a desire to protect copyright. I want to note that the experts responsible for bezopastnost [security] in cnet very good work but not without flaws,"" a wOrm member told CNET via twitter.  No cause for alarm?  CNET has not advised its users to change their passwords yet, as the compromised passwords were encrypted and wOrm has stated it will not try to decrypt them.  Web security expert Robert Hansen agrees CNET readers are not at risk. He points out that the hackers were careful not to reveal the “full path to the actual exploit” and that it informed the public of the attack.  ""It definitely can feel like a slap in the face to an organization to be hacked, but in reality, most of the time in circumstances like this it's actually a good thing,"" Hansen said.

42397762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE6fr,1405507562,Online Gambling Payments Pioneer NETELLER Snubs Bitcoin,"NETELLER, a digital payments service based in the Isle of Man, has revised its customer terms-of-service agreement to explicitly prohibit the use of digital currencies.  Founded in the late 1990s and owned by Optimal Payments PLC, NETELLER offers e-wallet and digital money transfer services, with a heavy focus on the online gambling market. Both companies are headquartered in the island's capital, Douglas.  NETELLER processes billions of dollars in financial transactions every year, and was an early pioneer in the online gambling payments sector. In 2005, the company provided payment services to more than 80% of gaming merchants worldwide.  According to NETELLER’s newly revised terms of services agreement, the range of restricted types of transactions now includes the term “virtual currency”. Specifically, the service has banned any type of action on its platform that may involve bitcoin or other digital currencies.  The company’s updated policy on banned transactions now restricts:  “[...] using NETLLER to facilitate the trade, exchange, purchase or sale of bitcoins, or any other virtual currency.”  CoinDesk reached out to Optimal Payments to learn more about the decision to block digital currency activities, but after several delays the company ultimately declined to comment.  Perceived risks  According to Paul Davis, a barrister and solicitor with Isle of Man-based Group General Counsel, the move by the service to ban digital currency isn’t surprising. The NETELLER policy change is an action largely in line with many other companies in the mainstream digital transaction industry.  Davis told CoinDesk that NETELLER likely did not evaluate the Isle of Man’s growing bitcoin ecosystem when it opted to expand its prohibited transaction policy to cover digital currencies. Rather, it sought to avoid the perceived risks that are keeping many traditional financial companies and banks away from integrating bitcoin.  He said:  “In truth NETELLER is a global company, and its presence in the UK, Canada, Bulgaria and other places around the world is much greater than its physical operation on the Isle of Man. Neither the Island nor its financial regulator would seek to impose an obligation on a licensee to service any particular vertical; rather the island’s stance is that it is open to quality digital currency businesses who are welcome on our shores.”  Bitcoin plan undeterred  Regardless of NETELLER’s policy change, or similar actions that may take place in the future, it doesn’t seem like the growing bitcoin community on the island will be restricted by these types of developments. According to Davis, general policy toward bitcoin on the Isle of Man will attract bitcoin companies regardless of what existing financial companies do.  Recent developments suggest that the Isle of Man is poised to create a regulatory environment that is conducive for bitcoin business.  The Isle of Man’s Department of Economic Development released information in June regarding its forthcoming digital currency regulation. The nature of this regulation was later debated during a panel at the Bitfin conference in Dublin earlier this month.  Isle of Man-based bitcoin companies are already moving to capitalize on the welcoming and growth-oriented market that local regulators are planning. Earlier this month, a new digital currency exchange, CoinCorner, opened on the island.  Meanwhile, a startup incubator curated by a group of local businesses is looking to support new companies operating in the Isle’s bitcoin space.

With the funding, Elliptic will be able to further its product development and strengthen its foothold as the trusted provider of enterprise digital assert services in the British market. It will soon offer a set of enterprise services meant to reconcile traditional finance and digital assets.  “We're seeing a clear trend of highly-skilled fintech talent seeking opportunities in forward-thinking tech companies, rather than traditional financial firms,” Elliptic CEO James Smith told CoinDesk, “which means we have many great options in terms of growing our team.”  This is the first major public venture capital investment in a bitcoin company based in the UK. Equally exciting, Smith added, is how supportive institutional investors like Octopus Investments have increasingly become. The company expects to see many similar investment moves in the coming months.  The funding comes amid increased attention in secure bitcoin storage systems, as evidenced by a recent $20m Series A-1 investment round raised by Xapo and Coinbase's introduction of a new higher-security vault accounts.  Business trajectory  The new capital comes six months after Elliptic launched Elliptic Vault, the world’s first bitcoin deep-storage service. However, the funding will allow Elliptic to further advance its efforts around customer acquisition to this service and others.  Since its January launch, Elliptic has seen law firms and hedge funds adopt Elliptic Vault for their businesses. One of those businesses includes JPMorgan trader Dan Masters’ Jersey-based and first-ever regulated bitcoin investment fund, the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund.  Elliptic will also be better able to reach its goal of becoming the trusted provider of enterprise digital currency infrastructure, Smith said, adding that the company can grow its team and iterate quickly on its current enterprise storage product.  He revealed that the team will add more services that help companies streamline the introduction of digital currencies into their existing processes:  “[We’re] putting Elliptic at the heart of digital currency infrastructure. We will provide the key tools the industry requires to grow, from reporting and audit to better trade management and more.”  Bitcoin in the UK  Citing the increasing clarity on digital currency taxation and regulation, and a widely respected regulatory regime, Smith said:  ""The UK and Europe are very proactively encouraging innovation and competition in financial services.""  For example, last month the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced an initiative to ensure that the regulatory environment supports ""positive developments"" like bitcoin.

As part of an ongoing partnership with Bitcoin Vietnam and desire to prove its technology in overseas markets, the company also supplied the underlying system for the initial BitcoinVietnam.com.vn exchange.  Eli Bejerano, CEO of Bit2C, said:  ""We believe bitcoin represents a revolution in international trade and commerce and are very excited to see our technology playing role in promoting the adoption of bitcoin. Especially in the vibrant and fast-growing Vietnamese economy.""  What VBTC offers  The company says despite a lack of existing regulation it will still comply with internationally common know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) measures in preparation for the future. This is technically not required yet, but authorities are known to be paying close attention to bitcoin business activities.  Other features of the new exchange include:  An extensive affiliate program  Bitcoin/litecoin trading with a 0% trading fee  Multisig wallets as well as Bit2C's own cold storage technology to protect the majority of users' funds  Trading fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% (depending on trading volume).  Questions remain about legality  The launch comes amid scattered reports the Vietnamese authorities remain skeptical about digital currency. The country's central bank released an initial warning in February and has followed up with repeated statements that bitcoin and other digital currencies are not legal tender or a permitted means of payment in Vietnam.  It is not unusual for domestic bitcoin businesses to receive visits from the authorities asking questions and requesting documentation. Those businesses remain undeterred, however, saying they always anticipated such curiosity.  Vietnam's developing economy ""offers fertile ground to bring bitcoin on a broader level to the local market"", a VBTC representative added.  VBTC would instead prefer to continue its dialog with the Department of Public Security to explain the exact nature of the business, and how the new technology can benefit everyday consumers and spur increased economic activity.  Other businesses joining in  Other digital currency brokerage platforms also exist in Vietnam, including Coinomat and Muabitcoin, providing competition and demonstrating the local scene (in a similar fashion to China's) is more complicated than it appears on the surface.  Coinomat is not a fully open book exchange, instead fixing its bitcoin price every 30 minutes. The company says it has been in touch with government officials and also follows compliance procedures, but does not exchange bitcoin into local currency directly as part of its service. Instead, it uses local payment companies like Webmoney and Sohapay.  A representative said the company explained bitcoin to its contacts as ""virtual money"", similar to items available for sale in video games.
