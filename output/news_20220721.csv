The funding rates, which had previously remained muted, quickly declined below neutral and proceeded to spend the next one month on this level. However, there is a significant change as last week saw funding rates return to neutral. Funding Rate Recovers On Exchanges The bitcoin funding rates had been touching low points as the price of the digital asset struggled. This was concerning given that funding rates were expected to improve as the digital asset began to basically trade at what was described as a “discount.” This would not be farther from the truth, as funding rates fell to their lowest points this June. It indicated that perp traders were still bearish on the cryptocurrency and refrained from moving in.

It showed that there is still a lot of leveraging going on in the market since the bitcoin open interest was not much different from what was recorded the prior week, even with the decline. Bitcoin Traders Turning Bullish The recovery of bitcoin funding rates to a neutral level is a testament to the returning positive sentiment among traders and investors. It definitely does not signal that the market has returned to its previously bullish phase, but it is an indication that investors are now looking favorably at the bitcoin and crypto market at large.

On Thursday, the price of Ethereum (ETH) showed just slight decreases. Ethereum Consolidates On July 21, price movement in the cryptocurrency market as a whole was mostly muted as traders took a day to digest recent gains and book profits after the strongest relief bounce since early June. The Ethereum Merge has remained at the top of the list despite rumors regarding what sparked the recent spike. After a preliminary date of Sept. 19 was chosen for the mainnet Merge, the market rally accelerated. The price of Ether (ETH), which reached a high of $1,620 on July 20, retraced to a low of $1,463 in the early trading hours of July 21, according to TradingView data, and has since recovered back above support at $1,500. ethereETH/USD back around $1,500. Source: TradingView Following the initial price spike caused by the Merge news, here is what various analysts anticipate will happen as Ether’s mainnet switch to proof-of-stake draws near. Market analyst Rekt Capital posted the following chart showing the significance of Ether’s weekly finish over $1,300 and subsequent rise higher, describing the retreat on July 21 as a good development. Rekt Captial said: “Though #ETH could just continue higher to reach the upper orange region, it would be healthier for ETH to dip. Such a retest of the lower orange area would only increase probability of continuation.” With this outlook in mind, the pullback on July 21 raises the prospect of a rise to $1,700 soon. Related Reading | Ethereum Merge: How ETHBTC Could Hint At A Return Of Risk Appetite Vitalik Hints At Future Of ETH The co-founder of Ethereum detailed his plans for future developments on Thursday at the Ethereum Community Conference in France that go far beyond the network’s switch to proof of stake. The upgrade—often referred to as “the merge” since it will integrate the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake beacon chain—is actually the first in a series of modifications that are being planned. Ethereum will then go through additional improvements that Buterin refers to as the “surge,” “verge,” “purge,” and “splurge” after the merging, which he believes is extremely close because “the only thing left to do is do a merge on Ropsten [test network],” he said during the conference. Buterin mentioned a goal to strengthen the Ethereum network being the reason behind the network continuous updates. Ethereum will only be about 55% complete after the integration, which is anticipated to be finished this September. The surge is due to the addition of Ethereum sharding, a scaling solution that, according to the Ethereum Foundation, will make layer-2 blockchains even more affordable, reduce the cost of rollups or bundled transactions, and make it simpler for users to run nodes that protect the Ethereum network. Buterin added that following the spike Related reading | Ethereum Cruised Past $1500, Is There A Possibility To Retrace To $1200?

Riley to issue up to $100 million of shares to the bank over two years to enhance liquidity.  Core Scientific has the right but no obligation to issue these new shares, subject to some limitations and conditions, according to a statement. The company plans to use this additional funding to bolster its balance sheet and help the miner expand, Core CEO Mike Levitt said in the statement.  The deal comes as a crypto bear market hammers shares of the publicly traded miners. Stocks of some of these publicly traded miners, including Core, have fallen anywhere between 50% to 80% this year.  The miner has also issued B. Riley 573,381 shares of common stock as consideration for B. Riley’s commitment to purchase Core Scientific shares.  Core has been raising cash by selling some of the bitcoin it has been mining. Last month, it sold 7,202 bitcoins at an average price of $23,000 to raise about $167 million. The miner said it intends to use the proceeds from the sales mainly for payments toward ASIC servers, capital investments in additional data-center capacity and debt repayments.

Crater’s firm offered virtual payment services through a fraudulent digital currency known as “My Big Coins,” which were marketed to investors between 2014 and 2017, according to court documents and trial evidence.  Crater and his associates falsely claimed the coins were a functioning cryptocurrency backed by $300 million in gold, oil and other assets. They also falsely told investors the company had a partnership with MasterCard (MA) and that the crypto could be easily exchanged for fiat currency or other virtual currencies.  Over the course of the scheme, Crater misappropriated over $6 million of investor funds for his own purposes, including spending hundreds of thousands of dollar on antiques, artwork and jewelry, according to the Justice Department.  In 2018, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Crater and My Big Coin with commodity fraud and also filed civil charges against the company’s CEO and two of Crater’s associates.  Crater was convicted of four counts of wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison for each count, and up to three counts of money laundering, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years for each count.

42395148,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXHvG,1658435437,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stalls at $23K but Sits Above Cost for Average Investor’s Purchase Price,"Hi, I'm Jimmy He, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) returned recent gains as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization declined 2.9% to $22,850.  Thursday’s decline followed an 11% increase over the previous seven trading days.  Bitcoin’s price remains stubbornly close to its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), but has yet to surpass that level. Ether’s price, by contrast, remains above the 50-day EMA, but remains below the average ETH investor’s purchase price. Ether was recently down 0.9% over the past 24 hours.  In traditional equity markets, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is down 3%, while gold’s price has advanced by 1.1%.  Alternative coins (altcoins) have been mixed, with Avalanche’s AVAX up 1.5% but Polkadot’s DOT token down 3.7%.  Today’s edition of ""Market Wrap"" was produced by Sage D. Young.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,087 −2.5%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,564 +0.4%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,988.68 +0.7%      ●Gold: $1,715 per troy ounce +0.9%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.91% −0.1       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

By Glenn Williams Jr.  Job data was the agenda Thursday for risk assets.  Initial jobless claims (pictured below) hit 251,000, 4.5% higher than the consensus forecast of 240,000. Continuing jobless claims were 1.38 million (versus expectations for 1.34 million), while the four-week moving average for claims increased 1% to 240,500.  As the U.S. central bank attempts to tame inflation without stalling economic growth too severely, we expect bitcoin investors will view today’s data as a net positive for prices, the rationale being that any data point that increases the probability of a higher-than-expected rate hike will depress prices. The CME FedWatch tool shows that expectations for a higher than 75 basis point rate hike have declined to 27.3%. For context, when we referenced this tool in Monday’s “Market Wrap,” the probability stood at 33.2%.  BTC was down on the day, albeit on lower-than-average volume. It’s worth noting that BTC breached overbought levels on July 19, using the 10-period relative strength indicator (RSI) as a proxy for measurement. The RSI is a technical tool that measures the speed and change of price movements, and is often used as an indicator of momentum. Levels of 70 and higher often indicate “overbought” conditions, while levels of 30 and below imply “oversold” conditions.  Additionally, the Average True Range (ATR) for BTC prices has been in decline since mid-June, indicating a narrower trading range. Also of note is BTC’s 10-period moving average crossing above its 20-period MA, as well as BTC prices themselves briefly touching the 50-period moving average. The decline in volume, however, implies uncertainty, and we expect that investors are viewing the $23,000 range as an area of potential resistance.  We see similar behavior with ether price action, the distinction being that ETH prices have surpassed their 50-day EMA, while the 10-period EMA looks poised to cross it as well. We would view this as a distinctly bullish sign if viewed in a vacuum. The upward move on lower volume however, indicates a decrease in investor conviction.  On-chain data reveals a distinction between BTC and ETH prices as well, most notably as it relates to realized price. For context, realized price can be viewed as the cost basis for a digital asset. Viewing this metric in comparison to current prices indicates whether the average investor is operating at a profit, or at a loss. As it stands, BTC is currently trading above its realized price of $21,947. Oftentimes realized prices are viewed as another area of potential support.  Conversely, the average ETH investor is currency operating at a loss, as ETH remains below its realized price of $1644. We expect that investors will view this price point (7% above current prices), as a potential area of resistance.

42395123,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXHeX,1658435288,What Tesla’s Big Bitcoin Sale Means for Other Firms Putting Crypto on Their Balance Sheets,"Tesla (TSLA) opting to sell 75% of its bitcoin (BTC) holdings is unlikely to have a significant impact on whether other firms will be adding crypto to their corporate treasuries.  For starters, CEO Elon Musk has not entirely abandoned Tesla’s bitcoin position, and said during the company conference call he remains open to adding to the company’s bitcoin holdings again in the future.  “This should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin,” Musk noted on the call, saying the sale was needed to boost the electric vehicle maker's cash position given COVID-19 lockdowns in China, one of Tesla’s largest markets.  Tesla was also able to eke out a small profit on its bitcoin sale, despite the sharp decline in bitcoin prices over the last few months. The company first bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in January 2021 when the cryptocurrency was selling for around $32,000 to $33,000. Tesla later sold about 10% of its holdings in that first quarter for a profit.  “We converted a majority of our bitcoin holdings to fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&L included within restructuring and other,” Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said during Wednesday’s earnings call.  And Tesla’s bitcoin sale could be viewed as a completely reasonable tactic for raising cash for corporate purposes.  “It makes perfect sense that corporate treasuries faced with decreasing profitability and possible layoffs will sell liquid assets, including cryptocurrency,” Pat Larsen, co-founder of crypto tax accounting software firm ZenLedger. “It is not a surprise that Tesla would try to free up cash right now with a falling stock price and an uncertain economic environment.”  Tesla’s cash position at the end of the second quarter increased to about $18.3 billion from $17.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, boosted by its bitcoin sale.  Larsen told CoinDesk he expects more corporations to add bitcoin to their coffers in the future, especially as more regulations are passed by the U.S. Congress.  Gil Luria, DA Davidson’s technology strategist, said that if we take Musk at his word about his reasons for selling and openness to repurchasing, then his outlook on bitcoin doesn’t appear to have changed.  Meanwhile, the proposition that bitcoin can serve as a better option than cash for corporate treasury purposes hasn’t been altered, but it also hasn’t come to fruition yet either, Luria said. And given the recent volatility in crypto prices, “the rate of adoption by corporates isn't going to be as fast,” Luria added.  Skeptics will remain on the sidelines, but other firms will explore the idea of adding bitcoin to their balance sheet, according to Chris Terry, vice president of enterprise solutions at open lending platform SmartFi. Tesla was able to successfully liquidate almost $1 billion in bitcoin and thus fared better than simply owning Treasury bonds, Terry told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/21/what-teslas-big-bitcoin-sale-means-for-other-firms-putting-crypto-on-their-balance-sheets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56113f1177cb57c5dbc93208a6bdade2b49c6863-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
221155,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243603,1658434357,XRP Technical Analysis: Retracement From $0.36 Warns Bearish Trend,"The Ripple(XRP) price action shows an increase in selling pressure above $036, resulting in a retracement to retest the broken trendline. Key technical points: The XRP prices dropped by 5.59% in the last 24 hours. The price action showcases a bearish reversal from $0.36 challenging the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Ripple is $1.34 Billion, indicating a drop of 17%. Past Performance of XRP XRP price action displays a bullish reversal from $0.30, breaking the long-coming resistance trendline on 16th July with a 5% jump. The bull run accounts for a price jump of 20% to reach the $0.36 mark. However, the supply dump above the resistance level influences a retracement of 6.5% over the past two weeks, influencing a retest of the broken trendline. Source- Tradingview XRP Technical Analysis The XRP price chart shows the falling trend in trading volume during the downfall, which increases the likelihood of a bullish turnaround after a successful retest. Moreover, the 50-day SMA acts as the last stand to keep the market value floating above the $0.35 mark. The RSI indicator shows a weakness in the underlying bullishness as the RSI slope stepbacks to retest the halfway line. Hence, the technical indicator warns of a downtrend below the $0.35 mark. Furthermore, the MACD indicator displays a sudden rise in selling pressure as the positive histograms take a downturn. Therefore, the bullish spread takes a hit between the fast and slow lines teasing a potential bearish crossover. In a nutshell, the XRP technical analysis displays a high likelihood of a price drop under the $0.35 mark to retest the broken trendline. Upcoming Trend Considering the Ripple(XRP) prices drop below the 50-day SMA, traders can expect the fallout rally to reach the $0.32 mark.

Source- Tradingview AVAX Technical Analysis The daily candle in the AVAX price chart shows a long-tail formation from $22, reflecting a post-retest bullish reversal.

Recall in mid-June when both Babel and Celsius froze customer withdrawals due to liquidity issues fueled by turbulent market conditions. About a month later Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . Given that Zipmex's exposure to Celsius is relatively small, the exchange is giving up on being paid as it intends to write off the loan against its balance sheet, the statement said. Zipmex added that it's currently engaging with Celsius and Babel to resolve the issues. The move comes shortly after Zipmex halted withdrawals due to market volatility beyond its control. Nevertheless, the company has now enabled withdrawals from its trade wallet and it's ""actively working to resume trading,"" according to the statement. ""Ever since the black swan events surrounding the crypto space Zipmex has retrieved the majority of our funds and assets that were historically deposited with our deployment partners and have been actively working to resolve the situation for the remaining outstanding assets. There were no materially adverse impacts to our operations,"" Zipmex explained. Babel Finance did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.

They include crypto portfolio companies such as fiat on-ramp startup Ramp, code collaboration network Radicle and minimalist blockchain Celestia.  NFX's Fund II launched in 2019 with $275 million committed for investments across all sectors. Its $450 million Fund III debuted in October to back pre-seed and seed stage companies.  An amended regulatory filing on July 11 showed the company had increased Fund II to $337.61 million. NFX confirmed to CoinDesk that the additional funds were for follow-on investments in high-conviction companies in the fund’s portfolio.  “We have a strong pipeline of crypto and non-crypto companies in Fund II that are opportunistically planning to raise small rounds to further extend their runway,"" NFX general partner Morgan Beller told CoinDesk in an email. ""We raised this extra funding to continue backing them during this uncertain market.""  Growing crypto investments  Beller co-created Facebook’s libra stablecoin project (the company is now Meta and libra, renamed diem, was recently shut down) before joining NFX in September 2020. The company's Fund III – which has more of a focus on crypto investments than Fund II – launched shortly thereafter. Fund III capital has been deployed to “numerous great startups at the intersection of crypto, [decentralized finance], blockchain infrastructure, Web3 gaming and more,” said Beller.  Portfolio companies for Fund III include blockchain infrastructure startup Mysten Labs, blockchain-based savings account provider Gelt, Web3 game studio Azra Games and Fair.xy, a provider of non-fungible token (NFT) infrastructure.  Beller said the “litmus test for Web3 investments is: Does this platform lower the barrier to entry for Web3 to developers, enterprises and/or consumers? And we plan to continue doing more of the same, but we also have some new tricks up our sleeve. Stay tuned.""  Bear market investments  Asked about deploying investments in a bear market, Beller said the firm is “more bullish than ever.”  “We recognize the market has changed but there are some silver linings to this because 1) prices have come down (which we believe is genuinely good for longterm-thinking founders), 2) businesses with network effects are further being solidified and 3) a lot of the shoddy projects are dying out,” Beller said. “In some ways, we’re only more confident deploying in today’s market than six to 12 months ago.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/21/venture-capital-firm-nfx-adds-626m-in-follow-on-investments-including-crypto-companies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/920bf05231f504719e16bc89711d044c6d6cf2cd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin NUPL Latest Trend Could Signal The Bottom Is Already In As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC NUPL breaking above the neutral market may be a sign that the bottom has set in. The “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss” (or “NUPL” in short) is an indicator that’s defined as the difference between the market and realized caps, divided by the market cap. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is the profit/loss ratio among investors in the current Bitcoin market. The indicator works by looking at the on-chain history of each coin to see what price it was last moved at. If this selling price of any coin was less than the current BTC value, then that particular coin is holding some profit right now. Otherwise, it is in loss at the moment. Related Reading | Capitulation: Public Bitcoin Miners Dump 25% of BTC Holdings Last Month When the value of the NUPL is greater than zero, it means investors in the Bitcoin market as a whole are in profit. On the other hand, the indicator’s value being negative implies the overall market is currently in a state of loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC NUPL over the last several years: The value of the metric seems to have surged up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the relevant zones of bear market trend for the Bitcoin NUPL. It looks like some time after plunging deep below zero, a bounce back to positive values has been a sign of bottom formation during the previous bear markets. Currently, the indicator is back to a positive value after observing a surge recently. This means that the investors as a whole are slightly in profit right now. If the past cycles are anything to go by, this trend could imply the bottom has already been in for this Bitcoin bear market. However, as is apparent in the chart, a break to green NUPL values doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the bear. It has only indicated that the crypto has already faced the worst.

218709,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241177,1658429801,How Vechain and its Traceability Solution Can Prevent Counterfeiting,"One of the most significant issues the supply and manufacturing industry faces is counterfeiting. It is estimated that the value of illicit goods is around half a trillion dollars annually, a huge problem affecting companies producing original products. Years ago, this was a relatively small-time business, but it has since grown to become a significant issue for many companies. The counterfeiting industry is a complex business with devastating effects on the individuals and companies it affects. According to the World Health Organization, around 30% of the drugs in circulation are fake, and 1 in 10 medical products in developing countries is counterfeit, responsible for about a million deaths annually. Despite the fight against counterfeiters, it’s still not always possible to tell if a product is real or fake. Retailers must have the necessary tools and resources to combat this issue. Unfortunately, the various technologies used to combat counterfeits have failed. It is why blockchain technology could be a viable solution to help prevent fraud. This article discusses the various advantages of blockchain-based technology VeChain and its traceability solution that can help businesses prevent counterfeiting. What is VeChain (VET)? As one of the first blockchains built specifically for enterprise-level clients, VeChain aims to improve the efficiency of the supply chain. The project’s developers are focused on using distributed ledger technology to improve the efficiency of the business process. Its robust features allow users to enhance their supply chain management and business processes. Due to the complexity of the logistics industry’s data collection systems, the lack of transparency and transmission of this information is a significant issue that has been affecting the operations of the sector. This issue is caused by the lack of unity between the various data sources within the supply chain. Through VeChain, businesses can track various data sources such as temperature, transportation status, and quality. It is crucial as it allows them to improve efficiency and reduce overhead. Through a distributed business ecosystem, VeChain eliminates the need for third parties and helps them improve their accountability. VeChain Traceability The Vechain network is a multi-faceted system that allows users to collect and analyze data. It includes various tools that are connected to the blockchain. Toolchain The toolchain is a fundamental component of the Vechain blockchain, allowing users to improve efficiency. However, it can also be very challenging to connect all the various components of the blockchain. This toolchain is a part of Vechain’s platform that aims to connect the Internet of Things (IoT) and the blockchain. It facilitates the transfer of data between the various devices and the blockchain. It is also a framework that integrates various components of the IoT and blockchain ecosystem. It is a vital part of the solution for monitoring and tracking the activities of multiple devices. IoT Device The Internet of Things (IoT) is a central component of the Vechain blockchain and its traceability solution. It allows users to collect and manage data related to various factors such as temperature, location, and precipitation. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are placed on the products under transfer or in packaging. These are then used to monitor the condition of the products. Each product has one of these devices, and the vehicle transporting them has one. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices attached to a vehicle or product have the necessary conditions to ensure that the goods or services are delivered to their intended destination. They can also collect data about the conditions of the road and the time spent at a particular stop. After gathering all the necessary details, the device can then be able to provide the user with a better understanding of the surrounding area. The Blockchain Core The blockchain core is the central hub of the VeChain network. It acts as the intermediary between the various activities within the network. Once the data collected by the IoT devices is sent to the blockchain, it can be easily accessed by buyers and sellers. The information collected by the IoT devices during the transit process can be used by the parties involved to compensate for the damages caused by the conditions. It eliminates the need for manual handling and helps protect the quality of the goods. VeChain Traceability: A Viable Solution to Counterfeiting Businesses can use a blockchain-based distributed ledger to fight counterfeiting through the Internet of Things and VeChain. This platform can help companies and consumers track the origin, ownership, and location of their products and raw materials. It can also give them the necessary transparency to improve their supply chains because both the blockchain and the IoT provide a secure and unalterable way to store and manage information. This technology can significantly improve the fight against counterfeiting by allowing authorities to track and monitor the movement of products in the supply chain. … Continued The post How Vechain and its Traceability Solution Can Prevent Counterfeiting appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",POSITIVE,VET,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | VET,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/how-vechain-and-its-traceability-solution-can-prevent-counterfeiting/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=how-vechain-and-its-traceability-solution-can-prevent-counterfeiting,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The Cumberland Lab incubator is based in Singapore, where it has been quietly building since March. The lab now numbers around 20 staffers, with five more being added this week, according to Cumberland Lab chief Naveen Agnihotri.  It could be a well-timed move as the so-called “DeFi summer” of 2020 blossomed following the 2018-19 crypto winter. In addition, pure DeFi would seem to be vindicated to a large degree as having so far survived the recent bloodletting involving overleveraged and opaque trading platforms.  “Crypto winter environments are a very favorable time to find growth partners who are in it for the long haul, as opposed to investors who only want to know if your token has gone up 30% this month,” Agnihotri said in an interview with CoinDesk.  There are currently several DeFi projects under the auspices of Cumberland Lab, added Agnihotri, though he decline to provide details.  Agnihotri continued: “The lab has two broad initiatives: One part is to incubate projects as they come to us, and the other is to launch our own projects. We look out into the ecosystem and see if there’s a product or a project that should exist but doesn’t. And if so, we build it ourselves. So we will create a team and we will fund it and bring in management and launch it ourselves.”  Cumberland Lab was founded by the DRW partners, Agnihotri explained, but strictly speaking it’s not a DRW or Cumberland entity.  “So legally, we’re a different company,"" he said. ""We have our own management, we make our own decisions. Having said that, we do benefit from the wisdom of our founders.

That hurdle is the fact that the securities rules simply do not work for digitally native instruments,” Shirzad wrote.  “Crypto assets that are securities need an updated rulebook to help guide safe and efficient practices,” Shirzad further argued. “Crypto assets that are not securities need the certainty of being outside those rules. Anything short of that will have the effect of entrenching incumbent technologies at the expense of innovation and ultimately, consumers.”  In the petition, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal outlined the key challenges associated with regulating cryptocurrencies, including a lack of clarity on which digital assets constitute securities, and conflicting or unnecessary requirements.  Grewal also listed a series of questions for the SEC to consider in creating a regulatory framework, addressing classification, issuance, trading and custody.  The SEC itself has expressed concern about the lack of regulation surrounding cryptocurrencies. Earlier this week, the commission’s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, told Congress of his desire to expand the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. On the same day, Gensler discussed his concerns with the lack of compliance from recent companies facing bankruptcy.

In an interview with Bloomberg’s “Odd Lots” podcast, Calacanis predicted a wave of litigation targeting promoters of crypto projects, following serious losses by retail investors who traded on the momentum and buzz that some financial institutions and investment moguls created.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “I believe the overwhelming majority of tokens are securities, but they’re being dumped onto retail investors. And this is being done explicitly by venture firms,” Calacanis said. “This is going to blow up in the faces of the venture community.”  Calacanis, who made early investments in future unicorns Uber and Calm, was unwilling to name names. One that might come to mind is Calacanis’ friend, co-podcaster and billionaire co-owner of the Golden State Warriors, Chamath Palihapitiya.  Palihapitiya is a former Facebook executive turned “pro-social” venture capitalist. You might also know him as the “SPAC King,” who promoted a series of special purpose acquisition companies that are now deeply in the red, or the guy who bragged about buying SOL, Solana’s native token, at a discount while looking for a greater fool to offload on.

Mere association doesn't mean Calacanis bears responsibility for his colleagues’ potentially fraudulent activity (former PayPal exec David Sachs, also a cohost of Calacanis’ “All In” podcast, was also a backroom SOL buyer). Calacanis is also largely right in saying that a vast number of crypto tokens are outright scams, or at the least risky “prelaunch companies” that should come with more disclosures.  The line  But it is telling how the powerful and influential protect their kind. Calacanis, a former journalist, isn’t shy of calling out what he sees as injustice – often causing social media rancor. His broader point that VCs have skirted securities laws, promoted and then backed out of useless tokens and given clueless founders a patina of legitimacy is right. But it’s also toothless.  There was another time that Calacanis came up to the edge of actual morality, but fell short. In January, speaking on the “All In” podcast, Palihapitiya said that the ethnic cleansing of Uyghurs in China was “below my line” of concern when it came to investing in that country.  “Disappointing,” Calacanis said in response.  It’s true that investors have to pick and choose their battles. Profit maximalism means identifying good products, with competent founders and – perhaps – doing what you can to help a company succeed. But Palihapitiya, who founded the venture firm Social Capital, claims he has higher ideals like combating climate change or developing poor countries.  It’s also true that Palihapitiya’s position toward the Uyghurs’ plight, while lacking empathy, is likely representative of how his friends think. This happens anywhere money mixes with morality. An aristocratic view, by definition, has to end somewhere.  Speaking out  The problem was Palihapitiya said the quiet part out loud. It was a Kinsleyan gaffe, coined by the former New Republic editor (Michael Kinsley) to describe those moments when politicians “speak an unpalatable truth.”  Calacanis drew his own line around generic VCs or “early investors,” and said “the people who are creating” crypto scams are “99% responsible.” Meanwhile, platforms and exchanges are essentially faultless. Did I mention he’s an investor in Robinhood Markets?  Again, Calacanis isn’t even wrong. But he is clearly clouded by cognitive dissonance caused by his personal stakes and relationships. In one breath, he suggested that only “qualified investors” should be able to trade crypto, and in the next, that people “should be able to gamble” or use their money as they want.  He also said that many who lost while trading crypto knew the risks and should take responsibility for their decisions, and praised millennials and zoomers for their financial acumen.  See also: VCs Pumped $4B Into Crypto Firms in Q2: CB Insights (2021)  I’m not even troubled by Calacanis calling crypto “peak grift.” But he fails to understand how crypto is looking to subvert the traditional financial system by allowing anyone to get involved. Drawing lines cuts people out and skews markets, even if keeping everything open enables low rent hustlers or people like Palihapitiya to enter.  It might be that crypto needs guardrails. Increased regulation rapidly slowed the pace of new SPACs – which Calacanis called “really high-risk, high-reward” investments – likely for the better. But I am concerned about who gets to draw the line and where, and whether there really is something to the idea of radical, open markets.  On either side of the regulatory divide, people still have to call out scammers.",NEGATIVE,SOL,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/21/jason-calacanis-is-right-about-grifting-crypto-vcs-but-confused,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d00034bb5412538541c4e56aed55c186a03c85f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393806,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLtP,1658425656,SEC Calls 9 Cryptos 'Securities' in Insider Trading Case,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission used its first insider-trading case Thursday to formally declare nine digital tokens as “securities“ in its ongoing practice of defining its crypto oversight through enforcement actions.  The federal securities regulator filed a complaint Thursday alleging a former Coinbase (COIN) product manager engaged in insider trading by giving his brother and a friend tips on which assets the exchange planned to list in the near future. In an unusual move, the SEC also explicitly said nine of the crypto assets listed were securities.  While the SEC has identified cryptocurrencies as securities in the past, typically it did so in enforcement actions or settlements with the issuer. But Thursday’s complaint is the first time the SEC identified several cryptocurrencies as securities without charging the issuers – or, for that matter, the exchange listing the so-called securities. The tokens listed were Flexa’s AMP, RLY, DDX, XYO, RGT, LCX, POWR, DFX and KROM.  The SEC declined to comment when sent a detailed set of questions about whether Thursday’s action was a precedent for how it would identify crypto assets it sees as securities; whether it intended to bring enforcement actions against crypto issuers behind the assets identified in Thursday’s action; whether it will bring charges against exchanges listing these assets; and whether it would penalize Coinbase for listing these assets.  An SEC official said the investigation into the underlying insider trading case was ongoing.  In a tweeted statement, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline Pham called the action a “striking example of ‘regulation by enforcement.’”  Attorney Jason Gottlieb, a lawyer with Morrison Cohen LLP, noted that the issuers, Coinbase and any other exchanges that may have listed the cryptocurrencies deemed securities “aren’t parties” to the action, meaning they may not be able to challenge the SEC’s determination in court.  For its part, Coinbase said none of the cryptocurrencies it lists are securities, and pointed to a parallel Department of Justice action that “did not charge securities fraud.”  “The SEC charges are an unfortunate distraction from today’s appropriate law enforcement action,” the Coinbase blog post, which was originally published in April but updated Thursday, said.  The 62-page SEC complaint went through the nine tokens one by one to illustrate how each should be defined under the Howey Test as securities.  “Each of the nine companies invited people to invest on the promise that it would expend future efforts to improve the value of their investment,” the agency asserted in the document.  Coinbase separately filed a petition with the SEC asking for it to start a rulemaking process to detail how it would apply federal securities laws to crypto assets.  “Securities law is thus not well-suited to govern digital assets. Attempted application of such ill-fitting laws to crypto creates a number of problems,” a blog post published Thursday said.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,"Nikhilesh De, Jesse Hamilton",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/21/sec-calls-9-cryptos-securities-in-insider-trading-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f5b782ae3d36ffe51750d22d36542a95e139f95-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its profits have been very much insulated from the volatility in the crypto market. The growth in the bottom-line has been amazing, but the stock price has lagged. Rationale Silvergate ( SI ) is a regulatory play on the Bitcoin ecosystem, with a profile to take advantage of higher interest rates. The company takes advantage of the Bitcoin adoption trend by getting zero-cost funding from institutions using the SEN network. The company applies those funds to high-quality assets (mostly variable-rate). Silvergate has also introduced a lending product called SEN Leverage. It is a Bitcoin collateralized lending product that allows its clients to use their Bitcoin as collateral for funding. The rationale here is very simple. The bank is an FDIC-insured institution operating in the crypto ecosystem, and there aren't many at this stage of the crypto scene. Most startups in the field are not even trying to get regulated, and the ones trying have been going through regulatory hell. Therefore, Silvergate is in an advantageous position to take advantage of the growth in crypto. While at the same time, it is in a good position to take advantage of the rising rates landscape. Silvergate's Business model Silvergate is a traditional bank that became involved in Bitcoin because it needed funding alternatives. Back in 2013, the CEO Alan Lane started researching Bitcoin. After concluding that institutions in the Bitcoin ecosystem had huge problems that traditional Wallstreet banks weren't interested in solving, the company saw an opportunity. The company developed the Silvergate Exchange Network (""SEN""). That network allows clients to move payments in real-time. Additionally, as mentioned before, the company developed SEN lending, a funding solution for Bitcoin holders. Other than that, Silvergate is a traditional bank. However, I believe that their success around Bitcoin will push them more and more into the crypto ecosystem. However, at present (2Q22), the bank is very traditional in its business. It gets funding from clients while it invests in high-grade mortgage securities (97% AA- or higher). More than 50% of the securities are floating rate, which means the company is also well-positioned to take advantage of a rising rate scenario. Silvergate The innovative footprint in Silvergate's business model is the SEN network that has allowed them to scale and get more funding to invest, while the SEN Leverage is broadening their options to offer loans. Their old-school approach to banking is excellent for a regulated company entering the crypto ecosystem. That will likely lead them to avoid the most outrageous business experiments and to go with the most down-to-earth ideas. Because crypto rehypothecation is one of the main sources of trouble for centralized companies operating in the field, and Silvergate seems very conservative in its approach, they will likely avoid significant problems. The company is applying a bread-and-butter approach to its business. On the one hand, it provides valuable help to customers that need to move payments in exchange for cheap funding. On the other hand, they leverage their network to offer over-collateralized loans. On the way, they collect interest margin and substantial fees while holding the optionality for further growth (further expand SEN and to stablecoins). Silvergate's Growth Prospects The company is expanding the SEN network to other currencies like the Euro. Giving their clients the ability to move Euros 24/7 is a valuable addition to their services offerings. Now, the SEN leverage is also driving its yield-generating applications. The growth has been incredible, around 600% YoY, while generating zero losses and no forced liquidations. It is worth noting that in the SEN Leverage direct lending program, Silvergate acts as the custodian, holding the client's Bitcoin, and then the bank loans the money through the SEN network directly to the client's account. The company also provides SEN Leverage indirect lending that might use third parties for custody or digital currency services. In any case, the company can liquidate, if necessary, the collateral. Furthermore, the collateral coverage is set in case of liquidation to yield an amount above the client's loan. Silvergate Silvergate has already revealed that it intends to run a stablecoin network. It even bought Diem assets from Meta (META). The company sees in stablecoins the potential to become global payment rails. Because the bank is an insured depository institution, it might become one of the first regulatory-compliant institutions to offer stablecoin services and products. That will likely drive the next leg in growth for the company. Financial Highlights The strategy started back in 2013 has yielded some impressive results. The SEN network allowed the company to increase its noninterest-bearing deposits and became its main funding source. Silvergate The table above is just deposits related to the digital initiative (total deposits are $14.2 billion). The SEN has also proved valuable in generating a source of noninterest revenues, specifically, fees from services and products associated with the SEN network. Silvergate The impact on the income statement is nothing short of amazing. Interest income has climbed rapidly, while interest expenses have decreased in the same period. If there is a holy grail in banking, that must be as close as you can get. Obviously, the bottom line has also improved significantly, as have the earnings per share. From 2017 to 2021, the EPS grew from 0.79 to 2.91. In short, most metrics have performed incredibly. Silvergate Risks As I have mentioned, the company has a substantial part of its investments in floating rate instruments. Assuming a static balance sheet, a 25bps rise in interest rates will increase net income by 16 million over twelve months, according to the company. However, this can also go the other way. On the other hand, crypto prices tend to list as a significant risk for Silvergate. The company's stock price tends to follow the Bitcoin price. In my opinion, the available data discards the notion that a decrease in Bitcoin's price is bad for business. The way Silvergate's business model is structured has allowed for revenue and net income growth even after huge drawdowns in crypto prices. Seeking Alpha Silvergate However, there are risks associated with crypto. If the industry shrinks permanently (e.g., regulation tightening), Silvergate would be in harm's way due to its reliance on that funding. Additionally, even if the business model is not directly affected by Bitcoin's quotation, it will impact adoption and, therefore, Silvergate's growth. The SEN Leverage loans are another potential source of risks. The first quarter earnings call included a mention of a MacroStrategy loan (MacroStrategy is a subsidiary of MicroStrategy). The company explained that this loan is part of the SEN Leverage segment. After the blowup in several crypto ventures (Luna, 3AC, Voyager), many fear that the SEN loans may carry much more risk than perceived. However, the publicly known details of the loan suggest that this has a low probability of affecting Silvergate. MacroStrategy put up $800 million worth of Bitcoin to support the $200 million loan. The loan concession happened when Bitcoin was trading at around $47 thousand. Since then, the collateral has more than halved. However, it is still close to double the loan amount. Finally, all this growth has its drawback. It triggers the need to raise capital. In my opinion, this type of capital raise is benign. The money goes towards growing the business and not just to mask ill-fated past decisions. Size, however, increases the risk of settlement accidents. Updated Investor Action In a previous article, I argued that the company has the potential to generate around $2.7 per share if it raised capital to increase the SEN deposits and target a 1% ROA. The original table is below: Author I built that more than one year ago. Now, the company has just released its 2Q22 results, and for the first half, it reported EPS of $1.92. The estimation of $2.67 in the table corresponds to a whole year. We will likely exceed that this year. I think the prospects are exciting. How has the share price fared then? Bad, very bad. Since I wrote that article, Silvergate dropped more than 50%. Seeking Alpha There are several reasons for that. One of them being the macro backdrop is terrible, with valuation compressions across the board. More than ever, I believe this stock is a good investment opportunity, even for crypto skeptics. If you are one, bear with me for a second. Silvergate has a conservative management team, running an old-school bank entrenched in a high-growth industry. They apply the same orthodox tactics that gave so many old-school bankers the upper hand in the past. While at the same time, they extract value from one of the fastest-growing fintech sectors. I won't ask any skeptic to drop all their assets and go all-in on this, but I would argue that if there is one good asset for them to enter the crypto scene, that is Silvergate. Trading at 15 forward PE, the company seems to be a value stock with growth potential. One of those opportunities that seldom appears. You can also look at this in the following way. The company last raised capital in 2021 at $145. Now, it has deployed that capital successfully and is already reaping the rewards of that move. Nonetheless, the market now offers the opportunity to enter at roughly half the price.

215021,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496376,1658422806,"Bitcoin Miner Revenues Continue To Plunge, But Will The Rally Change This?","Bitcoin miner revenues have been plummeting ever since the price of BTC peaked back in November. This has put miners in a tight spot, causing a good number of them to sell their BTC holdings in order to keep financing their operations. The same was the case for last week, where miner revenues were once again in the red. However, as the tide begins to change in the crypto market, there may be light at the end of the tunnel for miners. Miner Revenues Down 4% For the past month, daily miner revenues have been trending above $18 million but continued recording losses with each passing week. Last week would put an end to this trend when miner revenue fell once again, this time by 4.03%, causing average daily revenues to drop below $18 million. Reports show that miners saw an average of $17.7 million in revenues, more than 60% down from its peak back in November. Related Reading | Ethereum Classic (ETC) Reclaims $3 Billion Market Cap, More Upside To Follow? What followed this was a sell-off from bitcoin miners across the space. As the profitability plummeted, more BTC had to be offloaded by miners to provide cash flow for their operations. In June alone, miners had sold off 25% of their holdings, and with the prices remaining low, reports for July are expected to show even higher sales for the month of July. For the last two months, bitcoin miners have been selling more BTC than they were producing. For the month of May, they had sold more than 100% of the BTC produced. This number had jumped 400% in June when public miners sold approximately 14,600 BTC when they had only produced a total of 3,900 BTC, accounting for 25% of all of their holdings. BTC drops to $22,700 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Surprisingly, fees per day were up 12.61% last week, which brought the percentage of revenue gotten from fees to 2.59%, a 0.38% increase from the prior week. Will The Bitcoin Rally Help? The recent rally in the market has seen the price of bitcoin reclaim key technical levels and reach one-month highs. The digital asset had even briefly touched above $24,000 before trending back down, and the first half of the week had been green for the digital asset. Related Reading | Why Bitcoin Must Beat $25,500 To Establish A Bull Rally Since the profitability of bitcoin mining is directly tied to the price of the digital asset, it is safe to assume that there may be some uptick in miner revenues for this week. Given that price was trending around $19,000 for most of last week, an increase above $22,000 will see public bitcoin miners realize more revenue from their mining operations. However, given that the price had not recovered by a wide margin, the rise in daily miner revenue is expected to remain under double-digits. It is also important to note that there is more demand for block space, leading to higher transaction fees on the network, contributing more to the daily miner revenues.

The South American country's grid runs almost entirely on hydroelectric power, with a price of around 5 cents per kilowatt hour thanks to dams built on some of the world's biggest rivers. Most of the electricity from the Itaipu dam, the world's largest in terms of average annual energy production, is exported to Brazil under a treaty that is set to expire in 2023.  The Paraguay government is looking to attract bitcoin (BTC) miners to soak up excess energy. Last week, the country's Senate passed a bill to regulate the industry. The bill requires miners to be licensed by authorities.  The 100 MW secured by the Commons Foundation will create 1,000 jobs over the next four years in Villa Hayes at district Jose Falcon in central Paraguay, according to a press release sent to CoinDesk.  The contract between the Paraguay Electrical Authority (ANDE) and the Commons Foundation sets the price for the electricity at $30.78 per megawatt hour (mWh). However the price can be readjusted annually, as well as depending on regulations, under the terms of the deal. Miners usually prefer fixed-price agreements, locking in prices in advance so that they are not affected by price fluctuations.  ""Our contract today is a historic day for Paraguay. I am confident that this business will succeed and attract more investors,"" said ANDE Chairman Félix Sosa in the press release.  The contract was signed on July 15 but announced on Thursday.  The Commons Foundation is a Singapore-based organization that invests in crypto and blockchain projects.  Canadian firm Bitfarms (BITF) operates a 10 MW mining site in south-central Paraguay.

Other than saying the purchase will not necessarily be another crypto exchange, Rabelo declined to give more details, saying Mercado is awaiting regulatory approval for the deal.  Mercado Brazil parent 2TM raised $200 million from Softbank roughly one year ago, planning to use those funds to help expand across Latin America. Though the company did enter Portugal through an acquisition earlier this year, in Latin America it continues to operate only in Brazil.  Rabelo said he’s “looking at the Latin American market a bit more cautiously,” due to the struggling crypto market. 2TM last month laid off over 80 employees citing “the changing global financial landscape, rising interest rates and inflation.”  With its arrival in Mexico, Mercado Bitcoin plans to compete in the main market of its largest Latin American peer, Mexico-based crypto exchange Bitso, which started operations in Brazil last year.  The Mexican market stands out as one of the major crypto opportunities in Latin America, especially because of its remittance business.  Bitso processed $1 billion in crypto remittances between Mexico and the U.S. in the first half of 2022, while Tether launched its MXNT token pegged to Mexico's peso and Coinbase (COIN) enabled a cash-out service in the country.

Looking at the price of staked ethereum ( ETH-USD ), otherwise known as stETH, it's previously substantial discount to ether (dropping to as low as 0.8000 earlier in 2022) has narrowed closer to parity in a move that implies ""the acute deleveraging phase has now finished,"" Ayoub explained. That liquidity preference has coincided with ether's ( ETH-USD ) 33.5% jump over the past month. stETH is a token that represents one unit of ether ( ETH-USD ) that has been locked up to support the blockchain's upgraded network, a.k.a the beacon chain. Users typically use stETH to earn rewards -- similar to an IOU. Celsius, the formerly prominent crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy in mid-July, held more than 410K stETH, ""which appeared to cause speculative sales on fears of a liquidation into a relatively illiquid market,"" Ayoub noted, adding that ""this moved the stETH price further away from par."" Furthermore, the contagion effects into broader financial markets is unlikely given cryptos' relatively small market value, Ayoub wrote. The global crypto market cap recently stood at $1.03T vs. its November peak of $3T. That's tiny when compared with the U.S. equity market at $34T. ""We believe most mainstream financial firms are waiting for further regulatory clarity or are still at an early stage of exploring crypto investing,"" the note said.

Investors in the round included Jump Crypto, Wintermute, GSR, LedgerPrime, QCP, Altonomy, Dragonfly Capital, Electric Capital and the venture capital arms of cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken.  Founded in 2021, San Francisco-based Hashflow offers a decentralized exchange (DEX) backed by a request-for-quote (RFQ) pricing model that allows for cross-chain interoperability, low transaction or gas fees, high liquidity and no slippage, a common problem in volatile markets where the price of a trade changes between initiation and completion.  How it works  Hashflow said its RFQ model differs from most prominent DeFi trading platforms, which use automated market makers (AMM), or smart contract-backed protocols that use mathematical formulas to price assets. AMM models have their benefits but are also prone to high transaction fees and slippage. Uniswap is an example of an AMM.  Read more: What Is an Automated Market Maker?  Hashflow’s trading platform pairs traders with professional market makers to set token prices in what is essentially a type of on-demand price comparison shopping. The off-chain structure makes for better asset prices and means transactions are guaranteed to go through.  “Uniswap got people excited about DeFi by essentially bringing the simplicity of trading to anyone,” Hashflow founder Varun Kumar told CoinDesk in an interview. “We are scaling DeFi in the sense that, as markets mature, it all comes down to better pricing execution, guaranteeing that the trade will go through and being able to trade any asset class on any chain.

42395136,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXHlQ,1658416930,Ex-Coinbase Manager Among 3 Arrested on Crypto Insider Trading Charges,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged former Coinbase (COIN) product manager Ishan Wahi, his brother Nikhil Wahi and Sameer Ramani with wire fraud and insider trading on Thursday.  The DOJ alleged in a press release that Ishan Wahi shared information about what crypto assets Coinbase would list with Nikhil Wahi and/or Ramani prior to the actual listing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also brought charges against the three tied to the same insider trading allegations.  In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams of the Southern District of New York noted this was the second insider-trading case in crypto the DOJ has brought.  Ishan Wahi allegedly shared information about at least 14 different listings at Coinbase. According to the DOJ's press release, the defendants used anonymous Ethereum wallets and exchange accounts in other people's names to buy at least 25 different cryptocurrencies and potentially make up to $1.5 million (though the SEC release put the figure closer to $1.1 million).  The cryptocurrencies traded include TRIBE, ALCX, XYO, GALA, ENS and POWR, among others, according to the release.  The DOJ's indictment also referenced a Cobie tweet which identified an Ethereum address ""that bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens"" on an asset listing post from Coinbase, before the exchange actually published it.  Ishan Wahi was arrested on Thursday but has been on law enforcement's radar for months, according to the release. Officials stopped him from boarding a plane to India in mid-May.  ""Today I announce the first-ever insider trading case involving cryptocurrency markets. Our message with these charges is clear: fraud is fraud is fraud, whether it occurs on the blockchain or on Wall Street. And the Southern District of New York will continue to be relentless in bringing fraudsters to justice, wherever we may find them,"" Williams said.  Coinbase itself is not being charged. According to the DOJ, the exchange was also investigating allegations of insider trading.  Notably, the SEC did say in its complaint that some of the assets listed, such as POWR, AMP, RLY, DDX and LCX, were ""crypto asset securit[ies].""  ""As used in this complaint, 'crypto asset security' refers to an asset that is issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology – including, but not limited to, so-called 'digital assets,' 'virtual currencies,' 'coins,' and 'tokens' – and that meets the definition of 'security' under the federal securities laws,"" the SEC complaint said.  Coinbase said in a statement that it ""takes allegations of improper use of company information very seriously, as demonstrated by our rapid investigation of this matter. Again, we have zero tolerance for this kind of misconduct and will not hesitate to take action against any employee when we find wrongdoing.""  ""We appreciate the DOJ’s recognition of our help in holding these individuals accountable,"" the statement said.  UPDATE (July 21, 2022, 15:45 UTC): Adds context throughout.

42395144,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXHuH,1658416560,Tribal Groups in Remote Indian Area Get Blockchain Caste Certificates,"India has begun issuing blockchain “caste certificates” to up to 65,000 tribal members in a remote region in an attempt to stop fraudulent claims on government benefits for the disadvantaged.  Political corruption led to the idea  The project, in the western state of Maharashtra, was announced in March and is the brainchild of Shubham Gupta, 28, an officer of the Indian Administrative Services. Gupta conceived the idea after encountering a former elected politician in his area of jurisdiction who had fraudulently acquired tribal land by presenting himself as a tribal member with a fake caste certificate.  While the politician had been convicted by the Supreme Court of India, it took Gupta's administrative muscle to make him return the land to the tribes. It was just one of a large number of cases of politicians and job seekers using fake caste certificates to win benefits.  India's caste system remains a deeply entrenched reality, and despite laws, such as the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, social discrimination and atrocities against disadvantaged castes continue to persist. Of the country's 1.3 billion population, more than 40% belongs to disadvantaged castes, and 9% are tribal members.  ""Nobody here knows what crypto is but ...""  ""Today, as a start, we are delivering 100 caste certificates, which are built on blockchain through a paper representation with a verifiable QR code,"" said Gupta, who is effectively the administrative head of the Etapalli subdivision of Gadchiroli in the state of Maharashtra.  Of the region's population of 250,000, roughly 80%, or 200,000, are tribal members. The first phase of the project will see the delivery of certificates to 65,000 members.  ""Everyone thinks of development as providing basic livelihood needs like food, bamboos for shelter, a cow or a goat (through animal husbandry schemes), but nobody has thought of equity for them, probably because the people here are not tech savvy,"" Gupta said. ""So, what I tried to do was give them equity through exposure so that their children may learn about blockchain and do something in the future.""  While the implementation is being done by a three-man government team led by Gupta, Legit Doc – a private platform using blockchain to make tamper-proof digital documents that was commissioned through a government process – brought the idea to life on the Polygon protocol.  ""We are using polygon to make caste certificates impossible to forge and easily verifiable,"" said Neil Martis, co-founder and project lead at LegitDoc.     Gupta sold shoes as a child  As a 15-year-old, Gupta used to work in his father's shoe shop in Dahanu, a small town his family had moved to after suffering setbacks in the major northwestern city of Jaipur.  ""My sister and I had no option but to take a 5:50 a.m. train from Dahanu to Vapi everyday,"" recalled Gupta. ""As a bigger city, Vapi offered us proper schooling. We would take the return train at 1:30 p.m. so that I could come back by 3 p.m. to run the shoe shop till 10 p.m.""  Gupta made four attempts to get a top rank in the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), India's premier central recruitment agency for all Group ""A"" officers. He didn't qualify the first time, but ranked sixth in the country in his final attempt.  ""It was during my preparations for the UPSC exams that I was fascinated by blockchain technology,"" Gupta said.  In a coincidence, Gupta's blockchain caste certificate project happens to be starting on the same day when India for the first time has elected a tribal member as its president, with Droupadi Murmu garnering a majority of votes.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MATIC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/21/blockchain-caste-certificates-get-delivered-to-tribal-groups-in-remote-indian-area,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cefc804a3b34889b34e3570336f1843f50abbbd-1421x1066.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Yesterday, the Elon Musk-led car manufacturer Tesla announced that it sold 75% of its BTC holdings to convert them into fiat currency. Related Reading | Cardano (ADA), After 35% Spike, Locks On Next Target: $0.55 This has thrown fuel on speculations about other big BTC holders unloading their assets into the market. MicroStrategy and its CEO Michael Saylor have been the target of a majority of these speculations. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s third wealthiest address identified as 1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ, has transferred 29,200 BTC to exchange platforms. Crypto users believe this is MicroStrategy’s BTC address. Therefore, they speculate the software company sent their BTC to crypto exchange Coinbase. Over the past week, this address transferred 132,800 BTC to this platform which is roughly the amount held by the Saylor-led company. Did Tesla Trigger A Bitcoin Selling Domino Effect? Research firm Jarvis Labs questioned the rumors claiming the address most likely belongs to a “top trader”. The wallet has been accumulating Bitcoin since January 2019. MicroStrategy and Saylor disclosed that their first BTC purchase took place in 2020. The software company is a publicly-traded company in the U.S. and must be transparent about its treasury strategy or risk facing legal consequences. Jarvis Labs highlighted the complexity of labeling BTC addresses and dismissed the rumors with the following statement: Wallet labels are incredibly complex and a sensitive topic. As they lack confirmations from the concerned party most of the time. So take such noise with a grain of salt. Relax, he has not been selling yet, even if assumed it was Saylor’s MSTR wallet. Saylor Replies To Rumours On Their Bitcoin Holdings CEO at CryptoQuant Ki Young Ju claimed the rumors about the wallet unloading their Bitcoin into the market are “FUD”. The executive said the transactions associated to address 1P5Z are part of an internal transfer. In that sense, Young Ju said the BTC might have been sent to a cold or custodian wallet potentially owned by crypto exchange Gemini. Young Ju said: For the record, “1FzW…” has closer ties to hot wallets like “1NYA…” and “bc1quq…” and these are not Coinbase or OKx. These are Gemini hot wallets.Lots of on-chain data providers mislabeled them. See this tweet for more details.

Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is falling 7.2% to $22.4K but elevated by 9.5% over the past week. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) -7.3% , the world's largest altcoin by market cap, is also dipping to $1.48K as of shortly before 10:30 a.m. ET, though still up nearly 24% in the past five sessions. From a technical perspective, ""the positive momentum can still be conserved if the price rebounds from the current levels within the next couple of days,"" said Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36. ""However, on the Bitcoin 4-hour chart, the price has been printing a bear flag which makes the retest of the lower low - and potentially a breakdown - possible as well."" Turning to Tesla's ( TSLA ) sale of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the EV manufacturer's CEO Elon Musk said his company's move was driven by its desire to raise cash in the event that COVID-related lockdowns in China would impact its factories in the country. So, it wasn't necessarily related to bearish prospects for Bitcoin, though Musk did mention that the crypto isn't contributing to an environmentally favorable environment yet given its energy intensive Proof-of-Work-based blockchain. ""I think this is an example of good risk management from the world’s richest man,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in a note. ""Without their Bitcoin sale, their net change in cash would have been negative $89m, which is not desirable, and Bitcoin preceded to fall by around 40% after Tesla sold,"" he added. While Tesla ( TSLA ) sold 75% of its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings during the second quarter, retail investors are buying the crypto at the fastest rate ever, Sotiriou said, citing data from Glassnode. Specifically, the 90-day change in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) addresses with less than one coin is at record highs in a move that demonstrates a vote of confidence in BTC's long-term value, the note said. In the near-term, the token has fallen roughly 65% from its November peak. Some other popular cryptos trading in negative territory intraday include: ripple ( XRP-USD ) -5.6% , cardano ( ADA-USD ) -8.2% , solana ( SOL-USD ) -8.1% , dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) -6.8% , polkadot ( DOT-USD ) -7% , avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) -6.1% and shiba inu ( SHIB-USD ) -8.6% .

To establish itself as a regional fintech company, SCB X Group, a division of Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), planned to buy a 51% share in Bitkub by the second quarter of 2022. Things now appear to have changed because the bank has indefinitely paused the plan to buy the well-liked exchange. SCB X has chosen indefinitely not to proceed with a $487 million offer for a 51 % share in Bitkub. The parent company of SCB, SCB X, reportedly informed the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) on Thursday that the acquisition is “still undergoing due diligence.” The squad doesn’t know when the agreement will be finalized – a top SCB X official told the site. Thailand is Asia’s most progressive country in crypto, with tax incentives for traders and a regulated market for cryptocurrency exchanges. SEC, Bank of Thailand Announced Stronger Crypto Laws However, many cryptocurrency exchanges, like Binance and Huobi, have already had trouble with the country’s governmental regulations and rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand recently announced stronger cryptocurrency laws and usage restrictions. This ensures that cryptocurrencies can only be exchanged as assets on accredited platforms. Sakolkorn Sakavee, the chairman of Bitkub Capital Group Holdings, was fined by the SEC on July 2 for fabricating trade volume data. He received a $216,000 punishment (8 million baht) and a 12-month supervisory employment suspension from the company.

The integrations, which mark the launch of “Zapper v2,” or second version, add to the platform’s already extensive decentralized finance (DeFi) dashboards for which the company is known.  Zapper says its new platform touts over 260 Web3 app integrations, with its services having already been used by 1 million users since its launch two years ago, according to a release.  Analytics dashboards from Zapper and its many competitors mostly operate under the same thesis: The evolution of new blockchain industries, such as NFTs and DAOs, is outpacing the tools to track their development.  “A lot of products operate in a silo, even the analytics products,” Seb Audet, CEO of Zapper, told CoinDesk in an interview. “There are very few products that bridge DeFi with NFTs and DAOs. For us, the important part is the composability and the connection between the ecosystems.”  Audet describes a “Wikipedia-like” vision for the new site, where users can endlessly click and find new information within each page.  The Zapper v2 NFT dashboard allows users to take a deeper look at individual collections, even offering its own price estimation tool that updates in real time based on sale prices.  Users can also profile wallet holders of various collections, tapping into on-chain information, such as token holdings and dates of purchase.  The platform also allows users to follow the wallet activity of their favorite collectors, adding a social spin to the otherwise information-dense experience of tracking on-chain data. Audet says the company plans to eventually integrate a dedicated social feed into its dashboards, a la Coinbase’s new NFT marketplace.  The platform’s DAO dashboard shows users the total value of the different DAO treasuries, along with analytics for its collective holders.

We're Bradley Keoun and Shaurya Malwa, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  (First Mover lead author Lyllah Ledesma is in Paris for the EthCC conference. Her dispatch from the conference on Wednesday is here. Spoiler alert: Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin was overheard ordering a hot water during one of Europe's worst heat waves in recent memory.)  Price Point: Crypto analysts were racing to assess the impact of Tesla's bitcoin sales as well as Thursday's decision by the European Central Bank to move to hike interest rates at an accelerated pace.  Market Moves: As crypto analysts scramble to assess whether the market bottom is in, Wall Street's JPMorgan is now weighing in. Oliver Knight reports.  JUST IN: The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday raised borrowing costs for the first time in 11 years, exiting the six-year era of the negative interest rate policy (NIRP). The ECB's exit from the NIRP is pivotal, since the unorthodox practice of setting borrowing costs below zero was considered by many as a sign of cracks in the traditional financial regime – a common theme among cryptocurrency analysts. Read Omkar Godbole's breaking story here.  This web version of today's First Mover newsletter was produced by Sage D. Young.  Price Point  Cryptocurrencies reversed Wednesday’s price gains as traders took profits after days of an uptrend, causing bitcoin to slip below $23,000 and majors taking hits of as much as 10% in the past 24 hours.  Solana’s SOL slid 8.8% to lead losses among majors. Cardano’s ADA fell 8%, dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 7%, while XRP and BNB fell nearly 5%. Ether dipped but continued to trade above the $1,500 level.  A drop in bitcoin prices came as electric carmaker Tesla said in an earnings report on Wednesday that it sold $936 million worth of bitcoin, or 75% of its holdings, in the second quarter. CEO Elon Musk cited “the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China” as a crucial reason for its decision. Musk added the company did not trim its dogecoin holdings.  However, Musk said Tesla is open to increasing its bitcoin holdings again in the future and noted that the second-quarter sale ""should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin.”  Analysts said retail investors should not take the bitcoin sale as a caution sign. “Having the billionaire’s company sell a majority of its BTC holdings shouldn’t necessarily be taken as a statement or reflection of Elon Musk’s position towards Bitcoin,” said Claudiu Minea, CEO of crowdfunding platform SeedOn in a Telegram chat. “This is likely more of a need for liquidity for the company as their profitability for Q2 has suffered due to the current downward trend for bitcoin’s price.""  “Therefore, the decision to sell might be due to the need for cash on the balance sheet, rather than not seeing bitcoin as a valuable asset anymore,” Minea said.

Crypto analysts and traders warn that there might still be another price drop on the way. But the signals are turning more bullish.  Demand among retail investors in the crypto market is improving, and the ""intense phase"" of deleveraging appears to be over, JPMorgan Chase wrote Thursday in a report.

Dogecoin Core 1.14.6, the most recent update, went live early on Thursday, and all network users were asked to update. The most recent version includes several new features, adjustments to the current cost structure, and various security updates. The “breaking changes” also include a restriction on the maximum number of addnode records and a change to the setup of the wallet backup directory. There can only be 800 addnodes at a time. The dust limitations for all network participants have decreased from 1 DOGE to 0.01 DOGE, a crucial enhancement to DOGE’s fee structure. Dogecoin Community Introduced Dogeverse The “Doge Army” was ecstatic by the news, with “Doge father” Elon Musk mostly tweeting “Upgrades” as his main message. Later, Billy Markus, the inventor of Dogecoin, tweeted about the incident with the caption “new version of dogecoin core released.” The update follows a period of positive emotion in the Dogecoin community that introduced memes to the Dogeverse and a considerable rise in network activity. For the first time since May 2021 this week, the network processed more than 80,000 transactions in 24 hours on Wednesday as Whales continued to show interest. Giant whales on Binance are particularly fond of the dog meme token. The network has seen a marked surge in transactions costing over $100,000 since the most recent market rally.

At the developer-focused conference, Buterin spoke about the upcoming ""Merge"" in which Ethereum will make a full transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Discussing the Merge's long-term and short-term outcomes, Buterin said, ”After the merge you will be able to build an Ethereum client that does not even know the proof-of-work phase even happened.""  He also said that the network's roadmap includes the ""Surge,"" which will increase scalability for rollups through sharding.  Read more: Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding  ""At the end of this road map, Ethereum will be a much more scalable system,"" said Buterin. ""By the end, Ethereum will be able to process 100,000 transactions per second.""  He added that in terms of Ethereum's overall network development, the protocol will be ""55% complete once we finish the Merge."" Thus, there is much more work for developers ahead.  For now, Buterin outlined that the deep changes to the network will include updates to its monetary policy and token issuance, its security model and its transaction inclusion process.  He noted that pursuing these decentralized goals is difficult because of the complexity of the network and how quickly it is changing. But, he added, everyone has been looking forward to these upgrades to the network for a long time.  ""Who here wants to cancel proof-of-stake?"" Buterin asked the audience. Not one hand went up.  ""Even if you want to, we're not going to cancel it,"" he quipped.  Ether (ETH) is currently trading up 34% over the last month and at the time of writing was around $1,500.  At last year's EthCC, Buterin gave a talk on ""things that matter outside of DeFi"" and said that Ethereum had to expand beyond decentralized finance (DeFi).  Thursday appeared to be the busiest day for the conference, with many attendees saying that they thought the final day of the conference would be the best due to Buterin's talk.

42395141,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXHtI,1658408879,Bitcoin Nonprofit ₿trust Launches Africa Open Source Cohort; Names First Developer,"₿trust has selected Vladimir Fomene as the founding member of its Africa Open Source Cohort. ₿trust is a nonprofit organization created to decentralize Bitcoin software development by locating, educating and remunerating Bitcoin developers in the global south (Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean). It was initially funded by Block (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey and rapper/entrepreneur Jay-Z in February 2021 with a donation of 500 BTC.  ₿trust’s Africa Open Source Cohort program is designed for long-term contribution. New members will be expected to sign a one-year contract to start. Compensation will be based on a number of factors, including the extent of each developer's contribution to open-source Bitcoin projects. Cohort developers will receive professional management, mentorship, support from peers, assistance with relationship management and financial support (e.g., stipends for hardware and miscellaneous expenses).  ₿trust board member Obi Nwosu calls this type of investment into the Bitcoin ecosystem a form of speculative philanthropy – investing that seeks to increase the aggregate value of an ecosystem rather than to maximize traditional financial measures of return.  Read more: Jack Dorsey, Jay-Z Put 500 Bitcoin Into Trust Supporting Africa and India  Who is Vladimir Fomene?  Fomene is a Cameroonian software engineer with a self-confessed preference for JavaScript and Rust. He heard about bitcoin in 2014, but it took several key events to turn him into a bitcoin convert. The first was a divisive 2018 election in his homeland. Then came civil unrest in neighboring Nigeria where locals were protesting police brutality. The straw that broke the camel’s back may have been the consistent devaluation of Cameroon’s Central Africa CFA franc. All of these events left Fomene deeply distrustful of traditional governments and bitcoin appeared to be a viable currency alternative. “It became clear to me that we had given governments too much power, and they could abuse it,” Fomene wrote on his blog.  Fomene will primarily work on the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) – a suite of tools and libraries designed to improve bitcoin wallet development. He also plans to contribute to Swahili Wordlist – a project designed to enable Swahili-based mnemonic phrases (easy to remember words used to recover a bitcoin wallet). According to a United Nations estimate, over 200 million people in Africa speak Swahili.  Decentralizing Bitcoin development  In an interview with CoinDesk, Nwosu said he sees Bitcoin decentralization yielding benefits similar to what we have seen with the collaborative approach adopted by mathematicians and other sciences.  Distrust in government is a common theme throughout the global south, Nwosu said. This makes the region fertile ground for bitcoin adoption. Regions dominated by authoritarian governments need bitcoin the most. If that is indeed the case, he argued, why not invest and nurture Bitcoin developer communities in those regions?  Another consideration is developer centralization. While mining centralization is a frequently discussed issue, developer centralization receives much less attention. Currently, Bitcoin development seems to be concentrated in the global north (Europe, North America and Australasia). Efforts like ₿trust are designed to onboard developers from all regions of the Bitcoin community.  This decentralization strategy becomes even more critical as key Bitcoin Core developers resign from their positions. Over the past year and a half, several Bitcoin developers and maintainers have left their roles (John Newbery, Samuel Dobson, Jonas Schnelli and Peter Wuille). If ₿trust achieves its goal of locating, educating and remunerating Bitcoin developers in the global south, Bitcoin development stands to benefit from a large pool of geographically diverse developers ready to fill the shoes of outgoing contributors.  Read more: Bitcoin Core Developer Pieter Wuille Scales Back His Maintenance Role  Scaling the cohort program across the global south  Since ₿trust first received its funding, many key developments have quietly taken place. It set up its board of directors and established a set of principles. However, it is still in the process of finalizing its organizational structure. Once that step is complete, additional developers will be recruited. Eventually, lessons learned in Africa will be used to improve expansion efforts in other regions of the global south. Nwosu, calls this, “responsibly scaling” – developing a replicable cohort model and minimizing the disruption caused by new and inexperienced developers as they enter the Bitcoin development community.  ₿trust joins the ranks of other prominent Bitcoin development funding organizations like Brink, Spiral, Qala and Chaincode Labs in supporting the people who are building the open-source technology that underpins the ecosystem.

The bill likewise governed stablecoins. Stablecoin legislation was approved The previous evening during the chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi’s thematic speech. Although stablecoin regulation was always intended to be a part of the bill, some observers were worried about its future in light of the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency market and the departure of pro-crypto members of the government earlier in July, including Rishi Sunak’s predecessor John Glen and Economic Secretary to the Treasury. 2.

The Banking Act of 2009 and the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act of 2013 were expanded to include “digital settlement assets” (DSAs) by the law. It gave the Treasury the authority to control DSAs, payments made with DSAs, service providers for DSAs, and DSA insolvency plans. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Bank of England, and other regulators will be consulted as necessary during the creation of such regulations. Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, has a history of being skeptical of cryptocurrencies and has consistently argued for further regulation of the industry. In a lecture on July 12, he compared the present cryptocurrency regulatory environment to “unsafe aeroplanes,” citing notably the demise of Terra (LUNA), now known as Terra Classic (LUNC).

The Frankfurt-based central bank raised the deposit facility rate, or the main policy rate, by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) to zero from -0.5%. The increase was greater than the 25 basis point increase that economists had predicted on average, and the ECB signaled ""further normalization"" ahead.  ""Frontloading the exit from negative rates allows the ECB to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to rate decisions,"" the central bank said, adding that the decision is based on the back's updated assessment of inflation risks.  The ECB said it will launch a new bond-purchasing program to counter the risk of fragmentation of the economic union or disorderly movement in bond yields across the common currency area. Recently, bond markets in highly indebted nations like Italy saw heightened volatility relative to German bonds, signaling potential fragmentation in the European Union.  The ECB's rate hike comes four months after the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) kicked off its tightening cycle. Since then, the Fed has hiked rates by 150 basis points, putting asset markets under pressure.  The ECB's exit from the NIRP is pivotal, since the unorthodox practice of setting borrowing costs below zero was considered by many as a sign of cracks in the traditional financial regime – a common theme among cryptocurrency analysts.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has held steady around $22,700 since the ECB announced a bigger-than-expected rate hike at 12:15 UTC.

42421489,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUsH,1658407800,The Case for Investing in Bitcoin During Crypto Winter,"Winter has come to the land of bitcoin (BTC). This is my second “bitcoin winter,” and I expect to endure more such seasons in the future.  In these frigid times, clients may ask their advisors why they recommend owning one of the most volatile major assets in history. These clients don't tend to mind the volatility on the upside, but they can lose their nerve on the way down.  For that reason, sometimes all they need is a reminder about how the strengths of bitcoin – and long-term benefits of owning it – could greatly outweigh the risks.  Bitcoin is a survivor  Since its inception, bitcoin has collapsed in value by over 50% half a dozen times. And of those times, four led to sustained crypto winters.  Bitcoin, however, has managed to rebound successfully from all of the crypto winters prior to the most recent downturn. That gives us confidence that bitcoin can survive yet another slide.  Read more: Tesla's Musk Remains Open to Buying More Bitcoin After Selling in Q2 to Raise Cash  And bitcoin, in particular, has been more resilient throughout changes in seasons than any other project in the crypto market.  Take a look at the top 20 digital assets at the moment. Now wind the clock back just five years to the onset of the last bull market. How many of the top 20 tokens then remain on the leaderboard? How many of them have ever returned to their former glory, relative to bitcoin, over two price cycles?  Stratis, bitshares, bytecoin, golem, steem, saicoin, bitconnect … these coins don’t even trade within the top 100 by market cap anymore. A historical snapshot shows that even the top 10 tokens by market cap have endured tremendous fluctuation over the recent years.  Of all the digital assets that people trade today, bitcoin has remained the largest by market cap since its inception over 13 years ago. All the while, it has delivered attractive investment returns over every historical five-year period.  Bitcoin enhances a portfolio  Speaking of historical returns, when I published “Why Buy Bitcoin” in 2019, I included an analysis of the risk and return benefits of including bitcoin in a diversified portfolio based on historical price data.  Modern portfolio theory supports the idea that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” Bitcoin, together with other diverse assets, could help protect investors against – and let them take advantage of – an array of economic scenarios.  Read more: How Are Institutions and Companies Investing in Crypto?  Even after the recent drop in bitcoin's price, analysis still supports the benefits of bitcoin's inclusion in a diversified portfolio. The numbers are clear – bitcoin has added value to diversified portfolios.  Bitcoin outscores gold  While bitcoin offers numerous ways to win as an investment, the clearest case is as ""digital gold.""  Like gold, bitcoin is a monetary asset and store of value. Bitcoin shares the characteristic of scarcity that people love so much about gold.  But when measured against many of the most important characteristics of money, bitcoin has a number of advantages over gold, including transferability, divisibility, whether it can be seized, security and privacy.  Read more: Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists  We can send bitcoin electronically in unlimited amounts, unlike the case with gold. We can easily divide it up into small increments, unlike a gold bar. While bitcoin is still nascent and not immune to cyberthreats, it can be held securely in an encrypted digital wallet as opposed to gold bars that are difficult to safeguard. And, unlike gold, bitcoin can be exchanged without banking and governmental intermediaries that directly monitor payments.  One additional advantage of bitcoin: At less than 4% of gold's total value today, bitcoin still has further room to run.  Bitcoin lets people be their own bankers  Most clients of financial advisors aren’t ready yet to hold their own bitcoin. They would rather hold it as part of an exchange-traded fund, for example, than purchase it on a crypto exchange.  But, over time, many of these clients will become visionaries and be more inclined to buy and hold bitcoin themselves. In anticipation of economic turmoil in the future, they will recognize the value of having some portion of their net worth in an asset that is extraordinarily difficult to seize and that can be moved to any place that has an internet connection.  Because bitcoin doesn’t require intermediaries that possess the asset, everyday people can maintain possession of it, unlike with fiat money that is susceptible to bank runs during extreme economic scenarios.  The real risks  People ask me what would change my mind about bitcoin as an investment. For a full treatment of this topic, you can find 40-plus pages of risk factors in “Why Buy Bitcoin.”  But there are really only three that advisors and their clients should focus on in the near term.  1. Technical failure of the system  One of the few events that could cause me to change my investment thesis on bitcoin is a technical failure of the system. If the Bitcoin network stops cranking out blocks of transactions regularly, that's a major red flag.  This hasn't happened in the five years I've been watching bitcoin closely. But if it does, I'll reassess.  2. Regulation  Is tougher regulation coming for digital assets? Undoubtedly.  That's why, from a regulatory standpoint, there's never been a better time to own bitcoin.  I'm no securities lawyer, but my analysis indicates it's the only major digital asset that is unambiguously not a security based on the securities industry standard Howey Test. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler seems to agree.  3. Government rectitude  If you think the Federal Reserve is going to push the economy into a depression to flush out the debt that has accumulated over the past eight decades, then you might want to avoid hard money assets like gold and bitcoin. Dollars will be king.  But if you think the powers that be would prefer not to bring on a second Great Depression and that the far more likely path to dealing with the debt is inflation, then bitcoin probably has a role in your clients' portfolios. In my view, governments will struggle to contain inflation in the 2020s – so much so that bitcoin may become the most important major asset in clients' portfolios.  If that scenario unfolds, financial advisors will find themselves struggling to explain how they missed the most important major asset of the decade.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Andy Edstrom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/21/the-case-for-investing-in-bitcoin-during-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da04f7886f9e41258ecf46ffea094c978f9a6cd1-5120x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421488,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUrF,1658407800,How Two Asset Managers Are Handling 2022’s Crypto Volatility,"The key to long-term investing success in cryptocurrencies is really no different than it is for investing in any other growth-oriented, volatile asset class: Time in the market beats timing the market.  The problem is that severe downswings, characteristic of cryptocurrencies, can cause many investors to lose faith in buy-and-hold strategies. And the challenge, from an advisor’s perspective, is getting clients to stay invested.  The reason advisors should encourage their clients to stay invested is that the latest sell-off provides an abundance of opportunities for investors.  Brad Roth, chief investment officer at Thor Financial Technologies, emphasized the importance of not only staying invested but adding to investments in the current market climate: “We’ve seen a 60% drawdown in bitcoin this year. Now is not the time to throw in the towel. It’s time to look for opportunities. We don’t want clients making the wrong decisions at the wrong times, because history repeats itself.”  Read more: Tesla's Musk Remains Open to Buying More Bitcoin After Selling in Q2 to Raise Cash  However, investors who can't stomach the full brunt of the volatility of crypto prices may want to consider risk-managed trading strategies.  While risk management comes at a price, that price may be worth getting clients some exposure to the growth that cryptocurrencies offer.  After the ups and downs of the past seven months, it feels like a good time to revisit how professionals are mitigating the volatility of digital assets.  Two strategies to manage risk in crypto  Thor Financial Technologies offers a pair of such strategies designed to trade in and out of bitcoin and ethereum to avoid downside volatility.  “Our two main strategies are risk-managed spot bitcoin and risk-managed spot ethereum,” Roth said. “Relative to the amount of drawdown, we’ve done exceptionally well. Those strategies move to a risk-off mode or safe mode. Instead of investing in an altcoin or a stablecoin, we favor just putting them into cash.”  At the beginning of the recent drawdown, Thor’s strategies traded out of bitcoin and ethereum and into cash where they remain today. Roth said that his strategies are designed to avoid trading as crypto prices move sideways and that he probably won’t reenter the market until bitcoin prices break above $24,000 or $25,000. At that point, Thor’s strategies will begin to compound in value again from the lower price without having taken the 50% to 60% hit that most tokens have suffered in 2022.  Read more: How Are Institutions and Companies Investing in Crypto?  ZX Squared Capital, a digital asset hedge fund, also invests in bitcoin and ethereum. However, it manages risk using options and futures to achieve a higher Sharpe ratio, signifying better risk-adjusted returns.  “People are observing right now and trying to figure out how to get some exposure to this asset class. We think there’s an opportunity going forward, especially as this asset class goes through subsequent market cycles,” said CK Zheng, co-founder of ZX Squared. “This cycle is not unique – we’ve had three to four cycles before, and each time a token like bitcoin can drop 80% – but they all come back.”  ZX Squared uses options to express short, medium and long-term views on the marketplaces in bitcoin and ethereum, helping Zheng and his partners find a better balance between risk and return in the crypto market.  “In equity, you get around 20% to 30% volatility, but in bitcoin, you get somewhere around 80% to 100% volatility,” Zheng said. “So step one for us is to reduce volatility – essentially 50% of volatility will be reduced.”  Unlike Three Arrows Capital – the hedge fund that collapsed last month, sparking a series of failures of decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies and stablecoins and bankrupting some prominent crypto exchanges – ZX Squared doesn't use leverage, according to Zheng.  Over the past 12 months, ZX Squared’s strategy has experienced volatility of around 30-35%, similar to a Nasdaq 100 stock, while targeting a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, double bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.0.  By comparison, U.S. equities have a Sharpe ratio of 0.5, and so on a risk-adjusted basis, bitcoin has offered a better return, Zheng said.  Sticking to the big guns  ZX Squared and Thor are running different strategies using the same two assets – bitcoin and ethereum. As a result, they naturally mitigate some of the risk in the crypto market by avoiding new, esoteric, small and illiquid altcoins.  “I would say that as technological innovations, bitcoin and ethereum have first-mover advantage in the digitalization process,” Zheng said. “Whether or not they can be overcome or replaced by any other coin is really hard to tell at this stage.”  Read more: Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists  Both Zheng and Roth argue that bitcoin is unique in its design and should become more of a currency in the future.  “We believe that at some point in time bitcoin can become another form of money,” Roth said. “The long-term price appreciation potential is significant.”  In recent months, however, bitcoin has traded more like a technology stock and has correlated closely to stocks. Until that correlation is broken, Roth said that bitcoin is more of a growth investment than anything else.  Both agree that ethereum is also more of a growth play.  “We see ethereum more as a security than another form of money,” Roth said. “A lot of platforms are being built on it. That’s not going to change. There’s a massive growth opportunity in ethereum. It’s more like a high-growth stock.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/21/how-two-asset-managers-are-handling-2022s-crypto-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4e0bb6a32c2f46d113730f9ca669c5c065c3a66-4066x3049.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ADA spiked by as much as 35% in just a week with price trend going the same route as last week’s forecasts. If you have been holding and trading Cardano for the longest time then the past couple of weeks have predictably been a great rollercoaster ride. When Bitcoin showed new spark of vigor starting July 19, Cardano was warned of a bearish trend and a potential liquidity happening in the $0.40 range. ADA dipped by 12% which worked towards the bears. However, the bearish momentum is perceived to be otherwise short-lived as it failed to hold it at the $0.40 zone. ADA price did overshoot to $0.54 with $0.40 tagged as support zone.

ADA price is seeing two types of scenarios. One, its price may drop from $0.52 to just $0.35 region, or its price may go up to around the $0.65 zone. For those who are looking for higher targets, there is an uptrend signal which reveals a breach right below $0.472. The crypto was recently able to break past the resistance level of $0.45 and is now going for a higher high. In fact, there are strong technical indicators signifying that ADA can go shoot as high as 51% if it keeps up its steady rally. ADA appears to be gaining bullish momentum after overcoming a significant supply wall. Technical indicators suggest that as long as ADA continues trading above $0.50 it may have the potential to advance further.

After succumbing to a tedious consolidation period spanning three months, ADA’s price is now enjoying a 23% increase. The uptrend was brought about by Cardano recently overriding the $0.45 resistance level. Additionally, intensified buying pressure can push ADA prices higher as the support zone or level gets breached. The token had managed to break away from the descending triangle based on its 12-hour chart and is seen to increase to around 51% following its successful breach at the $0.45 zone. Once this is done, it could push for an uptrend targeting $0.70. However, in order to aim and shoot for higher highs, ADA should be able to hold it at the level of $0.50. If it fails to hold it at that range, it could be seen as a weak spot which could trigger mass selloff. If this happens, ADA may slide down to $0.45 or could even dangerously drop to $0.38.

According to a post, the program will support eight students for their Ph.D. for five years, with the possibility of extending funding. The student’s Ph.D. program’s tuition, fees, and stipend will all be covered by the annual budget, up to a maximum of $40,000, and there will also be a fund of $10,000 available for research-related costs like travel and computers. Another award program will pay one student with an annual stipend of $80,000 and a fund of up to $10,000 through a postdoctoral fellowship. The fellowships don’t relate to Shiba Inus. Nevertheless, the fact that the Shiba Inu developers had sent half of the token’s total supply to have it removed from circulation last year suggests that Buterin was aware of the meme coins community. At the time, the tokens were worth billions of dollars. Buterin Will Donate Remaining Shiba Tokens Buterin didn’t make a tidy profit when he sold the tokens. Instead, he decided to donate the remaining tokens to charity and burn or destroy 90% of the ones transferred to his wallet. This included a 50 trillion SHIB payment to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund, a charity the Indian government established to help its residents during the outbreak.

In 2021, the value of the South American crypto market exploded from $68 million to an incredible $650 million, a ten-fold increase. Such significant growth has attracted the attention of major global blockchain companies to the region. Known for its successful cases in the field of creating and promoting cryptocurrency exchanges, the EHOLD group couldn’t resist building on its success and acquired the Argentine exchange C-Patex to exploit the opportunities in the region to their fullest. Diego Aguar will become the managing partner and co-owner of the exchange. Diego is a well-known Latin American opinion leader in the crypto industry who is currently teaching more than a million people to invest in digital assets. Picture: Diego Aguar and EHOLD Group president, Mykola Udianskyi. Obviously, for a team that has raised more than one exchange to the top 50 world rankings, this is no idle interest, and the purpose of the transaction is to secure a strong position in one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the world. C-Patex was a family-run company based in the Patagonia region of Argentina until EHOLD took an interest in the company. Now, with EHOLD’s considerable resources and expertise, the C-Patex brand is assured of success. One of EHOLD groups subsidiaries, Prof IT, has already allocated a large team of experts to optimize and upgrade C-Patex’s systems and software. Prof IT was founded in 2013 and has expertise across custom blockchain software, tokenization, smart contracts, NFTs and more. EHOLD group has lots of experience regarding crypto exchanges, and every project they have become involved with goes on to be a roaring success. For example, the company’s president, Mykola Udianskyi, and CEO, Bohdan Prylepa were the brains behind Ukraine’s first government-regulated crypto exchange, QMALL, which was recently awarded an EU trading license and has since expanded its operations immensely. In just six months the Ukrainian exchange has become a European sensation. QMALL has taken full advantage of its newfound EU license and started a launchpad for crypto startups at the prestigious Sophia Antipolis, the French equivalent of America’s Silicon Valley. The success of QMALL is indicative; however, this brand is far from the only successful project within the EHOLD group. The skills and know-how held within the EHOLD group’s vast array of companies are ideally suited to helping crypto exchanges succeed. These include companies specializing in everything from machine learning technologies, blockchain and custom software development to market research, data science and public relations. All this firepower means that the EHOLD group can effortlessly create powerful products that become number one in their space. It’s easy to see why C-Patex appealed to EHOLD as a brand. Combining all of this and the fact that C-Patex is located in South America’s second-largest country by area and the third-largest country by population, the opportunity this acquisition presents is priceless.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/ehold-group-acquires-argentinian-crypto-exchange-c-patex/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

XRPL Labs Not Developing Credit Card For Xumm Wallet In a tweet post shared today, Wietse Wind clarified that the rumors of XRPL Labs developing a debit/credit card payment system are false and that there won’t be any such plans in the future. I just received a message informing me that there's a rumour spreading that @XRPLLabs is working on a @XummWallet debit/credit card. This is *not* the case. The rumour is false. There will not be a CC and those plans will not change. (1/..) — WietseWind – 🛠 XUMM @ XRPL Labs (@WietseWind) July 21, 2022 According to Wind, credit card systems are often associated with inefficiencies, including high transaction fees; there is no point in re-introducing the same downsides and inefficiencies. Also, introducing a card payment system would spoil the plan for a complete shift to XRPL payments. He does acknowledge that the idea of XRPL payments may or may not ever work out, but they must at least try. He said he won’t go through the easy route of “hacking the old system on top of a new; more efficient one.” While there’s a need for a bridge to link the two sides, he argues that re-introducing cards as they traditionally are would not be a smart solution. Instead, the best solution would be to develop an offramp/onramp system to facilitate instant swaps between fiat and XRP. This would allow users to send funds between their bank accounts and XRPL accounts without incurring heavy fees. Lastly, he divulged that his company was working on introducing such functionality for Xumm Pro Beta users before the year’s end, with a rollout planned to expand to the rest of the EU countries with potential plans for Asia.

The minor version release introduces essential security updates and changes to network efficiency.  Security-related fixes include changes to alert messages and increased transaction download system reliability, allowing developers to download historical transactions.  The release changed the recommended dust limit for all participants on the Dogecoin network to 0.01 DOGE from the earlier 1 DOGE. Dust limits are thresholds encoded in the Dogecoin network that denote the minimum amount of currency used for a transaction to be processed on the chain.  Wallet operators can also identify if any transactions are stuck, have not been mined or are not in the mempool, a holding bin for transactions waiting to get mined into blocks. This prevents the node from sending out old transactions that got lost.  Another wallet-related fix allows node operators to change the maximum number of connections their node allows without needing to restart, allowing for more fine-grained control of the node's network capacities.  A new remote procedure call (RPC) method, rescan, has been added to allow node operators to rescan the chain for wallet transactions from a certain height, as per developer documents. “This can help speed up the rescan process for keys known to be generated after a certain date or block height,” developers explained in the release.  Dogecoin’s native DOGE tokens saw volatile trading in the past 24 hours. Prices fell some 9%, regressing almost all gains from Tuesday’s run as traders took profits on their positions. However, the tokens are up 11% for the week.

42422672,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oRdh,1658400653,Bitcoin Slips Below $23K Ahead of ECB Rate Decision,"Bitcoin (BTC) retreated to under $23,000, after it hit a six-week high of $24,265 on Wednesday. Despite the pullback, its price was up 14% for the month, according to CoinDesk data.  Meanwhile, in fiat currencies, the euro, the common currency of 19 of the 21 European Union nations, held on to its recent gains against the U.S. dollar ahead of the European Central Bank's expected first interest rate hike in 11 years.  The EUR/USD pair rose to a two-week high of 1.0273 during early Asian hours and traded flat at around 1.0180 at press time. The so-called shared currency slipped below parity with the dollar early this month, hitting a two-decade low.  The ECB rate decision due on Thursday at 12:15 GMT will be followed by ECB President Christine Lagarde's press conference at 12:45 GMT. The consensus is for the bank to raise the benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points to -0.25% from the current record low of -0.5%. The ECB, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank have held rates below zero for years.  ""The European Central Bank will raise policy rates by 25bp on 21 July and effectively commit to a hike of at least 50 bps [basis points] in September, we expect, sticking to plans agreed at the June meeting,"" strategists at BNP Paribas wrote a note published last week.  Potential reversal of NIRP ahead  The ECB rate decisions haven't significantly affected cryptocurrencies in the past. The impending decision is noteworthy, however, because the central bank isn't only expected to raise rates for the first time since 2011, but it is also likely to signal that more rate hikes are in the pipeline. That would imply a reversal of its negative interest rate policy (NIRP) – a policy setting whereby borrowers receive interest rather than paying the cost of borrowing money to lenders. The ECB, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank have held rates below zero for years to boost growth.  Critics of the fiat monetary system and central bank medium of exchange have long cited negative rates as evidence of traditional finance nearing complete collapse and the need to explore alternatives like cryptocurrencies. So, one might think the reversal of the NIRP would be bearish for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. But that's not the case, according to one expert.  ""I think that the underlying case for crypto assets becomes more apparent in times of significant economic and currency turmoil – an alternative system beholden to sentiment but not to any economic fundamentals, unlike equities or bonds,"" Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, said.  Genesis is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.  ""And investors have to do something, staying in cash in times of rising rates and volatile currencies is not a resilient strategy,"" Acheson added.  Rate hike may inject temporary volatility  The ECB's lift-off and potential plans to ditch NIRP, however, may inject volatility into risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""I don't think it's priced in because traditional markets still seem to be in some denial about the macro consequences of this – in other words, the economic and earnings pain that, in my opinion, lies ahead is not yet reflected in current equity or bond prices,"" Acheson told CoinDesk, adding that the pace of the rate hike cycle will be critical.  ""More relevant will be any hint as to what the ECB will do next. Continued 50 bps hikes could help if it weren't for the danger they pose to not only the EU economy but also the state of the union itself, especially given Draghi's likely resignation today,"" Acheson noted, referring to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.  Some observers expect a bigger hike, in which case, the risk assets could come under pressure.  ""I believe that the ECB will deliver a 50 bps lift-off this month, in the wake of rampant inflation, resumption of the Russian gas supply and the fact that the ECB is way behind the curve,"" FXStreet senior analyst Dhawni Mehta said in a note published on Wednesday. ""It's also worth noting that front-loading rates now may allow the central bank some room to pause or go slower on rate hikes when a recession hits.""  According to FXStreet, interest rate traders are pricing a 40% probability of a half-point rate hike on Thursday while factoring 97 basis points of tightening by September.  Anti-fragmentation tool to save the day?  Perhaps battered risk assets may show resilience to rate hikes if the central bank announces an anti-fragmentation tool to ensure the impact of an increase in borrowing costs is felt the same way across the common currency area. Recently, bond markets in highly indebted EU nations like Italy saw heightened volatility relative to German bonds on speculation of an ECB rate hike. Such divergences could lead to fragmentation and pose a risk to the common currency area and the EU.  Under the tool, the policymakers may commit to purchasing assets, perhaps bonds of indebted nations, to limit divergences in bond markets of the bloc's strongest and weakest countries. Bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing, inject liquidity into the financial system. The Federal Reserve, ECB and other central banks launched QE programs following the crash of March 2020, sparking risk-taking across all corners of the financial market.  ""We maintain our long-standing central case that the ECB's anti-fragmentation tool (working name: transmission protection mechanism, or TMP) will arrive, probably next week,"" BNP Paribas said in its note.  ""We would expect the initial focus of the tool to be on the government bond market – the first stage of transmission, of which all other assets, are priced, and hence a necessary condition for preventing fragmentation,"" BNP Paribas added.

Key Technical Points: The KNC prices dropped by 8.70% in the last 24 hours. The price action showcase further sideways continuation within the accumulation zone ranging from $1.18 to $1.55. The 24-hour trading volume of Kyber Network is $47.07 Million, indicating a drop of 11.90%. Past Performance of KNC The Kyber Network (KNC) price action displays a sideways trend continuation after a sharp selloff of 45% in the first two weeks of June 2022. The consolidation range between $1.18 and $1.55 keeps the market value trapped for more than a month. Additionally, the recent bull cycle failed to exceed the overhead resistance due to the increased selling pressure from the 50 days average line. Source – Tradingview KNC Technical Analysis The KNC price chart displays a bearish crossover of the 100 and 200-day SMAs, reflecting a selling opportunity. Hence, the technical chart shows an increase in the underlying bearishness and warns of a fallout below the $1.18 support level. The RSI indicator maintains a neutral point of view as the RSI slope continues the sideways trend near the halfway line. Additionally, traders will find a selling opportunity if the RSI slope drops under the 14-day SMA. Furthermore, the MACD indicator reflects a positive trend continuing in the past and slow line to approach the zero line. Hence, the technical indicator reflects increasing buying pressure, but the positive histogram’s falling trend reflects a bear cycle. In a nutshell, the KNC technical analysis displays a bearish trend continuation possibility to the $1.18 support level. Upcoming Trend Considering the Kyber Network (KNC) prices sustain above the $1.18 support level, traders can expect a sideways continuation within the range. However, a dip under the range will drop prices to the psychological mark of $1.

The firm's fundraising efforts will absorb the financial impact from the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, the Blockchain.com representative said.  Other high-profile crypto companies have announced job cuts as the bear market continues to bite the industry.  Blockchain.com, which is one of the oldest firms in the crypto industry, is also shrinking its institutional lending business, halting all mergers and acquisitions, placing a pause on efforts to expand gaming and slowing its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.  The firm said its most active demand was coming from Europe, the U.S. and Africa, as opposed to Latin America. It also said it was receiving more demand from brokerage, rather than gaming.  Executive salaries and CEO compensation are also being reduced, the company representative said. Consumer revenue remains active and strong, while institutional revenue is flat and will need time to recover, the representative added.  Severance benefits ranging from four weeks to 12 weeks will be offered to those who are laid off, depending on the country, as will job replacement assistance through a third party to U.K. and U.S. employees.

The coins were seized in drug busts and had been legally forfeited to the state following court rulings. Finland Sells Confiscated Bitcoins in a Bearish Market According to a Bloomberg report from today, Finland sold its Bitcoin (BTC) stash for only 46.5 million euros ($47.5 million) during the summer where the same stake was valued at almost $130 million at the peak of the crypto boom last year. The sale was conducted via two crypto brokers which the agency said were selected via a competitive process in April. Finland’s Customs acquired the Bitcoin in a large narcotics bust in 2016 which was worth less than €700,000 ($712,000 million) at the time. It still holds 90 Bitcoins awaiting a court ruling of forfeiture, and an undisclosed amount of other cryptocurrencies. While the US government was the first to sell confiscated Bitcoins at an auction in 2014, other countries also took up selling cryptocurrencies seized in criminal investigations. In April, Finland donated “tens of millions” of euros earned through selling confiscated Bitcoin to Ukraine. “Thanks to the revenues from the sale of Finnish Customs’ stolen Bitcoin, the government will donate tens of millions to help Ukraine,” Finnish finance minister Annika Saarikko tweeted, adding that the measure was “acceptable and legitimate.” The post Finland Sells Confiscated Bitcoins (BTC) For $47 Million appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/finland-sells-confiscated-bitcoins-btc-for-47-million/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=finland-sells-confiscated-bitcoins-btc-for-47-million,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Key Technical Points: The XMR prices increased by 3.73% in the last 24 hours. The price action shows the wedge breakout rally jumping above the $150 mark. The 24-hour trading volume of Monero is $189 Million, indicating an increase of 14%. Past Performance of XMR As we mentioned in our previous article, the XMR prices continue to inflate and reach the $150 mark as the wedge breakout rally gains momentum. The bullish trend accounts for a price jump of 25% in the last ten days and exceeds the 50 days average line. Additionally, the increase in trading volume supporting the bull run increases the likelihood of an uptrend exceeding the $150 mark. Source – Tradingview XMR Technical Analysis XMR price chart showcases the bullish trend approaching the 100-day SMA as it crosses below the 200-day SMA. Hence we can expect the bull run to retest the 100-day SMA accounting for a 13% price jump. The RSI indicator showcases a gradual growth in the underlying bullishness as the RSI slope sustains in the nearly overbought territory with the support of the 14-day SMA. Furthermore, the MACD indicator reflects an increase in the buying pressure as the fast and slow line maintains a bullish trend in the positive territory. Hence the technical indicators maintain a positive outlook for the upcoming trend in the Monero prices. In a nutshell, the XMR technical analysis forecasts a positive trend approaching the $175 resistance level shortly. Upcoming Trend If buying pressure for the Monero (XMR) prices sustains over the week, we can expect the bull run to exceed $175 and attempt to cross the psychological mark of $200. Conversely, a Bullish failure to sustain above the $150 mark downfall will retest the 50 days average line at the $137 support level.

Called the Vitalik Buterin Ph.D. Fellowship in AI Existential Safety, the grant is for students starting Ph.D. programs in 2022 in the United States, U.K. or Canada who plan to work on AI existential safety research.  Grant fellows also include existing Ph.D. students who otherwise wouldn't have funding to work on AI existential safety research.  The program will fund eight students for five years of their research for a Ph.D. with extension funding possible, according to a post. The annual funding will cover tuition, fees and the stipend of the student’s Ph.D. program up to $40,000, as well as a fund of $10,000 that can be used for research-related expenses such as travel and computing.  A postdoctoral fellowship, another grant program, will provide funding for one student with an annual $80,000 stipend and a fund of up to $10,000.  The fellowships have little to do with Shiba Inu, but Buterin’s likely acknowledged the meme coin’s community because Shiba Inu developers had sent 50% of the token's total supply last year to remove it from circulation. The tokens amounted to billions of dollars at the time.  Buterin, however, didn’t sell the tokens for a neat profit. Instead, he chose to burn or destroy 90% of the tokens sent to his wallet and donated the remaining to charity.  That included a 50 trillion SHIB donation, valued at over $1 billion, at the time to India Covid Crypto Relief Fund, a nonprofit set up by the Indian government to provide care to citizens during the pandemic.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | ETH | SHIB | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/21/vitalik-buterin-thanks-shiba-inu-community-as-grant-program-begins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07166da3b3ccbedd97fb5d898348707185a2cbf8-2611x1958.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Key Technical Points: The KCS prices dropped by 3.73% in the last 24 hours. The price action warns of an evening star pattern formation, teasing a drop under the $9 mark. The 24-hour trading volume of Kucoin is $5.38 Million, indicating an increase of 9.40%. Past Performance of KCS The KCS price action shows a bullish reversal from the $8 mark resulting in the resistance trendline breakout in the daily chart. The bullish trend accounts for a price jump of 25 percent over the last month and exceeds the $9 mark. However, the recent evening start pattern formation at $10 warns of a bearish retracement resulting in a drop under the $9 mark. Source – Tradingview KCS Technical Analysis KCS price chart shows a declining trend during the evening star pattern formation in the trading volume displaying a lack of bearish commitment. Hence, traders can expect a bullish reversal from the next horizontal support level. The RSI indicator displays an increase in selling please as the slope takes a rounding reversal to dip under the halfway line. Therefore the technical indicator shows a high momentum retest phase threatening a fall under the $9 mark. Furthermore, the MACD indicator displays a bullish trend in the fast and slow lines maintaining a positive approach to reach the zero line. In a nutshell, the KCS technical analysis shows a high possibility of a bearish trend continuing with the evening star pattern. Upcoming Trend Considering the Kucoin (KCS) price action completes, the evening star pattern formation falling below the $9 mark will undoubtedly test the $8 support level. Conversely, a bullish reversal with increased buying pressure can sabotage the bearish pattern formation. In such a case, the prices may surpass the $10 mark to reach the 50-day average line at $11.15.

190370,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496337,1658390277,How Blockchain MMORPG Cradles and its Time-Lapsing Virtual World Plans to Shake-Up Online Gaming,"Blockchain-based technologies, as expressed by cryptocurrencies and other forms of digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are beginning to make their presence felt in many different industries. While appearing little different on the surface from other types of digital money, the excitement crypto and NFTs have generated centres around their enabling features in digital transactions, in particular with ownership management. NFTs, in their own right, have attracted a lot of interest over the last two years owing to the way they have allowed for the secure and authenticatable transfer of physical items via the blockchain. Stripped down, NFTs are simply tokens that represent unique assets. In the case of art and collectibles, this proved to be a highly useful feature that let people create NFTs representing unique and rare pieces of art and culture. If you owned an NFT, you owned the creative rights to a piece of art – verifiable by anyone just by cross-checking the NFT data on a public ledger Yet NFTs in this form has barely scratched the surface of what’s possible, particularly when dealing with industries where non-fungibility and fungibility factors are crucial aspects. Beyond Static NFT Use in Gaming Game developers DRepublic, the team behind the upcoming MMORPG Cradles: Origin of Species, are among those who believe that blockchain technology can provide solutions that could spell groundbreaking innovations in the gaming industry. While some gaming companies have already dabbled in crypto and NFTs, they’ve so far been met with limited success. High-profile NFT efforts have even resulted in a major backlash from the gaming community. The ire drawn by NFT experiments like that of Ubisoft can be traced back to the simplistic implementation of NFTs in games, either as an alternative currency or as a way to generate more money for the company by generating even more “unique” items like skins. In other words, NFTs in gaming so far have only served to further the much-maligned “lootbox” mentality perceived by many gamers as plaguing game developers. Cradles developers seek to move beyond the static features of NFTs that have made them so popular among speculators, by fine-tuning a new type of NFT token based on what they call the EIP-3664 protocol (technically, it is simply a naming of a proposal for a new set of rules on the blockchain), that expands on existing NFT standards, ERC721 and ERC1155. The new EIP3664 NFTs will allow all game elements to contain far more information than regular NFTs, giving them many more attributes that result in a variety of ways the game can interact with these elements. In game-speak, this simply means that the entire game world is made up of components that can be combined with or separated from each other. Combinable game elements and a time-lapsing virtual world Component NFTs can be described like this. If characters, items, and even plants and animals are all made up of component NFTs, it would be possible for a player to fully create and participate in the world-building of a virtual universe. For example, you would harvest raw materials from nature and combine them to create tools and weapons bearing all the different attributes of their individual components. Then, attach these tools, weapons, clothes and even skills to a character and that new character bears all the different attributes of all their combined components. Similarly, you can break down an element into all its separate components to recreate a virtually unlimited combination of possible new items and characters. In effect, the EIP-3664 protocol is set to make these digital assets more customizable for Cradles players to shift and change their in-game articles in unlimited ways by harvesting raw materials obtained by exploring and going on adventures. Crucially, NFTs in Cradles will also have evolvable attributes hard-coded into every component, enabling all game elements to simulate the laws of time and physics – something no virtual world has been able to properly implement. DRepublic calls this effect “entropy-increase”. Using block time as a stable basis for perpetual time lapsing, each game element evolves gradually. Items rust, characters age, and buildings slowly break down as block time passes, requiring the active intervention of players to incentivize cooperation amongst players. Players will be able to see their NFTs (as characters and even items) evolving over time. Rather than the static standards of today, Cradles will create a world in motion with its own changes, deterioration, and progress. A game that insists on new experiences At the core of Cradles is an open-world MMORPG with elements of the metaverse but with an aim to expand on the conventional RPG experience. Cradles players will experience a virtual reality game compatible with deep immersion hardware that will enable them to play and interact with other players at any species of their choosing. The game will provide players with ultimate freedom, capacity for exploration, and community building. Players will be able to explore different areas in the game, a Main City and an Adventure Zone. In the former, players will be able to explore and interact with other players while in the latter, players will need to defend themselves from potential hostilities and gather supplies from their surroundings. The entire virtual world also ties into the spine of the plot, where characters are sent far back in time from a doomed future, seeking an answer to avoid a destiny of extinction. In this way, exploration, research and discovery are the only ways to further the world-building as Cradles hopes to be a game that encourages and motivates new gaming experiences, to try and move beyond the repetitive grinding spiral that most online RPGs tend to end up with. Blockchain will have a say in the Future Of Gaming Despite already raising significant funding for its development, the team behind the project is keen to lay the foundations for an open, decentralised community that will eventually result in a self-sustaining game. Its growing community aren’t just considered as gamers but as game creators. Even now, the game developers continue to work on improving the overall gaming experience by implementing new features, fixing bugs, and testing new functionalities – following the direction and feedback of its community online. Cradles players can position themselves today and benefit from a sector destined to keep on expanding over time by attracting new users to its ecosystem. Today, according to data from Dapps Radar, the top 10 Blockchain games command over $700 million in assets with close to 1 million active players. Clearly, there is interest and potential in more decentralised forms of games that rely on community-based efforts to develop, particularly when the relationship between gamers and traditional game developers in recent years has been fraught with disappointment and frustration. The games of tomorrow may not necessarily be all about being able to earn cryptocurrencies and buy NFTs in the game. But should blockchain technology provide the next true innovation, enabling and unlocking new gameplay aspects that traditional games have always lacked, it may very well be the gateway to the future of gaming.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | RESEARCH,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/how-blockchain-mmorpg-cradles-and-its-time-lapsing-virtual-world-plans-to-shake-up-online-gaming/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

For instance, crypto unicorn Babel suspended withdrawals in June, while Celsius, one of crypto’s biggest lenders, suspended withdrawals this month and filed for bankruptcy a week ago. Similarly, Vauld, another Singapore-based crypto platform, suspended withdrawals, trading, and deposits due to financial challenges earlier this month. Established in 2018, Zipmex is a licensed cryptocurrency and digital token exchange in Thailand. However, the platform is not registered in Singapore to provide digital payment token (DPT) services. Last year, the exchange raised $41 million with an investment from the Bank of Ayudhya, one of Thailand’s largest banks. As of June, Coinbase had reportedly agreed to make a strategic investment in Zipmex. The company was also working on a Series B funding round projected to raise its valuation to $400 million.

Square Enix intends to release a set of Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary cards and miniatures on Enjin’s Efinity blockchain with the aid of NFT infrastructure company Enjin. A commemorative action figure with a ticket to redeem an NFT version of the figure will be available for purchase by customers. While trading card preorders won’t be available until later this year, preorders for the figures are currently available. Given that past decisions to incorporate NFTs into games have been met with significant criticism, it is unknown how fans of the brand will receive the initiative. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise’s Ukrainian game developer, G.S.C. Game World, decided against including NFTs in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 after receiving negative feedback from players. Square Enix to Devote More Resources to Blockchain Technology Yosuke Matsuda, president of Square Enix, recently hinted that the company might devote more resources to blockchain technologies in 2022. He stated in a letter dated January 1 that the company was considering creating its tokens but qualified his remarks by saying that the NFT area was experiencing instances of irrational trading. “This, obviously, is not an ideal situation, but I expect to see an eventual right-sizing in digital goods deals as they become more commonplace among the general public, with the value of each available content corrected to their true estimated worth, and I look for them to become as familiar as dealings in physical good,” Matsuda said in the letter. Since then, the company has invested further in blockchain technology, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence and sold $300 million in intellectual property and studios.

The raids were extended to eight other places including the homes and offices of people involved in the case. “A total of 15 places, including cryptocurrency exchanges and related offices, were searched on Wednesday for proof of allegations,” a spokesperson told the Reuters news agency on Thursday.

The overly leveraged players in the cryptocurrency market were revealed by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May, which led to the high-profile failures of Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, and Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Due to liquidity issues, several exchanges have temporarily stopped operating their trading platforms. The company said, “Many of these firms were overleveraged with short-term liabilities mismatched against longer duration illiquid assets.” “We have not engaged in these risky lending practices and instead have focused on building our financing business with prudence and deliberate focus on the client.” Coinbase Says No Credit Exposure While Coinbase denied having any credit exposure to Celsius, 3AC, and Voyager, it claims that through its venture capital business, it did make “non-material investments” in Terraform Labs. Coinbase is using the update to convince investors that it won’t go the same way as some of its competitors. Since the beginning of 2022, the company’s stock has fallen about 70% as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases spooked investors in equities and cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency market has been in chaos since the death of the so-called “algorithmic” stablecoin, Terra. Celsius and 3AC, two businesses that made risky crypto bets using borrowed money, resulted in liquidity problems. Investors wanted to withdraw their money from companies like Celsius and 3AC when the value of cryptocurrencies started to plummet this year. However, a decline in the value of the assets held by these corporations made it impossible for them to fulfill the redemption demands. Because of this, Celsius, Voyager, and other companies stopped making withdrawals before ultimately seeking bankruptcy protection.

188422,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243502,1658386856,ETH Technical Analysis: Retracement Ready To Retest $1400,"The Ethereum(ETH) price action displays a retracement phase ready to touch $1400. But will the prices drift around after retest or continue to crash? Key Technical Points: The ETH price has dropped by 6.95% within the last 72 hours. The price action shows a retracement rally from the resistance trendline, reflecting a retest possibility of $1400. The 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum is $23.61 Billion, indicating a rise of 2.61%. Past Performance of ETH As we mentioned in our previous analysis, the ETH prices exceed the 50 days average line and the $1500 mark to reach the heights of $1700. The price jump of 50% over the past week accounts for the bullish break out of the consolidation range. However, the bullish trend takes a setback from the resistance trendline in the daily chart resulting in a price drop of 6.95 percent in the last three days. Source – Tradingview ETH Technical Analysis The ETH price chart shows a falling trend in the trading volume during the retest phase, and the small-bodied candles with long-range increase the possibility of a bullish turnaround. Hence, traders can find a buying opportunity near the $1400 support level shortly. The RSI indicator displays an increase in selling pressure but maintains an overall bullish view as the slope sustains in the nearly overboard zone. Hence, technical indicator supports the possibility of a bullish turnaround shortly. Furthermore, the MACD indicator displays a solid bullish trend in motion as the fast and slow lines enter positive territory. However, the falling trend in the positive histograms reflects a retest phase in Ethereum prices. In a nutshell, the ETH technical analysis suggests a high likelihood of a bullish turnaround from the $1400 support level after a successful retest. Upcoming Trend Considering the Ethereum (ETH) prices take a positive turnaround and exceed the resistance trendline influence, traders can expect the market value to shoot up to the $2000 psychological mark. Conversely, if the buyers fail to question de downtrend at the $1400 mark, the market value can crash to $1250.

42422679,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0oRnh,1658386800,Ethereum’s Kaleido Collaborates With Polygon for Web3 Adoption,"Enterprise Ethereum platform Kaleido is teaming up with Polygon, the popular scaling service, to bring the convergence of public and private blockchains a step closer.  Unveiled on Thursday at Ethereum’s annual community gathering in Paris, EthCC, Polygon Edge is intended to offer businesses a user-friendly, cloud-based system connected to the Ethereum mainnet. It will offer companies a range of high to zero gas fee models, depending on the transaction requirements.  Historically, blue chip companies have looked to create private blockchains to keep control of their data and stay within existing regulations. However, these firms are now being drawn to the transparency of public blockchains, driven by the growing interest in Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  “We’ve been saying for years the enterprise blockchain segment, that popped up in 2015, would come together with these public ecosystems,” Kaleido founder Steve Cerveny said in an interview. “Now we are seeing enterprise NFTs that are references to digital twins and real world things and all kinds of utility being created and happening now in 2022.”  Polygon is developing a whole range of clever overlay and side channel systems to make the Ethereum blockchain, with its congestion and high gas costs, fast and affordable. But an additional scaling layer is required, which Cerveny calls “app-chains.” This is a kind of dedicated blockchain for an application, he said, that comes with additional choices out of the box when it comes to intuitively bridging Ethereum.  For example, if an enterprise customer wants to set up a stablecoin, that might require high gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet to some extent, Cerveny said. A second tier of transactions could use the Polygon mainnet and would incur a smaller fee, he noted. Then there are a large percentage of use cases and transaction loads that need to be zero gas fees, he added.  “We are bringing along a framework that offers the power to choose. It’s as simple as a different flag on the API to choose a super-special transaction, or something very high volume with a different mix of security and decentralization,” Cerveny said. “Making it that simple to build on really does unlock a lot more zeros in the scaling equation.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MATIC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/21/ethereums-kaleido-collaborates-with-polygon-for-web3-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29d5fae5c5db4b8de295b6cb1983ac9f6e14c0b2-1662x1247.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Vauld requested a moratorium order in a Singaporean court on July 8. The moratorium would give the troubled lender more time to find a suitable restructuring strategy if approved. The Journal claimed that while the moratorium helps the company avoid total shutdown, a Singaporean moratorium order is comparable to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States. Vauld Group Seeks Moratorium to Prepare for Restructuring To allow management “the breathing room it requires to prepare for the envisaged restructuring for the benefit of all stakeholders,” Vauld announced on July 11 that it would seek a moratorium order. The application for the moratorium, as the Journal noted, was submitted three days earlier. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Vauld ceased deposits, withdrawals, and trading on July 4.

Minecraft Says No To NFTs In its statement, Minecraft shared that it will no longer be supporting or permitting the use of blockchain technologies within its servers, including NFTs. The platform said this decision has been made to ensure Minecraft players’ “safe and inclusive experience.” “To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications, nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilized by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset,” the post reads. TL;DR:""To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our Minecraft client and server applications nor may they be utilized to create NFTs associated with any in-game content…"" — Minecraft (@Minecraft) July 20, 2022 The company argued that NFTs within the game could privilege some users and undermine others, as the NFT usage model can create scarcity and exclusion within the player community, which goes against the value of the platform: “The speculative pricing and investment mentality around NFTs takes the focus away from playing the game and encourages profiteering, which we think is inconsistent with the long-term joy and success of our players,” the post adds. Despite being adamant against integrating blockchain technology into the game, the company said they would research over time to see if a future implementation turns out to be fruitful. However, they have no intention of doing the same in the short term.

Will this rejection retest the broken range? Key Technical Points: The BTC prices jumped by 0.98% in the last 24 hours. The price action showcases a shooting star candle forming the previous night, displaying a sudden increase in selling pressure. The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin is $42.39 Billion, indicating a drop of 9.40%. Past Performance of BTC As we mentioned in our last analysis, The BTC prices exceed the consolidation range in the daily chart with a jump of 22% over the week. However, the breakout rally struggles to surpass the $25K mark resulting in a shooting star candle, displaying an increase in selling pressure. This bearish turnaround of events makes it difficult for the prices to sustain above the 50-day SMA and might shortly break it to retest the broken range at $22K. Source – Tradingview BTC Technical Analysis BTC price chart shows a significant trading volume, influencing the start of a retest phase that will damage the week-long gains. Hence, the short-term traders can find profit booking a viable option to reenter the post-retest reversal. The RSI indicator takes a neutral standpoint as the slope turns sideways in the nearly overbought zone teasing a potential reversal shortly. Hence, RSI dipping below the halfway line will mark the retest phase. Furthermore, the MACD indicator displays a solid growth in buying pressure over the week but the last night’s dump is yet to show in the fast and slow lines. Hence, the indicator remains bullish on the upcoming trend in Bitcoin. In a nutshell, the BTC technical analysis projects a high likelihood of a bullish trend upon completing the retest. Upcoming Trend Considering the Bitcoin(BTC) prices sustain above the 50-day SMA, traders can expect a positive continuation exceeding $25K to reach the 100-day SMA. Hence, the uptrend shows a potential of 20% growth in the coming weeks or months. However, a dip under the 50-day SMA will cut the weekly gains in half and retest the $22K mark.

Tesla Cashes Out 75% Of Its Bitcoin Holdings In its latest earnings report, released Wednesday, Tesla revealed it has sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings this quarter for approximately $963 million. “As of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency. Conversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet,” the company wrote. In an earnings call, the company’s executives said the reason for the sale was a desire to maximize cash positions during the uncertainty of China’s COVID lockdowns. “We are certainly open to increasing bitcoin holdings in [the] future. So this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin. It’s just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company given COVID shutdowns in China,” Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said. The electric vehicle company invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February 2021, after changing its investment policy in January to allow it to hold digital assets. At the time, it was seen as a very bullish move, so much so that BTC hit a new all-time high of $43,000 during that period. The company further announced that it would soon accept Bitcoin as payment for its vehicles. Later in May 2021, Musk suddenly announced that Tesla would stop accepting it as payment, citing concerns over the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.

182426,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496284,1658376054,"Lateral Movement Of Uniswap, When Is There A Chance Of Correction?","Uniswap has displayed tight trading conditions for over the last 24 hours. The coin has been consolidating and it recorded minor losses over the last day. Although Uniswap performed well over the past week securing more than 30% gain, recently, the bulls seem to be resting. Recently UNI broke past the $6.00 mark and it could be eyeing the $8.00 price ceiling now. Buying strength displayed slight decline but buyers were still more in number than sellers in the market. Bitcoin’s price action has helped many altcoins to rally but continued support from the buyers still remain crucial. Going by the technical indicators, it seems though that UNI might hover around the same price zone at least over the upcoming trading sessions. After the rally, chance of a pullback cannot be ruled out, Currently UNI hasn’t witnessed a pullback but consistent consolidation could drag the coin to the nearest support level. If it manages to clear its immediate resistance, there are chances for UNI to trade beyond the $8.00 price mark. Uniswap Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart UNI was trading at $7.41 at press time and the coin was still optimistic on its chart. The current range of consolidation was between $7.33 and $7.49 respectively. A slight push from the buyers could help Uniswap to zoom past the $7.57 resistance mark. If that happens, reaching $8.00 becomes easy and there could be a chance that UNI would trade above the $8.00 mark. On the flipside, the local support for the coin was at $7.08 and then at $6.47. A break below the $6.47 will push Uniswap near $5.38. Volume of UNI traded declined slightly pointing towards a slight fall in buying pressure. Technical Analysis UNI has witnessed growing buying strength on the chart ever since the coin rallied. There is a small downtick in the number of buyers even then buyers are still in control of the market. The Relative Strength Index was above the half-line and that meant buying pressure exceeded selling pressure. Price of UNI was also above the 20-SMA line which signalled that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. UNI was also above 50-SMA and 200-SMA which meant that the coin was trading on a bullish momentum.

At the moment ETH has managed to break past an important resistance mark of $1500 and flipped it into a support level. The coin maintained a rally after it crossed the $1000 mark, chance of correction still remains on the horizon. Bullish strength has regained vigour as buying strength also shot up. The invalidation of bearish thesis started once ETH managed to cruise past $1200. If the coin remains above the $1500 mark then the bulls could propel the price higher. The rally was also caused by the bullish sentiments revolving around the Merge that is anticipated in the month of September. There are chances for the coin to shoot up to $2000 but there are other resistances that ETH has to break past for that to happen. The coin has been trading on an ascending trendline and it could soon revisit $1660 on its chart. The global cryptocurrency market cap today is $1.12 Trillion with 4.6% positive change in the last 24 hours. Ethereum Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart ETH was trading at $1600 at the time of writing. The king altcoin has broken past the $1500 mark. The overhead resistance for the coin was at $1660, strength from buyers could push ETH to touch $1660. Other important price ceilings were at $1745 and $1800 respectively. Once the coin moves past the $1800 mark, $2000 can be on the chart for Ethereum. If the coin witnesses a correction then, the first support level would stand at $1300 and then at $1200. Volume of Ethereum traded in the last session grew signifying that buying strength remained high. Technical Analysis ETH’s bulls have caused buyers to re-enter the market. The altcoin has visited the overbought zone a couple of times in the past weeks. The Relative Strength Index portrayed an uptick and was near the 70-mark which meant that buyers heavily outnumbered sellers in the market. Ethereum was above the 20-SMA signalling the same thing that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Ethereum was parked above both the 50-SMA and 200-SMA lines which are signs of excessive bullish force in the market.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Has the crypto brush fire passed? Or is there another leg down coming?  Bitcoin (BTC) is having its best week since March, up 12% just since Sunday, and ether (ETH) is doing even better, up 15%.  Yet, on Wednesday the rally appeared to stall out somewhat, and the news was filled with additional headlines on this year's carnage in the crypto industry – the fallout from this year's price crash.  Omkar Godbole reported on a new withdrawal freeze – the harbinger of trouble that also preceded bankruptcy filings from the troubled crypto platforms Voyager Digital and Celsius Network. This time the freeze came from Zipmex, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange that reportedly loaned some $100 million to Babel Finance, another ailing crypto firm. The contagion continues.  And the Peter Thiel-based cryptocurrency lender Vauld filed for protection from Singaporean creditors just days after suspending withdrawals. The crypto lender – which also counts Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures as its investors – owes $402 million to creditors.  And yet, the recent market rally has kindled questions over whether the worst of the industry's malaise is in the past. There's no more big shoes to drop, as it were – only small ones.  Godbole reported separately (yes, he was busy) that a Bank of America (BAC) survey found investor pessimism – in traditional markets, not crypto – at dire levels. And that might be a contrarian indicator, which might be good for stocks, and thus good for bitcoin because the assets have largely been trading in sync lately.  ""An old Wall Street mantra says when investors collectively feel worse and hold cash, most of the price drop has already happened,"" Godbole wrote. ""Then, selling stalls, eventually paving the way for a new bull run.""  Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) disclosed Wednesday that it sold the majority of its bitcoin holdings during the second quarter to boost cash. That worked out to about $936 million worth, or 75% of the electric vehicle maker's holdings, in the quarter. It sold its bitcoin for an average price of around $29,000 per bitcoin, avoiding a substantial impairment charge by selling earlier in the quarter, since bitcoin ended the second quarter at a price of about $18,700.  Here's what three analysts are saying about the outlook for bitcoin and crypto:  Mark Newton, Fundstrat: Bitcoin's breakout ""gives some added confidence that lows to this decline might finally be in place.""  Alexandre Lores, Quantum Economics: ""The burning question being asked across Twitter is: is this just a ""bull trap,"" or have we seen the worst of it and are in our next bull market? The right answer is that I have no idea and neither does anyone else.""  Greg Magadini, Genesis Volatility: ""We're probably going to see some consolidation – you know, probably between $20,000 to $27,000 on bitcoin, and then I still think there's probably some downside in sort of the medium term to crypto.... For the first time in quite a few months, we're getting the options asymmetry to the call side.... I'm kind of the opinion that a lot a lot of these losses have now been measured and accounted for and people are aware of them. So a lot of the brush burning is probably behind us.""

Insights  Traders Have Mixed Sentiments on Ether’s ‘Merge Trade’  By Shaurya Malwa  Ether has added nearly 48% in the past week as investor sentiment turned bullish ahead of Ethereum’s expected Merge event in September. But the price rise is seeing mixed emotions among market observers.  Merge refers to deploying Ethereum’s execution layer – the term for the current Ethereum network – to the “consensus layer” of the Beacon Chain, the term for Ethereum’s upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain.  The move is part of Ethereum’s multi-stage shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that would validate transactions using nodes run by “stakers.” This is in favor of the current proof-of-work design, which relies on centralized entities called “miners” to validate network transactions.  Traders have bid up ether in anticipation of the merge. Last week’s price action led to over $457 million in liquidation losses on Monday alone, the most since last September, per analytics firm Coinalyze.  The long-awaited Merge upgrade will lead to a 90% reduction in ether's annual issuance – thus decreasing supply, likely leading to an increase in value. Some observers consider the merge as equivalent to three Bitcoin halvings – a programmed code that halves the per block bitcoin (BTC) currency supply every four years.  But despite that, sentiment around the upgrade remains mixed.  Ethereum ""has undergone a rapid change in narrative over the past week with speculators purely focused on the upcoming 'Merge' as a catalyst for appreciation,"" said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds. ""Adding to this, we believe that there is a significant amount of sidelined capital that has been waiting on bullish momentum to establish new positions.""  Anderson McCutcheon, CEO of Chains.com noted that the broader markets were currently seeing a “change of sentiment” and that investors were looking to deploy cash into strong assets.  “This amplifies whatever positive news or major upgrades the projects offer,” explained McCutcheon. The merger is obviously good news and a pivotal moment in Ethereum's history, but its effect on the market is amplified by the lack of sell pressure.”  “There is a lot of [ether] locked up in staking or frozen in accounts to which users have no access,” McCutcheon added, citing products like Lido that allow users to stake coins while retaining liquidity and bypassing the burden of owning a minimum of 32 ether to become a staker.  Some analysts, however, cautioned that ether’s upward movement was unlikely to continue in the coming days.  ""While the price action of [ether] certainly gives hope for the overall market to turn a corner in the next few weeks, the sudden jump is mainly motivated by hype and perhaps a lack of understanding of what the Merge will do,” explained Martin Hiesboeck, head of crypto research at Uphold, in a Telegram message.  “It has been announced in very similar wording six times before; “this is the one” may just be hopium,” Hiesboeck added.  Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the merge comes at a time when the ill effects of mining bitcoin and its climatic impact are in focus.  “Crypto mining has been highly criticized for contributing to climate change due to its energy-intensive nature and as wildfires rage across Europe and the United States, the promise that ether transactions could be less damaging to the environment has caused a wave of interest,” Streeter said.  Streeter, however, cautioned: “With the rules of the future games of mining, staking, and trading still pretty murky, and the value of crypto assets hugely sensitive to volatile conditions in financial markets, it’s clear investing in the crypto Wild West is still a very risky business.”  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Headlines  Crypto Exchange Zipmex Suspends Withdrawals, Citing Market Volatility:The outfit becomes the latest digital-assets platform to make that move.
