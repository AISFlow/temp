Department of Information Technology commissioner Wei-bin Lee confirmed that Taipei would be partnering with IOTA and local startup BiiLabs for its Digital Citizen Card project, telling CoinDesk that the effort was one of many proof-of-concept plans the city had.  Taipei will specifically be using IOTA's Tangle ID service for several projects, he said, though he did not elaborate beyond the Digital Citizen project.  The Digital Citizen Card will act as a tamper-proof identification system, protecting users from identity theft, according to CrowdFund Insider.  Lee elaborated in an email to CoinDesk:  ""We'll be starting with related applications for Digital Citizen Card that can be used as a platform. We also seek to boost the authentication and integrity checks for municipality-to-municipality/institution-to-institution data exchange (such as medical records).""  That being said, the commissioner also said the city is open to other proposals which may help Taipei further develop its goals of becoming a ""smart city."" As such, the city will work with any other available technologies, he told CoinDesk.  While Taipei is testing IOTA's tech, the city is not yet using any type of cryptocurrency, Lee said.  The details of upcoming projects have not yet been discussed, but IOTA has been invited to set up an office in Taipei to facilitate future projects, he said.  For the moment, the Department of Information Technology, BiiLabs and the foundation will continue discussing project proposals to establish proofs of concept. The three groups formed a task force to work on the details for these projects.  Lee concluded:  ""After the PoCs, we will evaluate the results and see where we go from there.""

Everipedia, the decentralized offshoot of Wikipedia, announced Thursday that it had secured $30 million through an equity sale led by Galaxy Digital’s EOS.io Ecosystem Fund. The funding round was restricted to strategic investors, according to statements.  The startup plans to use the proceeds from the round to launch its peer-to-peer network, led in part by chief information officer and Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger.  Everipedia announced last year that it was moving to the EOS.io blockchain, with its newly-envisioned infrastructure being built on top of that network.  The company now hopes to develop a censorship-proof system using smart contracts which record contributions while using a cryptocurrency token to reward contributors.  Sanger said in a new statement:  ""In the era of fake news and a general distrust in central entities like governments, corporations and the media the world stands to benefit enormously from a decentralized and uncensorable knowledge base.""  Galaxy Digital was announced and launched last month by Novogratz, who sees it as a full-service bank for digital assets.

Proposed Bill 5001, submitted by Representative Patricia Dillon, proposes ""that the general statutes be amended to establish a fee to transfer or trade virtual currency in this state."" However, the text of the proposal does not go into detail on the amount or type of fee it seeks to levy on cryptocurrency transactions, or what such a fee's benefits might be.  The proposed bill is part of a growing body of legislation seeking to regulate cryptocurrencies, though government-imposed cryptocurrency transaction charges are so far unknown in the U.S.  Elsewhere, a European Central Bank council member recently put forth the idea of requiring people who transact with cryptocurrencies in the E.U. to pay value-added tax (VAT) – a scenario already in place in Australia.  And in other use cases for the technology, U.S. lawmakers are increasingly looking to legitimize the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  A new bill introduced to the Florida House of Representatives in January aims to legally recognize blockchain records and smart contracts. The measure would introduce stipulations that blockchain ledgers and smart contracts be treated as legally-binding means of recording data, so long as no pre-existing laws or regulations are infringed in the process.  Also last month, a bill submitted to the Arizona Senate would, if approved, let people pay their state tax liabilities using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

The restoration of the account belonging to Bitfinex'ed came hours after his or her account was suspended on Wednesday by Twitter moderators. Bitfinex'ed has waged a steady campaign against the exchange and the related company Tether, which manages the USDT token, accusing Bitfinex of using the U.S. dollar-pegged ""stablecoin"" to manipulate and pump up the price of bitcoin. The companies, in turn, have threatened legal action against their pseudonymous gadfly.  In a statement posted to the r/buttcoin subreddit, Bitfinex'ed pointed the blame squarely at the cryptocurrency exchange, writing: ""After Failing to spam my Twitter with 400,000 fake followers, Bitfinex hires bots to mass-report my tweets and accounts.""  ""My Twitter account is currently suspended, earlier I had about 20 tweets that were considered 'private' despite the fact that it's all public information (and some stuff that even the NY times has along with [B]loomberg, yeah so private), so they've been using bots to mass report my tweets,"" he or she wrote, adding: ""Some people just don't like their scams being exposed.""  A spokesman for Bitfinex and Tether denied the claims of spamming and automated mass reporting. He would not say whether the companies had reported the account to Twitter at all, even manually.  According to Mashable, a Twitter spokesperson said that the suspension ""was a mistake.""  Late last month, Tether said that its relationship with auditor Friedman LLP had ""dissolved,"" blaming the complexity of the process. The revelation provided further fuel for critics of Bitfinex and Tether, given their promises to release full audits.  Friedman has yet to comment publicly on that outcome, but it has scrubbed all mentions of Bitfinex from its website.  And just days later, Bloomberg reported that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had issued subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether, although it remains unclear exactly what information the agency is seeking.  With the suspension lifted, Bitfinex'ed has resumed publication, arguing in a Thursday morning tweet that it must have been Friedman that pulled the plug on the Tether audit.    It makes no sense for Tether to fire Friedman and then start all over looking for another auditor and then starting the audit process all over again.

In a written petition sent to the House Committee on Ethics dated Feb. 5, Colorado House Representative Jared Polis argued that, because cryptocurrency assets are regarded as commodities by several agencies, Congress members should follow the same financial disclosure requirement as for traditional assets.  Currently, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities Exchange Commission both regard cryptocurrencies as commodities in the U.S. Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service requires that gains from cryptocurrency are also subject to federal income tax rules.  Polis argues in the letter:  ""Members of Congress and covered employees are already required to report certain asset holdings over certain amounts, including reporting any commodities holding over $1,000, a Member or covered employee should report any virtual currency holding as they would report any other commodity, such as gold.""  The letter marks Polis' latest effort in pushing through the normalization of cryptocurrency as part of his long-term advocacy for the technology.  As reported by CoinDesk, Polis' prominence stemmed from his earlier satirical recommendation to ban the U.S. dollar and replace it with bitcoin in 2014. He also became notable as one of the first politicians in the U.S. to accept bitcoin donations for political campaigns.  More recently, in September 2017, he introduced a bill seeking capital gains tax exemption for holdings of cryptocurrencies worth less than $600.

42380321,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mx7V,1518098450,How to Help ICOs Go Legit,"Julio Faura is the head of blockchain research and development at Santander. The views expressed are his own.      Much is being written these days about the need to regulate initial coin offerings (ICOs) and – to the extent possible – access to cryptocurrencies.  With close to $350 billion in (theoretical) market value, cryptocurrencies have started to hit the mainstream, and it is becoming urgent to find a suitable, enforceable regulatory framework that protects investors and helps companies leverage the advantages of ICOs as an efficient way to access funding.  Here are some thoughts that may be helpful to structure and fire up the debate.  Speculation on utility is a bad idea  In my opinion, it would be a good idea to clearly separate functionality from funding. Mixing them together ends up producing transaction costs that are artificially high, since access to functionality is subject to speculation.  A good example of this is the very case of the ethereum network, which has become very difficult to use for real things due to the high price of ether in U.S. dollars, and because the network is swamped with speculative applications and trading.  I always understood the role of ether as a mechanism to pay for the use of a network that implements a shared supercomputer, which is a truly amazing construct that can change the world for good. But its dual role as an access token and a currency to store value is making the construct expensive and difficult to use in practice.  The implication of the above is that utility tokens are not a good idea. Firstly, because they are subject to uncurbed speculation on basic goods and services that will be out of reach for the least favored segments of the population.  The problem is particularly acute in this digital realm, where the network effect is significant and most businesses show a ""winner-take-all"" behavior. Therefore, the lack of mechanisms to curb speculation on uncensorable, decentralized networks leads to higher service costs and significant concentration of wealth.  The other reason utility tokens are a bad idea is because, if we are honest, in most cases they are in fact securities, and treating them as if they were not would essentially be a lie to ourselves.  A comparison often made in response to this point is the down payment for a house that is yet to be built, or the payment for a Tesla car that is yet to be manufactured and even designed. But in both cases users 1) are buying these basic goods for their personal use, and 2) have a fairly good idea of what they are buying.  Utility tokens, on the other hand, are arguably sold as a way to raise funding, they are bought as an (speculative) investment, and only rarely do the buyers have a good idea of what is going to be built.  ICOs can be an alternative to VC  That said, ICOs are proving to be a great instrument to help companies and entrepreneurs to raise funding.  In my opinion, we should collectively work on a framework to build a clearly defined scheme for ICOs, recognizing from the very beginning that they are securities.  Indeed, they are an alternative to traditional venture capital since 1) they provide a much more liquid capital instrument (VC will typically lock you down for 5–7 years until an exit is possible), and 2) they grant access to a much larger, diverse and atomized investor base with fewer intermediaries and in a more democratic way.  As a matter of fact, they greatly resemble initial public offerings (IPOs), which in essence can be seen as nothing less than crowdfunding schemes for large companies.  ICOs could mimic the same process, but on a much more efficient, digitally native platform, suitable for smaller projects and an atomized investor base.  If the above is true, the ICO process should be designed in collaboration with regulators to comply with securities law, which exist for a reason: to protect investors.  Key elements of this process would be as follows:  Securities would be issued on the shared ledger as tokens living on a smart contract, rather than in tokenized form. In other words, these smart contracts would implement securities as natively digital objects, instead of being digital representations of the (actual) securities living in traditional systems (or on paper).  Required information about the project needs to be filed and audited, so it is clearly understandable by potential investors.  Pursuant to know-your-customer rules, holders of tokens must be identified prior to the sale by the company, and also upon transfer to other holders.  Tokens should grant access to dividends and should provide voting rights. Non-KYC'ed holders should not be given dividends and their votes should not be considered  Role of cryptocurrencies  The use of cryptocurrencies in the ICO process as described above provides for further points of optimization compared to traditional IPOs and subsequent corporate governance.  First is the ability to use cryptocurrencies as a source of capital, provided that the world accepts them as a legitimate instrument for storing value and facilitates ways to exchange them for fiat currency.  But second, because their digital nature can be used to execute corporate actions in a more efficient and transparent way in comparison with the traditional system.  In fact, smart contracts are a perfect mechanism determine the behavior of securities contracts, as all conditions, covenants and actions can easily be automated with no room for interpretation. For example:  Dividends originated in fiat currency can be converted into cryptocurrency and paid to the token contract, which can then distribute the money proportionally to KYC’ed token holders (crypto businesses that produce profits directly in cryptocurrency have an additional benefit here, as dividends would be paid straight to the KYC’ed token holders).  Options and voting rights can be exercised by signing on the same smart contracts after identification of signing parties through attestations on a self-sovereign digital identity construct.  Lock up periods can very easily be enforced.  Any other actions such as options issuance and exercising, new share issuance or buybacks can be easily executed, and covenants can be transparently modeled using smart contract code  In fact, the separation of the business and the security token even makes it possible to use cryptocurrencies to fund traditional businesses models not related to crypto at all.  But also, an alternative way to fuel ICOs would be through the use of tokenized fiat currencies, either through tokenization processes over smart contracts, or by creating ether on a private version of ethereum redeemable in fiat.  These constructs would not be reliant on classical cryptocurrencies, yet would enable most of the benefits of current ICOs in terms of liquidity of shares, democratization of investment opportunities, and automation of corporate actions.  All of which should represent a significant improvement from traditional venture capital and IPOs.  The question is, what will happen first, regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a source of capital for companies, or creation of legal, fiat-backed ones?

According to an FT report, Mersch is now saying that, while regulators had been taking a wait-and-see approach to cryptocurrencies, ""since this hype accelerated at the end of last year it has moved higher up on the agenda.""  But, he added that, although the ECB shares Carstens' concerns over the issue of crypto assets, he doesn't believe the market is big enough to affect the wider economy.  Instead, the central bank is ""more concerned about the social and psychological effect"" of the hype in the market.  Mersch said:  ""There is so much money flowing in that it's like a gold rush – but there is no gold.""  The ECB board member also raised the subject of the illicit use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and terrorist financing, saying that a solution may be to ""force"" unregulated exchanges to report transactions – giving the ECB data it needs to ""create a better response.""  In his Feb. 6 comments, Carstens argued that cryptocurrencies could become ""parasites"" on the financial system, saying they must be held to the same standards as banking and payment services. He further stated that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed to undermine trust in central banks.  ""The tried, trusted and resilient modern way to provide confidence in public money is the independent central bank,"" Carstens said at the time.  Mersch's comments come a day after the European Union's top securities watchdog – the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) – released a report indicating that cryptocurrencies will be one of its top priorities for 2018.

According to a report from Nikkei, the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is looking to inspect several more cryptocurrency exchanges in the country starting as soon as this week, following its visits to Coincheck in the days after its recent major hack.  The plan comes as the agency seeks to push for stronger security procedures to be adopted by cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan in order to protect investors and to prevent such intrusions from reoccurring.  As reported previously, around $531 million-worth (at the time) of NEM tokens were stolen on Jan. 26 from the Coincheck exchange. That led to the FSA's on-site inspection on Feb. 2 to gauge the platform's security and financial ability to compensate victims, as it has promised.  The FSA has stated that it had warned the exchange about its security loopholes before the hack, which also explained why Coincheck has yet to obtain a formal approval from the agency.  In fact, Nikkei's report further explained that, while the cryptocurrency exchange business is burgeoning in Japan amid wider market growth, many platforms have fallen behind in terms of security protections.  According to the report, among the total 32 cryptocurrency exchanges, Coincheck is currently one of the 16 platforms that are not formally registered with the FSA because the operation started before the cryptocurrency law went into effect last April in Japan.

42380337,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MxQN,1518084020,Bull Case Strengthens? Bitcoin Stays Bid Above $8K,"Bitcoin's quick recovery from a minor wobble during Asian trading hours has strengthened its bull-case scenario, technical charts indicate  As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is at $8,165 – up 3.9 percent from the overnight low of $7,573. That said, the cryptocurrency is still down 3.7 percent from the previous day's high of $8,582.  On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, BTC clocked a high of $8,650 yesterday before a technical failure at key trendline resistance pushed prices back to $7,535. However, the dip was short-lived and the cryptocurrency moved back above the $8,000 mark this morning and was last seen changing hands at $8,280.  The positive price action indicates the investors continue to cheer the conciliatory tone adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at Senate hearing on Tuesday.  Bitcoin 4-hour chart  The last 4-hour candle closed above the descending trendline (1), signaling a bullish breakout. The move adds credence to the bullish price-RSI divergence indicated on Tuesday and the bullish higher lows pattern (as indicated by rising trendline).  View  BTC looks set to test yesterday's high of $8,650 and could make a move towards the $9,000 mark.  A slight cause of concern is the drop in volumes seen on the 4-hour chart, which puts a question mark on the sustainability of the breakout.  Further, BTC may find it hard to hold on to gains above $8,572 (10-day moving average), given the 5-day and 10-day MAs are still sloping downwards, indicating bearish setup.  A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA would validate the argument that BTC has bottomed out at $5,873 (Feb. 6 low).  Bearish scenario: Failure to hold above trendline (1) followed by a drop below $7,535 could yield re-test of the recent low of $5,873.

42380332,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MxGJ,1518080439,Bush Security Advisor Warns Against Blockchain Cold War,"The man who helped invent the financial embargoes that cut off terrorist funding after 9/11 is concerned that cryptocurrencies could be used to undermine his creations.  A former deputy assistant to U.S. President George W. Bush, and a former deputy national security advisor for combating terrorism, Juan Zarate is widely credited with helping create sanctions tools and financial instruments that put pressure on enemies of the state. But as blockchain technology begins to break down borders and empower the unbanked, Zarate is growing concerned it might also be weaponized to illicit ends.  Zarate told CoinDesk:  ""There are nefarious actors out there, including state actors like North Korea and Iran that are looking to the use of digital currencies and related technologies, at a minimum as a way of circumventing the current global order which limits their access to capital. But ‎these capabilities and technologies could also be a way for them to try to undermine global financial commercial systems at some point.""  To be clear, Zarate supports the idea that blockchain and cryptocurrencies could give ""greater autonomy"" to individuals, while potentially boosting ""commercial activity.""  Now a senior adviser at Washington D.C.-based think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and chairman of the Financial Integrity Network, Zarate was also among the technology's earliest advocates, having been an advisor to U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase since 2014.  Still, he's adamant there needs to be more transparency about how even governments might use blockchain due to the geo-political nature of the monetary system it could help reimagine.  Key to the success of the tools Zarate created, for example, was the U.S. dollar's status as the de facto global reserve currency. By creating ways to strategically cut off a nation's access to the dollar, Zarate was able to effectively restrict their ability to wage war or otherwise undermine U.S. interests.  In his 2013 book, ""Treasury's War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare,"" Zarate wrote a detailed account of these tools, but also ended with a stark warning about what he called the ""coming financial wars,"" in which the tools he helped create might be used against his own country.  And even though he identifies as a blockchain advocate, in interview, he outlined multiple examples of how state actors are already experimenting with the technology for illicit uses, in the process painting a vivid picture of what could go wrong.  Sanctions evasion  To date, the largest and most real threat of blockchain is its ability to help nation-states evade sanctions, according to Zarate.  Already, a Swedish startup has been granted a business license to build an infrastructure explicitly designed to help countries evade potential sanctions, with the stated goal of giving investors the ability to back ""good, hard-working companies and individuals"" in Iran.  Most recently, multiple reports by cybersecurity firms indicated that North Korea was amassing a ""war-chest"" of bitcoin to evade sanctions. Later, a South Korea official formally accused North Korea of stealing cryptocurrency worth ""billions of won.""  Indeed, Iran's own temporary sanctions relief has been recently called into question by U.S. President Donald Trump, who last month expanded what are considered strict sanctions against North Korea.  Zarate didn't comment specifically on the potential impact of such sanctions for the number of startups that have launched and are using blockchain solutions as a way to simplify international investment.  Still, he struck a perhaps forboding tone about what he sees as their possibly misguided intents.  Zarate said:  ""Actors that are less invested in the global financial commercial system are likely to be more reliant on technologies or techniques that give them asymmetric capabilities to threaten that very system.""  Government exploration  And Zarate sees a wide range of potential risks.  Since much of the success of Zarate's sanctions tools relied on the influence of the U.S. dollar as a global standard, anything that undermines that influence could undermine the tools.  Simply put, the possible threat is that value from state-backed fiat currencies could be siphoned off into cryptocurrencies that aren't technically limited by any borders, thereby undermining the issuers' ability to influence monetary policy.  While the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has said it is unlikely that cryptocurrency would ever impact that ability, central banks and lawmakers around the world are still exploring or seeking to explore this theory.  And though much of that work appears to be benign in nature, other central banks with a history of corruption allegations are also seeking out use cases.  It is, of course, possible that these banks are merely exploring cryptocurrencies as a way to increase transparency and perhaps expand the trust of the international community. But one, Venezuela, plans to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency, and it has already come out with the overt objective of circumventing ""financial blockades.""  ""We have to be very conscious of the fact that there are actors in the system, both state and non-state that may be willing to disrupt that system,"" said Zarate. ""They may be willing to use new technologies to actually undermine those very systems to affect the U.S. economy and to affect other economies, and frankly, even to profit from it.""  Responsible adoption  If Zarate has one message then, it's perhaps a warning about possible unforeseen consequences of the technology.  Already this week, U.S. lawmakers appear to be growing concerned about the possibilities, too, having convened representatives from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to answer questions on the issue in Washington, D.C.  Unsurprisingly, questions at the event focused on financial stability. And while both the heads of the CFTC and the SEC indicated they see cryptocurrencies as a low risk, they acknowledged this was likely due to the nascent state of the market.  Zarate draws a similar conclusion, but is perhaps more focused on what happens when that variable changes, and blockchains and cryptocurrencies aren't so academic anymore.  ""I'm incredibly optimistic about these technologies, but having witnessed failures in the past of regulation and recognition of risk, and cascading risk, I want to make sure that with adoption comes evaluation of where those risks lie,"" said Zarate, concluding:  ""And a recognition that we need greater transparency and not less, if we hope for these technologies to take hold.""

In a research report released Wednesday, Kerrisdale Capital alleges Kodak's blockchain effort isn't genuine, going so far as to call it ""a last-ditch stock promotion gambit for a company hurtling towards bankruptcy."" Kerrisdale holds a short position on Kodak's stock, and is known for giving strong opinions on public stocks that could move prices.  As reported by CoinDesk, Kodak announced an initial coin offering (ICO) on Jan. 9 in an effort to apply blockchain technology to solve copyright issues faced by photographers. The news was followed by a 37 percent jump in the company's stock, and a period of heightened performance.  However, in Wednesday's report, Kerrisdale Capital said its research leads it to believe that Kodak won't be able to compete with other blockchains startups, because ""it's staring at the possibility of default and a debt restructuring in the next 12-18 months.""  As such, the hedge fund argues that Kodak lacks the technological capacity and the funding to realize its claimed KodakCoin technology and thus transact and store images over a blockchain.  Addressing its separate plans to enter the mining market as well, the firm furthered its argument that the return of investment on Kodak remains questionable.

42428534,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8eHh,1518066030,Crypto's Price Correction Isn't Killing the Industry High,"""You should buy crypto in amounts you're not worried about, and sell it whenever you start thinking about it once a day.""  At least that's Blockchain CEO Peter Smith's stance on investing in cryptocurrency, a take issued during just one of a dozen or so panel discussions at Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit Tuesday. Focused solely on cryptocurrencies, the one-day event, curated in part by CoinDesk, paired Smith with Chain CEO Adam Ludwin, who agreed this wasn't exactly a bad investing philosophy.  The comments, while perhaps amounting to 'Investing 101' advice, were notable for their contrast to the ""just HODL"" movement, an ethos propagated by early investors that has largely encouraged the holding of cryptocurrency – no matter the ups and downs.  But that's not to say that the panel, as well as the day's event, didn't showcase just how captivated investors are with cryptocurrency these days.  Smith told attendees:  ""There's probably never been more hype about a technology or industry than ours.""  And numbers from a survey Yahoo undertook seem to bear that out.  According to Yahoo editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, 40 percent of respondents have bought cryptocurrencies over the past year. Yet, in the same survey, about half still believe they may be a fad or even a hoax.  Both the hype and this confusion has caught the attention of various regulators – two of which, the CFTC and the SEC, were called before a Senate hearing on cryptocurrency just a day before the event. As such, the hearing provided ample fodder for the speakers, many of whom saw the regulators' remarks as a positive for the fast-growing industry.  Speakers touched on the plethora of new investment vehicles and tools, even as some spoke out about what they feel is the nascent state of the technology.  ""Usually nascent technologies out of the lab don't get this much attention because there's no way to profit off them,"" said Ludwin. ""It's good to never lose sight of that.""  He added:  ""You have a capital markets phenomenon overlaid against a very early technology … so time will tell whether this intense capital markets thing around it stunts the growth or accelerates the growth or stunts and accelerates back and forth, which has sort of been the course so far.""  More sophisticated options  But caution aside, much of the focus was on products, including hedge funds, derivatives, futures and initial coin offerings (ICOs) – topics that were all widely discussed during the day's event.  For example, Barry Silbert, head of crypto investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), was there to tout a new fund announced Tuesday by Grayscale, a DCG subsidiary specializing in public markets vehicles offering cryptocurrency exposure.  The fourth Grayscale product, the Digital Large Cap Fund is designed to give investors exposure to the five largest cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization, and it joins the ranks of a whole slew of hedge funds that have launched over the past year to lure more institutional investors.  Not only that but derivatives, futures and ETFs were also mentioned several times.  Bitcoin futures  may have made a debut of two large traditional exchanges, CME Group and Cboe, at the end of last year, but there's talk that more could be on the way.  According to Karan Sood, the CEO of Cboe Vest, the investment management arm of Cboe, the launch of futures has parlayed into more interest from Cboe's institutional clients.  Speaking to the combination of traditional tools and the crypto market, Sood said:  ""To marry those two gets us all excited.""  Cboe also seems excited about the idea of bitcoin ETFs, filing with the SEC to list six in one week at the end of December. Yet, no ETF has been approved so far. And as the SEC has been reluctant to accept the crypto ETF notion in the past, several speakers voiced pessimism that the product would be seen soon.  ""A more likely thing is the continuation of the derivative aspect, because at least you have oversight from the CFTC on derivatives, and that’s how you were able to get the first products out,"" said Kathleen Moriarty, a partner at Chapman and Cutler LLP.  Yet, Sood said retail investors are still predominantly driving interest in these sophisticated products. And as such, regulators are doing their best to keep up.  Wait up, innovators  On hand representing this group was CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz, who spoke about how regulators are still trying to get their bearings in the crypto space.  Over the past several months, the CFTC has made headlines on multiple occasions for the role it played in jumpstarting the bitcoin futures market by overseeing a number of regulated products, and Quintenz didn't exactly temper the mood Tuesday.  ""One of the other takeaways from yesterday,"" said Quintenz, speaking to Monday's Senate hearing, ""was you didn't hear either chairman say ‘No, absolutely not, this is not safe, we must stop this at all costs.’ No one said that.""  He continued:  ""We don’t want to be saying no to innovators.""  Having said that, though, Quintenz did elaborate on where the CFTC and other regulators would be focusing some of their efforts.  According to him, regulators are looking at the difference between a futures contract and a sale. If the delivery of an asset happens within 28 days, he said, it's a sale and not a future. As such, the CFTC is currently looking for input on how to protect investors from what he called ""look-alike"" futures contracts.  Yet, while many speakers tipped their hats to the regulators for their seemingly positive outlook, Perianne Boring, the president of Chamber of Digital Commerce, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group for cryptocurrency, said the regulatory landscape remains a mess in her eyes.  The CFTC is regulating cryptocurrency as if it's a commodity; the IRS calls cryptocurrency property for tax purposes; and the SEC sees some cryptocurrencies as securities.  Because of this, she believes cryptocurrency entrepreneurs might leave the U.S. for not only places with lower regulatory hurdles, but those with a more clear regulatory framework for the nascent industry.  ""In three years, we’ve really turned this around, to the point where we have a Congressional blockchain caucus, a group of senators coming together to say we’re going to protect this industry,"" Boring continued.  But she and many others are hoping the cryptocurrency industry can come together to find ways to self-regulate so that stricter regulatory action isn't pursued.  ""We need best practices so people can delineate good from the bad,"" she remarked.  Proceed with caution  Yet, that's a tricky thing to do, especially since even experts in the industry have trouble figuring out what end is up in the space.  Alex Sunnarborg, a founding partner at Tetras Capital, went through a list of the ever-expanding list of available cryptocurrencies during his fireside chat, highlighting the growing number of token products, which have primarily differentiated themselves in name only (SAFT, ICO, TGE, ICBM).  All these new names have made it challenging for investors to differentiate tokens in an effort to decide which ones to invest in. And not only that but vetting cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens requires some amount of technical proficiency in looking at the teams, the white papers and the economics of the system.  Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, whose native cryptocurrency XRP has seen meteoric growth over the past couple months, also commented on the troubles of assessing the token industry. In particular, he said many of the tokens he sees don't have much purpose, and that as the industry corrects from the hype, ""there's also going to be carnage along the way.""  With that, Boring reminded the audience they shouldn't invest in things they don't understand.  ""For the retail investor who wants to get involved in the blockchain ecosystem, whether through an ICO or through other means, you really need to educate yourself,"" she continued. ""For the first time in possibly history, you can have control – but with that increased amount of control comes an increased amount of responsibility.""  Having said that, though, Boring is still a true-blue crypto believer, telling the audience:  ""I have more money in cryptocurrencies than in any formal retirement fund.""
