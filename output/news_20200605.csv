42394574,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwCvEx,1591396854,ShapeShift,"ShapeShift is a cryptocurrency exchange founded by Erik Voorhees in 2014. The company is headquartered in Switzerland but largely operated out of Colorado in the U.S.  ShapeShift initially distinguished itself in the industry as a non-custodial exchange that did not require customers to register or open accounts. Its team also initially used pseudonyms, with Voorhees utilizing the name ‘Beorn Gonthier’ - a Tolkien reference - until 2015. Similarly, in 2015 ShapeShift announced that it would stop serving New York residents after the state implemented the BitLicense, a regulation that would have required it to collect identifying information about customers. However, in 2018, the company launched a membership program that it said would eventually become mandatory for all of its users. It remains a non-custodial exchange.  When ShapeShift launched, the company positioned itself as a “cryptocurrency vending machine” that notably enabled users to purchase more cryptocurrencies than just bitcoin. The purchase process entailed customers requesting a particular cryptocurrency, providing a deposit address, depositing another cryptocurrency into a deposit wallet and then receiving their desired coin. No personal information was collected over the course of the purchase.  In March 2015, ShapeShift raised $525,000 in seed funding from early industry investors Barry Silbert and Roger Ver. In September of the same year the company raised an additional $1.6 million from Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, Ver and angel investors Bruce Fenton, Trevor Koverko and Michael Terpin. In 2017, ShapeShift closed a $10.4 million Series A funding round led by Earlybird Venture Capital, a Berlin based firm. Other participants included Lakestar, Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital and Access Venture Partners in addition to FundersClub, Digital Currency Group and Voorhees himself.  In 2016, ShapeShift lost around $230,000 in three thefts over the course of four weeks in March and April, which it claimed were carried out by a company employee. ShapeShift later said that it had discovered that an employee stole 315 BTC and it subsequently fired the responsible party. After their dismissal, the ex-employee sold security information such as ShapeShift’s IP address to an outside hacker, who then stole 154 BTC, 5,800 ETH and 1,900 LTC in two further hacks. Because ShapeShift is a non-custodial exchange, no customer funds were lost during the hacks.  In 2018, ShapeShift announced its membership program, citing a desire to reduce risk at the company during a time of “uncertain and changing global regulations.” It subsequently undertook a significant rebranding process in 2019 which saw it move from its shapeshift.io website to a platform that aggregates all the products Voorhees and his employees had been working on since the company launched. The new platform allows users to buy, sell, trade and over 50 digital assets. To use the platform, users must link their account to a hardware wallet such as Trezor or KeepKey, the latter of which was acquired by ShapeShift in 2017.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,"Parker Ferguson, John Metais",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/shapeshift,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcc1accf4fa96fd39dbec8335a6391df0062d8b5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432015,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Jh,1591395008,Coinbase Offers US Feds New Crypto Surveillance Tools,"Coinbase is getting in on the government blockchain analytics game.      The behemoth cryptocurrency exchange has initiated procurement deals with a number of U.S. agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for a cryptocurrency investigations tool called “Coinbase Analytics,” according to publicly available documents. The Block first reported on the prospective deals Friday.      Coinbase Analytics has close ties with Coinbase’s entire product ecosystem, as its Senior Product Manager “collaborates” with “Coinbase Consumer, Coinbase Pro, and Coinbase Custody as well as” Coinbase’s payments and crypto division, according to an undated but now closed job posting.      In an emailed statement, Coinbase said its Analytics product does not and has never used any internal customer data.      ""Coinbase Analytics data is fully sourced from online, publicly-available data, and does not include any personally-identifiable information for anyone, regardless of whether or not they use Coinbase,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk.      Coinbase joins a crowded field of cryptocurrency analytics companies – Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace and others – vying for a piece of the federal pie. Agencies from all corners of the U.S government regularly contract with crypto intel firms, inking deals for their tracing software worth millions, and sometimes stretching years.      Read more: Inside Chainalysis’ Multimillion-Dollar Relationship With the US Government      Apparently, Coinbase, who bought blockchain intelligence firm Neutrino in February 2019, is about to undercut the competition.      “This is the least expensive tool on the market and has the most features for the money,” read a DEA May notice so heavily redacted that those features’ specifics are unclear. But they are unique, as the IRS notice, published in April, notes Coinbase Analytics has “enhanced law enforcement sensitive capabilities that are not currently found in other tools on the market.”      Coinbase confirmed that it developed the Analytics product from Neutrino. It further stated that Analytics is available for financial institutions and law enforcement agencies alike, and is used in internal investigations.      ""It’s an important tool to meet our regulatory requirements and protect our customers’ funds,"" Coinbase said.      The DEA’s interest appears to stem in part from Coinbase Analytics’ pinpoint accuracy. It has “some of the most conservative heuristics used in commercial blockchain tracing tools,” a “critical” distinction in avoiding false positives, the DEA notice read.      Neither the DEA or IRS disclosed the bottom-line value of their prospective deals, which federal contract websites indicate have not been finalized yet. Both agencies seek year-long contacts with Coinbase, and the DEA deal is not more than $250,000.      The IRS has recently begun ramping up its activities in the cryptocurrency space, sending tax firms notices last month requesting proposals for auditing support.

According to the white paperhttps://www.binance.com/resources/ico/Binance_WhitePaper_en.pdf, Zhao's goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, poor market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.  Binance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance's proprietary blockchain, Binance Chain.  In 2019, Binance started to offer support for new token listings through IEOs, or initial exchange offerings, that offer users the ability to purchase new tokens only with BNB in an exclusive launch.  In May 2019, hackers stole over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ's ""Funds are #safu"" tweet has become something of a meme in the crypto space.  Binance has secured several notable partnerships, including a 2018 memorandum of understanding with Malta to launch an office and a fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchange. Binance's physical location remains a point of contention. Technically the firm is headquartered in Malta, though the island European nation said in Feburary 2020 that Binance was not under its jurisdiction. Since then Binance has not said just where, exactly, it is headquartered.  Binance licensee Binance US was established in late 2019 to serve American crypto traders.  In April 2020, the exchange made one of the splashiest acquisitions of the year when it bought CoinMarketCap, the storied (if somewhat flawed) cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/binance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87dd867064cd349246aa2f286092b52902152787-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company aims to offer monetization opportunities to online publishers through “instantaneous and low-cost micropayments”, where they can charge fees of any size for consumers to interact with their content.  SatoshiPay enables content producers to decide what content they get paid for and how much they get paid, while providing a micropayments infrastructure that is currency-agnostic. SatoshiPay previously utilized Bitcoin to power its micropayments, but shifted to the Stellar blockchain in 2017 due to barriers with scaling and transaction fee issues on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The company’s products include a stellar wallet called Solar, an application programming interface (API) and a WordPress plugin. In 2016, SatoshiPay partnered with Visa Europe’s innovation unit on developing a proof-of-concept system that would allow automatic micropayments from a user’s VISA account to a SatoshiPay wallet. At the time, the company said the goal of this partnership was to explore use cases such as micropayments for internet-of-things (IoT) devices.  SatoshiPay has carried out several funding rounds. In 2015, SatoshiPay garnered €160,000 (roughly $180,000) from Kuala Innovations Limited in seed funding in exchange for 10 percent of the company. As part of the same round SatoshiPay received an additional €200,000 from Coinsilium Group, who was also the firm’s lead investor, in 2016. In 2017, a new funding round netted the company €640,000 (roughly $684,000) from Blue Star Capital.  In 2018, SatoshiPay announced that it planned to go public on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM. Daniel Masters contributed €566,000 in pre-IPO funding, though the company announced that it had canceled its plans to IPO in January 2019. In February 2019, the company raised €1 million in a round led by CoinShares’ Daniel Masters with participation from SatoshiPay CEO Meinhard Benn, blockchain platform Aeternity, enterprise blockchain organization AERGO and angel investors.

42421871,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwliv,1591392679,Block.one,"Block.one is a private blockchain company founded by Brenden Blumer and Dan Larimer in 2017. It is best known for developing the EOS.IO protocol, which the company announced in 2017 and subsequently released as open-source software in 2018.  The EOS.IO blockchain was developed with the aim of facilitating efficient and scalable decentralized applications (dapps). The blockchain includes an operating-system-like set of services and functions and works similarly to the Ethereum platform. Block.one completed an initial coin offering (ICO) of EOS in June 2018 after taking over a full year and 350 periods of distribution (one token distribution of 2 million tokens per day). The ICO raised over $4 billion over the full year, with 1 billion tokens sold: 90% to the ICO participants and 10% to the Block.one team.  Shortly after the ICO, several executives departed Block.one to create StrongBlock, a company that helps businesses launch, manage and scale enterprise blockchains.  In order to secure its network, EOS.IO uses a delegated proof-of-stake model (DPoS), a concept first developed by Larimer. DPoS uses real-time voting combined with a social system of reputation to achieve consensus on who can create the next block of transactions in the blockchain. Every EOS token holder has influence over what happens on the network, proportional to how many tokens their account holds. After initially deciding not to utilize its influence in the platform’s governance process, Block.one later decided to utilize its tokens to vote for block producers.  In 2019, Block.one revealed that it would launch a social media platform on the EOS blockchain called Voice. The platform will have its own native token, the Voice Token, that will allow users to earn crypto while posting content. Furthermore, in order to keep bots off the platform, Block.one will perform identity checks using a government ID.  In September 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that Block.one must pay a $24 billion penalty for their 2017-2018 ICO, which the SEC classified as an unregistered securities sale. Adding to that, Block.one's problems are not yet over. Block.one promised to build a decentralized protocol without a leader when raising money in 2017. But critics argue Block.one failed to achieve that goal. Investors filed a class-action lawsuit against Block.one in May 2020 asserting that Block.one raised money during ""a global frenzy over cryptocurrencies and unchecked human greed."" At the start of 2021, Dan Larimer announced his departure from the company via a public message on Block.one's social media platform, Voice. The former Steemit and BitShares creator gave no indication as to what motivated the move but said he intends to turn his focus towards ""building more censorship-resistance technologies"" elsewhere.

However, some observers see fundamental problems ahead.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,735 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 1% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Friday (8:00 p.m. Thursday EDT), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands around $9,800 on spot exchanges like Coinbase. The price stayed around there until 10:00 UTC (6:00 a.m. EDT), when selling caused bitcoin to drop as low as $9,584. Bitcoin is now close to its 50-day and 10-day technical indicator moving averages, indicating sideways trading heading into the weekend.      Read More: Bullishness Building in Bitcoin Options Market, Data Suggests      The markets story of the day was the surging performance of stocks on Friday. Economic data released from the U.S. Labor Department showed May to have the largest one-month employment increase ever. That was after a record drop in April due to the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on the global economy.      As a result, Europe posted big gains in late trading, as theFTSE 100 of top public companies closed the day up 2.25%, thus making the week positive by 6.7%. In the United States, the S&P 500 index climbed 2.6%, closing the week in the green 5.2%.      Yet, the total employment number likely belies bigger economic problems ahead and the rally in equities might be short lived, said George Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis Capital.      “Stocks are on Prozac,” Clayton said. “Unemployment came in better than forecast, but it’s still at 13.3%.”      Some traders skeptical of traditional markets see crypto as the best investment during turbulent times. That likely has been one of the reasons for bitcoin’s continued outperformance relative to the S&P 500 year-to-date.      “For the last two years, many have been anticipating a global economic crisis. 2008-2009 did not change anything in the fundamental faults of global debt, money printing and wealth distribution,” said Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelberg.

42432017,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Nh,1591388311,Money Reimagined: The Ongoing Crisis Is Stirring a Crypto Awakening in Developing Nations,"Regular readers of this column will know about the recent surge in African peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions, now at more than $12 million a week, according to Useful Tulips.      I think this, and similar patterns across other emerging market regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect the most important cryptocurrency trend of the moment. We are a long way from mass adoption, but the circumstances driving this nascent demand in the developing world, not only for bitcoin but also for stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, bring the human benefits of this new form of money into stark relief.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      What’s driving this is a worldwide dollar shortage. For billions of non-Americans in places far from the United States’ now-unruly cities, the U.S. currency is a vital instrument in their daily lives. But it is now scarce. If you can’t get dollars and you don’t trust your local currency, bitcoin and stablecoins start to look attractive, either as a hedge against future inflation or as a payments or remittances solution.      Dollar shortages are the mirror image of the Federal Reserve’s “QE infinity” program and the reason it rapidly created swap lines with 16 central banks in industrialized countries in March. At that time, the pandemic had triggered a kind of global bank run into dollars. Debtors in European and Asian financial capitals who’d borrowed in dollars scrambled to buy them to cover margin calls on their collateral, which in turn sent investors racing to secure access to the same USD safe haven. As Jill Carlson wrote for CoinDesk, the Fed had no choice but to “turn on the taps” to feed the world’s demand.      Note some key words in that prior paragraph: “industrialized countries” and “financial capitals.” The Fed’s rescue mission might have stabilized global currency markets for now, but the Wall Street-centric structure of its policy implementation means the liquidity injections are far from evenly spread.      While quantitative easing has breathed life into U.S. stocks (see below), the shortages have persisted in many emerging markets, creating serious problems in their citizens’ lives. That’s especially so in many formally or informally “dollarized” countries, where mistrust of the local currency makes the dollar the preferred unit for business-to-business transactions, savings, and large-ticket consumer payments such as rent.      This is what’s happening in oil-exporting Nigeria, where the collapse in the price of crude has combined with the global dollar shortage to create a real USD crisis. It’s no wonder that Africa’s biggest economy is the biggest contributor to the pickup in the continent’s peer-to-peer bitcoin exchanges.    Microtasking to survive    Consider also Venezuela. Nicolas Maduro’s dictatorship has unofficially abandoned constraints on dollar usage because an evaporation in the bolivar’s value has made it physically impossible for people to carry all the banknotes needed to buy groceries. Now, in the midst of the pandemic, home-bound Venezuelans can’t find the dollars they need. For some, bitcoin is offering a solution.      “USD bills are getting like a rare thing, like a collectible,” says journalist Javier Bastardo, who spoke to me from his electricity-challenged home in Caracas. “So, people are finding new ways to avoid the depreciation of the bolivar.”      One way, they are doing this, Bastardo said, is by “doing microtasks, connecting to a website where you can earn 10 satoshis (0.0000001 BTC) for doing different things.”      Yes, crowdsourced microtasking, by which companies get large numbers of people to collectively teach human intuition to machine-learning algorithms – think of those sign-on requests to identify traffic lights – is now a money-earner for people in the developing world. Developments in crypto technology have enabled this.      Previously, on-chain bitcoin fees – currently around $3 per transaction – were too high to sustain the kinds of micropayments made for these many small tasks. But advances in the layer two Lightning Network, which allows for secure off-chain transactions, now mean that sites such as Stak can affordably provide these money-earning services to their customers. Stak users in the Philippines and Argentina can earn enough satoshis to buy smartphones offered on the site.    Stablecoins' opening    Developing-country demand for bitcoin, however, still seems less based on its role as a payments vehicle than on its appeal as a gold-like speculative asset and store-of-value, an especially valuable proposition in places threatened by hyperinflation. What, though, of the challenge of day-to-day payments and remittances in dollar-scarce countries?      This is where stablecoins could be stepping up.      Latin American wallet provider Ripio offers evidence of that. CEO Sebastian Serrano says active user demand for the platforms’s stablecoin offerings, USDC and Dai, grew tenfold in the first quarter.      The reason seems pretty clear: people want what they’re used to.      “What people want in Nigeria or in Venezuela isn’t really bitcoin but the U.S. dollar,” says Alejandro Machado, a colleague of Carlson’s at the Open Money Initiative. “So if you can have an asset that mimics or behaves like dollars perhaps we have a solution.”      For Machado, the solution doesn’t lie in Ethereum-based stablecoins like tether, USDC or dai, but in leveraging the liquidity that he says only bitcoin can provide. He's currently working with Valiu, a service targeted at Venezuelans that doesn’t create stability through a reserve model like Tether or USDC, or through a smart contract-based collateral system like Dai, but synthetically. Through a sophisticated strategy for trading and hedging bitcoin, Valiu offers access to a digitally executed contract whose value holds steady against the dollar.      These various solutions are landing in emerging markets that are, once again, reeling from problems that emanate from industrialized countries. Whether they’ll achieve mainstream usage rates remains to be seen. (The $8 million daily turnover for bitcoin trades in Nigeria, for example, although double that of two months ago, is a tiny drop within that country’s $420 billion economy.)      Still, there appears to be a clear and broad-based uptrend in demand. It speaks to what many of us have long argued: that the most obvious use cases for cryptocurrency lie in the developing world.      I think this, and similar patterns across other emerging market regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect the most important cryptocurrency trend of the moment. We are a long way from mass adoption, but the circumstances driving this nascent demand in the developing world, not only for bitcoin but also for stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, bring the human benefits of this new form of money into stark relief.    A bifurcated American Dream    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, with its specially tailored selection of 30 important companies’ stocks, was designed by its founders as a snapshot of the American economy. It’s one reason why the performance of “the Dow” is often used as a proxy measure of U.S. prosperity, a rather simplified encapsulation of the American Dream. So it’s worth asking: how has this most famous of Wall Street indicators done over the past two weeks?      Between May 25, the Memorial Day holiday on which Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, and Thursday, June 4, the Dow gained 7.4%, marking the best 50-day performance for U.S. stocks ever. And now, after some surprisingly good unemployment numbers, they are up again as of Friday afternoon (by more than 930 points as of 5:48 p.m. UTC).      Let’s put this in context. Within the past nine trading days, millions swarmed into American cities to protest the unending injustice and racial inequality that this crime represented. There were violent responses from some members of the security forces and alarming acts of destruction and theft from some of the protesters. Meanwhile, as the nation’s political divisions were deepened by a President who seemed to want to fan the flames, the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 100,000. Yet the stock market was up, CNBC pundits said, on hope of a stronger-than-expected economic recovery.      I have an alternative theory: investors know that the longer America is gripped by an existential crisis, the more money the Fed will pour into financial assets. I’m not sure how enriching hedge funds at this time will help overcome this country’s divisions. It will only underscore the failure of our financial system and the need for an alternative. It’s time for a new system.    The Global Town Hall    KYCING OUR VIDEO CALLS Thanks to COVID-19 lockdowns, the world now lives on Zoom. So it’s no wonder eyebrows were raised when company CEO Eric Yuan this week said non-paying customers wouldn’t get privacy-protecting end-to-end encryption. Citing a presentation to investors this past week, Bloomberg’s Nico Grant reported Yuan as saying, “Free users for sure we don’t want to give that because we also want to work together with the FBI, with local law enforcement, in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose.” There were understandable privacy concerns among the crypto community, though Abra CEO Bill Barhydt pointed out that Zoom, which currently has no ad model or other means of monetizing free users, could never afford the expensive exercise of encrypting everybody. What struck me, though, was how the arrangement made this information platform’s customer relationship look like that of a bank. If you buy a Zoom subscription, it won’t be able to snoop on your calls, but it will know who you are. Sound familiar? Know-your-customer, or KYC, rules are the bedrock of how banks serve law enforcement’s efforts to catch money launderers. I suppose we shouldn’t be surprised: money is just a form of information anyway.      FORKING THE MEME Memes can be one of the most entertaining things on the internet... until you become one, of course. What started as a footnote in the larger protests surrounding the killing of George Floyd – a photo of a person whom we can only conclude is a bitcoin bro, or at least aspires to be one, held up a sign with the slogan ""Bitcoin will save us"" – became a cautionary tale. The image predictably went viral, drawing the ire of people inside and outside of the crypto community for pushing crypto gospel at precisely the wrong time.      That would have been the end of it, except someone in that community photoshopped the face of bitcoin proponent Neeraj Agrawal – himself widely thought of as Crypto Twitter's meme king – onto the head of the protester, giving the viral image a second, stronger life (not sharing or linking here to prevent further ""infection""). For those in the know, it was a cleverly ironic visual twist, but with so many Twitter users with high follow counts liking, retweeting or commenting on the image, it inevitably veered over the edge of context collapse when it reached a wider audience. As Agrawal himself noted, the proliferation of the doctored image probably wasn't good for him (or bitcoin) — a reminder that, on social media, with great influence comes great responsibility. –Pete Pachal      GOD, THAT'S GOOD ... BUT I have to hand it to Frances Coppola. That was a superb biblical metaphor in her CoinDesk op-ed about why Libra caved in to regulators’ demands and ended its currency basket model. Citing the Tower of Babel story, the writer compared Facebook and its fellow Libra Association members to those “upstart humans [who] challenged God (aka government) by building something that would, by reaching to heaven, threaten his authority.” Taking the analogy further, Coppola said a currency is like a language – which it very much is. Just as God punished the humans by making them speak mutually incomprehensible languages, so too did the powers of government force Libra to break up its operation into multiple, independent stablecoins.      Here’s the thing: As per Jack Miles’ book “God: A Biography” about the shifting depiction of the Old Testament’s God as a character, it’s we humans who decide what God is like. (Humans made God in their likeness, not vice versa.) We do the same with our governments – with varying degrees of democratic participation. Just as we have sometimes made God a benevolent, loving figure, we’ve occasionally produced benign governments. But we’ve also allowed terrible, malevolent leaders to take power, much like the spiteful God that Miles documents in numerous parts of his wonderful deconstruction. Now’s a time when we humans should be rewriting the character of our government – or more specifically, the governance of our financial system. And while Libra sure ‘aint perfect, and could allow its owners to exploit the people they’re supposed to serve, it has the potential to contribute to a better system. In fact, with those otherwise independent stablecoins built on Libra’s open-source, interoperable code base, they may well end up talking to each other.      God and governments will always be around. But there are times when we need to reimagine him/her/them. This is one of those times.

42432007,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN901h,1591387554,SEC Moves to Freeze Assets of Alleged $12M Crypto Investment Scam,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved Friday to freeze the assets of a cryptocurrency mining and multilevel marketing scheme that it claimed bilked investors of $12 million.      Unsealing its complaint against Utah resident Daniel F. Putnam, his businesses MMT Distributions and R & D Global and associates Angel A. Rodriguez of Utah and Jean Paul Ramirez Rico of Colombia, the SEC claimed the three had lied to investors and misappropriated funds.      The “Modern Money Team” (MMT), as Putnam apparently called both businesses, invested in crypto mining equipment from at least July 2017 and eventually pivoted to offering investors “cryptocurrency trading packages” that would exploit crypto “arbitrage” opportunities at Bitfinex, according to the complaint, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the District of Utah.Ramirez ran the crypto investments, Rodriguez was the liaison, and Putnam, a veteran of multilevel marketing, ran MMT.      Two hundred investors joined Putnam’s mining scheme, and MMT collectively raised $12 million from 2,000 investors in total, the SEC alleged. The SEC further alleged MMT ceased paying out investors in November 2019 but continued to raise funds through March 9, 2020.      But the complaint said some of the money never went toward crypto mining equipment or digital asset investments. Instead, Putnam spent over $100,000 of his investors’ funds on a condominium and $33,000 buying a spa, according to the SEC.      Ramirez controlled the Bitfinex account that Putnam told investors as recently as January 2020 held 260 bitcoin, according to the complaint. But the SEC alleged the account never held more than 50, and that it was closed in May 2019. Ramirez had been periodically making Ponzi-like payments to investors, the SEC alleged.      The SEC alleged Putnam and Rodriguez knew “or were reckless in not knowing” that Ramirez was running a Ponzi-like scheme based on WhatsApp communications.      “We are either going to retire this year or go to jail,” Putnam texted to Rodriguez in February 2019, according to the SEC. “And Im [sic] still not sure any of it is real.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/05/sec-moves-to-freeze-assets-of-alleged-12m-crypto-investment-scam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e4f8b8a9613ff360c98032e1dae3140eeb8c80-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421869,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwlgr,1591386365,Mt. Gox,"Launched in 2010 Mt. Gox was the world’s largest bitcoin exchange until its demise in 2014.  By 2013, the Japan-based exchange was handling 70 percent of all bitcoin trades worldwide, but collapsed in 2014 after it was revealed that it had lost 744,408 of its customers’ bitcoins and 100,000 of its own bitcoins, amounting to the loss of approximately 7% of all bitcoins at the time.  Programmer Jed McCaleb, who later co-founded Ripple and Stellar, was the original owner of the mt.gox domain. Mt. Gox was an abbreviation for ""’Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange,"" as McCaleb initially purchased the domain with the intention of creating an exchange for ""magic"" cards associated with the trading card game. McCaleb later converted the site into a bitcoin exchange, and after about a year of operation, sold it to programmer Mark Karpelès in March 2011.  In June 2011, a hacker initiated a massive sell-off of bitcoin from a compromised user account, leading the price of bitcoin to plummet on the exchange. The hacker also stole details from 60,000 mt.gox users.  In March 2013, the bitcoin blockchain temporarily split into two, with differing rules upon how transactions could be accepted - this caused Mt.Gox to halt bitcoin deposits.  In May 2013, a business partner, CoinLab, sued the exchange for $75 million for breach of contract. The companies had previously agreed that CoinLab would take over Mt.Gox’s North American customers, but CoinLab alleged that this never materialized. During the same month, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security forced payment processor Dwolla to suspend transactions to and from Mt. Gox’s account.  On Feb. 7, 2014, Mt. Gox stopped all bitcoin withdrawals, claiming an increase in withdrawals was creating technical problems. On February 24th, the exchange suspended all trading and the website went offline, that same week a document leaked revealing 744,408 BTC was stolen from customers in a hacking incident. Another 100,000 of Mt.Gox’s bitcoin was also missing. It later discovered approximately 200,000 BTC in an old-format bitcoin wallet.  On Feb. 23, CEO Mark Karpelés resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, and all previous posts from the Mt. Gox twitter account had been deleted.  Five days later Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy claiming a debt of $63.6 million. In April 2014, it filed for liquidation. Attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi was appointed as the exchange’s bankruptcy trustee to administer and dispose of its assets.  Mark Karpelés was arrested in Japan on August 2015 with charges of fraud and embezzlement. He was released on bail in 2016, but in March 2019, Karpelés was found guilty of falsifying data reflected in Mt. Gox bookkeeping while found not guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust.  In 2017, several Mt.Gox creditors filed a petition for the commencement of civil rehabilitation proceedings against Mt. Gox. with the Tokyo District Court. A judge approved the petition in 2018 and stayed the previously ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.  When Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, creditors filed claims as to how much they should receive in recompense. CoinLab originally claimed $75 million, the amount it had sued Mt. Gox for in 2013 for breach of contract. However, when civil rehabilitation proceedings commenced, creditors had to refile their claims. All other creditors refiled for their original claims except CoinLab, which reportedly increased its claim to $16 billion. Creditors will reportedly be unable to vote on a civil rehabilitation plan until Coinlab’s claim is assessed by a bankruptcy judge, delaying the proceedings indefinitely.  Additionally, in 2019, two plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Jed McCaleb (the original owner of Mt. Gox) and accused him of ""negligent"" and ""fraudulent"" misrepresentation of the exchange, and knowingly hiding security issues - which in part, the plaintiffs claim - led to their loss of bitcoin when the exchange was hacked in 2014.  Also in 2019, crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce launched Gox Rising, which aims to bring together Mt. Gox’s creditors and submit a civil rehabilitation plan to the Tokyo District Court. Gox Rising also aims to relaunch Mt.Gox as an exchange.  Resources:  Mt.

Blockchain capital closed a $13 million investment fund for bitcoin and blockchain startups in 2016. In 2017, the firm announced that it would raise its next fund through an initial coin offering (ICO) of an ethereum-based token dubbed BCAP. The token represented shares in its Blockchain Capital III Digital Liquid Venture Fund. Blockchain Capital raised $10 million in six hours.  In January 2018, bitcoin developer Jimmy Song joined the firm as a venture partner. Later that year, Blockchain Capital raised $150 million, with $125 million going to its Blockchain Capital IV Venture Fund and $25 million worth of cryptocurrency to its Blockchain Capital Parallel Fund IV. The $25 million worth of cryptocurrency was later revealed to be in the form of XRP, which was invested in the fund by Ripple Labs. The fund was the first to accept capital calls in cryptocurrency.

Originally founded in 2014 in Hong Kong, the exchange is currently based in the Seychelles. Hayes is the CEO.  The platform only handles prices in bitcoin rather than fiat currencies, meaning that all gains and losses are in BTC. BitMEX offers a variety of trading services, including margin trading with up to 100 times leverage (meaning that a deposit of $1,000 will result in a trader having the ability to trade $100,000 worth of BTC) and futures trading (allowing investors to bet on the future prices of BTC). In 2016, BitMEX became the first Bitcoin denominated futures contract on a Chinese A Share index.  BitMEX also has a research department that produces reports on the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.  In 2019, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reportedly opened an investigation into BitMEX pertaining to whether the exchange allowed U.S. traders to use its platform. The CFTC has jurisdiction over commodities and derivatives trading in the U.S., and BitMEX would be required to register with the commission if it wanted to allow Americans to use its platform to trade those products.  On Oct. 1, 2020, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed a criminal indictment against Hayes and several other BitMEX executives, alleging they failed to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act in allowing U.S. residents to trade funds on the platform. Specifically, they said the exchange did not conduct know-your-customer (KYC) checks, which opened the door for potential criminal activity. As one example, the office said proceeds from an exchange hack were laundered through BitMEX. Hayes and his team knew this was happening but did nothing to stop it, the prosecutors alleged. On the same day, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged BitMEX, its leaders and it related entities violated the Commodity Exchange Act by letting U.S. residents conduct transactions on an unregistered platform operating in the U.S.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/bitmex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61b2a3b8db9fa1f16aec3ebf7a821d353f9969d5-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432021,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Rh,1591375829,Crypto Derivatives Exchange OKEx Launches Options on Ether,"Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx rolled out option contracts on Ethereum’s ether (ETH) token on Thursday, ending the Panama-based Deribit’s virtual monopoly in the space.      “OKEx ETH Options Contracts will be settled in ETH. Each contract’s face value of ETH/USD options is 1 ETH,” Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, told CoinDesk.      Options are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right, but not obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. While a call option represents a right to buy, a put option gives the holder the right to sell.      The mark prices of exchange’s options are determined by the Black-Scholes model on a real-time basis, and the final settlement price will be generated via a time-weighted average of the underlying price over a period of time ahead of expiry.      To avoid what OKEx calls a “societal clawback,” the exchange has already established an ETH/USD options insurance fund of 1,000 ETH, worth about $240,000 as of Friday. Clawbacks occur when the exchange’s insurance fund lacks sufficient reserves to cover investors’ total margin call losses. Exchanges face such shortages and socialize losses by clawing back a portion of the gains of profitable traders when the market unexpectedly sees a big bullish or bearish move, leading to forced unwinding of long/short positions.      “Options would give traders more versatility and a great way to hedge their risk,” said Hao. Ether's fortunes are closely tied with the use of Ethereum in decentralized applications (dApps). Hence, one may argue ether options are hedging instruments for dApps.      Investor interest in the crypto derivatives market has exploded this year, with open interest in ether futures listed on major exchanges rising by 100%. Meanwhile, open interest in ether options listed on Deribit has skyrocketed by over 900%, according to the data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      As of Thursday, OKEx was the largest ether futures exchange by open interest, accounting for 26% ($179 million) of the global tally of $672 million. Further, the exchange recently surpassed BitMEX to become the largest bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange by open interest.      “Adding ETH options is a logical next step for us, and also a market demand particularly as we pride ourselves on the wide variety of products and features that we offer traders, allowing them to keep their pricing strategies more flexible,"" said Hao.      While OKEx dominates the futures product, the options segment is ruled by Deribit exchange. As of Thursday, Deribit accounted for more than 75% of the total open interest of $1.3 billion in BTC options and contributed almost the entire open interest of $144.35 million in ether options. Meanwhile, OKEx contributed only 4% of the total open interest in BTC options.      OKEx, therefore, has plenty of ground to cover before threatening Deribit’s number one position in the options market. The exchange has traded $1 million worth of ether option contracts since inception and has $342,000 worth of open positions at press time.      OKEx plans to launch options on EOS, the ninth largest cryptocurrency by trading volume, on June 18.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/05/crypto-derivatives-exchange-okex-launches-options-on-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18e59414a73c143e36a74cbc23c5ebf3528b3119-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432010,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Bh,1591375809,How Bitcoin Fits Into Lebanon’s Banking Crisis,"Lebanon’s financial crisis has banks looking for alternative monetary policy and citizens scrambling for alternative banking services.      The economic crisis has been raging for years, but political turmoil and the pandemic-induced global market downturn has raised fears of government defaults and the devaluation of the Lebanese pound. As a result, more Lebanese people are seeking information about bitcoin (BTC), which is relatively cheap and accessible compared to the fractured banking system.      The exchange rate for Lebanese pounds to dollars has skyrocketed from 1,500 pounds for every dollar to 4,000 pounds for every dollar, said Patrick Mardini, CEO of the Lebanese Institute for Market Studies and associate professor of finance at the University of Balamand in Lebanon. That exchange rate also varies depending on the type of dollar.      Dollars already inside the restricted Lebanese banking system trade for less than physical dollars from the local black market, which are easier to move around. This is why some people are using bitcoin to buy black-market dollars to pay off their bank loans cheaply, said bitcoin researcher Matt Ahlborg.      Read more: Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: The Middle East      Most traders on LocalBitcoin get their bitcoin by using bank accounts outside of their country of residence and use the local listing as a type of advertisement. Some software developers and poker players, who earn bitcoin from foreign clients or online games, also bring their bitcoin to this and other over-the-counter (OTC) traders to liquidate for local currency. Likewise, attorney Charbel Choueh, partner at Choueh Law, said his firm is the first in Lebanon to accept both tether (USDT) and bitcoin from clients abroad.      “The bitcoin coming into the country is coming from the freelance market ... plus a little bit from poker people and remittances,” Ahlborg said, referring to how most newbies use social networks to find bitcoin veterans rather than rely on exchanges. “There’s more demand due to the COVID-19 shutdown of traditional finance and supply chain businesses.”      One anonymous OTC trader, who has been operating in Lebanon since 2013, estimated the Lebanese people trade between $1 million and $5 million a month using informal networks, which dwarfs the $54,916 worth of Lebanese bitcoin transactions tallied over the past year on Paxful and LocalBitcoins combined. He added the COVID-19 pandemic increased demand, and therefore the fees, of local hawala remittance networks. Now that hawala options are more expensive, by comparison, bitcoin is a cheaper and more attractive option, he said.      Such traders primarily use sites like Paxful for advertising but conduct the trades using other mobile apps. Many bitcoin traders in emerging markets like Lebanon, even professional OTC traders that move assets at scale, rely on WhatsApp as one of the top chat platforms for discussing deals. Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter are among the most important platforms in this scene.      Social networks have essentially become grassroots financial networks without banking restrictions, relying on global currencies like dollars and bitcoin. In response to this, the government has banned exchange-rate apps showing the actual exchange rate for pounds to dollars.    Bankers strike back    Meanwhile, proposals from the government and bankers suggest the country is in reform, Mardini added.      If the country can prove it is rebuilding its fiscal infrastructure, it might be able to secure billions of dollars in financing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). IMF backing would encourage further investment from the international community, Mardini added.      At the moment, the government’s plan is to cut its debt by about 62% and wipe out $44 billion in foreign exchange losses at the Lebanese central bank. This plan would include wiping out the reserve capital at the central bank, the reserve capital at private banks and a certain amount of deposits from the country’s wealthiest people.      The result of both the government and central bank defaulting on debts would likely shrink the number of banks in the economy from 50 to 10, Mardini added. In a country that’s already dealing with a central bank that struggles to prove its independence from political factions, Mardini said he worries the restructuring of the banking system in Lebanon would create more distrust in banks.      Read more: Despite Bitcoin Price Dips, Crypto Is a Safe Haven in the Middle East      “If you let the government do the restructuring, they would put their hand on the banking sector – the crown jewel of the Lebanese economy,” Mardini said. “It would be an oligopoly of 10 banks controlling the market.”      Currently the Lebanese banks are asking the government to consider a counter-proposal that would include no government defaults. The first part of the plan would allow the government to purchase bonds with lower interest rates from private banks. The second part of the proposal looks similar to tokenization in the crypto space: Government assets like the telecommunications networks, waterfronts and real estate assets in Lebanon would be made into bonds and essentially be tradable shares.      The banks argue this would hypothetically decrease the government’s debt by $40 billion, but the bonds would be wholly owned by the government. “You’re just transferring it from one central government to another government entity in a fund,” Mardini said.      Mardini said he’d prefer the government dissolve the central bank and replace it with a currency board that would ensure the Lebanese pounds would be backed 100% by the U.S. dollar.      “Either they keep them in cash or put them in secure-asset American government bonds, which would allow a certain income and cover the costs of operations for currency board,” Mardini said about his proposal. “The quantity of money issued by the currency board into circulation would be determined by market conditions.”    Crypto vs. the pound    Jon Gayfield, a U.S. Navy veteran who began mining crypto in 2013 and was an early trader on Mt. Gox, has been working with Professor Mardini on ways to introduce crypto to the Lebanese people after meeting Mardini through Gayfield’s sister, who does humanitarian work in Lebanon.      The ethos of economic freedom that undergirds the cryptocurrency community made Gayfield realize that bitcoin could be a humanitarian endeavor in addition to a business model, he said.      “I believe cryptocurrency is potentially the best anti-war idea ever devised,” Gayfield said. “If the citizens of a nation actually owned their currency/wealth and not the government, then the government must actually serve the people and cannot wage war without the consent of the governed for funding.”      Initially, Gayfield considered having Lebanese expats use bitcoin for remittances to get crypto flowing into the country.      “In an ideal case that is a necessary part of what we’re trying to do,” Gayfield said. “However, the way to get this working is not to use a really broad solution like that you’re going to have to get a large portion of the population to learn how to use the technology.”      Read more: Lebanese Bitcoiners Show How to Talk About Crypto at Thanksgiving      Currently, Gayfield is looking at having importers send crypto to a company that Gayfield and Mardini would headquarter in Malta, converting that crypto to fiat and using that fiat to pay international suppliers and curtailing the banking system.      “We could get a couple of importers on board for our proof-of-concept and demonstrate that it works,” Gayfield said. “Then we’re driving the adoption where regular citizens could potentially pay the importer directly in crypto. … Expats are more likely to send crypto to the country if there’s a demonstrable use case for crypto there.”      At first, Gayfield was thinking about using a stablecoin like tether for the project so Lebanese businesses would have something less volatile for moving money, but “there’s the inevitable concern about influence from politics or sanctions,” Gayfield said.      Bitcoin being the most recognizable cryptocurrency, it seems to be the easiest to use in Lebanon, he added. Gayfield was supposed to fly to Lebanon to meet Mardini and network with businesses that might be interested in using crypto, but his flight was canceled after the U.S. banned flights to Europe as part of its pandemic response.      Since most major exchanges don’t operate in Lebanon, citizens have to work with local traders, which makes scaling difficult. Users are also not allowed to buy bitcoin in Lebanon with a credit card and banks have set limits on withdrawals.      If all goes well, the project could have further implications than just Lebanon’s failing bank system.      “This isn’t just a Lebanon project,” Gayfield said. “There’s no reason this couldn’t work somewhere else … in any other country that’s going through a financial crisis.”",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,"Nate DiCamillo, Leigh Cuen",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/05/how-bitcoin-fits-into-lebanons-banking-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7e043e4b731d819c2fdd22f423f017826a36704-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432019,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Th,1591374870,Blockchain Bites: Why UN and Federal Reserve Experts Think CBDCs Could Kill Commercial Banking,"U.N. and Federal Reserve experts independently researched central bank digital currencies and found they could effectively compete with the commercial banking system.      Meanwhile, New York State and France have entered into a regulatory agreement and Europol is concerned about the bitcoin privacy wallet Wasabi. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Demise of Banking? In a new research paper, the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia investigated the implications of an account-based CBDCs, focusing on its potential competition with the traditional maturity transformation role of commercial banks, and found it could one day replace commercial banks. A similar conclusion was found by Massimo Buonomo, the U.N.’s global blockchain expert, who said digital currencies, particularly CBDCs, could soon “eliminate the need for a bank account” altogether.      Regulatory Matters The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is reviewing its regulations around digital bank activities and seeking public input, to ensure these regulations “continue to evolve with developments in the industry.” Meanwhile, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and its French regulatory counterpart will work to “ease the entry” for fintech innovators into their respective markets by syncing their regulatory frameworks. Elsewhere, InterWork Alliance, a 36-member organization including Accenture, IBM, ING, Nasdaq, and Digital Asset launched this week with the aim of creating token standards. (Forbes)      Privacy Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency, said “things are not looking good” for tracking potentially criminal transactions, due to the popularity of the privacy-protecting Wasabi Wallet. An internal document shows money is filtering through Wasabi for criminal purposes, with a Europol representative confirming the agency often lacks the tools to decrypt the scrambled transactions. Meanwhile, Bitfinex-incubated DeversiFi claims its re-released decentralized exchange (DEX) is receiving interest from 70 institutions, thanks to a privacy layer that can protect their trading strategies from rivals. Separately, Signal, an encrypted messaging app, will roll out a feature allowing users to blur people out of pictures. (Decrypt)      Exchanges: Hacks & New Allegations A German crypto trader is trying to seize nearly 500 bitcoin from Xapo and Indodax through a new lawsuit that accuses the two crypto exchanges of harboring his stolen funds. The suit alleges that the exchanges aided and abetted an unnamed thief and remain in possession of the funds. Meanwhile, Canadian crypto exchange Coinsquare said a former employee stole customer data last year, and potentially made it available to hackers to tarnish the firm’s reputation, The Block reports.    Interviews    Bitcoin Is a Way to Repair Economic Injustice: Author Isaiah Jackson Isaiah Jackson, founder of KRBE Digital Assets Group and the author of Bitcoin & Black America, thinks that bitcoin can play a crucial role in addressing economic disparity in black communities. While there are no immediate technological solutions to solving America’s economic and social problems, highlighted by George Floyd’s murder, bitcoin can make disadvantaged communities more resilient and weaken the existing hegemony.      The Free Market Will Determine Cardano’s Fate: IOHK’s Charles Hoskinson Charles Hoskinson thinks price matters for the project he founded, Cardano. A higher price for tokens means there’s recognition among a broader base of users a project has utility and inherent value, creating certainty and staying power for a project. “Ultimately people do what they make money with,” Hoskinson said. Token projects that prove to be commercially successful end up inspiring imitations, meaning that “the market will basically decide what the standards are.”    Weekend reads    Deep Dive Into DeFi MakerDAO, the organization behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin known as DAI, is voting on whether to further diversify the collateral it accepts for loans beyond cryptocurrencies to include real-world assets (RWAs), CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports. Specifically, Maker is considering allowing supply chain invoices and musicians’ future royalty streams as security when it lends out DAI.      If approved, the proposals would pave the way for the first application of DeFi to solve a tangible business problem caused by the coronavirus crisis: freeing up working capital for cash-strapped supply chains. The system would remove banking and credit intermediaries.      The first companies ready to work with Maker on RWAs are ConsoleFreight, a platform for supply chain finance, and Paperchain, which makes musicians’ royalty payments from Spotify instantly available.      The catch for lenders is that in the event of default, they would have to rely on the flesh-and-blood legal system to enforce their rights to the collateral, rather than an automated smart contract that can do so with on-chain assets. Get the full story here.    Market intel    Derivatives Suggest Bullish Mood Bitcoin derivatives traders are turning bullish, as the put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of put options open relative to call options, fell to 0.43 on Thursday – the lowest since March 24. “The put-call ratio can gauge the overall sentiment of traders and the lower ratio dictates that more traders are buying calls (bullish bets) than puts (bearish bets),” according to Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack.      The Known Unknown Since late April, bitcoin has traded in a range between roughly $8,500 and $10,200. Predictions for where the currency is heading range from a drop down to $0 to as high as $300,000 within five years. Recently, Bloomberg analysts claimed bitcoin prices could approach $20,000 later this year. A glance at bitcoin’s price chart since early 2017 shows how far off bitcoin remains from that $20,000 threshold. But it also shows how rapidly the price ran up in 2017. In the volatile bitcoin market, it’s hard to rule anything out.      Regional Growth Bitcoin trading in India exploded last month, with Paxful and LocalBitcoins totalling nearly $3 million in value transfers in one week alone.

42432016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Hh,1591365759,"Digital Currencies Could Replace Low-Interest Bank Accounts, Says UN-Linked Expert","Correction (15:40 UTC, June 8, 2020): Based on information from Massimo Buonomo's LinkedIn profile and from the CryptoCompare/Bequant event, an earlier version of this article described him as a United Nations blockchain expert. He is on a list of "" global expertshttp://www.theglobalexperts.org/experts/area-of-expertise/business-and-globalization/massimo-buonomo"" recommended to journalists by the UN Alliance of Civilizations.    Digital currencies could supersede bank accounts as low-interest rates make them increasingly obsolete.      That's the view of Massimo Buonomo, an economist who has previously worked with the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC). In fact, digital currencies, particularly central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), could soon ""eliminate the need for a bank account"" altogether, he claimed.      Speaking on an online panel hosted by CryptoCompare and Bequant to discuss the post-coronavirus global economic order on Thursday, Buonomo said banks and credit cards have long enjoyed a duopoly on digital payments, but the advent of digital currencies means users could sidestep them entirely.      Low-interest rates, enforced by central banks to encourage more borrowing, may expedite the process, he said, as they incentivize account holders to hunt for returns elsewhere. The Bank of England, for example, is actively reviewing taking interest rates into negative territory, meaning savers would pay the banks to hold money in their bank accounts. U.S. President Donald Trump recently pushed for negative rates, calling them a ""gift.""      According to Buonomo, interest rates were the one remaining killer app for bank accounts. But they are in danger of becoming obsolete in the face of digital currencies, which can process electronic payments just as easily.      ""Those who are going to suffer the most [from digital currencies] are the credit card processing companies and the banks because, in the current interest rate environment, your [only] advantage of having a bank account is that it enables digital payments,"" he said.      See also:UN to Use Blockchain to Tackle Exploitation of Migrant Workers in Hong Kong      On Thursday's panel, Buonomo said banks remain vulnerable to hacks and, along with credit card companies, they add friction by charging transaction fees.      In contrast, digital currencies ""allow you to hold digital money, it lets you pay the bills, use the mobile phone without credit cards, with no fees to credit card processing companies and no fees to banks for money transfers,"" he said.      Of course, there remain questions on what type of digital currency could replace the ubiquitous bank account. In a March interview with City AM, Buonomo argued bitcoin and ether, two public cryptocurrencies that enjoy widespread adoption, had a fighting chance in becoming alternatives to fiat currencies.      See also: Central Banks Mull Creating a CBDC, but Not on a Blockchain: Survey      But on Thursday, he took a more measured approach, saying tech limitations and privacy implications mean most public blockchains are widely unsuited for a national digital currency. Regulators would need overarching control over the system, he said, and many public blockchains don't have the throughput required.      Digital currencies issued by a central bank were the real alternative, Buonomo argued. The question is whether central banks rely on commercial banks to distribute money, just as the Digital Dollar Foundation proposed last week, or go more radical and issue funds to private citizens directly.      The ""one-tier model"" would be the ""most disruptive,"" he said, and just as feasible. Central banks could piggyback off the sophisticated social security systems that are widespread in the developed world to distribute currency to ""those who need it most,"" such as the disabled or the registered unemployed.      In a sense, social security systems could become the issuance model for the central banks, Buonomo suggested.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/05/digital-currencies-could-replace-low-interest-bank-accounts-says-un-linked-expert,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02d0620290be570b2c4e1ff82b94e23cf1ce5d9e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Clearing the threshold would represent a remarkable comeback for bitcoin, and it would reset many of the conversations around the market. Imagine the daily breathless headlines – in both cryptocurrency- and Wall Street-focused media – as the 11-year-old digital asset charted new price records.      A glance at bitcoin's price chart since early 2017 shows how far off bitcoin remains from that $20,000 threshold. But it also shows how rapidly the price ran up in 2017. In the volatile bitcoin market, it's hard to rule anything out.      Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of the cryptocurrency analysis firm Digital Asset Research, says ""predicting prices for bitcoin has been notoriously difficult.""      ""It's a highly volatile asset with not a lot of understanding of valuation and pricing frameworks,"" Cipolaro said in a phone interview. ""People kind of throw darts at a dart board. Sometimes they've been proven to be wildly low, and sometimes wildly optimistic.""      What's easier to predict, according to Cipolaro, is where prices are headed more generally. He says he's bullish.      ""The current backdrop, the macroeconomic and social and political divide that we're experiencing, all point to a non-sovereign-backed store of value, and that is something like bitcoin,"" Cipolaro said.      Maybe that's the right approach. Such finger-in-the-wind forecasts are increasingly the modus operandi on Wall Street these days.      The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is now close to its 2019 year-end level, even though the coronavirus and related lockdowns have pushed the global economy into its worst contraction since the 1930s, hitting corporate profits and driving large retailers into bankruptcy. Unemployment is soaring.      Some commentators on U.S. stocks argue that valuations aren't really supported by the fundamentals, but by a belief that governments and central banks like the Federal Reserve will pull every official lever to keep share prices from falling. The implication is that stocks might have little downside, but little upside either.      With bitcoin, there are naysayers, of course. Goldman Sachs' money-management division wrote last week that bitcoin is ""not a suitable investment."" Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said in February that bitcoin has ""no value.""      But to professional crypto analysts, the downside risks are far more mundane. Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Ventures, said in an email that bitcoin prices could fall toward $7,000 if they break below the $8,500 mark. Not exactly catastrophic, given that prices have often traded below $7,000 over the past six months.      And there's a lot to talk about when it comes to the upside.      The European Central Bank on Thursday announced it would inject as much as 600 billion euros more into financial markets than previously promised, potentially bolstering bitcoin's use as a hedge against inflation.      CoinDesk's Zack Voell reported on Thursday that bitcoin is increasingly being used in ""tokenized"" form when transacting on decentralized-finance networks on the Ethereum blockchain. A fast-growing use case, as it were.      CryptoCompare, a London-based data aggregator, said Thursday in a report that cryptocurrency derivatives volumes surged to a record $602 billion in May.      And CoinDesk's Wolfie Zhao reported Thursday the Bitcoin blockchain underwent an automatic adjustment that will make it easier to mine new units of the cryptocurrency, theoretically luring more operators back to the network to keep its distributed ledger secure.      Mati Greenspan, of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency-analysis firm Quantum Economics, says the milestone could catapult bitcoin into the ""next wave"" of its price cycle. The adjustment comes roughly a month after bitcoin's once-every-four-years halving, which cut bitcoin rewards for miners in half.      ""Though we only have two examples of previous halving events, the price began to rise approximately one month after the event, begging a brand new massive bull run each time,"" Greenspan wrote in an e-mail to clients.      Bitcoin may not go to $300,000. It may not even go to $20,000.      But the base case for now is that the price is likely to go up. First, it needs to get past $10,000.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,738 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,875| 24-Hr Low: $9,472      Trend: A key bitcoin price indicator continues to call a bullish move despite the cryptocurrency's recent failure to keep gains above the $10,000 mark.      The weekly chart's moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is producing higher bars above the zero line, indicating a strengthening of upward momentum. It's now reporting a value of 282 – the highest since mid-July 2019. Put simply, the indicator is currently suggesting the strongest bullish bias in 11 months.      While the MACD is based on backward-looking moving average studies, it has proven its fortitude in the past by marking the beginning of bullish trends with a cross above zero. For instance, the MACD crossed above zero in mid-February 2019 and began climbing above zero well before the cryptocurrency broke into a bull market with a 26% rise in the first week of April 2019. Similarly, the bearish trend seen in the second half of last year began after the MACD moved back below zero.      The weekly chart's relative strength index is also signaling bullish bias with an above-50 reading, while the daily chart is flashing a golden crossover, a long-term bull market indicator.      Multiple long-tailed candles seen on the hourly chart show persistent dip demand near the 200 hour average, currently at $9,581. The immediate bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above that level.      All in all, the charts seem to have aligned in favor of a re-test of $10,000. The cryptocurrency was rejected above that hurdle on Tuesday, falling sharply by $800 in just five minutes. As a result, some analysts say a sustained move above $10,000 is required to restore the rally from the March low of $3,867.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/05/first-mover-bloombergs-pie-in-the-sky-bitcoin-call-looks-directionally-defensible,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/688da68d5d76a2510155119868bc6e0198a386ad-1500x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432018,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Ph,1591355924,"Bullishness Building in Bitcoin Options Market, Data Suggests","Option market traders look to be placing bets for a continued upward move in bitcoin, according to a key metric.      The put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of put options open relative to call options, fell to 0.43 on Thursday – the lowest since March 24, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The data takes into account open interest at leading derivatives exchanges Deribit, OKEx, CME, LedgerX and Bakkt.      Notably, the ratio has declined sharply from 0.81 to 0.43 over the last four weeks.      “The put-call ratio can gauge the overall sentiment of traders and the lower ratio dictates that more traders are buying calls (bullish bets) than puts (bearish bets),” according to Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds. “The decline toward 0.4 indicates that some form of bullishness is building,"" he said.      However, it is possible to argue that increased selling of calls is causing a drop in the put-call ratio. After all, open interest refers to the number of calls and put contracts that are active, or open, at a given point in time and does not reveal whether investors are buying call/put options or selling (known as ""writing"" in options markets).      Traders usually buy calls when the market is expected to rise and buy puts when prices are likely to fall. That said, experienced traders often sell calls when the market is expected to remain range-bound and not rise beyond a certain level. Selling a call or put can be equated to selling a lottery ticket, where the maximum profit for the seller is the ticket price. The loss is huge if the buyer wins the lottery.      However, in this instance, the decline in the ratio does look to have been fueled by increased call buying, a sign of bullish sentiment, as calls are commanding higher prices than puts.      The one-month put-call skew, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls, is currently at -1.9%. Three-month and six-month skews are also reporting negative values.    Institutions bullish?    “The move lower in the put-call ratio likely reflects the sharp increase in call buying on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)”, said Shaun Phoon, senior trader at Singapore-based QCP Capital.      Data from CME, which is considered synonymous with institutional and macro trading, does show that the market is currently being driven almost entirely by the activity in calls.      “As of June 4, about 25,000 bitcoin worth of call contracts were open in total and most of those are between the $10,000 to $15,000 strikes,” Ecoinometrics, a bitcoin analysis company, noted in its daily newsletter.      Currently, there are 51 calls open against one put option. Clearly, the CME options market is heavily skewed to the bullish side.    A reliable indicator    “The put-call open interest ratio has proven its fortitude and has dictated the right direction over the past few major moves such as the Fed decline, and post-crash rally,” said Stack’s Neo.      The previous two instances of sub-0.5 readings on the ratio observed in early January and in the second half of March coincided with the beginning of major upswings in prices.      The ratio bottomed out at 0.42 on March 24, after the cryptocurrency had dropped close to $6,500. In the following six weeks, prices rose back to highs above $10,000.      The likely scenario is that the options market is anticipating another move above $10,000. Bitcoin, however, needs to build a strong base above that level, as that would likely draw stronger chart-driven buying. Over the last 12 months, bitcoin has failed multiple times to keep gains above $10,000.

A DeversiFi spokesperson told CoinDesk the firm had already had a ""significant pipeline of funds"" interested in integrating with the exchange following the implementation of its new software implementation, DeversiFi 2.0, which went live on Wednesday.      While not divulging particular details, the spokesperson said: ""We have interest from 70 funds and large traders and have 18 funds ready to trade on DeversiFi 2.0 at or around launch.""      The smallest of these funds had around $1 million in assets under management (AUM), while some of the bigger clients had AUMs ""well into the tens of millions.""      A spokesperson said some institutional clients saw DeversiFI 2.0 ""as a key bridge to crossing from the centralized to the decentralized trading space.”      See also: Retail Investors Are Buying the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders Say      With a team based in London, DeversiFi started out as Ethfinex, an exchange incubated by Bitfinex back in 2017. It spun out and rebranded in August 2019. It is non-custodial, allowing users to maintain control of their funds.      The 2.0 implementation is designed to provide users with scalability and privacy. Using the zk-STARK privacy layer, it allows anyone to trade anonymously and also increases trade settlement capacity by up to 9,000 transactions per second.      DeversiFI says one of the main issues traders have with conventional DEXs is most are completely public. Third parties can watch others trade from their computers. That's a conundrum for professional traders who worry such openness endangers their proprietary trading strategies, as they can be copied or undercut by rivals.      Although it describes itself as a DEX, one crucial difference with DeversiFi is that trades are executed off-chain, so third-parties can't monitor the trading behaviors of individual users. Once executed, these trades are batched together into groups and settled on-chain, once every hour, so there's ""no way traders can be copied,"" a spokesperson said.      See also: Kyber Network Activity Surges as DEX Plans Switch to Staking Model in Q2      Ross Middleton, DeversiFi's CFO, said DeversiFi 2.0 gave users the usability and convenience of a centralized exchange – speed, liquidity, and low fees – while removing risks, including account freezes, trade rollbacks, and hacks.

42432014,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Fh,1591347720,The Free Market Will Determine Cardano's Fate: IOHK's Charles Hoskinson,"A high token price gives a project crucial staying power, believes the CEO of IOHK, Charles Hoskinson.      Mention token price in the company of developers and many will hold their noses. In a lunch interview with the Financial Times back in 2018, Ethereum's creator Vitalik Buterin said that he felt an obsession with price had muddied the waters around cryptocurrencies and created the wrong incentives.      ""The idealistic early coders, who wanted blockchain to transfer power from corporations and governments to individuals, last year started getting overtaken by get-rich-quick schemers. Some ICOs were scams. Buterin watched in dismay as his blockchain was flooded by mercenaries making a fast buck,"" opines the article.      But Hoskinson, who began as an Ethereum co-founder before leaving to set up IOHK, the main developer house behind the Cardano project, thinks differently. While there are certainly other factors that count towards a project's success – a strong consensus mechanism, say – he firmly believes the market should, and does, have the final word.      ""Ultimately people do what they make money with,"" he said, in a call with CoinDesk. Token projects that prove to be commercially successful end up inspiring imitations, meaning that ""the market will basically decide what the standards are.""      ""I've been in the space so long that I remember when Peercoin [the first to use proof-of-stake] was in the top 10, I remember when Primecoin [which confirmed transactions eight to 10 times faster than Bitcoin] was in the top 10,"" Hoskinson said.      These coins have struck on something palpable for cryptocurrency users. Over time, new projects have come along that have built on their successes, improved on some of their failures, and gradually succeeded them on the cap table.      Now, Tezos and Cardano are the biggest PoS-based coins by market cap; Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV are the most prominent projects offering a more scalable Bitcoin. In comparison, Peercoin and Primecoin have, over the years, faded into obscurity.      Hoskinson argued that the only way you can beat your competitors is to at least do what the most successful one is doing, and then try and do it even better.      See also: Fintech Think Tank Takes Legal Action Against Cardano Foundation      Of course, it can throw up some surprises. ""The things you think may gain traction and become a big deal, they could be yesterday's news, and other things that you don't think are going to be a big deal, end up becoming huge,"" he said.      Hoskinson didn't think that either Tether or XRP would be that successful when they first launched. But the market proved him wrong. Both have attracted demand which has led to highs valuations and has helped make them super resilient. They look to be here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future.      That's why Hoskinson thinks price matters to Cardano. A higher price means there's recognition among a broader base of users that a project has utility and inherent value. That creates certainty and staying power for a project: a hot commodity in a space often derided for its untried and untested technology.      Last Thursday, Hoskinson announced that the long-awaited Shelley protocol – which allows users to stake and earn Cardano's native ADA currency – would be rolled out gradually across June, with a full launch penciled in for June 30.      That created a buzz that has driven the ADA price up nearly 50%, according to CoinDesk's price data, and allowed Cardano to, albeit briefly, re-enter the top-10 largest coins by market cap. ""We're flirting with it, back and forth with Tezos,"" Hoskinson said.      According to CoinMarketCap, Tezos had retaken the lead, with a market cap worth $85 million more than Cardano's at time of writing. Then again, rival price site CoinGecko reckons Cardano's market cap was well over $300 million more than Tezos.      Price is a hard yardstick to measure yourself by. But so long as IOHK and the Cardano community can complete the roadmap, Hoskinson believes ""there's a very strong possibility that we will be very competitive price-wise with the rest [of the crypto market].""      See also: IOHK Opens Cardano Research Lab at University of Wyoming Following $500K Donation      The powerful role of the market isn't something unusual to cryptocurrency. Hoskinson argues it has had the deciding vote in many of the crucial decisions in the technology space for the past 30 years.      Even though the very concept of a distributed consensus system has a long lineage in computer science, the first wave of tech companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s – the Amazons, and the Googles and the Microsofts – valued speed and user experience above resilience, Hoskinson said.      The idea smoldered until Bitcoin came along in 2008, and successfully made the economic case for decentralization amidst the ruins of the financial crash.      In the end, being responsible for a crypto project feels like leaving your fate in the hands of an unruly and unpredictable master.      ""Sometimes the market just values something differently, and you just accept that as reality, because you can't really fight the market, and then you just do your best to try to work within the constraints of a broken system,"" Hoskinson said.      ""Things surprise me and what I've learned to do is just be pragmatic,"" he added.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/05/the-free-market-will-determine-cardanos-fate-iohks-charles-hoskinson,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88f71ade34b34932c8caa88d8eaf7826872ba95f-2540x1664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432013,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN90Dh,1591344830,Fed Paper: Central Bank Digital Currencies Could Replace Commercial Banks – But at a Cost,"Central bank digital currencies might one day replace commercial banks. But that comes with risks, according to new research from the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia.      The 32-page research paper – titled ""Central Bank Digital Currency: Central Banking for All?"" – investigated the implications of an account-based central bank digital currency (CBDC), focusing on its potential competition with the traditional maturity transformation role of commercial banks.      ""The introduction of digital currencies may justify a fundamental shift in the architecture of a financial system, a central bank 'open to all,'"" the paper, which was published on June 1, reads.      Questions posed by the research arm of the Fed, which were undertaken in collaboration with the Universities of Pennsylvania and Chicago, examined the ramifications of the introduction of a CBDC and how the opening of central bank facilities might affect financial intermediation.      Specifically, the questions were aimed at exploring the role CBDCs play in ""giving consumers the possibility of holding a bank account with the central bank directly,"" in essence replacing the role currently performed by commercial banks.      See also: How the COVID-19 Crisis Revived the Digital Dollar Debate      Maturity transformation refers to the practice by financial institutions of borrowing money on shorter timeframes than they lend out. This is often done through deposits from savers by converting that finance into long-term borrowings such as mortgages. It is the role of commercial banks to facilitate the needs of lenders and borrowers.      This process can backfire though, such as if there is a panic or bank run where all savers attempt to withdraw money at once or if the money markets suddenly dry up due to lenders no longer providing short-term loans to one another.      The paper determined the set of allocations achieved with private financial intermediation (commercial banks) could also be achieved with a CBDC, provided competition is allowed with those commercial banks and depositors do not panic. However, the paper also determined an associated cost involved.      ""Our equivalence result has a sinister counterpart. If the competition from commercial banks is impaired (for example, through some fiscal subsidization of central bank deposits), the central bank has to be careful in its choices to avoid creating havoc with maturity transformation,"" according to the paper.      See also: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption      In other words, if CBDCs did disrupt the role of commercial banks and allowed the borrowing of more money than is lent out, there's a concern central banks could harm the money markets.      The paper also showed how the ""rigidity of the central bank's contract with investment banks"" deterred panic runs and, as such, if depositors started to exclusively deposit with the central bank it could end up becoming a ""deposit monopolist,"" attracting deposits away from the commercial banking sector.      ""This monopoly power eliminates the forces that induce the central bank from delivering the socially optimal amount of maturity transformation,"" the Fed paper says.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/05/fed-paper-central-bank-digital-currencies-could-replace-commercial-banks-but-at-a-cost,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e48105a2073986011c6b8feed50ed46a71c0339b-1000x685.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421873,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwlo5,1591317559,Silk Road,"Named after the historical network of trade routes that connected Europe and Asia, the Silk Road was an online black market founded in February 2011 by the pseudonymous “Dread Pirate Roberts” (later revealed to be Ross Ulbricht).  This platform, best known for selling illegal drugs, operated out of the dark web as a Tor hidden service that would enable the users to browse it anonymously and securely. Transactions on the site were carried out with bitcoin for anonymity.  Before it was shut down in 2013, the Silk Road handled over $1.2 billion worth of illegal goods and services, with over $79.2 million in commissions, according to the criminal complaint against Ulbricht. Following the closure of the site, the FBI seized 144,000 BTC (worth around $28.5 million at the time) which it said belonged to Ulbricht. The US Marshals Service later sold off the bitcoin in four separate auctions.  Following Ulbricht’s arrest and the subsequent closing of the Silk Road, a second iteration of the website - Silk Road 2.0 - was opened by the administrators of the original site. The successor only survived for a year, ending with the arrest of the alleged operator in 2014.  In 2015, Ulbricht was convicted of four narcotics charges and three charges related to money laundering, computer hacking and trafficking fraudulent identity documents. At the age of 31, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and is serving at the United States Penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona.
