42381063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Xol,1532640797,Winklevoss Brothers Bitcoin ETF Rejected By SEC for Second Time,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again rejected an effort by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to list a bitcoin ETF.  The move comes more than a year after the SEC turned down a rule change request from the Bats BZX Exchange that would have paved the way for the bitcoin-tied investment vehicle. Shortly after, Bats submitted a petition to review that decision, triggering another wave of comments – and expectation – about the agency's willingness to approve a cryptocurrency exchange-traded product.  Yet the concerns highlighted in that March decision don't seem to have abated, according to the decision published Thursday by the SEC.  The agency notably highlighted that its decision doesn't constitute a judgment against cryptocurrencies and blockchain in general, but rather the structure of the proposal that was pitched.  The SEC wrote:  ""Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment. Rather, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed in detail below, BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.""  And as before, the SEC left the door open to potentially approving such products in the future, noting that ""over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets may continue to grow and develop.""  ""For example, existing or newly created bitcoin futures markets may achieve significant size, and an ETP listing exchange may be able to demonstrate in a proposed rule change that it will be able to address the risk of fraud and manipulation by sharing surveillance information with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin, as well as, where appropriate, with the spot markets underlying relevant bitcoin derivatives,"" the agency continued.  Should that happen, ""the Commission would then have the opportunity to consider whether a bitcoin ETP would be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.""  The decision has had an impact on the price of bitcoin, which fell from nearly $8,300 following the decision to a low of $7,973.81, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). As of press time, the BPI is showing a price of about $8,004.  Manipulation concerns  Among the significant points raised in the release is the concern that the price of bitcoin is susceptible to manipulation – a point that Bats BZX sought to counter during the review.  Yet the SEC pushed back against this contention within the context of the Exchange Act's requirements, highlighting the lack of surveillance-sharing agreements with exchanges where the spot price of bitcoin is determined.  ""Because adequate surveillance-sharing agreements are not in place—and any current surveillance-sharing agreements are with bitcoin-related markets that are either not significant, not regulated, or both—the Commission concludes that the proposal is inconsistent with Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5),"" the agency wrote.  The SEC notably highlighted a recent study which claimed that USDT – the dollar-tied 'stablecoin' operated by Tether, which is linked to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex – has been used to support the price of bitcoin during market downturns.  ""...the Commission notes that recent academic papers suggest that the price of bitcoin can be, and has been, manipulated through activity on bitcoin trading venues. One recent academic paper examined whether the growth of the circulating supply of Tether (a cryptocurrency that claims to be backed by the U.S. dollar) through new issuances 'is primarily driven by investor demand, or is supplied to investors as a scheme to profit from pushing cryptocurrency prices up.'""  Regulator Dissent  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce wrote a dissension to the decision, saying she believes ""the proposed rule change satisfies the statutory standard and that we should permit BZX to list and trade this bitcoin-based exchange-traded product ('ETP').""  She added that ""more institutional participation would ameliorate many of the Commission's concerns with the bitcoin market that underlie its disapproval order. More generally, the Commission's interpretation and application of the statutory standard sends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets, a signal that may have effects far beyond the fate of bitcoin ETPs.""

The moves mark the first time such orders were dropped against blockchain startups in the state.  The regulator had claimed that ShipChain's tokens and Genesis Mining's mining contracts were both unregistered securities. ShipChain pushed back against this claim in May, saying in a statement that the firm did ""not believe [its] tokens are securities."" Furthermore, ShipChain claimed it was unaware South Carolina residents could purchase its SHIP tokens.  On Thursday, deputy securities commissioner Tracy Meyers wrote ""the Securities Division of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of South Carolina, after receiving information regarding matters detailed in the Administrative Order to Cease and Desist issued ... upon due consideration of such information, finds good cause has been shown to vacate the [order],"" referring to ShipChain.

42381081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93YA9,1532633463,"Google Yanked MetaMask From the Chrome Store, Left a Phishing Scam Up","It was ""an interesting wake-up call.""  That was how Kevin Serrano, an employee at ethereum startup and incubator ConsenSys, described the revelation that MetaMask had been removed from Google Chrome's web store in a recently published blog post.  MetaMask, a Consensys ""spoke,"" is an ethereum wallet that also serves as a bridge between web browsers and the ethereum blockchain. A little after 10:00 a.m. EDT Wednesday morning, the MetaMask team announced on Twitter that the extension had been removed from the Chrome store.  The team received no explanation for Google's action, according to Serrano, or even notification that it had happened – though he added that it's possible the email bounced. The extension was restored to the web store around five hours later. According to Serrano, Google explained that delisting MetaMask had been an ""error.""  And in this way, Serrano said it became clear:  ""For a product that enables decentralized technology, [MetaMask] has centralized points of failure.""  It's an issue blockchain entrepreneurs have grappled with since the industry first started testing its ideas.  One of the fundamental merits of blockchains and the decentralized applications built on top of them is that no single party can take down or censor them. Yet, this theoretical quality is frequently rendered moot where blockchain networks meet the legacy web or financial system.  Centralized exchanges, where fiat currency is converted into cryptocurrencies, are the most commonly cited example of where censorship-resistance and decentralization fail in practice.  But this incident has highlighted another such choke point: app stores.  Making the app available to users, Serrano continued, requires ""placing our trust in browsers, GitHub and the people deploying in order to keep the system working.""  Phishing frenzy  It's not only the trust required to keep the extension open to the most users (sufficiently tech-savvy users could have still downloaded it on Chrome), but also the fact that the action opened up opportunities for scammers – an endemic problem in the cryptocurrency space.  With MetaMask proper removed, Serrano wrote, ""What was left when one searched the term 'MetaMask' on the store was a few re-branded MetaMask forks and one ambiguously branded lookalike.""  Indeed, the situation presented the risk of phishing, in which attackers trick would-be users into downloading fake files that contain malware.  At one point Augur, another ethereum project, tweeted a warning not to download an extension called ""MetaMask by Kupi.net,"" which was available in the Chrome store (it has since been removed). The app ""is a fake, phishing app,"" the Augur team wrote, attaching an image:  Serrano told CoinDesk in an email that attempts to steal from users were also present on Telegram, a messaging platform popular with cryptocurrency enthusiasts, where attackers were ""posing as an alternative support desk."" It appears that some users were affected by this scam, he said, as well as an unrelated one on the Google Play Store, which lists apps for Google's Android operating system.  A Google spokesperson declined to comment on these phishing attempts.  While MetaMask continued to work on other browsers – Brave, Opera and Firefox – and those who had already downloaded the Chrome version were still able to use it, the team is looking into more decentralized alternatives such as IPFS, Serrano said.  The team also published a guide to installing the extension manually.

Melvin and Dennis van de B., aged 25 and 21, were convicted of accusing 1,259 computers in the Netherlands and other Western European countries with the ransomware and demanding bitcoin payments as a ransom to fix the computers. The two reportedly made roughly 10,000 euros each between 2014 and 2015, Dutch website NU.nl reported.  CoinVault would cut off victims' access to files on their computers and demand 1 bitcoin as a ransom – equivalent to several hundred euros at that time. Almost a hundred victims paid the fee, according to NU.nl.  After the news of the malware spread, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab tipped the Dutch police on the names of the hackers. The firm said it had found a bug in the CoinVault code and could see ""one of the suspect's first names in the pdb path."" Kaspersky also issued around 14,000 decryption keys for the victims of the attack, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The men told the court they just wanted to experiment and challenge their technical skills, but the judges noted that the brothers would always ask for payment, including when some victims were asking for the return of files related to their deceased parents, the Dutch website NRC.nl reported.

Despite the delay, Novogratz said in a statement that he was ""proud"" of the progress Galaxy Digital made so far in 2018.  He added:  ""We have assembled a world-class team with deep institutional knowledge and expertise and have also made significant strides in scaling our four core business lines.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Hong Seong-ki, head of the virtual currency response team at the FSC, said:  ""While crypto markets have seen rapid growth, such trading platforms don't seem to be well-enough prepared in terms of security.""  In March, the Democratic Party of Korea proposed a bill that would put exchanges under the supervision of the FSC.  Hong told the news source that the bill should be passed ""as soon as possible,"" adding that it will most probably happen in the end of the year, when the country's National Assembly is expected to move on the initiative.  ""We're trying to legislate the most urgent and important things first, aiming for money-laundering prevention and investor protection,"" he said, stating that, personally, he wouldn't recommend investing in cryptos.

In an announcement this week, Viet Nam News reported Wednesday, the State Securities Commission (SSC) said firms should avoid issuance, transactions or brokerage of cryptos, adding that they must observe laws on money laundering.  The warning relates to an April 2018 Prime Minister's Directive on strengthening the management of activities related to cryptocurrencies. Vietnam banned the use of cryptos in payments in October 2017, as CoinDesk reported, despite suggestions earlier that year that the prime minister might legally recognize bitcoin for that purpose.  Back in April, the country's central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam, also banned commercial banks and payment service providers from making transactions with cryptocurrencies, arguing that such activities could increase the risk of money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion, Viet Nam News states.  In a further move aimed to restrict crypo activities in the country, the central bank last week supported a move to block, at least temporarily, the import of mining devices into the country.  The suspension was initially proposed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in June, which argued that, since cryptocurrency miners are not on the list of prohibited imports, it has become difficult for local authorities to enforce current restrictions on cryptocurrencies.

As reported by CoinDesk earlier this week, following a vaccine data scandal exposed last weekend, the Chinese crypto community weighed in with the argument that blockchain could be a potential solution for monitoring the vaccine supply chain.  After the scandal broke, YLZ Info, a software company listed on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, announced that it is now planning to work with Alibaba payment affiliate Ant Financial to create a blockchain for just that purpose.  The claim followed a previous announcement made by the company in March indicating it was cooperating with Ant Financial on technological development in areas that include blockchain.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, YLZ's claim on Monday to be planning a specific vaccine blockchain project appears to have prompted keen interest from stock investors in the country.  Since the announcement, the company's stock price has surged by 10 percent on each of the past three days, recording a significant total spike of as much as a 50 percent and reaching an upper limit imposed by market regulators in China.  Given the stock surge, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange – which has the remit to regulate public firms to comply with securities law in China – sent an enquiry to the company on Wednesday night, demanding that YLZ deliver substantial proof of its capacity and resources in R&D of blockchain technology by Friday.  The exchange further demanded details regarding the firm's collaboration with Ant Financial on the topic – effectively asking whether the company is actually partnering to work on the vaccine project or merely harnessing blockchain hype in conjunction with a public crisis to juice up its stock price.

42381069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Xyp,1532606415,Bitcoin's Cutting-Edge 'Coin Selection' Tech Gets First Major Integration,"Crypto security startup BitGo's latest technology – ""predictive UTXO management"" – sounds technical, but it's got an end goal that everyone will understand: cutting crypto fees.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, BitGo is the first mainstream crypto company adopting a spin on ""coin selection,"" a scaling technology that's been one of many touted as a way to ease the industry's obsession with lowering fees since they spiked to over $20 a transaction in December.  Though fees have since fallen to less than $1, the incident had a huge psychological impact. As such, the industry jolted into action, looking into technologies that could help chip away at these fees.  As long-promised, coin selection more efficiently selects what coins go toward a particular transaction, and thus could have a big impact on users the next time fees go up (due to rising prices or increased use of the network). The idea has been around for a couple years but is just now starting to gain more widespread attention.  And with the news today, BitGo is opening up the technology to a large swath of the industry.  Indeed, all BitGo clients who have upgraded to their latest software version will have access to this new tool, seeing fee reductions of up to 30 percent, according to the company.  ""What we're doing here is addressing high-traffic wallets. Some of our clients get lots of lots of deposits into exchanges. And these enterprises need to sweep up these on-chain transactions,"" BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt, the main brain behind the technology, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""If fees fluctuate again in the future, customers will save a lot on fees.""  While Erhardt couldn't reveal which of its customers have upgraded to the newest version of its software – and as such, have access to the technology – he said, it's most of them.  And with some of BitGo's clients including the likes of Bitstamp, one of the oldest and largest bitcoin exchanges, and blockchain-based identity platform Civic, the technology is likely to reach a significant number of bitcoin enthusiasts.  A tweak on the tech  The proprietary technology Erhardt came up with, which includes coin selection, hasn't been used anywhere else before.  It's a bit complicated, but it takes on a very old problem in bitcoin.  Each transaction fee depends on how much data is put into a transaction, rather than its value, as in traditional payment systems. It sounds funny, but the reason it's this way is that bitcoin's transaction space is so limited. Charging extra for more data incentivizes users to take up as little space as possible.  Because of this, it's conceivable a small transaction of $0.10 could cost more in fees than a $1,000 transaction.  So, what causes there to be more data in some transactions than others? This largely depends on the number of so-called ""inputs,"" which are the pieces of bitcoin that go into a transaction – the more inputs, the more data, the more expensive.  A couple years back for his master's thesis, Erhardt invented a better algorithm for choosing which coins should go into a transaction (this is coin selection), trying to avoid creating, or unnecessarily using, so-called dust, or tiny amounts of bitcoin. It was such a useful improvement, the largest bitcoin software client, Bitcoin Core, moved to adopt it.  When adding the technology to BitGo's services, though, Erhardt realized something else.  Spending transactions with a large number of inputs when fees are lower, like today, is not as expensive. And so this is a good time to look through a wallet's coins and see if it's possible to ""consolidate"" the coins – a process you can think of as like trading in a hundred pennies for $1.  ""We really would like to partially automate this,"" Erhardt thought.  And that prompting him to build something even more complex, the predictive UTXO management product, which reacts to the level of fees at the current time, using a threshold of 10 satoshis per byte. If fees are higher than this number, it uses as few inputs as possible. But, if fees are lower than this number, it automatically decides instead to consolidate the tiny transactions.  Low fees, still saving  As mentioned, Erhardt thinks this algorithm will be particularly useful for high-traffic wallets who are sucking in tons of UTXOs (or unspent transaction outputs).  Erhardt said his company is ""operating under the assumption"" bitcoin fees will continue to fluctuate over time, which is why the actively reacting algorithm is so necessary.  Yet, Erhardt admits it's hard to say what will happen in the future.  Last time, fees spiked when the cryptocurrency world saw a flood of new users correlating with an increase in the price per bitcoin (it topped at over $20,000 per coin). The industry has definitely cooled since then, with the price per bitcoin now hovering around $8,000 per coin, and it's unclear if and when that exuberance will happen again.  ""It's a little hard to predict right now. We've had small fees lately,"" Erhardt said, adding:  Spending patterns are hard to predict and fees can go crazy overnight.""  Even with today's lower fees, though, Erhardt expect the algorithm to have a big impact. ""With small fees, we see huge savings,"" he told CoinDesk.  And this will be especially true once the few lagging BitGo clients who haven't yet transitioned to the new technology finally do.

The new bolívar soberano (or sovereign bolivar) is to enter use in the country next month, according to an announcement on Wednesday from the country's president, Nicolas Maduro.  As well as stating that the sovereign bolivar will be ""anchored"" to the oil-backed petro – which was launched in February – Maduro said the country will strip five zeroes from the bolivar rather than three as had been initially planned, Reuters reports.  The move is aimed to counter soaring inflation that is expected to reach a million percent this year, the article states.  According to local news source teleSUR, the president said:  ""The economic reconversion will start on August 20 definitively with the circulation and issuance of the new Sovereign Bolivar, the new monetary cone [sic] that is going to have a new method of anchoring the Petro.""  Stating that the new currency will alter the financial situation of the country ""in a radical manner,"" Maduro said, ""We have the correct vision of what the economic future in Venezuela should be, above all, we will achieve it.""  The petro, he added, ""will end up being consolidated technologically and financially"" and will come to ""permeate all the national and international economic activity.""  Despite being declared as ""illegal"" by the opposition-led congress before its launch, the petro has been moving ever further into the heart of the nation's finances as the president has endeavored to ensure its use across society.  In February, he requested the country's banks to mine and use the petro, and ordered several state-owned companies to convert a percentage of their sales and purchases into the token, among other initiatives aimed to promote its uptake.  Maduro originally stated that approximately 100 million of the tokens (worth a claimed $6 billion) would be issued to overcome the financial sanctions imposed by the U.S. In March, the U.S. responded, with Donald Trump signing an executive order imposing new sanctions against Venezuela over the petro.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,300 on Bitfinex, having clocked a two-month high of $8,507 on Tuesday.  A month ago, it was all gloom and doom in the bitcoin market, as the cryptocurrency had created back-to-back long-term bearish chart patterns in the months of May and June. Consequently, BTC looked primed for a move lower to $5,000.  However, the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout seen earlier this month confirmed a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. Furthermore, the convincing break above $8,000 seen this week appears to have set the stage for a major bull run.  Daily chart: Falling channel breakout  To start with, the pennant breakdown witnessed on June 9 had signaled a revival of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.  However, the ensuing sell-off ran out of steam at $5,755 (June 24 low) and the subsequent recovery established a falling channel (bearish pattern marked by circles), which has been breached to the higher side this week.  So, what we have is an upside break of the four-month-long falling channel, i.e. a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  4-hour chart: Rising channel is intact  The short-term outlook also remains bullish as indicated by the rising channel (higher highs and higher lows). Still, there is merit in being cautious as the above chart also shows a bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence, which could yield a price pullback.  View  BTC has likely witnessed a long-term bullish reversal this week.  In the short-term, BTC may struggle to find a firm foothold above the all-important 200-day moving average (MA) hurdle of $8,593, courtesy of overbought conditions.  BTC could revisit the 100-day MA support of $7,616 if the bearish RSI divergence seen in the 4-hour chart pushes prices below $7,938 (rising channel support).

A plan to develop an ""indigenous"" cryptocurrency is currently on the agenda of the government's Science and Technology Department, according to Iran's official news outlet PressTV. Alireza Daliri, the department's deputy head in charge of investment affairs, said on Wednesday that the project is ongoing in cooperation with the Central Bank of Iran.  ""We are trying to prepare the grounds to use a domestic digital currency in the country,"" Daliri was quoted as saying in the report.  The cryptocurrency would back and tokenize Iran's national fiat currency, the rial, in order to facilitate domestic and cross-border transactions ahead of the U.S. sanctions, which go into effect next month.  The U.S. announced its withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran in May alongside the reactivation of economic sanctions that will restrict Iran's access to U.S. dollars starting from Aug. 6.  Daliri said his department aims to integrate blockchain technology with the country's central bank over the next three months, rolling out a cryptocurrency for general implementation across domestic commercial banks.  The announcement aligns with the Iranian government's ongoing support for developing cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.  According to the Science and Technology Department's website, Daliri announced at a meeting early this month that he will support ""the path of creation of digital currency in the country,"" adding:  ""[O]ur goal is to guarantee the success of those entering this field and conclude contracts in this field.""  In April, Daliri also doubled down on a commitment to launch a ""mutual cryptocurrency"" that could facilitate financial payments between domestic and foreign businesses.  The reported move by Iran follows the lead of Venezuela, which launched its own oil-backed ""petro"" cryptocurrency – also as a way to fight U.S. sanctions.

42429417,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyYJh,1532592025,Reflections on a Swatting: Inside One Bitcoin Engineer's Security Battle,"October 16th, 2017 started off like any other Monday. I awoke at 6 a.m. and drove to the YMCA to play racquetball, ready to start the week with a win.  When I finished playing, I tweeted out a cute quip:  I then hit the steam room and the shower to relax and freshen up. Upon returning to my neighborhood, I encountered an unusual problem: a police cruiser with its lights flashing was blocking the entrance. I came to a stop and rolled down my window:  ""Hi Officer, is there a problem? I'm just trying to get to my house.""  ""Sorry, we have to secure the area due to an ongoing incident.""  ""Is it an active shooter?""  ""Unclear, but we have information that he has long guns on the premises.""  ""Well shit, what should I tell my family to do? They're at the house.""  ""Call them and tell them to get in the car and exit the community.""  ""Will do!""  I pulled off the main road and found a place to park so that I could call the house.  ""Hey, don't panic but the police are locking down the neighborhood due to an incident. You should get in the car and leave.""  ""OK, I'll be right out.""  I waited a few minutes and then received a call back.  ""The police stopped me as I was leaving and asked me if I was OK. Apparently they were called to our house! They want you to come speak with them at the mobile command unit around the corner.""  I drove back to the entrance and told the patrol officer that his captain wanted to speak with me, so he waved me through. Upon entering the mobile command unit, the first thing I was asked was:  ""Sir, do you have any enemies?""  To which I replied:  It wasn't long before the news stations showed up; apparently, they didn't even know what ""swatting"" meant.  The news stations managed to get a copy of the phone call that was made by the attacker; you can listen to it here. The attacker claimed that they shot and killed someone and were holding others hostage after rigging the front door with explosives.  Once the news crews left and everything calmed down, I figured I should let the attacker know that they failed to achieve their goal.  Within a few hours of making my tweet, I received a threatening voicemail from a number with a New York area code; you can listen to the voicemail here. Note a common theme between the 911 call and the voicemail — both times he demands $50,000 (or the equivalent in BTC.)  ""Next time I do anything to you, it won't involve the police.""  Within 48 hours the Durham Police Department told me that they had traced the call to a throwaway server in Texas but hit a dead end and were turning the case over to the FBI. I never heard from the FBI. I lost any confidence in the ability of law enforcement to protect me a long time ago, so this was disappointing but not surprising.  What did I do in response? I installed 360-degree 4K resolution surveillance around my property, double-checked the rest of my physical security setup, took a few firearms out of the safe, and I waited.  Fortunately my intuition that the attacker didn't have the guts to put his own life in danger by physically attacking me proved to be right. There were no further (physical) incidents.  Shit just got real  Swatting is not a game; it can be fatal. Case in point:  I have little hope that the perpetrator will be found, but I feel compelled to offer an additional incentive.  I want to make it extremely clear that I will not tolerate threats against myself or anyone I care about. I will defend myself and my loved ones until my dying breath with every resource at my disposal.  The following message  is signed with this PGP key.    ***    There was a lot of speculation that this was related to the bitcoin scaling debate, but the attacker never said what his motivations were. After the fact, he left me this voicemail demanding a ransom payment… but didn't even give me an address to which I should send the BTC!  After speaking with other folks who have been harassed, I fully expected other annoyances such as:  Using stolen credit cards to purchase things and ship them to my house.  Purchasing drugs / illegal things on darknet sites and shipping them to my house.  Tampering with the accounts for my utilities to get them turned off.  Forging a deed in an attempt to claim ownership of my home.  On November 9, I got email bombed by a bot that was signing me up for a ton of email marketing lists.  Since the emails were ""legitimate"" marketing rather than mass emails from a few sources, I decided pretty quickly that the best option was to just I turn off my email for the day and made most of the signups bounce, preventing my email address from getting added to the lists of the marketers. Having 8 years of experience writing email marketing software has its perks.  Twelve hours later statoshi.info was DoS attacked and my host blackholed the IP address to save their own infrastructure. No big deal.  I've kept this detail a secret for the past year, but I wasn't home when the attacker sent the SWAT team to my house. I truly hope that the perpetrator reads this article and gets to realize how miserably they failed.  I highly suspect that the reason the attacker chose to strike when he did was from the tweet you see at the beginning of this article. I generally vary my social media posts and delay tweeting anything that may tie me to a specific location.  So, when the attacker saw that I ""just woke up"" he incorrectly assumed that I must be at home – he was clearly not sophisticated enough to know my routine. I can only imagine how this story may have played out differently if not for this one tiny point.  Had I been home, we may not have made contact with the SWAT team until they were breaking down the door, which would have likely ended badly.  The real problem with swatting  I've waited so long to reveal the details of this day because I wanted to take additional steps to improve my operational security. I've written down all of the precautions I've taken over the past year and intend to publish them soon.  The thing is, I was lucky that the Durham Police Department is more competent and cautious than other departments in the U.S. Had a few variables been different that day, I could easily be dead.  While I certainly blame the attacker for the actions they took, my root cause analysis places the blame squarely upon law enforcement for creating an exploitable vulnerability. The militarization of police combined with non-existent authentication creates a great environment for swatting.  When you think about it, the asymmetry is disturbing – a single anonymous phone call can result in lethal force being deployed in a matter of minutes against an arbitrary target. A single anonymous phone call costs only a few dollars to make and yet can consume tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in public resources just to determine whether or not a threat is real.  What's the solution? While I'm a huge privacy advocate, I don't think it should be possible for someone to deploy lethal force with no risk to themselves. At the very least, you should have to put your reputation on the line so that you can be held accountable.  My recommendation to law enforcement agencies: Realize that swatters are almost always going to place a call from outside of their target's locale. As such, they can't actually call 911 – they have to find a non-emergency number they can call that will escalate them to 911. These escalations should be red flagged as suspicious.  Trace the source of the phone call; if it traces back to a completely different state than the caller's claimed location, red flag!  If the source phone number of the caller isn't registered in their name (or anyone's name) then ask for proof of identification. If the caller refuses to identify themselves (my attacker hung up when asked) then it's a red flag!  I leave you with an excerpt from ""The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"" (emphasis mine):  ""Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.""

42429398,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyXlh,1532584828,Hitachi Trials Blockchain to Settle Retail Payments Using Just Fingers,"Japan-based tech conglomerate Hitachi and telecommunication giant KDDI are testing a blockchain-based system that can settle retail payments using shoppers' fingers.  According to a release on Wednesday, a group of staff from the two partners are this week experimenting with a coupon settlement system deployed in a KDDI store in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, as well as a local donut shop.  Built by Hitachi with technology from the Hyperledger Fabric platform, the blockchain system is integrated with Hitachi's biometric verification and KDDI's existing coupon system. It seeks to settle shoppers' coupon transactions over a distributed network based on the vein pattern of their fingers as validators.  Hitachi explained that when shoppers sign up to use the system, they will register their coupon credits and biometric information, which are then encoded into a string of encrypted data and stored on the blockchain.  When initiating a transaction at a retail shop that accepts the coupons and participates in the blockchain as a node, shoppers will verify their identity with a finger reading device that broadcasts the request to the network and the transaction is settled.  Hitachi said the end goal is to use a tamper-proof blockchain to assist in verifying the vein pattern of users' fingers and to keep their coupon usage information accurate and updated across stores within the network simultaneously.  ""As a result, users can authenticate themselves by holding the finger on the authentication infrastructure, so it is not necessary to present a coupon at the store, and the coupon can be used even without a smartphone,"" the company said in the release.  The project is the latest pilot test taken by Hitachi to utilize a blockchain platform in retail transactions. Last year, the company also announced it is developing a blockchain platform for supply chain businesses to manage orders and invoices on an immutable ledger.

42429408,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyY7h,1532577657,Waves' Decentralized Exchange Had a $6 Million Debut. Then It Got Hacked,"When a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange supports fiat tokens and courts banks, yet makes customer identification optional, all bets are off.  According to data provided to CoinDesk by the blockchain project Waves, the company's new decentralized exchange (DEX) was facilitating $6 million of crypto transactions a day at the end of its beta testing last month. That's six times the daily volume that a rival DEX, AirSwap, boasted at its debut in April.  Waves, which is incorporated in Switzerland but headquartered in Russia, also told CoinDesk its DEX had 90,000 traders using 330,000 wallets ahead of its full launch this week – dwarfing the comparable figures for other DEXs.  There are a few reasons for this impressive performance coming out of the gate. One is speed, courtesy of the platform's centralized matchmaking service – highlighting the contradictions inherent in so-called DEXs, which have a way to go before they live up to their name.  Another factor is that almost any trader can issue a token on Waves' unique blockchain, even one that represents an IOU in fiat currency, and instantly trade it for bitcoin on the exchange.  Not least of all among its attractions for traders, standard know-your-customer ID checks are optional in this marketplace except in certain circumstances.  But the rollout hasn't been all rainbows.  On Tuesday, when Waves officially ended the year-and-a-half-long beta period and launched the full DEX, hackers hijacked both the exchange website and the company's main site to phish for users' personal wallet information. It took hours for Waves to get its site back online after restoring access to the DNS server.  ""Someone just faked my passport and gave it to support [staff] at the domain company and they changed the password at his request. Then the attacker was able to change the main website,"" Waves CEO Sasha Ivanov told CoinDesk.  Undaunted by the incident, or by criticisms of Waves' security practices, Ivanov told CoinDesk he hopes that even banks will also start launching currencies on his DEX.  He said:  ""We are looking for partnerships with major banks because we hope major banks will want to issue their own fiat tokens.""  How it works  In order to transact on the DEX, users need Waves tokens. The broader project raised $22 million by selling these native tokens in 2016. The tokens are also used to run smart contracts and incentivize node operators on the Waves blockchain, a model similar to ethereum.  The network has garnered more than 200 unique nodes, including two run by the Canadian mobile gaming company RewardMob, which sees the DEX as a key attraction.  ""Now we don't have to worry about currency control from different countries and players wanting to cash out in different currencies. It allows players to trade their tokens between other players...The decentralized exchange was a huge, key component in our decision to go with Waves,"" RewardMob CEO Todd Koch told CoinDesk.  His company launched its own Waves-based token and is preparing for an ICO. It operates tokenized rewards for multiple video games, such as a beer pong app, and maintains back-end wallets for more than 100,000 users.  ""We want to integrate the DEX right into our app so that [when] a player earns our currency, they could easily exchange it for Waves or bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency,"" Koch said.  Since the Waves DEX matchmaking software is open source, numerous nodes could run their own matchmakers and almost act like cryptocurrency miners earning fees (in Waves tokens) for processing trades.  But most of the trades are going through Waves' own central matchmaker.  Dean Eigenmann, co-founder of blockchain governance startup Harbour and of the DEX project Dexy, found this approach dubious, saying it defeats the purpose of a DEX if service can be denied by a central authority.  Ivanov acknowledged that the current state of affairs is out of step with the decentralized ethos and will have to change. He said:  ""A centralized matcher can just say 'I don't accept the trade,' for now, so it's important for us to make it more trustless.""  Compliance  The Waves DEX generally requires identity checks in two instances: when users opt for fiat cash out, through the Czech Republic-based payment processor Coinomat, a separate company Ivanov launched in 2013; or when they issue a token on the Waves platform and then list it publically on the DEX.  Private token issuance traded through private listing options, according to Ivanov, does not require identity checks for compliance. And neither does trading of bitcoin for other tokens.  ""For now, you can do crypto-to-crypto trading without any type of KYC,"" Ivanov told CoinDesk.  But Drew Hinkes, chief legal counsel and co-founder of the crypto advisory firm Athena Blockchain, told CoinDesk that exception probably doesn't apply to users in the U.S.  ""We know from the 2013 guidance issued by FinCEN [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network] that a lot of people in the crypto ecosystem need to have a BSA, the Bank Secrecy Act, and AML, which is anti-money laundering, compliance programs,"" Hinkes said. ""Those programs are required to include customer identification programs.""  According to this guidance, if an exchanger accepts or transmits a virtual currency, or if the exchanger buys or sells virtual currency for any reason, they are a money transmitter under FinCEN's jurisdiction, and thus required to check ID.  ""The guidance says that, when defining a money transmitter, they don't care whether you use real currencies or convertible virtual currencies,"" said Hinkes, who is also an adjunct professor at New York University's School of Law and Stern School of Business.  Meanwhile, Waves node operator RewardMob requires users to hand over personal information such as their full names and addresses, according to Koch, who cited requirements of Canadian sweepstakes law.  Security  This week's phishing attack not only put a damper on the DEX launch, it also prompted criticism of Waves' practice of having users enter their recovery seeds – strings of words that act like passwords for crypto wallets – into a website to use its software wallet.  Drawing a different lesson from the hijacking, Ivanov said, ""We and the whole industry need to work on decentralized domain name systems.""  A spokeswoman for Waves added that ""the DNS servers of the Waves website are maintained by the registrar, and in this case, their security is beyond our control. Nevertheless, the security levels of the registrar are, indeed, in question, and so we are currently considering further action ... to make sure that this one-time breach will never occur again.""  The incident was not the company's first brush with security flaws, though.  In 2017, an audit by the cybersecurity firm Kudelski Security pointed out that despite overall ""good security engineering,"" Waves' unique blockchain was susceptible to several types of attack and that users' wallet passwords were stored in a cleartext database that was ""readable to anyone accessing the file system.""  When asked about this, Ivanov said:  ""Most of the recommendations were carried out. As for the passwords, all the critical moments have been fixed. They are still stored in a clear config file.""  Eigenmann said he was unimpressed with Waves' infrastructure or ICO.  ""It's just embarrassing the level of software development skills which goes into some of these projects,"" he told CoinDesk. ""I don't see any real value in tokens for exchanges.""  Regardless of the controversy, Waves' volume is staggering for a new exchange with self-custody options.  According to Waves' internal data, on June 23rd alone DEX traders swapped Waves tokens for $1.59 million worth of bitcoin and $251,697 worth of monero, just to name a few.  Ivanov said he was grateful to the community for supporting their ICO and is eager to deliver real value to global businesses.  ""Our blockchain is quite fast,"" he said, claiming Waves can process 500 transactions per second. ""We have a very active Brazilian and Turkish community, you can even trade a token Lira on our exchange.""
