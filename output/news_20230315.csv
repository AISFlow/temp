42387909,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwClZ,1678924309,Art Trading Platform LiveArt Announces NFT Membership Card Linked to Exclusive Drops,"LiveArt, an art trading and analytics platform, will soon launch its LiveArt X Card, a non-fungible token (NFT) collection intended to grant holders access to exclusive curated art, token-gated communities and art market insights powered by artificial intelligence (AI).  The platform, which was founded by former Sotheby's and Christie's auction house executives, provides users with art pricing data and market insights, along with live auction streaming and peer-to-peer art trading.  The LiveArt X Card integrates Web3 into the art-collecting experience to provide holders with access to its digital art market, free airdrops, exclusive access to LiveArt's AI-generated artist insights, rewards in the form of their ART token and VIP access to real-world art events, among other things. The ART token, which powers the LiveArt ecosystem, can be used to buy physical and digital art on the platform.  According to LiveArt, its NFT membership card is meant to ""put an end to NFT flipping and speculation"" by encouraging collectors to hold onto their art long-term.  ""The traditional art world has always understood how long-term value is protected, and yet much of the digital art world continues to rug itself,"" LiveArt wrote in a Medium post. ""The LiveArt X Card ensures that the new breed of true digital collectors are protected from fraud, scams and flips, and at the same time gain exclusive access to important new digital artworks.""  The Ethereum-based collection will be available for pre-sale beginning on April 4, with the public sale beginning on April 5. It will have a total supply of 3,500 editions.  LiveArt launched its LiveArt X NFT platform in April 2022. Investors in the startup include Animoca Brands, Binance and KuCoin Labs.  NFT marketplaces continue to battle for market share amid an extended crypto winter, resulting in a market that currently caters more to investors than art collectors or creators. In response, some platforms have launched features to incentivize long-term collecting and refocus the conversation on NFTs as art.

42387893,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwBw7,1678920851,U.S. Federal Reserve’s Real-Time Payments System Coming in July,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is activating its long-awaited real-time payments system in July, the central bank said in a Wednesday statement, marking a transition that some have seen as a government challenge of the crypto sector’s instant-transaction advantages.  The FedNow Service, meant to solve the existing delays for clearing financial transactions between institutions, will begin certifying its first participants at the beginning of next month. The system will operate around the clock and provide immediate, full access to funds.  “We urge financial institutions and their industry partners to move full steam ahead with preparations to join the FedNow Service,” said Ken Montgomery, the chief operating officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who has been working on the new system he said will offer a “modern instant payment solution.”  FedNow has also been seen as a potential precursor to a central bank digital currency (CBDC), though the service could also undermine one of the key strengths of a digital dollar – the ability to transfer instantly. Fed officials have said the agency hasn’t made any decisions about a future U.S. CBDC, which they say would need the support of Congress, the Biden administration and the public.  Federal officials – including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, then-Fed Governor Lael Brainard and then-Federal Trade Commission Commissioner (now Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director) Rohit Chopra – have also cited concerns about the proliferation of certain private stablecoins, like the now-shuttered Diem (formerly Libra) project, as a sign that a real-time payment network is needed.  Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, suggested the system might actually be of use to crypto investors as a way for them ""to fund and cash out of trades without having to leave cash or digital dollars on a trading platform,"" he wrote in a client note on Wednesday.  The Fed’s new system for transactions won’t be the first, though, because the banking industry already launched its own RTP network.

42387908,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwD4H,1678917112,Bitcoin Slides Below $24.5K as European Banking Woes Spook Investors,"Bitcoin slid below $24,500 as investors weighed a potential European banking meltdown triggered by concerns about often-embattled Credit Suisse.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped to $23,946 at one point before regaining ground to recently trade at $24,502, roughly flat over the 24 hours. But that was still well off BTC's highs of the previous day when it soared past $26,000 after the release of a mildly upbeat consumer price index (CPI) inflation data for February. The 6% CPI improved on the previous month’s reading and offered investors looking for more monetary policy dovishness hope the U.S. Federal Reserve would at least temporarily stop its recent diet of interest rate hikes.  On Wednesday, banking troubles trumped monetary policy considerations.  Shares of the Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse (CS), which has been rocked by scandals over the past year and posted losses for five consecutive quarters, tanked on Wednesday after the bank’s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest capital beyond the $1.5 billion it sank into the bank last year. Saudi National Bank owns a stake of up to 9.9%.  The Swiss National Bank seemed to at least temporarily halt the damage after announcing it would provide CS with liquidity “if necessary,” and rejecting the notion that contagion tied to the failure of two, large U.S. regional banks over the past week had spread overseas.  Credit Suisse shares tumbled 13%, as did several European banking stocks including French banks BNP Paribas (BNP.PA) and Société Générale (GLE:FP), down by 8% and 10%, respectively. European markets tumbled as investors in riskier assets grew skittish.  U.S. equity markets initially tumbled on the banking news coming from Europe before recovering some of their losses. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.05%.  Regional banking stocks also plunged, with First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW) falling 21% and 13%, respectively.  “Credit Suisse is a bigger story than Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and this has Wall Street extremely nervous,” ​​Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday email. “Bitcoin’s decline isn’t that bad when you consider how much pressure is hitting stocks, oil prices and the euro.”  While banking turmoil could ultimately become a bullish moment for bitcoin, “for now crypto weakness is justified,” Moya added.  Meanwhile, the CME FedWatch Tool showed that currently around 55% of traders believe the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starting March 22. An additional 45% expect the Fed to boost the rate by 25 basis points (bps), a stark change from a week ago when an increasing number of observers felt the Fed would increase the rate by 50 bps.  Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at technical analysis-based research firm Fairlead Strategies, said BTC's resistance is strong near $25,200, while tackling “intermediate-term overbought conditions in place that have become a headwind.""  “This increases short-term downside risk to support from the 200-day [moving average] (~$19,800),” Tamplin told CoinDesk in an email.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was hovering around $1,656 Wednesday afternoon, down 2.4% from Tuesday, same time. HNT, the native token of the decentralized wireless communication network Helium, recently tumbled 13% to trade near $2 Wednesday, its lowest level in two months. The decline came after Binance.US said it would delist the cryptocurrency on March 21.

According to its website, its suite of products that make up Salesforce Web3 will help companies build, manage and integrate NFTs into their businesses. The new platform will also include support for Web3 technologies through its customer service product Customer360.  In addition, Salesforce Web3 is rolling out Web3 Connect, an API integration that provides insight into the customer experience across Web2 and Web3 as they tap into these new technologies. Salesforce is also releasing NFT Management, a platform that allows companies to create and monitor the success of their NFT collections and blockchain data through the Salesforce interface.  Adam Caplan, Salesforce’s senior vice president of emerging technology, said in a Salesforce blog post the company is enthusiastic about embracing Web3 and the capabilities it offers businesses to build communities and propel digital ownership.  “We’ve seen a lot of interest from customers who want to understand and tap into this new world of Web3 and NFTs,” said Caplan in a blog post. “Unique digital assets like NFTs present new avenues for brands to tap into first-party data to build digital communities, create digital twins, and drive loyalty programs.”  Salesforce says it began testing Web3 technologies last year and successfully executed 275,000 transactions while in its beta phase. Companies such as whiskey manufacturer Crown Royal, toy distributor Mattel and fashion company Scotch and Soda all tested Salesforce’s technology with their own Web3 technologies.  “Salesforce Web3 enhances our NFT collections to help us connect with customers and bring our Web2 and Web3 systems together,” said Sven Gerjets, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Mattel, in a blog post.  Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff initially teased plans for integrating bockchain technologies in 2018. A year later, the company revealed its plans to integrate its own native blockchain into its CRM.

In recent months the exchange has suffered several setbacks such as a lackluster user adoption rate, declining product revenue and the exodus of many of its leaders, including its co-founder.  Holders of mStable’s governance token will select which proposal to accept. An approved buyer will control MStable’s crypto assets and its technology, which includes its yield-generating stablecoin vaults, after a sale goes through.  The proposal will go to a vote on March 20, and the voting period will last for a period of five days.

42394475,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8KPh,1678915603,What Are Crypto Whales and Why Are They Important?,"Crypto whales are some of the most influential entities in the crypto space. In fact, they are so important that individuals and tools track their activities to predict price movements. Bearing this in mind, let's look at what crypto whales are and why they are critical components of the cryptoverse.  What are crypto whales?  Simply put, crypto whales are individuals or organizations that own a large amount of a coin or non-fungible token (NFT) collection. The size of the holding has to be large enough to cause a ripple effect on the price of the coin or NFT if the holder sells it all at once.  For example, a bitcoin (BTC) whale is an entity that owns a large amount of bitcoin, usually a minimum of 1,000 BTC or $10 million and above. A holder could also be an ether (ETH) whale, another altcoin whale or an NFT whale.  The threshold of determining whether an altcoin holder is a whale or not depends on the market size of the coin in question. As such, although $10 million worth of BTC is the threshold for identifying bitcoin whales, the minimum requirement may be lower for altcoins, especially those with small market capitalization.  Market capitalization, also called a market cap, is a metric that shows the relative size of each cryptocurrency. To calculate the market cap, multiply the current price of each coin by its circulating supply (that is, the total number of coins in circulation).  For example, the market cap of bitcoin at the time of writing this article is around $469 billion when you multiply its price (as of writing, $24,300) by its circulating supply (19.3 million BTC). Because bitcoin has the largest market cap, bitcoin investors need to hold a sizable amount of bitcoin in dollars to be considered whales.  Most other cryptos don’t come close to bitcoin’s market cap, so holders will need far less to be considered a whale. For example, Polygon's MATIC has a $10 billion market cap while dogecoin (DOGE) is at $9.5 billion, so it would take under $1 million in either to qualify as a whale.  NFT whales are entities that own a large number of NFTs, ideally of the same collection, though often NFT whales own many high-value blue-chip NFTs such as Bored Apes, CryptoPunks, Moonbirds and others. A collector who owns a significant fraction of an NFT collection is an NFT whale. For instance, if a collection consists of 1,000 NFTs, an individual or organization that holds 50 of such NFTs would likely be considered a whale.  Why are crypto whales important?  The sheer size of the holdings of crypto whales means they can influence price trends intentionally or unintentionally. When whales make big moves, they make waves. Let’s look at some of the ways they can cause price swings.  Short-term price spikes  Before discussing the short-term price impact of crypto whales, it is vital to first understand crypto liquidity.  Simply put, liquidity is how easy it is to convert a coin to another cryptocurrency or fiat without experiencing a wild shift in price. When a trader enters a BTC buy or sell order on an exchange, the liquidity status of bitcoin on that exchange will determine how fast it is to match the order, and whether the price of the coin will remain stable.  If there is high liquidity, the exchange transaction will finalize quickly without causing the price to shift significantly. In a case where there is low liquidity, it will take a while to match the buy or sell order and, as a result, the price may shift before the finalization of the trade. Exchanges with high liquidity ensure that all sell and buy orders are matched promptly. In contrast, low liquidity occurs when there is an order matching delay due to deficiencies on either the sell or buy side of trades.  So how does this phenomenon tie into how crypto whales influence the digital asset market?  Like most average crypto holders, whales aim to make more money by increasing the value of their holdings. Because they have access to a large crypto holding, they can influence price trends momentarily by either flooding the crypto market with coins or initiating buying pressure. The two strategies with which crypto whales can cause short-term price swings are as follows:  Strategy 1: From the fundamentals of economics, when supply exceeds demand the price is bound to fall. Therefore, a bitcoin whale can cause the price of BTC to fall by selling a massive chunk of his BTC holding. If there is not enough demand for bitcoin, the BTC price will likely plunge sharply. When the price has dipped enough, the whale can start buying BTC at a value lower than his initial selling price. If done right, the whale will end up with more BTC than he began with.  Strategy 2: Another basic economic principle that whales can take advantage of says the price of an asset will increase if the demand exceeds supply. With this in mind, an individual or group of bitcoin whales can initiate buying pressure. If the coin supply does not meet this high demand, the price of BTC will surge. This buying spree may trigger the fear of missing out (FOMO) among other traders. As a result, traders will likely start to buy BTC in the hopes that the price will continue to rise. Once BTC surges to the desired price, the whale can start selling at a profit.  In the two strategies highlighted above, the bitcoin whale invokes low liquidity in the BTC market and profits from the imbalance.  Long-term price impact  The activities of whales also denote a shift in crypto market cycles (that is, the recurrence of different stages of euphoria and fear resulting in long-term rise and fall of crypto prices). During a period of a sustained surge in crypto prices, whales often buy more coins to increase the size of their holdings. Once whales begin to sell off a fraction of their holdings, a market crash may be imminent.  The growing adoption of community-based governance anchored by tokens is another reason crypto whales are vital components of the crypto space. A typical decentralized system launches a governance token that distributes voting rights to holders. In most cases, wealthy investors buy up a large portion of these governance tokens to become major stakeholders in crypto projects. Because they own a significant fraction of the governance token, they can easily sway governance voting results in their favor. This is similar to how the votes of large shareholders significantly determine the results of corporate elections.  How to track crypto whales  Bearing in mind the influence of crypto whales, it has become common for crypto participants to track whale activities to determine short-term and long-term price trends.  Crypto whale tracking is possible because the blockchain is a public ledger that documents activities and crypto balances of users. Anyone can track any blockchain wallet address and how much they hold. However, it should be noted it is only possible to determine the real-world identities of the owners of wallet addresses when they publicly reveal this information.  Nonetheless, it is not crucial to figure out the real-world identities of whales. The most important thing is how much the whale's address holds, how often it moves and the destination of the funds. In particular, the destination wallet is critical information. Below is why:  Wallet-to-exchange transactions: When a whale moves a large amount of crypto from self-custody wallets to exchanges, it usually means that the whale is looking to initiate a massive sell-off, which may force the price of the cryptocurrency to drop.  Exchange-to-wallet transactions: The movement of large amounts of coins from an exchange to a whale address means the whale is not looking to sell in the near term.  Wallet-to-wallet transactions: In some cases, whales prefer to maintain a low profile by ensuring their activities do not cause ripple effects on crypto prices. They do this by executing over-the-counter (OTC) trades. The whale sends coins directly to the OTC wallet and vice versa when buying or selling cryptocurrency.  To track all this information, enter the wallet address of the whale into a blockchain explorer. A blockchain explorer is a database where you can access on-chain historical data.  If manually tracking the activities of crypto whales seems like too much work, here are other ways to do it:  Subscribe to on-chain analysis services: Some analytical firms and tools break down live whale transactions.  Follow whale-monitoring social media accounts: Certain social media accounts like Whale Alert focus on tracking and reporting the activities of crypto whales.  Note that crypto whales are aware that traders track their transactions. In the hopes of triggering price movements, they sometimes move coins around without eventually executing trades. So keep this in mind and only whale watch as one of many inputs to inform your trading decisions.

Speaking to reporters after a commission vote on Wednesday, Gensler said securities laws could be triggered because investors anticipate a return when they purchase tokens underpinned by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The Block first reported the news.  ""Whatever they're promoting and putting into a protocol, and locking up their tokens in a protocol, a protocol that's often a small group of entrepreneurs and developers are developing, I would just suggest that each of these token operators ... seek to come into compliance, and the same with the intermediaries,” Gensler said.  According to The Block, Gensler’s remarks came after reporters asked him for his thoughts on statements made by Rostin Behnam, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), last week, arguing that ether is a commodity and should be regulated by his agency.  The two regulators have long been at odds over which agency should take precedence in regulating the crypto markets. Gensler has said that bitcoin is a commodity but has been reluctant to relinquish control – or, at least, the possibility of future control – over any other cryptocurrency, including ether, and has claimed that the “vast majority” of the thousands of existing cryptocurrencies are securities.  In September 2022, after the Ethereum blockchain upgrade to proof-of-stake known as the Merge, Gensler suggested that proof-of-stake tokens could be investment contracts that subject them to securities laws.  Last week, Gensler’s argument that proof-of-stake tokens are securities got an unexpected assist in the form of a lawsuit filed against crypto exchange KuCoin by the New York Attorney General’s Office (NYAG). In the suit, the AG argued the Seychelles-based exchange is violating U.S. securities laws by offering tokens, including ether, that meet the definition of a security without registering with the proper regulatory bodies – in that case, with the state AG’s office.  Despite Gensler and Behnam’s public back-and-forth, the NYAG suit is the first time a regulator has claimed in court that ether is a security, albeit in a state court rather than a federal court.

42411005,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvU02,1678910604,"Trading Ranges for Bitcoin, Ether Reflect Diverging Views About the Assets","Trading ranges for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, signaling differing investor perceptions of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Bitcoin spent much of the day trading flat, with a narrower trading range than the prior day. BTC eventually moved downward, and was recently off 4.3%, although the decline did not offset the robust gains of the previous four days.  Moreover, BTC trading volume was lower than in the previous day, while the low price on the day exceeded the low price from Tuesday, generally referred to as a “higher low.” An asset reaching a higher low signals the continuation of an uptrend, even if the price is lower on the day.  By contrast, ether’s trading range expanded relative to the day prior, with its decline in price eliminating Tuesday gains.  Monitoring the trading range of an asset can provide clues about investor sentiment, particularly when coupled with volume. Ether’s “lower low” compared to the prior day suggests that ETH holders are entertaining concerns about the market turning bearish.  Whether ETH's price finds support near $1,640 will be key to watch. A look at ETH’s Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) shows significant levels of activity near its current trading level. Traditionally, price action can be “sticky” at these high volume nodes, as liquidity is easy to secure.  ETH investors could be wary that the upcoming Shanghai upgrade will cause selling pressure, because previously locked staked ether will be eligible for sale.  According to Ethereum.org, the current amount of staked ETH is 17,577,231, representing approximately $29 billion, and receiving a current annual percentage rate (APR) of 5.2%.  A counter-thesis to ETH being sold off following the upgrade is the extent to which it makes economic sense to do so. The current ETH price ($1,650) exceeds the price of ETH in December 2020, when staking began ($600). However, the current APR relative to other opportunities may prove compelling enough for investors to continue staking.  Additionally, removing the requirement to lock up ETH indefinitely during the staking process could incentivize more staking, not less.

42387892,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwBrR,1678909714,"Chinese Businessman With Ties to Steve Bannon Arrested, Charged With Fraud, Including $500M Crypto Scam","Exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui was arrested in New York on Wednesday morning and charged with fraud for allegedly orchestrating a series of fraudulent schemes that bilked retail investors out of a collective $1.4 billion.  Hours after his arrest, Guo’s luxury penthouse apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side caught fire, burning for two hours before firefighters were able to put out the blaze. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is reportedly investigating the fire. The 15-room apartment is currently on the market for $32.5 million.  Out of Guo’s four alleged schemes, three were related to GTV Media Group, the Chinese social media company formed in April 2020 by Guo and Steve Bannon – a longtime ally and former adviser to former U.S. President Donald Trump. The three alleged schemes raised an estimated $857 million.  Bannon was arrested on Guo’s yacht, the 152-foot-long Lady May, in August 2020 and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in connection to a crowdfunded effort to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Bannon has not been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with GTV.  Guo’s fourth alleged scheme – which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a separate civil complaint raised $500 million from retail investors – was an unrelated crypto venture called H-Coin, or Himalaya Coin. Beginning in October 2021, Guo founded and promoted H-Coin, telling his social media followers that the currency was 20% backed by gold and promising to cover “100% of investment losses attributable to H-Coin.”  Four months later, in February 2022, Guo filed for bankruptcy protection, claiming assets valued between $50,000 and $100,000 and liabilities of up to $500 million. Despite his claims of poverty, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Wednesday that it seized over $630 million of alleged fraud proceeds from 21 different bank accounts controlled by Guo between September 2022 and March 2023.  Before declaring bankruptcy, Guo lived lavishly – a lifestyle prosecutors say was funded by unsuspecting investors.  “[Guo] is charged with lining his pockets with the money he stole, including buying himself, and his close relatives, a 50,000 square foot mansion, a $3.5 million Ferrari, and even two $36,000 mattresses, and financing a $37 million luxury yacht,” U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said.  Guo’s U.S. legal troubles are not his first. In 2014, the former billionaire fled his native China in anticipation of fraud charges, and became a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party. Guo, who is wanted by the Chinese government, filed an application for political asylum in the U.S. in 2017.

42387900,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwCJV,1678909604,Brian Brooks: U.S. Government Using Crisis to Choke Off Crypto Access to Banks,"""It's pretty clear there has been a decision across the bank regulatory agencies in this [Biden] administration that crypto is inherently risky and needs to be extricated from the banking system,"" Brian Brooks, the former acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday.  Last week, Silvergate Bank, a California firm that catered to crypto companies, said it would “voluntarily liquidate” and shut down. Days later, tech startup-focused firm Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which had some crypto clients, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which said the bank had “inadequate liquidity and insolvency.”  Then, over the weekend, New York-based firm Signature Bank, which also had a number of crypto clients, was closed by New York State banking regulators. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took receivership of SVB and Signature.  When he ran the OCC ""I had a weekly call with the FDIC chairman and with the vice chairman of the [Federal Reserve],"" said Brooks, now a member of the board of blockchain company Bitfury. ""We talked every week for an hour and talked about what our priorities were for the coming week how we can support each other how our actions would affect the [banking] system.""  Brooks reiterated comments made during the Milken Conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this month that the Biden administration is trying to close down crypto in what he calls Operation Choke Point 2.0, the ""biggest story for the next six months."" The original Operation Choke Point was the Obama-era initiative (when Joe Biden was vice president) investigating banks and the business they did with, among others, firms believed to be at a high risk for fraud and money laundering.  “My belief is that [regulators are] trying to send a signal that will eventually choke this [crypto] off,” Brooks told CDTV.  Brooks said he is ""100% confident regulators were working together"" in shutting down the banks, despite the differing circumstances.  The New York Department of Financial Services, for instance, said Tuesday Signature Bank was not closed because of crypto, but because of a ""crisis of confidence"" in the bank's leadership. Signature had been working to decrease it exposure to crypto in recent weeks. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation said it took over SVB because of its ""inadequate liquidity and insolvency."" Silvergate voluntarily closed a week after saying it would be late filing its annual report and was not sure about its ability to continue as a ""going concern.""  Still, to Brooks “these things are not accidents at all. I’m highly confident of that.”  But crypto won’t be so easily cut off, said Brooks. “There will always be smaller banks that are willing to step up” and work with crypto companies, he said. But it would “be better if larger banks with better risk management were serving the sector.”  Read more: President Biden Calls for Stronger Bank Regulations in Wake of SVB, Signature Bank Collapses  CORRECTION (March 15, 2023 18:25 UTC): Brian Brooks is on the board of Bitfury.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).  “We’re going through that mechanical process right now,” Tillis said Wednesday at a Bipartisan Policy Center event in Washington, D.C. He said that “all the ideas coming from various offices” are under that review, with an aim toward finding components that could clear a Congress split between the political parties. Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, which will have a key role in advancing any sort of crypto legislation.  “We’re completing that inventory now and hope to share it over the next couple of weeks,” he said.  A number of bills made progress on Capitol Hill last year, including a stablecoin oversight bill in the House Financial Services Committee and a bill in the Senate Agriculture Committee that would have set up the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a direct regulator of non-securities crypto trading. So far in the new legislative session, none of the earlier efforts have yet regained the traction they had before. Now the lawmakers face pressures from the fallout of the FTX crypto exchange meltdown and the more recent collapse in crypto banking.  A two-party approach “is the only way you’re going to get something done in this Congress,” Tillis said, and the outcome isn’t likely to make either side especially happy. “This is not going to be a crowd pleaser or an applause line.”  Also at the event, Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) agreed that digital assets oversight is going to have to come from bipartisan common ground. Any outcome will be colored by what the lawmakers have seen from the industry in the past several months, especially the implosion of FTX.  “The brand of cryptocurrency took a deep hit,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/15/us-lawmakers-digging-through-crypto-legislation-for-bipartisan-winners-senator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfb654560b80cbfcfdbf439c2ed902fa2db78af0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It fully repaid these loans by the start of this month.  Some in the crypto industry have speculated that the early repayment ultimately triggered the bank run on Silvergate. Silvergate’s stock price tanked a day after the company made the disclosure, and it announced it would suspend operations and voluntarily liquidate a few days later.  “We can't speculate as to what went into their final decision to prepay; however, the existing tenure of their remaining advances before the prepayment was short term,” the spokesperson said.  The spokesperson said that the FHLBank could require prepayment if the bank it’s loaning to experiences a “material adverse change,” but that didn't happen with Silvergate.  “Again, we did not request or compel Silvergate Bank to prepay its outstanding advances. We would assume that any prudent borrower in their position would assess their own position and upcoming disclosures and make their own decisions about what was in their best interest in terms of all of their assets and liabilities,” a statement from FHLBank said.

42387897,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwCOB,1678898958,Web3 Security Company Ironblocks Takes Aim at Spate of DeFi Hacks,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols keep losing the security fight – and hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto – to hackers and thieves. Israeli startup Ironblocks is looking to change that.  On Wednesday, Ironblocks began rolling out a security product that CEO Or Dadosh says could help smart contract-based financial programs get ahead of the damage. It’s a threat detection platform, and it plugs into DeFi protocols in order to monitor and flag any asset transfer that looks fishy – or worse.  “We are looking for economic anomalies in the transaction itself,” Dadosh told CoinDesk in an interview at ETHDenver.  The launch comes as DeFi protocols continue to take a shellacking from savvy hackers who steal millions of dollars by pulling their economic levels in unanticipated ways. Just this week, an unknown exploiter drained borrowing and lending protocol Euler Finance of $200 million by spoofing the way it handles collateral and debt, Dadosh said.  In the case of Euler, the hacker withdrew the funds in a flurry of multi-million-dollar transactions. But those withdrawals were possible because of the unusual transactions that they initially executed to trick the protocol in the first place. It's at this stage that Ironblocks thinks it can flag and foil other instances of smart contract thievery.  Ironblocks is hardly the only security team building monitoring software for DeFi protocols; it’s not even the only Israeli company. Hypernative is also trying to make a name for itself. Both companies announced seven-figure funding rounds less than a month apart.  The funding frenzy and competitive landscape speaks to the growth of the on-chain security landscape. While once only inhabited by tracing companies that retroactively follow the money, it's now buzzing with smart contract auditors, economic risk analysis firms, white hats and monitoring platforms that seek to mitigate the damage.

The token has lost 20% in the past 24 hours and was recently trading at $2. The delisting, announced Monday, comes ahead of Helium’s migration to the Solana blockchain from its own blockchain.  The Helium Network is a decentralized grid of wireless hot spots that aims to provide an alternative to hard-wired internet or mobile data service. The services are powered by cryptocurrencies, and users who participate in the network receive rewards for doing so. HNT is earned when hot spots provide and validate wireless coverage and transfer data over the network.  “While the Helium Foundation is disappointed that Binance.US has decided to take this action in advance of the migration, we understand their position,” the foundation said. “Helium’s migration to Solana is significant, and a first for the industry – on par with Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.”  The foundation said the transition to Solana is proceeding as planned. The migration takes effect on March 27.  The move comes after the project’s initial exponential growth in adoption slowed and it suffered accusations of lying about key partnerships and its profitability. Founder Amir Haleem responded in a tweet thread saying Helium doesn't have any commercial relationships with entities using the network. Rather, it “evangelizes[s] the network” to help them develop applications.

42387907,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwCzb,1678898393,Bitcoin Dominance Reaches 9-Month High,"The bitcoin (BTC) dominance rate – the leading cryptocurrency by market value’s share of the total crypto market – has reached a nine-month high of 45.5%, according to data from charting platform TradingView.  BTC.D last reached over 45% on June 25, 2022.  The recent surge comes amid a turbulent two weeks in crypto markets with the failure of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature and a near meltdown of the wider banking sector. Bitcoin dominance has historically risen during periods of high stress because BTC is considered a less-volatile asset than most other cryptocurrencies.  BTC’s market share gains have also lately coincided with a nearly three-day surge in bitcoin’s price, which soared past $26,000 on Tuesday for the first time since last summer after the release of a mildly favorable consumer price index (CPI) data for February. The CPI report spurred a spike throughout the crypto market.  BTC was recently trading above $24,700, down 4% over the past 24 hours but up by double digits from where the price stood over the weekend.  “A bitcoin dominance run is generally viewed as healthy for the crypto market, as it signals that froth in the market is relatively low (crypto traders are choosing to buy bitcoin over more speculative altcoins),” FundStrat Research noted in a tweet Tuesday.  FundStrat said the spike could reflect investors' interest inbitcoin “reigniting when traditional banks such as SVB are failing.”  In December CoinDesk contributing columnist Noelle Acheson wrote that “BTC is the least volatile of the non-stablecoin crypto assets, and when traders and short-term investors are feeling confident they tend to prefer the high risk/high reward offered by some of the smaller tokens.”  Bitcoin’s dominance has also strengthened while stablecoin unrest has surfaced over the last few weeks, with the world’s second largest stablecoin USDC, depegging from the dollar following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. USDC has more recently regained its peg, but uncertainty about stablecoins’ path forward remains, particularly as regulators have increased their scrutiny of this asset.

42421324,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqcH,1678898036,Don’t Get Your Hopes Up: SVB's Demise Won't Bring Interest Rates Down,"Crypto markets have experienced a surprising surge over the past few days, with bitcoin and ether rising by around 20% since late Sunday. Stock markets are down sharply Wednesday morning as banking’s woes expand to Europe, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was actually up a little over 1% between Monday’s open and Tuesday’s close.  Those breezes of bullishness came despite a wave of bank failures within the last week that would seem to suggest a rocky road ahead for the economy. That reflects the current “bad news is good news” environment, in which anything that makes a Federal Reserve interest rate hike less likely – including negative news about the real economy – is bullish for asset markets.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     But markets may still be overlooking a specific provision of the Fed’s recent bank bailouts that could undermine that conventional wisdom. The Fed has created a program called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) that is, on its face, about backstopping banks.  But the BTFP will also make it easier for the Fed to further raise interest rates.  The new and improved Fed ‘put’  At the most obvious level, of course, the crypto surge and early-week steadiness in equity markets were reasonable first-order reactions to the Fed’s decision to designate Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank as “systemically important.” That emergency declaration suspended the normal rules of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and allowed all deposits to be made entirely whole.  While West Coast venture capitalists have been rightly excoriated for their irresponsible panic-mongering about the consequences of a normal unwind for their precious SVB, it’s certainly true that some amount of short-term turmoil has been avoided. The rescue of Signature in particular seems like good news for crypto, as Signature banked some operators in the sector.  See also: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite 'Too Big to Big to Fail' Debate  But positive sentiment may also have come, perversely, from the fact that the banks collapsed in the first place. The collapses could be taken as a sign that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes over the past year are having their desired effect of slowing the economy. In turn, that might mean rate hikes would slow or even reverse, which would be good for everyone still in the game.  This is the essence of the “bad news is good news” logic of a market hanging on the Fed’s every twitch. But the specifics of the SVB and Signature insolvencies made the logic even more compelling. The banks were quite directly undermined by the Fed’s interest rate hikes, which undercut the value of existing Treasury bonds, leading to big losses when the banks had to sell those underwater bonds to cover withdrawals.  While SVB and Signature faced industry-specific withdrawal pressures, this erosion of the market value of pre-2022 bonds is an issue for a large number of banks across America. Continuing rate hikes would likely make it worse and could cause more bank failures. At the same time, as we found out Tuesday, inflation is still very much alive and well in America, now running at 6%.  So the Fed needs to keep raising rates to curb inflation, but such a hike could put more banks at risk. That looked like a bit of a trap for the Fed, and maybe a barrier to continued aggressive rate hikes. An appealing source of hopium, if nothing else.  Keep it rolling  But the Federal Reserve has printed itself a get-out-of-jail-free card on the underwater-Treasurys dilemma. The change could also constitute a large and somewhat stealthy federal subsidy of the entire U.S. banking industry.  As excavated in detail by Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, the new Bank Term Funding Program, announced alongside the SVB and Signature bailouts, will offer loans of up to one year against U.S. bonds issued before March 12, 2023. This includes bonds issued before interest rate hikes began in 2022, bonds whose market value has been driven down on the order of 10%-15% by the issuance of higher-yield bonds since then. That’s what forced both SVB and crypto bank Silvergate before it to take huge losses on bond sales when customer withdrawals accelerated.  The key feature of the BTFP is that it will offer loans against those underwater bonds at their face value, rather than at their current market value. The intention seems to be to offer banks a bridge between the shaky, old, low-yield bonds and safer ground.  The duration of the loans is notably just one year, which is not exactly generous, so there’s at least some restraint on display here by the Fed. But it still means the Fed could wind up shouldering a lot of risk for banks: three have just blown up in rapid succession. Some level of default on these BTFP loans seems very plausible.  That would leave the Fed holding Treasury bonds that might not regain their market value for years, or even decades. The Fed doesn’t face the same duration risk as private banks, so it can afford to hold, even all the way to the bonds’ 10-, 20- or 30-year maturities, when their face value can be redeemed from the U.S. Treasury Department.  It will take further analysis to figure out exactly what costs and risks this effectively transfers from private banks to the Fed, and ultimately to the U.S. dollar and American public. For instance, defaults on BTFP loans could amount to some kind of stealth money-printing. But the BTFP certainly smells like a sector-wide banking backstop, or even bailout, if nothing else, trading on faith in the Federal Reserve.  See also: Should I Keep My Money in Bitcoin or a Bank? | Opinion  The important takeaway for markets, meanwhile, is that interest rate hikes are still entirely on the table because the new BTFP will prevent further harm to banks. That seems particularly worth the attention of crypto market participants. The factors driving the current BTC and ETH rallies are still a bit opaque, but another rate hike would add substantial downward pressure.  The next meeting of the Fed’s rate-setting Open Market Committee is scheduled for March 22-23, just over a week from now. The Fed knows it has headroom to raise rates, but if traders have missed that fact, the current crypto surge could turn out to be a dangerous bear trap.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

The move also has the potential to provide users with more efficient and cost-effective trading options. This ultimately improves the value proposition for BNB Chain and prominent ecosystem tokens, such as BNB Coin.  The expansion means that Uniswap Protocol users will be able to leverage BNB Chain’s high-speed and low transaction fees to trade and swap tokens across the network.

42421342,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqsn,1678895794,Evaluating Bitcoin as a Store of Value,"It’s a common question: Is bitcoin (BTC) a store of value? While proponents say, “Yes” without hesitation, skeptics note its historically large drawdowns. And that’s fair. Not long ago, in November 2021, bitcoin reached nearly $70,000 but is now around $20,000. That said, BTC also used to trade below 1 cent so, using just prices, the answer to the initial question is, “It’s hard to tell.”  For an asset in its speculative, price-discovery phase, volatility should be expected. New opportunities and technologies often capture the attention of speculators and traders, often resulting in wild fluctuations as participants seek to determine true value.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Pair growing interest with the skepticism, controversy and industry speed bumps experienced thus far, and the roller coaster of highs and lows makes sense at just 14 years of age.  While the asset exhibits qualities of sound money (it’s durable, portable, scarce, uniform and divisible), acceptance is the final uncertainty.  Through the following on-chain metrics, I aim to prove that bitcoin’s users believe it’s a store of value (SoV), despite the volatility.  Realized capitalization  One measure of bitcoin’s use as an SoV is its “realized capitalization.” Different from traditional market cap, this alternative considers the last transfer price of each bitcoin rather than the current market price.  In doing so, realized capitalization is an aggregate cost basis of bitcoin’s on-chain users. The total realized cap is the amount of money that has been stored in the network over time.  To me, this is a proxy for inflows. Realized capitalization rises when transfers are made at higher prices than before and declines when transfers are made at lower prices.  According to Glassnode data, bitcoin stores a total of about $380 billion in value, down from a peak of $460 billion. But, importantly, this is four times more than in December 2017 – when bitcoin was priced around where it is today. So, money has flowed into the network – to store value.  Holding trends  Not only that, but bitcoin’s users also are holding the asset for longer and longer. Just last week, the percentage of supply that has been held for long periods has hit all-time highs despite the drop in prices since late 2021. As of March 7, according to Glassnode data:  % Supply Held for 1+ Years: 67.7%  % Supply Held for 2+ Years: 51.4%  % Supply Held for 3+ Years: 39.2%  % Supply Held for 5+ Years: 28.3%  Conclusion  There is a saying that “perception is reality.” Remember, bitcoin has essentially been willed into existence. Despite the noise and skepticism, money continues to flow into the network and its users are holding their assets for longer periods of time.  The next time somebody questions bitcoin’s use as a store of value, show them these charts.

As is the case for many analysts, I was assigned to cover a set of companies. As an analyst, you usually don’t receive carte blanche to write about whatever you want. Each business sector has its own nuances, and so industry custom is to specialize in one. What will be interesting over time is whether this applies to digital assets.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  My coverage universe focused on small and microcap oil and gas companies – those with small market capitalizations, and ones with little “coverage.”  The rationale for this focus was that alpha lay in small, unknown firms. These types of organizations go unnoticed not because of a lack of quality but because they haven’t been widely discovered. This dynamic exists in crypto as well.  Of the thousands of digital assets, all but about 25 of them would be considered small cap, given the $2 billion market cap top I used with equities. So lowering that threshold (perhaps to $500 million) makes sense, at least as a first step.  Because the crypto space is a nascent field, fundamental analysis is constantly evolving. Technical analysis translates well in my view, but you must be willing to shift your opinion rapidly when the facts change.  A second step is to start with a theme. Perhaps there’s an area or development that you feel strongly about, and you wish to participate in digital assets that connect to it.  Perhaps you think the overall market regime is ripe for value investing because of recent turmoil. Clearly, the initial impact of both Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley bank closing negatively affected markets, which seemed to provide favorable valuations of which some investors have already taken advantage. Alpha is often found in the shadows of down markets, although most times it’s seen in hindsight.  Artificial Intelligence may be a theme worth exploring – potentially transformative in the way that cryptocurrencies have been.  AI is a branch of computer science that allows machines to mimic, and possibly improve upon, processes that the human mind controls. Early AI results have been promising with such technologies as Alexa, Siri, self-driving cars and ChatGPT becoming increasingly accepted.  What AI-related assets have potential? Consider the following:  Asset: SingularityNET. Token: AGIX. Market Capitalization: $596 million. Correlation (BTC): 0.86  SingularityNET bills itself as the “world’s leading decentralized AI marketplace, running on blockchain.” Its most up-to-date white paper states that most AI tools today are fragmented and running within a closed loop environment.  By contrast, SingularityNET plans to facilitate coordination between different AI tools while allowing developers to monetize their efforts.  Year to date it has increased 996%, with trading volume that is 0.10% of BTC. Technically, its RSI is 75, indicating that the asset is currently overbought.  Asset: Render Token. Token: RNDR. Market Capitalization: $491 million. Correlation (BTC): 0.88  Render token’s (RNDR) value within the AI ecosystem relates to storage and infrastructure. The RNDR token allows for graphics processing unit (GPU) renderings to be distributed via the blockchain.  Much of the developing AI that has taken center stage recently (ChatGPT, for example), requires significant computing power and is becoming too robust for GPUs to handle efficiently.  Render token as a network attempts to solve this problem by allowing anyone with a modern GPU to exchange their GPU power for RNDR tokens, which can increase the size of GPU compute power for developers.  Year to date, RNDR is up 252% and has daily trading volume of $157 million.  Asset: Fetch.ai Token: FET Market Capitalization: $355 million. Correlation (BTC): 0.91  Fetch.ai, the machine learning platform aims to facilitate the exchange of data across a decentralized, distributed ledger.  Fetch.ai is the AI lab, and its native token (FET) is the medium of exchange/currency within the Fetch ecosystem. Developers wishing to access datasets within the Fetch.ai ecosystem would acquire FET, allowing them to deploy it for their own development purposes within FET, and/or benefit from its price appreciation.  Year to date, FET is up 394% and has daily trading volume of $360 million.  Takeaway  All told, the three platforms mentioned are only a sliver of the burgeoning technologies within the crypto landscape. Whether they succeed remains uncertain. (Nothing in this column should be considered investment advice.)  However, one thing that I remain confident about, as was the case in my past stint in traditional finance (TradFi), is that opportunities for alpha are more likely to be found in lesser-known, lesser-capitalized assets that are waiting to take center stage – much where AI as a technology was a few years ago.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  Bailout? When crypto-friendly bank Silvergate collapsed and wound down operations just one week ago, two other banks followed suit: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank faced bank runs, the second and third largest in history. When the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stepped in and declared the failures “systematic risks,” the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department rescued the depositors (who were otherwise only insured up to $250,000 per account), but unlike 2008 left the stockholders out in the cold.  Overexposed: BlockTower Capital Funds, an institutional investment firm for digital and traditional assets, had four private funds tied to Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank that were valued at $940 million in total. Two of its funds used Silvergate as its sole custodian, whereas two of its other funds used other custodians, including Signature Bank.  Repegging: Fears that USDC stablecoin issuer Circle had exposure to SVB triggered a wave of depegging – in both directions. That included decentralized stablecoin MakerDAO, which relies on USDC for 52% of its reserves; and also tether (USDT), which depegged and rose to $1.06 as traders fled USDC. USDC fell to a record low of 87 cents on Friday, but crypto exhaled after the stablecoin regained its 1:1 U.S. dollar peg on reassurance by Circle that its reserves were safe and sound and that it had a new banking partner, Cross River Bank. The bank is a top choice of TradFi players like Visa and has backers including Andreessen Horowitz and T. Rowe Price Investment Management.  Undeterred: Coinbase has shocked Binance USD (BUSD) by suspending trading of the stablecoin. Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, who broadcast these intentions in February, cited liquidity concerns as the reason behind the delisting of BUSD. The move followed Paxos, the company that issues BUSD, halting the minting of the stablecoin due to regulatory action by the New York Department of Financial Services and Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao isn’t pausing to recover. Binance said it will convert $1 billion worth of the stablecoin to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), BNB coin (BNB) and other tokens to support the crypto market.

42421330,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqiT,1678893979,When Will Crypto Learn From the Mistakes of Banks?,"Some crypto industry operatives will point to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank as further evidence that traditional financial (TradFi) institutions are ineffective and untrustworthy.  In fact, you may have already heard from the bitcoiner in your life about avoiding financial scares by storing their crypto in cold wallets. That sentiment feeds the narrative that banks have nothing to offer the crypto industry in terms of infrastructure, risk-assessment mechanisms and regulatory compliance.  Eric Sumner is the content chief at ReBlonde, a tech PR firm specializing in blockchain and Web3. Based in Tel Aviv, he’s a former editor for The Jerusalem Post.  The idea that SVB and the like somehow incriminate the entire banking industry and prove crypto works better couldn’t be further from the truth. Crypto cold storage is hardly an alternative to banking.  The reality is SVB seems to have made some bad Treasury bets, having failed to predict the inflation-induced interest rates we’re seeing now when it bought government bonds. That led to a massive bank run that will have ripple effects throughout tech, but it doesn’t as of now indicate wrongdoing on SVB’s part. That stands in stark contrast to FTX, for example, having straight up reallocated investors’ funds without disclosure and losing all their money. The same goes for Celsius Network and countless other crypto companies.  Crypto’s mission as an industry is to offer an alternative financial landscape that corrects for the mistakes of banks. Yet, ironically, too many founders replicate TradFi’s flaws in a blockchain setting because they refuse to learn the lessons banks have already learned from their own past mistakes.  There are a few clear reasons for that. Most notably, most crypto leaders come from a tech, rather than finance, background, and haven't put much of their youth into studying the history of finance to date. So enthralled by the beauty of blockchain as a technology, such founders forget that banks are actually quite good at what they do. Banks are effective at doing things like leveraging assets and assessing risk. Banks are also transparent about the fact that they lend out your money when they do.  See also: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite 'Too Big to Big to Fail' | Opinion  Instead of recreating entire financial ecosystems from scratch, crypto projects should build on the things banks already do well. From there, they can pinpoint the problems and focus on solving those.  Top-down regulation works better than bottom-up trust  Some founders also miss the fact that regulation can work quite well. One of the main themes of the Obama-era financial reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act was an attempt to restrict the ability of banks to take risks using public money. While there is still debate over the overall efficacy of the Wall Street reform, industry leaders broadly agree capital requirements and stress tests are effective, according to a Grant Thornton survey.  The introduction of certain blockchain features and products introduces crypto-specific regulatory questions, such as how to classify different kinds of digital assets and how to address the issue of cold wallets. But the conceptual approach to regulating crypto already exists in laws like Dodd-Frank. Just as there is no need to reinvent TradFi practices that already work, there’s no need to start regulatory ideation from scratch.  Part of the challenge, however, is that much of the crypto regulatory framework in the works was crafted with the input of FTX’s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. As such, it will be hard for regulators to determine which parts are genuine and which were designed to give FTX a competitive edge.  The truth is while SVB has taken over the news cycle, we’re still feeling the aftershocks of FTX and there are still questions that need to be answered. There are rules in place to prevent blatant fraud, but crypto companies do not always comply.  In its early days crypto was often compared to the Wild West. These days it looks more like an overgrown lawn in that it has experienced immense growth without the regulation to match, so it’s hard to follow the plot. That’s precisely why it’s important to recognize regulation is the only way to clean up the industry.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced last month it’s considering a proposal to crack down on qualified crypto custodians to prevent foul play. Chair Gary Gensler even used Bernie Madoff and the 2008 financial crisis to justify the crackdown.  The next generation of crypto leaders should welcome that proposal and take a genuine approach to the regulation process. Supporting legitimate regulatory measures doesn’t mean bribing politicians behind closed doors to write the industry a blank check to do whatever it wants. That’s not real regulation, and certainly not the kind of approach that shaped Dodd-Frank and the like.  See also: Should I Keep My Money in Bitcoin or a Bank? | Opinion  The naive sentiment that prevailed in crypto circles during the industry’s early days, that individuals can perform the same financial actions they would in a bank only minus the intermediary and minus the regulation, has simply been proven wrong. Businesses exist to earn maximum profit. The fact that a company happens to use blockchain doesn’t change that, and it won’t prevent shady practices if there aren’t any legal consequences.  Crypto has branded itself as the alternative to TradFi, and yet too many platforms seem to be building dollar-store TradFi knockoffs that don’t play by the rules. If founders can start by addressing that, then maybe crypto can start seriously talking about challenging the big banks.

42411020,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB3dx,1678893920,Uniswap's NFT Platform Shows DeFi's Reluctant Acceptance of Centralization,"In November, the most popular decentralized exchange on the planet, Uniswap, launched a non-fungible token (NFT) trading platform. The new marketplace didn’t list NFTs directly but instead scraped the tokens from all over the market.  Then, Uniswap presented the NFTs on its site so the financial institutions and precocious children who dominate the platform could trade any picture, video or Mp3 file logged on the Ethereum blockchain in one handy place.  Robert Stevens is a freelance journalist whose work has appeared in The Guardian, the Associated Press, the New York Times and Decrypt. He is also a graduate of Oxford University's Internet Institute. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Culture Week.""  One thing stuck out almost immediately after launch. In its first month of trading Uniswap’s decentralized aggregator overwhelmingly redirected trades from two of the most popular NFT marketplaces: the very centralized OpenSea and the slightly more decentralized NFT trading platform LooksRare. Most of the trades then came from OpenSea, a platform so centralized that one rogue employee was charged with insider trading in June 2022.  It might seem strange for a decentralized exchange’s (DEX) first dip into NFTs to rely so heavily on centralized marketplaces, where employees and founders are free to run the platforms in the same way that feudal lords command small fiefdoms.  After all, Uniswap launched four and a half years ago with the purpose of cutting out the need for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, like Binance or Coinbase. The DEX allowed traders to swap coins on-chain by having other Uniswap users fund large liquidity pools, then relying on algorithms to rebalance the prices of cryptocurrencies held within them. The platform has since processed over a trillion dollars worth of trades and is steadily eating away at the market dominance of centralized exchanges.  Despite the culture shock, Uniswap doesn’t consider its integration of centralized marketplaces into its new NFT marketplace a major roadblock to its mission of decentralized trading. “We're only acting as a wrapper around these marketplaces,” Scott Gray, Uniswap’s head of NFT product, told CoinDesk in an interview at launch.  Uniswap has also taken some pains to protect its users from the perils of centralized control. If a customer buys an NFT on Uniswap that comes from a centralized marketplace, Uniswap only hands the NFT to the customer after receiving it from the marketplace.  Indeed, far from compromising Uniswap’s ideal of decentralization, Gray said linking up centralized marketplaces solved a problem that has long plagued the NFT market: “the fragmentation of liquidity across marketplaces.” It’s not very “capital efficient,” he said, to split NFTs across different marketplaces. “If you're not seeing all listings, you're not getting the floor.”  By supporting listings from all marketplaces, “no matter their royalty stance or their fee structure,” Gray said the outcome is better for customers. He added the aim is for Uniswap to become a platform that puts “all the options in front of the consumer” so that “the consumer can easily decide which marketplaces they support.” That “allows for everyone to create their own preference schedule and have the community decide what they value,” he said.  It’s a lofty goal, and one that hadn’t initially paid off. Uniswap’s new NFT platform generated a cumulative trading volume of just $2.5 million about a month after launching, according to one Dune Analytics dashboard. Since then, that figure has only grown to $7.8 million – while other NFT marketplaces like Blur shot off like a rocket.  Uniswap’s NFT venture’s slow start may be down to timing. NFTs took off in 2020 after convincing traders of the necessity of property rights to virtual plots of land or one-of-a-kind renditions of an infinitely reproducible Internet meme.  Demand spun out of control in 2021, with Axie Infinity’s monster NFTs generating billions of dollars in sales revenues and sparking cottage industries in struggling economies just to farm the tokens. Rare Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunk NFTs frequently sold for millions of dollars, often to celebrities, including Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon.  When the wider crypto market bottomed out following a cascade of failures of top protocols and companies toward the end of 2021, NFTs stopped being so cool. That prompted trading volumes to dwindle and led many of the celebrities who had championed the technology to cast aside their new digital personas in favor of the next big thing.  But Uniswap still saw value in the market, and acquired NFT aggregation app Genie in the summer of 2022, then incorporated its tech into its own platform.  Gray, Uniswap’s head of NFT product, was Genie’s old CEO. He has been tasked with spearheading the new marketplace’s development. While few people are using the marketplace, it is certainly pretty and is easy to use.  NFTs are neatly separated into collections, and customers are provided with the opportunity to select which marketplaces are included in their search for the perfect JPEG. It also has a “sweep” feature so traders can buy several NFTs at once. Plus, all the various fees and royalty payments that dig into a customer’s wallet are baked into a single final fee.  Uniswap added to Gray’s work by incorporating two new pieces of technology. The first is called Permit2, a contract for approving tokens that Uniswap claims will make smart contracts more secure and lower transaction fees. The second, Universal Router, lets users buy NFTs from different marketplaces in a single transaction saving gas fees.  See also: NFTs Are Securities and It's Great | Opinion  “The game plan now is really tapping into all forms of liquidity,” Gray said, and to deliver better prices and more listings. Ultimately, he wants Uniswap to be “the interface for all NFT liquidity out there,” he said.  ApeCoinDAO’s first-party marketplace for Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs might provide one way forward. It allows for direct listings on its marketplace, then undercuts fees if traders buy and sell direct listings instead of those aggregated from other marketplaces. But that marketplace, too, has produced lackluster volumes.  While all this aggregation is certainly innovative, NFT strategists may have to solve an obvious problem many fresh faces in the space haven’t had to deal with before: how to convince people to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on JPEGs of memes and monkeys?",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/15/uniswaps-nft-platform-shows-defis-reluctant-acceptance-of-centralization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97517f49568d980b7a61b6455598c2fdcec14aed-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387902,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwCSr,1678891065,"What Is Cross River Bank, USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle’s New Partner?","Cross River Bank – a venture capital-backed, FDIC-insured regional bank in New Jersey that’s part financial institution and part fintech – has an increased profile in crypto circles thanks to the collapses of crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in under a week. The latter seemingly (but didn’t) lost its real-time payment infrastructure SigNet, forcing customer and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle to find another way to quickly settle its payments. On Sunday, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire announced a new partnership with Cross River for automated settlements.  The bank collapses came at a particularly vulnerable time for a crypto industry trapped in an extended winter. Last year there were a number of headline-grabbing scandals, including the liquidity crisis and bankruptcy filing of multi-billion-dollar crypto exchange FTX. The collapses will also increase regulatory scrutiny of remaining crypto-friendly banks, with a particular eye on potentially thin balance sheets.  “Regulators who tend to fight the last war are certainly on guard right now – looking at banks, including Cross River, to make sure that they are sufficiently capitalized,” Jay Ritter, Cordell professor of finance at the University of Florida, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Read more: Banking Crisis in U.S. Likely to Push Crypto Firms Offshore  What is Cross River?  Founded in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in 2008, Cross River has grown to $9.9 billion in assets and has originated more than $100 billion in loans, according to its website. The state-chartered bank has the regulatory and compliance infrastructure to originate loans – unlike most traditional fintechs – and financial infrastructure like the Real-Time Payment system, which can facilitate crypto-to-fiat conversions at all hours, among other use cases.  A number of venture capital firms were exposed to the three bank collapses, and Cross River might seem like a natural move considering its ties to some top venture capital (VC) players. In 2017, the bank raised $28 million in a funding round backed by noted investors Battery Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Ribbit Capital. An approximately $100 million round was announced the following year, with $75 million of the total coming from an equity investment from global investment giant KKR. Battery Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Ribbit Capital returned as backers.  However, bank runs that took out Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were partly due to the role traditional tech companies played among the bank's clients, which have become a higher-risk asset in this high-interest-rate environment. Cross River Bank also has deep tech exposure, providing financial infrastructure for the likes of Coinbase and Stripe and originating loans for fintechs such as buy now, pay later service Affirm.  How we got here  While the collapse of crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank had been telegraphed by the firm’s inability to file a financial statement due to concerns of its independent auditors and accounting firm, the demise of Silicon Valley Bank – popular in both crypto and general tech circles – was more sudden. That bank run helped inspire one at Signature Bank, which collapsed days later.  “Where Silicon Valley Bank got into trouble is that they had a mismatch in the duration of their assets and liabilities,” explained Ritter. “They invested a fair amount in longer-maturity Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and when interest rates went up [the bonds] fell in value. But bank accounting allows them to keep a lot of that on their balance sheet at historical cost, not representing current market value.”  “But that doesn’t mean that regulators can’t pay attention to current market value and see how much of the equity capital has been wiped out If those securities were marked to market,” he continued. “I’m sure with Cross River Bank, that’s one of the things that regulators will be looking at to make sure that it didn’t fall into the same problem that SVB did with basically gambling on interest rates and losing,” he added.  Regulatory scrutiny  Cross River isn’t the only bank that crypto companies are considering for payment infrastructure. Circle has moved its USDC reserves to BNY Mellon. Tribe Capital managing partner Boris Revsin, in an email to CoinDesk, mentioned Arizona-based Western Alliance Bank as one of the “innovative banks” that can still offer payment infrastructure to crypto firms. Any bank that steps in to fill the void will have more attentive eyes turned in its direction.  “Everybody has viewed the crypto space as relatively risky due to the high incidence of fraud and crypto theft that there has been. FTX certainly raised the regulatory scrutiny there,” said Ritter. “Regulators are going to be looking at banks in terms of that interest rate exposure and the crypto exposure. And I think it's pretty hard for a bank right now to hide things as compared to a week ago.”  CoinDesk reached out to Cross River for comment but had not received a response by publication time.

42387904,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQwCgt,1678889621,Crypto Winter Ends Era of Bitcoin Mining ‘HODLers’,"The last publicly listed bitcoin miner to pursue a 100% “HODL” strategy since the bull market, Hut 8 Mining (HUT), said last week that it finally gave in and sold 188 bitcoins in February to fund operations.  Miners in general have found it difficult to raise funds for operations, including in the form of capital in public markets, amid a slide in the broader financial market and narrowing margins. Some of the miners that opted to hold onto their mined bitcoin (BTC) through the last bull market and into this bear cycle are now starting to sell the coins, mostly to pay for their daily operating expenses.  Hut 8 hadn’t sold any bitcoin since January 2021, leaving it with 9,242 BTC at the end of February, after the sale. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), for its part, sold bitcoin for the first time in January, after it indicated that it would. Marathon still held 11,392 bitcoin in reserve as of the end of February.  Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton had previously said the company would sell bitcoin so that it could complete a merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp.  Read more: Shares of Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 Slump on Merger With US Bitcoin Corp.  A matter of time  “It was only a matter of time before these companies needed to be a little more careful with their cash on hand,” given rising interest rates and other obstacles, said Chris Brendler, an analyst at D.A. Davidson who covers the bitcoin mining industry.  Holding onto a reserve of bitcoin that miners produce can be very expensive. As other types of financing became less available, the companies had to sell what they mined to fund operations and growth.  “When the market was at its peak, public bitcoin miners were aggressively funding operations of existing assets and growth capital with equity issuances, which the market supported (or overlooked),” said Kerri Langlais, chief strategy officer at bitcoin miner TeraWulf (WULF).  Marathon Digital spokesman Charlie Schumacher said miners that held onto their bitcoin were getting “brownie points” from both investors who saw a ballooning balance sheet and the bitcoin community that is long on bitcoin.  But Langlais said that during the bear market, the practice of holding bitcoin resulted in “tremendous dilution” for shareholders while the price of bitcoin and mining stocks dropped. Eventually, investors were no longer willing to support companies’ strategy of “growth at any cost” or holding mined bitcoin, while funding operating losses with equity, she said.  At the same time, the prolonged bear market resulted in the bankruptcies of some large-scale miners, including Compute North and Core Scientific, as well as in debt restructurings by some other miners to keep their operations going.  Read more: Compute North’s Reorganization Plan Approved by Bankruptcy Judge  “The example of debt-laden bitcoin miners going through bankruptcy protection or debt restructuring” contributed to the decision to sell bitcoin reserves, said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, a business started by BlocksBridge Consulting to provide research and data on crypto mining.  Tim Rainey, treasurer at bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation (GREE), said that the trend was likely kicked off by “the decrease in hash price [mining profitability]” and “the need for liquidity during the bear market to fund operations and other obligations.”  The liquidation of bitcoin holdings was particularly strong in June 2022, when miners sold 14,200 bitcoins, according to Zhao’s analysis. Roughly half of that was from now-bankrupt Core Scientific. Since then, miners tracked by Zhao have been selling 5,000 to 7,000 bitcoins per month, more than twice as many as they were selling between January and May 2022.  Timing is everything  Even though the writing was on the wall for miners selling off their holdings, timing the sale is crucial to maximize the benefit.  Core Scientific started offloading its massive bitcoin holdings in June 2022, when the price of bitcoin started dropping from around $40,000. According to Zhao, the miner could have earned $144 million more if it had started selling in January, instead of waiting for the market to start crashing in May.  Many miners and investors were forced to sell their bitcoin last year, but Marathon wanted to ensure that when it started selling, it was clear to the outside world that it was making “a conscious choice that had to do with treasury management and building the business,” Schumacher, the spokesman, said.  Marathon wanted to be “producing at a high enough capacity and had a good line of sight into our bitcoin production” in order to feel comfortable to sell, he said. The miner first started selling its mined bitcoin in January of this year to cover its operating expenses.  Impairment implications  Greenidge’s Rainey expects miners to report “large non-cash impairment losses for both digital asset holdings and other mining related assets, including miners and infrastructure” in upcoming earnings reports.  Riot Platforms (RIOT), one of the largest firms in the crypto mining industry, reported $147.4 million in non-cash impairments in cryptocurrencies for 2022, compared with $36.5 million the year before. Similarly, Hut 8 took a $113.9 million loss on mining equipment during 2022. The price of mining rigs roughly follows crypto prices.  Zhao expects more miners to “stick to a hybrid strategy until maybe whenever the bull returns. But then the question is will they become 100% holders and repeat the same again?”  Read more: Bitcoin Miners Are Starting to Emerge From Brutal Crypto Winter",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/15/crypto-winter-ends-era-of-bitcoin-mining-hodlers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/796fe59895f5d3ceed5de093ced6ca9aaeec9d59-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412638,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5g36,1678888800,VC-Backed NFT Social Platform Metalink Launches Mobile App,"Non-fungible token (NFT) portfolio management and social platform Metalink has launched its mobile application, creating what it says is a token-gated space where NFT collectors can interact with one another, aggregate announcements and track their portfolio performance. The app also plans to launch a transaction functionality later this year so users can buy, sell and swap digital assets.  The all-in-one NFT app is now available on the Apple App Store and serves as a complement to Metalink's website, which has already connected with 100,000 crypto wallets. The platform was launched in August 2021 as a private chat app for CryptoPunks collectors and expanded to include official chatrooms for other blue-chip NFT projects such as Bored Ape Yacht Club.  ""Our goal was to make it incredibly easy for anyone to quickly and safely chat with holders of any collection in their portfolio,"" said Metalink's head of product, Adam Ceresko. ""With Metalink, you simply connect your wallet and start typing. Token holders only, one chat per collection. No Discord, Telegram or verification bots.""  Metalink also announced a previously undisclosed $6 million seed round with funding from an impressive list of venture capital funds and Web3 personalities. Investors include Guy Oseary, Gary Vaynerchuk, MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright, The Sandbox founder Sebastien Borget, former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan, DJ Justin Blau, Social Capital, Arrington Capital and Sound Ventures. NFT collectors including Cozomo de Medici, Gmoney, Seedphrase, SobyLife, Tony Herrera, Meltem Demirors and Farokh, as well as corporate investors Gemini Frontier Fund, Dapper Labs' venture arm, BallerVC, and Genies' Human Ventures also provided funding.  The Metalink app is intended to simplify the fragmented process for trading NFTs and building community. The platform automatically generated a token-gated chatroom for every NFT collection created on the Ethereum network, and holders can access those chatrooms by connecting their wallets and verifying their assets.  “The vision is to eventually not need to communicate through Web2 messaging apps and separately buy and sell through several different marketplaces,"" said Metalink CEO Jake Udell.  Metalink also pulls live NFT floor price data as well as rarity trait data from multiple marketplaces to help holders accurately gauge the value of their NFT portfolio and track price movements in real-time. In addition, the platform offers aggregated announcements from NFT collection chatrooms, providing users with a scrollable feed of all major updates.  Several startups have been working on ways to simplify the process for NFT collectors, taking popular ideas from Web2 and bringing them into Web3. Metaverse-focused blockchain MultiversX recently launched its xPortal ""super app,"" combining elements of chat, finance and artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, NFT management app Floor recently acquired NFT data platform WGMI.io to build out its portfolio management tools.  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends?

The authorities took down the platform's infrastructure, seizing four servers, 7 terabytes of data and 1909.4 bitcoins (BTC) ($47.7 million), Europol said on Wednesday.  The seizure was also supported by Belgium, Poland and Switzerland.  ChipMixer laundered money for ransomware perpetrators, darknet markets, fraudsters and state-sponsored actors, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  One operator of ChipMixer, Minh Quốc Nguyễn, from Hanoi, Vietnam, was charged on Wednesday in Philadelphia with money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and identity theft, the DOJ said.  The platform is believed to have enabled the laundering of 152,000 BTC – around $3.8 billion at current prices – since 2017, a large share of which was connected to ransomware groups, illicit goods trafficking and child sexual exploitation.  According to the DOJ, activities enabled by ChipMixer include over $700 million in bitcoin associated with wallets designated as stolen funds, including those related to heists by North Korean cyber actors, and bitcoin used by the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) to purchase infrastructure for Linux-based malware Drovorub.  Mixing services gained increased prominence in August 2022 when Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control for facilitating North Korea’s money-laundering operations. Shortly after that, Tornado Cash’s web developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested.

42412651,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5gFG,1678883183,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Falls Back to Below $25K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin has retreated to below $25,000 after reaching a nine- month high on Tuesday at about $26,500. The rise for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value came minutes after the U.S. Consumer Price Index was released. The index showed that the rate of inflation is slowing down. Meanwhile, altcoins continue to rally, with stacks (STX) taking the lead. It is up 36% over the past 24 hours. The IMX token for Immutable X, a layer 2 scaling tool for non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, surged 30%.  Binance.US' deal to buy the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital for $1 billion should be put on hold while key legal objections are ironed out, the U.S. government said in a filing on Tuesday. The move follows an appeal by the U.S. Trustee, a branch of the Department of Justice responsible for bankruptcy cases, which is concerned that the deal would effectively absolve Voyager and its staff from breaches of tax or securities law.  Anchorage Digital is laying off roughly 20% of its staff, or 75 people, because of the slide in the prices of digital assets, according to a report from Bloomberg. The institutional crypto platform and parent company of Anchorage Digital Bank, the first federally chartered crypto bank in the U.S., told Bloomberg that regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. played a role in its decision to cut staff.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin's weekly chart shows the cryptocurrency is again struggling to establish a foothold above $25,000, which capped gains last month and in August 2022.  According to chartered market technician Aksel Kibar, a breakout above $25,000 would shift focus to the next hurdle at $28,600.  ""The challenge for BTCUSD is the immediate strong resistance at $28,600 after $25,000. The ideal condition is to break $25,000 with momentum so that it clears $28,600 in one shot,"" Kibar noted.

42412652,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5gEK,1678881717,Bitcoin Options Market Still Afraid of USDC Volatility,"USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Financial, regained its dollar peg on Monday, recovering from the Silicon Valley Bank-induced chaos over the weekend that saw its price plummet to 90 cents on major exchanges.  The re-pegging, however, hasn't calmed nerves in bitcoin's (BTC) derivatives market, where Deribit-listed options contracts settled in BTC trade at a higher implied volatility premium than Bybit's contracts paid in USDC.  That's a sign of investor preference for contracts settled in native cryptocurrencies, according to crypto derivatives analytics firm Block Scholes.  ""Whilst USDC has now recovered its peg to trade at $0.99, the [positive] spread of Deribit option- to Bybit option-implied volatility persists,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at Block Scholes, wrote in a research note on Tuesday.  ""The discrepancy is present across the term structure and is most dramatic at longer tenors [longer duration options]. This suggests that the market is still valuing options that settle in the underlying (rather than USDC) at a relative premium due to a continued concern of a further depeg,"" Melville added.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while the put option offers the right to sell.  Implied volatility refers to the options market's expectations for price turbulence over a specific period. Higher implied volatility represents increased demand and prices for options. Volatility term structure is the graphical representation ofhow options of the same underlying asset exhibit different implied volatilities across different expiration months.  Bybit and Deribit calculate the payoff or profit/loss from the options trade, referencing the dollar value of the underlying asset (BTC). At Deribit, however, the actual settlement is paid in bitcoin, while Bybit uses USDC. Settlement refers to resolving the contract between trading parties through exchange of cash or actual underlying asset.  That exposes Bybit-based options traders to volatility in USDC. Besides, a potential crash in the stablecoin would make Bybit's options worthless.  ""The brief depeg of USDC tokens to $0.90 meant that options on Bybit would be settled at around 90% of their stated payoff in dollar terms. The market was slow to price for this difference, briefly continuing to price both option-types at the same level of implied volatility,"" Melville said.  The spread between the seven-day implied volatility derived from Deribit and Bybit-listed options surged over the weekend and has remained elevated ever since.  ""Although the decoupling crisis between USDC and USD has been temporarily lifted, investors are unwilling to take systemic risks, so [options] buyers will seek lower premiums in the far-end options,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/15/bitcoin-options-market-still-afraid-of-usdc-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a20d3dd50bada55d679fc6c00205c303ed0a7d75-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412649,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5gDO,1678879800,MEV Rewards on Ethereum Reach All-Time High During SVB Bank Run and USDC Depeg,"Last Friday’s Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse and subsequent contagion around what that means for the crypto industry drove a dramatic increase in the profitability for validators who run the Ethereum network.  As the tech industry blew up over the weekend, Ethereum validators saw profits from MEV (maximal extractable value) spike as the bank collapsed and as stablecoin USDC depegged from $1, according to data about Flashbots, which supplies the software responsible for 89% of all MEV activity.  MEV is a central component as part of trading on the Ethereum protocol. MEV refers to the additional profits that validators earn as a result of inserting or reordering transactions within a block. Some have compared MEV similar to arbitrage in traditional markets.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The main way that Ethereum validators can get MEV is through MEV-Boost, a software developed by Flashbots that allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders. Validators get these blocks from MEV-Boost through relays to earn MEV. Because 89% of validators use MEV-Boost to add blocks to the blockchain, and Flashbots has relayed most of those blocks, most of the data reflecting MEV activity is reflected in their numbers.  After regulators shut down SVB, stablecoin issuer Circle confirmed late on Friday that $3.3 billion in cash deposits remained at the bank, or about 8% of the total reserves backing its stablecoin USDC, causing the stablecoin to depeg from its 1:1 ratio with the U.S, dollar. Consequently, users rushed to cash out their USDC or move their crypto.  As the news of one of the largest stablecoin issuers in the crypto industry riled the markets, the movement of people’s crypto meant that there were more transactions available to generate MEV profits.  During this time, users of Flashbots’ MEV-Boost relay raked in a peak of 7,691 ETH in rewards worth about $13 million on March 11. This was more than twice as high as the last peak, which occurred during the FTX blowup on Nov. 9 when MEV rewards earned with Flashbots were 3,202 ETH or $5.5 million.  By March 12, MEV profits significantly decreased to regular levels, with MEV rewards via Flashbots bringing in 2,282 ETH. The calming in the movement of transactions probably came after the announcement that Circle would cover any shortfall in USDC reserves, leading to USDC regaining its peg.  Toni Wahrstätter, an Ethereum researcher who created a Flashbots MEV-monitoring dashboard, told CoinDesk, “In times of extremely high MEV, it's good to know that the MEV rewards mostly end up with the validators, who don't have to run complex algorithms, engage in private deals or anything but just be lucky while securing the Ethereum blockchain.”  Some Ethereum users that ran their own validators noted the gigantic increase in MEV over the weekend, hoping they could have their own share of the MEV rewards.  Whenever there is massive news that affects financial markets, prices of coins move quickly and create opportunities for profit. Ethereum validators are no different when it comes to profiting off the contagion of ordinary bank runs.

42412663,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5g5u,1678879631,Bitcoin Isn’t Trading as a Currency but as a Speculative Asset: Morgan Stanley,"As concerns mount about traditional banks following the forced closures in the U.S., this should be bitcoin’s (BTC) “moment to shine” because holders of the largest cryptocurrency in private wallets should be protected from counterparty risk, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Monday.  Morgan Stanley notes that bitcoin was designed as a way for people to hold value in a private digital wallet without the need for an intermediary to store the value for them or to enable transactions.  In practice, “bitcoin isn't isolated from the traditional banking system” because its price is supported by “USD bank liquidity, making it trade as a speculative asset rather than a currency,” the report said.  “Crypto prices rose quickly in 2020/21 due to central bank monetary expansion, causing capital to move from the traditional fiat banking world to the crypto world,” analysts Sheena Shah and Kinji C Steimetz wrote.  While the Bitcoin network can operate without banks, BTC’s price, and therefore its purchasing power, continues to be influenced by Federal Reserve policy, and it needs banks to facilitate flows into the cryptocurrency market, Morgan Stanley said  Bitcoin’s reaction to the negative news flow changed in recent days, rising almost 20% on Monday after the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department said they would support the banking sector, the note said. However, last week, at the height of uncertainty, bitcoin fell along with risk assets and bank stocks, trading as a speculative asset.  “If bitcoin had been trading on its core value proposition – the ability to ‘be your own bank’ – then bitcoin would have rallied with rising bank uncertainty,” the note added.  Price action indicated the rally earlier in the week was driven by a small number of market participants and was likely helped by a short squeeze as opposed to a “fundamental shift in the trading dynamic,” the report added.  Shorting is a way of betting that the price of an asset will decline. An investor borrows a security and sells it in the hope that the price will drop. They then repurchase the security and return it to the lender, pocketing the difference in price. A short squeeze occurs when an asset gains in price and investors positioned short are forced to cover their positions for a loss.

The passage has been edited to reflect that it is unclear whether that account belonged to Suex, because a typo in the handle suggests it does not.  The Russian branch of Transparency International, a global anti-corruption nongovernmental organization (NGO), found at least eight over-the-counter (OTC) brokers in Moscow that can sell you tens of thousands dollars in stablecoins for cash and then exchange it in the U.K for pounds sterling – all for cash and without know-your-customer (KYC) paperwork.  In findings shared with CoinDesk, Transparency said it focused on the U.K. because the country has long been a favorite destination for Russian money stashed abroad. That includes Russian firms raising capital investment and Russian oligarchs, like Roman Abramovich, parking their savings in elaborate houses and soccer clubs.  Moving money between Russia and the rest of the world has become more problematic since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.  After February 2022, the U.S. and European countries moved to isolate Russia from the global financial system to stifle the money flows helping Russia finance its invasion. A big part of that was cutting most Russian banks off from the international inter-bank money transferring system, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT.  Read more: Anna Baydakova - Coins of War: How Crypto Keeps Feeding Russia's War Despite Sanctions  A handful of Russian banks still can do currency transfers in the SWIFT system, according to the Russian financial news website Banki.ru. But the list does not include the largest banks in the country. Those that still have access to the global system often see their transactions held up with delays, reports show. Foreign banks often subject such transfers to additional checks – sometimes for months.  In addition to that, the European Union last fall banned Russian citizens from European crypto services.  Nevertheless, there are still ways to move tens of thousands in cash across the Russian border without declaring them at customs control. For instance, you could buy the tether (USDT) stablecoin for cash in Moscow and then selling it for cash in London. No registration, no identity verification, no licenses, no guarantees.  Moving the money  The first step is to buy USDT, the largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin by market cap, at one of the cash OTC offices in Moscow City, the Russian capital’s cluster of luxury business centers. Then, you need to find OTCs that offer to buy your USDT for pounds sterling.  Transparency found eight such brokers and learned they would process $10,000 and more in crypto: Pridechange, Bitokk, Alfa.exchange, Finex24, Mychange, 24ExPay, Trust-exchange and the sanctioned OTC Suex, which, according to Transparency, keeps operating.  Posing as a prospective client, Transparency researchers texted what appeared to be the Suex official account on Telegram and received a response that it can sell 15,000 USDT for cash in London, for a 1.5% fee. The seller would need to send USDT first and receive cash within five hours from an anonymous courier.  Egor Petukhovsky, Suex's founder, told CoinDesk that Suex ceased operations on Sept. 21, 2021. He said he didn’t know who had access to the Telegram account of the firm.  Telegram users can change names of their accounts and it’s hard to tell who is the actual owner of a certain username. It is possible that Transparency has been talking to a Suex impersonator, because the account billed as the official Suex account contained an easy-to-miss typo:Suex_officlal (with an “l” where the second “i” should be).  Other brokers offer similar terms: commission between 1% and 3%, and same-day delivery in an agreed location in London. Clients need to send a photo of any banknote with a serial number and show it to a courier when they meet their counterparty. Sometimes, couriers would also ask for a description of a client’s clothing to recognize them on the street, Transparency told CoinDesk. But no ID is required.  Transparency’s researchers identified 15 crypto wallet addresses belonging to the OTC firms. According to Transparency’s calculations, the most active wallets received and sent out $420,000-$470,000 a month.  CoinDesk looked into the wallets Transparency identified. They mostly sent funds to several crypto exchanges: Huobi, Binance, WhiteBit and two Russian exchanges, MEXC and Garantex (sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2022), according to the Crystal Blockchain analytics firm.  For example, Trust-exchange is an OTC offering to redeem USDT for euros in Prague, in the Czech Republic, Transparency learned. The USDT wallet Trust-exchange provided processed more than $3.7 million since last April, according to the blockchain data.  Alfa.exchange, whose wallet processed over $1.8 million in USDT since October, offers a broad range of options for cash deals.

When a Transparency researcher asked about a delivery location in London, the firm suggested meeting a courier in London’s Norbury area, at a local gym.  Other OTCs that offered pound sterling cashouts include 24ExPay, which has processed more than $7.2 million USDT through its USDT wallet since September 2021, and Pridechange, whose wallet received and sent over $3.7 million since its first transaction in April, 2022.

The previous high of $24.3 billion was in May 2021, when bitcoin (BTC) was worth roughly $65,000 and ether (ETH) $4,400.  Trading activity surged on a wave of panic as USD coin (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin, lost its peg to the dollar following a short-lived banking crisis in the U.S.  The majority of trades took place on decentralized exchange Uniswap, with weekly volume of $31.7 billion. On the Curve protocol, meanwhile, traders rushed to flee USDC – a move that prompted an unbalancing of the protocol's equally weighted stablecoin liquidity pool.  Circle, the company that issues USDC, calmed concerns by reiterating that every USDC token remained backed by one U.S. dollar, despite having $3 billion in exposure to the troubled Silicon Valley Bank.  Volume across the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has remained high in the wake of the depegging with a weekly increase of 255%, according to DefiLlama.

Gordon was among those who made a submission about the Treasury's token mapping consultation paper, released last month, after flying in from London. Token mapping is the process of identifying the key activities and functions of products in the crypto ecosystem and mapping them against existing regulatory frameworks.  “The Australian Treasury’s token mapping exercise is one of the most detailed and thoughtful papers we have seen on the topic, and it sets a strong foundation for their forthcoming draft rules for crypto exchanges and custodians, which we are keen to see later this year,"" Gordon told CoinDesk in an email. ""It’s great the industry is able to engage in this open and transparent regulatory rule-making process.""  The Australian Treasury said it ""maintains stakeholder relationships across all policy areas and meetings are a normal part of consultation.""

CNHC is pegged 1:1 with the offshore yuan, known by its abbreviation CNH to differentiate it from China’s onshore yuan, which goes by CNY. Reserves for the CNH are kept at a Hong Kong depository institution.  “This investment in CNHC is part of KuCoin Ventures' broader strategy of investing in the Web3 infrastructure in the APAC region,” Justin Chou, chief investment officer of KuCoin and lead at KuCoin Ventures, said in a statement. “Hong Kong has a well-established traditional finance ecosystem. With the regulation and new policy for next-generation digital assets, Hong Kong has a real opportunity at becoming the new crypto center of the world.”  CNHC is issued on both Ethereum and Conflux. On-chain data shows that Ethereum has 23 holders of the token and 102 transfers, while Conflux has 606 holders and 1,487 transfers.  Fan Long, co-founder of Conflux, said Conflux is capturing the majority of the volume here because of Conflux’s “regulatory compliance” in China.  “The significance of CNHC stems from its capacity to connect traditional financial systems with the emerging Web3 landscape, especially amid heightened regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “CNHC presents a practical alternative for businesses and users in search of compliant options beyond the U.S.-centric regulatory framework.”  Hunting for a dollar alternative  Stablecoins are overwhelmingly backed by the U.S. dollar. While there are stablecoins based on other world currencies such as the euro, pound, or other dollars like the Australian, Canadian or Singaporean variety, none come close to touching the volume of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins including USDT and USDC.  On one hand, this has only re-enforced U.S. dollar hegemony. The next frontier of finance being denominated in dollars is largely a good thing as it extends U.S. rule making, CoinDesk columnists have argued.  But at the same time, not everyone wants to follow U.S. rules, especially when they have no nexus to the country. Regulators in the U.S. are also hesitant to allow crypto full-fettered access to the American banking system until stringent federal oversight is established.  The market itself is not a fan of the U.S.-centric concentration risk this presents. USDC, knocked off its peg for multiple days during the crypto banking crisis, only recently regained it but the smart money is skeptical.  BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes thinks the answer to all of this is a bitcoin derivatives-based algorithmic stablecoin called the kakaDollar, though the market might be skeptical of the concept after the collapse of Terra last year.  There’s certainly been a successful use case for the CNH in China’s offshore bond market, for bwhich it was built. But crypto is something else entirely.  It’s not without its skeptics.  Alex Liu, CEO of Taipei-based Maicoin, said in a recent interview with CoinDesk the RMB is too tightly controlled on- or offshore for it to work out.  “I think the only real challenge for the U.S. dollar is the RMB. But not through crypto, and not through China’s CBDC,” he said, referring to a central bank digital currency. He said the real focus is oil traded in RMB-denominated contracts. “Most trade between Russia and China has been de-dollarized,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | CFX,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/15/kucoin-has-closed-a-10m-funding-round-into-cnhc-but-is-the-offshore-yuan-right-for-a-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18bdeaa130e87485d78e6912775037a520656efe-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move follows an appeal by the U.S. Trustee, a branch of the Department of Justice responsible for bankruptcy cases, which has concerns the deal would effectively absolve Voyager and its staff from breaches of tax or securities law.  “The Court cannot tell the Government to speak now or forever hold its peace before Voyager and Binance.US wed,” the filing by U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said. “Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code permits courts to exculpate parties from liability to the Government for past and future conduct.”  Williams said approval of the deal should be put on hold – or at least those parts that limit the government’s ability to enforce the law – until appeals are dealt with in higher courts.  Last week, bankruptcy court Judge Michael Wiles in New York approved the deal after showing considerable skepticism about the arguments by the Securities and Exchange Commission that Voyager’s VGX token might be an unregistered security.

42412648,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5gCS,1678860800,"Bitcoin, Ether Volatility Stuns Bears and Bulls Alike; Some Say Recent Price Action Driven by Bank Crisis","Higher-than-usual market volatility affected bulls and bears alike as crypto futures racked up $300 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Bitcoin and ether briefly inched above $26,000 and $1,770 respectively on Tuesday as investors brushed off the long-term effects of a regulatory clampdown on crypto-friendly banks and U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data pointed to slowing inflation in the coming months.  But the euphoria was short-lived as both major tokens dipped as much as 5% from Tuesday’s highs before gradually stabilizing. In Asian morning hours on Wednesday, bitcoin traded just under $25,000 while ether traded slightly over $1,700.  The volatility caused over $140 million in bitcoin futures and $80 million in ether futures to take on losses. Of this, 58% of futures losses came from shorts, or bets against price rises, while the remaining came from longs, or bets on price rises – meaning both short sellers and long traders were hit almost equally.  Among other major tokens, futures on Conflux’s CFX tokens and Filecoin’s FIL had $8 million and $5 million in liquidations, respectively, as trading volumes for both surged on fundamental developments.  Meanwhile, some market observers said the price action came as investors looked for alternative assets following last week’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  “Bitcoin’s rally to a new yearly high as Silicon Valley Bank falls and inflation remains stubborn shows that investors are looking to bitcoin for stability in highly uncertain market conditions,” Alex Adelman, co-founder of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, told CoinDesk.  “While many have looked to bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and tracked its price moves accordingly, bitcoin’s relationship to traditional finance is more complex,” Adelman stated, adding that bitcoin worked as an “alternative to the traditional financial system at large.”  “Weakness across the banking sector has heightened investor awareness of bitcoin’s unique value proposition. In the coming weeks, we will continue to see increased demand for bitcoin as a superior system for holding and moving money securely,” Adelman said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/15/bitcoin-ether-volatility-stuns-bears-and-bulls-alike-some-say-recent-price-action-driven-by-bank-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75e8f337a91a9d38d4bdb576fb5af218b93fe806-1680x945.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos spent another day in the green after an encouraging inflation report and continued hopefulness for a less hawkish Fed.  Insights: The crypto industry must mature to develop productive relationships with banks.

Investor hopes for a less-draconian U.S. central bank continued.  Bitcoin embraced the more upbeat vibe and continued its romp upward for much of Tuesday, rising above $26,000 at one point for the first time since last summer before retreating more than a $1,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $24,936, up about 2% over the past 24 hours. BTC's stall followed two consecutive days of double-digit gains tied to Binance stablecoin conversions, investors' relief that the banking sector would not collapse, and that the Federal Reserve would reverse its steady diet of hawkish interest rate hikes.  On Tuesday, a small decline in the consumer price index (CPI) from 6.4% in January to 6% last month seemed to offer the Fed fresh grounds for monetary dovishness. Even a month-over-month increase in the the core inflation rate, which removes volatile food and energy costs, included a counterweight – a slight annual decline.  “Bitcoin is surging because the liquidity situation appears to be shifting rapidly,"" Joe Ziolkowski, the CEO and co-founder of digital asset insurer Relm Insurance, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""Today’s CPI data shows that inflation is slowing.  Ziolkowski noted that the latest banking crisis involving the collapse of Signature, Silvergate and Silicon Valley banks had ""triggered a federal response, injecting a lot of money in the economy, and strengthened Bitcoin's use case as a decentralized alternative to our existing banking system.""  ""Investors are clearly showing confidence in this,"" he wrote.  Ether was changing hands just above $1,700, about where it stood on Monday, same time. The second-largest cryptocurrency has roughly matched BTC's upswing this week. Other major cryptos spent most of Tuesday healthfully in the green before flattening. APT, the token of layer 1 blockchain Aptos was recently up more than 14%. CRO, the native crypto of crypto exchange Crypto.com, rose about 6%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, climbed 2.4%.  U.S. equity markets also took heart from the CPI report with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumping 2.1% and 1.6%, respectively. But as CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote in his Tuesday column, the Fed's path forward at its March 22 meeting remains uncertain.  Reim's Ziolkowski noted optimistically that ""pressure is now mounting on the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of rate hikes, and perhaps even stop hiking altogether, given that the rapid rate increases over the last year have clearly placed significant stress on the system.""  He added: ""The setup for a durable rally for bitcoin and other digital assets appears to be in play.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +16.9% Entertainment Cosmos ATOM +11.4% Smart Contract Platform Loopring LRC +8.5% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  Crypto Industry's Banking Learning Curve  The voluntary liquidation of Silvergate, crypto’s go-to bank, and subsequent regulator action to seize Silicon Valley Bank sent shockwaves through the industry.  While depositors will be made whole, the shockwaves the industry is feeling are no longer from the concept of funds lost, but rather the loss of industry-friendly banks that were pillars of the sector.  As CoinDesk recently reported, Crypto companies being orphaned by the downfall of Silvergate and Signature as well as the incompetence of Silicon Valley Bank, hurt the industry.  William Quigley, a co-founder of Tether, who now runs the non-fungible token (NFT) exchange WAX, highlighted to CoinDesk in an interview that Silicon Valley Bank’s demise was one based on managerial incompetence.  Holding long-dated, government-issued debt, purchased at a time when interest rates were low, then having to jettison it at fire-sale prices to shore up liquidity when its startup clients stopped raising money and started just spending, was not a great move but should have only been a challenge and not a fatality for banks, he says.  Quigley says that around June 2022 management should have noticed the impairment of its bonds and government securities and moved to sell off the portfolio and take the losses, or bring in more deposits.  “I've been an audit committee chairman and a bank auditor. I know the conversation that happens when deposits are going down at an accelerated rate and our investment portfolio is being impaired to the point where we don’t have enough money to pay off depositors,” he said.  A lack of communication  Management should have been in touch with the Fed in January, and the Fed should have put the bank in some sort of supervisory wind-down then.  The problem that’s going to emerge from this, he says, is a lack of trust. SVB was regulated by multiple federal and state agencies, had a clean audit opinion, and was rated as investment grade by a federally licensed rating agency, making it seem like a good bank.  SVB existed because large banks would typically not give tech startups and crypto companies the time of day.  But that doesn’t mean it's impossible.  As CoinDesk recently reported, crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG) has been having productive conversations with the likes of Santander (SAN), HSBC (HSBA), Deutsche Bank, and United Overseas Bank (UOB) in Singapore, as well as fintechs such as Revolout about onboarding its portfolio companies.  DCG is reportedly having conversations with big banks, but there’s no guarantee that they will come to fruition. These banks might end up spooked by something, and decline to onboard companies orphaned by Silvergate-SVB-Signature. DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.  For roughly the last decade, Taiwanese crypto exchange Maicoin has had fiat on- and off-ramps with Far Eastern International Bank, which would be categorized as a big bank by the Fed.  Alex Liu, the CEO of Maicoin, told CoinDesk there wasn’t really any magic to convincing banks to give his exchange fiat pipelines. He’s also quick to point out that the root cause of these three banks' demise in the U.S. is not crypto itself.  “It involves being able to come across not as a bomb-throwing radical. It helps if you can put on a suit, and talk about things like investor protection, [know your customer/anti-money laundering] and so forth,” he said.  It also helps to have a physical address for your headquarters, he continued. Maicoin’s headquarters are in an office tower in downtown Taipei.  “How many crypto companies refuse to do that one thing?” he asks.  Crypto banking issues in Asia?  As all of this occurs, many jurisdictions in Asia, from Hong Kong to Taiwan, are working on building a crypto licensing regime for retail traders.

42393751,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1FV,1678846479,"Crypto Must Do Better to Be Banked, Say Industry Executives","The voluntary liquidation of Silvergate, crypto’s go-to bank, and subsequent regulator action to seize Silicon Valley Bank sent shockwaves through the industry.  While depositors will be made whole, the shockwaves the industry is feeling are no longer from the concept of funds lost, but rather the loss of industry-friendly banks that were pillars of the sector.  Most large, brand-name banks wouldn’t work with a small venture fund, a tech startup, or a crypto company – not to mention an exchange. But Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature saw these as valued clients.  Everyone from OKX’s U.S. exchange OKCoin to CoinDesk itself has been impacted by the demise of these three institutions.  “We're going to struggle with banking for a while,” William Quigley, a Tether co-founder and CEO of non-fungible token exchange WAX, told CoinDesk in an interview. Quigley, who left Tether in 2015, is disappointed with its current management.  Holding long-dated, government-issued debt, purchased when interest rates were low, then having to jettison it at fire-sale prices to shore up liquidity when startup clients stopped raising money and started spending, was not a great move by banks. But this action should have only been a challenge and not a fatality, he says.  “It’s not the first time in the history of Silicon Valley that a weird phenomenon happened,” he said. “Has there ever been a rush of money into a sector, which then goes into [SVB], and gets burned off as the companies are making payroll? It’s literally how the system works!”  Quigley says that around June 2022 someone in management should have noticed and moved to sell off the portfolio and take the losses, or bring in more deposits.  “I've been an audit committee chairman and a bank auditor. I know the conversation that happens when deposits are going down at an accelerated rate and our investment portfolio is being impaired to the point where we don’t have enough money to pay off depositors,” he said.  Management should have been in touch with the Federal Reserve in January, and the Fed should have put the bank in some sort of supervisory wind-down then.  'It’s banking 101'  The problem that’s going to emerge from this, he says, is a lack of trust. SVB was regulated by multiple federal and state agencies, had a clean audit opinion, and was rated as investment grade by a federally licensed rating agency, making it seem like a good bank.  “It’s unfair to expect depositors to know more than all the regulators and regulated entities that reviewed the bank,” he said, pointing out that the U.S. can’t have a “South American” banking environment where minimal funds are kept in the bank because of low institutional trust.  VC and crypto investors prefer working with small, non-systemically important banks due to hesitance from big banks to work with these companies because of regulatory uncertainty, he explained.  But that doesn’t mean it's impossible.  Big banks can onboard crypto companies  For roughly the last decade, Taiwanese crypto exchange Maicoin has had a fiat on- and off-ramp with Far Eastern International Bank, which would be categorized as a big bank by the Fed.  Alex Liu, the CEO of Maicoin, told CoinDesk there wasn’t really any magic to convincing banks to give his exchange fiat pipelines. He’s also quick to highlight that the root cause of these three banks' demise in the U.S. is not crypto itself.  “It involves being able to come across not as a bomb-throwing radical. It helps if you can put on a suit, and talk about things like investor protection, [know your customer/anti-money laundering] and so forth,” he said.  It also helps to have a physical address for your headquarters, he continued. Maicoin’s headquarters are in an office tower in downtown Taipei.  “How many crypto companies refuse to do that one thing?” he asks.  One of its local competitors is in a neighboring tower, visible from Liu’s office, yet provides an address on business cards for an off-shore jurisdiction.  Liu also says that a big part of getting banking access was respecting the idea of equivalence.  This means anything from ensuring that you are compliant in any jurisdiction you operate into respecting traditional finance (TradFi) rules that may apply to crypto, too. In Taiwan, for instance, trading futures or options is a licensed activity.  “We know plenty of players that said, ‘Oh, those equivalent rules don't apply to us, because there's nothing on the books that says they apply to us,'"" Liu said. “That could make you a lot of money for a while, but at some point, you’re going to get called on that.”  Will crypto’s US banking problems ricochet to Asia?  As all of this occurs, many jurisdictions in Asia, from Hong Kong to Taiwan, are working on building a crypto licensing regime for retail traders.  Certainly, they will be looking to the U.S. to see what’s going on especially given the last six months, which involved the collapse of FTX, and now three banks.  No regulator or lawmaker in the U.S. has come out and said directly: ""Hey, let’s just ban this thing,"" Liu points out.  Asia regulators are going to take that as a clue.  “The collapse of three banks, two of which are related, will give them a lot to think about as they shape their regulations,” he said. “It’s the stuff of regulator nightmares.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/15/crypto-must-do-better-to-be-banked-say-industry-executives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfa6d7d28e7ef67d02de0e1e987478df9309c018-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412669,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5iZK,1678842000,Blockchain Firm RockX Unveils Institutional Liquid Staking Platform,"RockX, a Singapore-based blockchain company, is looking to attract institutional investors to liquid staking with its new service, Bedrock.  As well as offering staking services to retail customers, Bedrock offers institutional-grade know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance to institutions looking to stake more than 32 ether (ETH)($57,000), RockX said in an email Wednesday.  The company is initially targeting exchanges and wealth management platforms, with a view to attracting large funds and banking institutions further down the line, founder and CEO Chen Zhuling told CoinDesk in an interview. Crypto trading firm Amber Group, a RockX investor, will be one of Bedrock's first clients.  Staking is a means of earning yield on digital assets, in which crypto holders can lock up their tokens to secure proof-of-stake blockchains in exchange for a reward. With liquid staking, investors keep their capital liquid and use their staked tokens as collateral by receiving derivatives.  Last month, liquid staking became the second-largest crypto sector when its total value of assets locked reached $14.1 billion, surpassing the $13.7 billion held on decentralized lending and borrowing protocols. Liquid staking platform Lido Finance has become decentralized finance's largest protocol with about $10 billion worth of digital assets locked on the platform.  The catalyst for liquid staking is the Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai upgrade, which will allow stakers to withdraw the ether (ETH) they have staked and for which they have accumulated rewards. The expectation is Shanghai will strengthen ETH by establishing a blueprint for staking protocols and give users more confidence in their sovereignty over their assets.  However, there have been doubts cast on the appetite for liquid staking among financial institutions, particularly in the Asian market closest to RockX. David Cicoria, head of markets technology for digital asset custodian Hex Trust, recently said institutions are giving it a miss due to risks of depegging, hacks and lack of regulatory clarity.  Zhuling agreed institutions do hold some of these concerns, but stressed the important distinction between custodial and non-custodial staking services. Bedrock falls under the latter.  ""We are not holding any ETH at all. All the ETH is held in a smart contract and then deployed to validators,"" he said.  ""It's very easy to tally how many coins are held in the pool and thence being passed on to validators, so there is no risk of inflation of the numbers or misappropriation of assets,"" he added.

42412674,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5id4,1678840823,"Circle USDC Rebounds From Depegging, but Stablecoin Observers See an Uncertain Future","Circle-issued USDC’s s inability to hold its peg against the U.S. dollar three days ago sent investors fleeing.  Circle has removed about 3.9 billion USDC from the circulating supply since last Friday, with the current circulating supply at 39.5 billion USDC, Messari data shows. Circle has still minted new coins, adding to the circulation, but much fewer than it burned.  “It’s likely to take some time before market participants feel comfortable parking their holdings in any stablecoin over long periods of time,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email.  The drop in USDC supply started as the stablecoin issuer’s ties to embattled Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) became apparent, and the banking industry seemed to be nearing a meltdown. Circle confirmed on Friday that it had $3.3 billion of its reserves tied to SVB, and its price against the dollar plunged to 87 cents on the Kraken exchange early Saturday – far lower than it sunk when crypto exchange FTX’s collapse sent markets reeling. USDC has subsequently regained its peg and Circle has said it would transfer the reserves to BNY Mellon.  A report from crypto data firm Kaiko noted that the USDC-U.S. dollar trading pairs on centralized exchanges (CEX), which offer real-time exchange rates into the dollar, pushed the daily trade volume to an all-time high of $600 million on Saturday. By comparison, the daily average trade volume ranged between $20 million-$40 million in the prior week.  More of the trades have come on CEXs, which “could not support the influx in sell volume, which caused USDC’s exchange rate to nosedive,” Kaiko said.  Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges (DEX) Uniswap and Curve processed record-high trade volumes over the weekend amid depegging as traders rushed to swap USDC for ether (ETH) and tether (USDT). Curve and Uniswap version 3 processed nearly $6 billion in volume of the USDC-USDT pairing, Kaiko’s report showed.  The dollar depegging has also created “countless arbitrage opportunities” in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, with Aave and Compound receiving more than $2 billion in repayments, mostly in USDC, as borrowers repay loans at a discount, according to Kaiko.  Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey told CoinDesk via Twitter message that concerns about USDC will “hang over markets for a long time.”  He added that although the urgency to exit USDC has ended, “we likely haven’t seen the end of USDC redemptions yet. This is also complicated by the fact that there isn’t really any widely adopted alternative to USDC, meaning a centralized, DeFi-focused stablecoin.”  On Monday, in a weekly newsletter, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at digital asset investment firm Arca, wrote that “likely one-fourth or half of USDC assets under management” – worth around $10-$20 billion – will be redeemed. He also suggested that USDC could rebound.  “Even though USDC is itself backed by real assets, those assets are held by Circle, Coinbase and a lazy susan of exploding banks,” Dorman wrote. “If USDC passes this stress test, it’ll likely grow assets again over time.”  Data provider Coin Metrics wrote in a weekly newsletter that the USDC event has highlighted “the risks posed by excessive reliance on centralized infrastructure, and will be certain to inform future decisions.”",NEGATIVE,USDC,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | USDC,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/15/circle-usdc-rebounds-from-de-pegging-but-stablecoin-observers-see-an-uncertain-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6131d1514745a0b912d0c4ce658292a3433ed27-2111x1188.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
