42401850,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2eBx,1535203823,Crypto Isn't Just Money – It's a Defense Against Discrimination,"Sonya Mann works in communications and marketing at the Zcash Foundation, a financial privacy non-profit. She is a former technology journalist.      For Americans, it can be easy to discount the social relevance of censorship-resistant digital assets like bitcoin.  Unlike people living under authoritarian regimes, we are free to enter into commercial transactions how and when we like, right?  Well, not always.  Many Americans find themselves unable to access the financial system for political reasons. It's a frustrating experience that cuts across ideological lines. Common targets of financial exclusion include sex workers (regardless of whether their work is legal), drug users and — oddly enough — gun rights organizations.  New York vs the NRA  For a recent example, look to the National Rifle Association and its run-in with New York State.  Although the NRA is a controversial organization, prone to selective advocacy and partisan rhetoric, the group's activities are indisputably legal. Freedom entails being able to say and do controversial things, especially when those things are explicitly protected by the Constitution.  The NRA's mission is to protect and promote Americans' right to keep and bear firearms. The organization likes to bill itself as the oldest civil rights advocacy group in the country. So, readers may be surprised that the NRA claims to have struggled to access financial services. In May, the non-profit decided to sue governor Andrew Cuomo and the state's Department of Financial Services.  ""The NRA presented as evidence an April letter from Maria Vullo, the DFS's superintendent, warning banks under her purview about the 'reputational risk' of doing business with gun-rights groups,"" according to National Review. ""The state also pressured the companies behind the scenes, the group claims.""  If these allegations are accurate, it's an echo of the Obama administration's Operation Choke Point, in which the government put pressure on banks to stop enabling legal but disapproved-of businesses. In 2014, the US House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that the initiative was intended ""to deny [certain] merchants access to the banking and payments networks that every business needs to survive.""  The committee's report noted that ""bank regulators labeled a wide range of lawful merchants as 'high-risk' — including coin dealers, firearms and ammunition sales, and short-term lending."" Thereby, ""Operation Choke Point effectively transformed this guidance into an implicit threat of a federal investigation."" The effort was deemed an illegal abuse of power by the Department of Justice, and eventually shut down.  Yet even upstream of payment processing, e-commerce platforms like Shopify are kicking off gun-related merchants. ""We have invested more than $100,000 in the development of our Shopify store, which will disappear once these policies go into effect,"" said Cole Leleux, the general manager of firearms dealer Spike's Tactical, in an interview with the Daily Wire. A platform like OpenBazaar not only wouldn't do that, it wouldn't be able to, because the marketplace is designed to prevent top-down censorship.  When it comes to reputational risk, many banks would be wary of serving someone like dissident gunsmith Cody Wilson, whose projects include publishing free weapons schematics and selling machines for the home manufacture of firearms. His activities are legal, and in fact, litigation comprises much of his activism. But Wilson is a radical, and finance firms tend to eschew radicalism. (That is a problem in-and-of-itself, but we'll leave it aside for now.)  By contrast, the NRA is a longtime figure of the establishment. It doesn't just work within the system; the NRA is the system. It has close ties to politicians and firearm manufacturers alike. Whether or not you like guns or the Second Amendment, it should be alarming when a legacy institution as entrenched as the NRA is turned away by financial service providers, especially as a result of state pressure.  That financial discrimination shows just how precarious Americans' rights are in actual practice. What if a financial regulator decided that the ACLU's First Amendment advocacy was distasteful, and jeopardized the group's ability to accept donations?  The point is not that every bank should be forced to work with the NRA. For some banks, refraining from doing business with the NRA may make commercial sense. If the reputational risk, or cost of monitoring compliance, outweighs the revenue that a financial services company can garner from a controversial client, it's a rational business decision to drop that client.  An imperfect solution  However, the NRA's case demonstrates the critical need for permissionless financial infrastructure. A truly open financial system would mitigate the state pressure brought to bear against private organizations that advocate for Americans' constitutional rights. It would also protect provocateurs like Cody Wilson, who may pose a legitimate threat to the PR and marketing needs of a traditional, centralized bank.  Cryptocurrency is the solution to financial exclusion — if an imperfect one at present. Anyone in the space knows that the promise of a robust parallel system has yet to be fulfilled. Usability and adoption remain low. Bitcoin privacy is far from perfect (although it is steadily evolving, and alternate options like zcash and monero are available). The tax and regulatory environments remain intimidating, which is a huge problem for merchants.  And yet, despite all those caveats, cryptocurrency continues to hold the promise of financial freedom. The cypherpunk approach is not to rely on the government upholding the Bill of Rights, but to write code that will guarantee those liberties cannot be taken away. Cryptocurrencies that are trustless and distributed already provide an incredible advantage: You can exchange value, even across great distances, without having to do a song and dance for a gatekeeper.  In this bear market, it's important to remember the revelatory nature of Satoshi Nakamoto's innovation. Freedom entails being able to say and do controversial things — and when it's true freedom, you don't have to beg for permission first.

42429583,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzp7h,1535202011,The Weirdest Prediction Markets on Augur Right Now,"Do you believe in God? Would you put your cryptocurrency holdings on it?  Augur  , an ethereum-based platform for betting on the outcome of real-world events, aims to be a repository of crowd-sourced knowledge for journalists, investors and policymakers, as well as an effective tool for hedging against adverse outcomes.  But it's also become one other thing: a hilarious place to troll.  Forums for questioning a higher power are just one of many markets that currently exist on the decentralized prediction market, developed by the non-profit Forecast Foundation and funded with one of the world's first token sales in 2015.  That token sale took place before people were even using the word initial coin offering, or ICO, to refer to these types of crypto fundraising schemes, and the project went through the ICO boom in beta – with the developers testing and vetting one of the most hotly-anticipated launches in crypto history.  As such, when it launched on ethereum's live blockchain last month, it briefly surpassed the most famous decentralized application, CryptoKitties, in terms of the number of users. Although enthusiasm has since dipped markedly.  So far, most of Augur's markets – and the vast majority of the trades on the platform – deal with relatively vanilla topics like the outcomes of sporting events or the prices of crypto assets. But a few take a truly dark turn, gauging the likelihood that prominent figures will be assassinated or that terrorist attacks and mass shootings will occur.  Others, though, are just goofy, evoking the cryptocurrency community's peculiar obsessions, wild rumors and the sorts of riddles a bridge troll might ask before letting you pass.  So here's to the Augur users who have selflessly donated their time and potentially their funds – market creators post a bond in the platform's native REP tokens, which they lose if a market is deemed ""invalid"" because the outcome cannot be verified – all just to brighten their fellow users' days.  In no particular order, here are a few of the weirdest markets on Augur today.  Vitalik's girlfriend  Vitalik Buterin, creator of ethereum, the world's second-most valuable blockchain, enjoys the kind of wealth and notoriety few 24-year-olds have.  But does he have a girlfriend? And if not now, when?  These questions have vexed the crypto community enough to spawn a dedicated article – one that's apparently been viewed over 18,000 times. And now, indelibly etched into Buterin's own creation, there's an Augur market for it too.  Buterin himself must confirm the relationship, according to the market's terms, and the couple must have been together for at least one full day.  It's worth noting here that (as with many Augur markets) nobody has bet on this one at the time of writing.  Are you there, God?  Ostensibly, Augur markets must be based on verifiable events, but Augur is a platform without moderators, so that's become more of a guideline.  As mentioned above, the perfect example: someone has posed the question, ""Does god exist?""  They're apparently in no hurry to find out, as the market expires at the beginning of 2020. And the resolution source must be the ""news media.""  The heathen users that initiated the market give the creator of the universe a 10 percent chance of existing. No money is at stake at the time of writing.  SAFU or not SAFU  Naturally, Augur users haven't passed up on the chance to sprinkle the platform with their particular flavor of memes.  Titled ""FUNDS ARE SAFU?"" one market references a bizarre – but popular – YouTube send-up of Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao's attempt to reassure users that their crypto holdings on the platform were safe.  Looking at the market's details, however, it appears not to be a joke, but a serious – if vaguely worded – question about whether Binance will be hacked: ""Will the security of https://www.binance.com/ be negatively affected such that there is a newsworthy loss of money?""  The market expired without any bets having been placed.  Does not compute  Competition is stiff, but the trolliest market currently active on Augur may well be this restatement of the liar paradox – the sort of query one might use to incapacitate a murderous supercomputer.  For the uninitiated, the statement ""this sentence is false"" is a paradox because, if the statement is, in fact, false, that means it checks out. So it's true.  If the statement is true – by being false – then it violates its own premise: it has to be false.  Thinking about this paradox goes back to at least the fourth century BCE, making it one of humanity's longest-running time wasters. Adding a pinch of circular meta-salt to this concoction, the market creator made the point of reference for this market Predictions.Global, a site that scrapes data from Augur.  The pee tape  The allegation that Russian authorities possess compromising material on U.S. president Donald Trump is one of the stranger stories to emerge from the 2016 election.  The existence of this compromising material – originating from a collection of documents prepared by a former British intelligence officer working (indirectly) on behalf of Democrats – is often known as the ""pee tape"" due to its alleged content.  But it hasn't been proven.  Judging by an Augur market on the topic, though, chances are around one in four that such a tape will emerge before the end of Trump's first term.  Betting volume on the market has been very low, however, at the equivalent of less than $60.  McAfee's bold prediction  Many of the most liquid and valuable markets on Augur deal with the prices of cryptocurrencies.  So at first glance, it's hard to see what's remarkable about one particular market predicting that the price of bitcoin will pass $1 million before 2020.  But there's a clue in the fact that it's tagged ""McAfee.""  The anti-virus-software-creator-turned-cryptocurrency-hype-man has published many inadvisable tweets. Topping the list, however, is one from late 2017, when he predicted that bitcoin would hit $1 million and reiterated a promise he'd made earlier to ""eat my dick on national television"" if he proved incorrect.  Yet another Augur market gets to the, um, meat of the story.  And that's probably enough Augur for today.
