42426008,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhujh,1409954440,Ross Ulbricht Pleads Not Guilty to New Drug Charges,"UPDATE (8th September 15:30 BST): Article updated with comment from Ross Ulbricht's legal defense.      Ross Ulbricht, the accused ringleader of the now-defunct online black marketplace Silk Road, has plead not guilty to a series of new charges levied against him by federal prosecutors.  Filed on 21st August, the charges include narcotics trafficking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identification documents and distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet. Those charges followed previous allegations that Ulbricht had engaged in drug trafficking, computer hacking, money laundering and engaging in a criminal enterprise.  The 30-year-old Texas native appeared in a Manhattan federal court today to answer to the charges issued in the latest indictment, Bloomberg reports.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Ulbricht’s attorney Joshua Dratel, of the law firm Joshua L Dratel, PC, said that this latest plea is consistent with Ulbricht's position throughout the case, that he is not guilty of all charges.  Dratel told CoinDesk:  ""We continue to have complete and unwavering confidence in the result at trial, which will establish that Ross is not guilty of each and very charge.""  Ulbricht's trial is set to begin 3rd November.  Case updates continue  The news of Ulbricht's latest plea followed an update in another long-standing court case that has garnered headlines in the bitcoin space.  On 4th September, both former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem and former Silk Road operator Robert Faiella plead guilty to separate charges, each agreeing to pay $950,000 in damages to the US government under the terms of the deal.  Faiella allegedly ran an underground bitcoin exchange through the Silk Road website. He and Shrem exchanged nearly $1m in cash for bitcoins that would be help facilitate transactions for Silk Road users.  Speaking to CoinDesk earlier this week, Shrem framed the plea deal as the first step in moving forward from the charges that have held back his ability to interact with the broader bitcoin community.  Unlike Ulbricht, Shrem, who currently serves as a business development advisor for bitcoin buying service Payza, will not go to trial.  His future will be decided at a 20th January sentencing hearing, and he faces up to 60 months in prison for aiding and abetting an unlicensed money-transmitting business.  Dark markets evolve  Notably, despite the demise of Silk Road, recent reports suggest that the shutdown has done little to stem the bitcoin-enabled online drug trade.  Online black market Agora, which operates using the Tor network and accepts only bitcoin payments, now has 200 more listings than Silk Road 2.0, the successor to the illicit business Ulbricht is accused of heading, Wired reports.  The media outlet suggests that Agora has been able to dominate the market due to security breaches that have affected its major competitors such as Silk Road 2.0 and Cannabis Road.

42426026,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhvHh,1409950824,Crypto 2.0 Roundup: Block Chain Bloat Solutions and a Crypto Football Team,"The last few weeks have provided evidence that the emerging crypto 2.0 community is moving to integrate more fully with the mainstream bitcoin industry.  The trend is evidenced by projects such as DigitalTangible, a gold and bitcoin exchange that uses tokens in an effort to bring gold trading into the 21st century. The project was backed by major partners Amagi Metals and Agora Commodities.  However, the increased interaction between these two industry sectors has not been without controversy.  The block chain bloat debate  An increasing number of bitcoin industry observers now fear that the digital currency's block chain may soon become 'bloated', suffering from an information overload that weighs down the network with information that falls outside the network's primary purpose: validating bitcoin transactions.  In other words, if bitcoin is the new email, experts are predicting it may soon face a problem from its own type of spam.  However, two notable names from the crypto 2.0 industry emerged as partial scapegoats for the situation: Counterparty and Mastercoin, projects that use bitcoin's block chain to create new decentralized networks – in this case, networks that aim to enable more complex financial functions via the block chain.  Unsurprisingly, the crypto 2.0 industry has moved strongly to counter this viewpoint.  Counterparty co-founder Evan Wagner told CoinDesk that his project adds only a small amount of data to the bitcoin block chain. He estimates that in its nine months of operation, Counterparty has added only 15 MB of information to the bitcoin block chain, which is now 22 GB in size.  Wagner also moved to dismiss the idea that Counterparty's data is spam, saying:  ""Counterparty data serves a useful purpose, unlike true spam. Counterparty is first and foremost a protocol for financial tools, like bitcoin itself, and its use of bitcoin makes bitcoin both more powerful and more valuable.""  Shawn Wilkinson, founder of distributed file sharing service Storj, echoed this sentiment, telling CoinDesk:  ""The underlying question is: how do you use a block chain as a public ledger, not just for cryptocurrency, in a way that scales and avoids problems? I reject the current 'this is bad' and 'get off my block chain' approaches. Block chain bloat is just something that can and will be solved.""  Solutions ahead  Wilkinson is not alone in his assertion, as others have suggested that if crypto 2.0 projects are posing an issue for the bitcoin block chain at present, these problems will likely be overcome through innovation. For example, representatives from Mastercoin pointed to the Notary Chains project, which is in the middle of rebranding as Factom.  If bitcoin is to serve as the ledger of record, Factom aims to use the bitcoin block chain to provide a record of its own record of provable events.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Factom's Paul Snow described how his project could ensure that small amounts of information end up on the block chain, saying:  ""Mastercoin's Omniwallet could run its decentralized exchange protocol on Factom. Thousands of transactions – bids and asks – could be secured with just a handful of entries into the bitcoin block chain, eliminating the bloat issue.""  He added: ""Metadata in the block chain is not detrimental to the network, just inconvenient. There are already solutions to the bloat problem, but they just haven't been implemented.""  More on Factom and its potential uses for smart contracts, securities and tokens can be found in its full white paper.  Crypto's first football squad  In our last roundup, we profiled Mypowers, a marketplace for premium access rights that allows artists to create digital coins as a way to allow fans to invest in artists while improving the overall fan experience.  Now, the Jetcoin Institute has launched a similar service, albeit one focused specifically on allowing sports teams to reward their fans for loyalty. Called jetcoin, the offering is billed as a digital loyalty coin for sports fans. In turn, jetcoin aims to provide users with a way to invest in athletes and their contracts, thereby securing a stake in their future performance.  To kick off the project, the Jetcoin Institute partnered with startup incubator Seedcoin to sponsor Chievo Verona, an Italian football club based in Chievo, a suburb of Verona.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Seedcoin's chief startup officer Eddy Travia, framed the partnership as one that allows his firm to capitalize on its long-held idea that sports could serve as a great onboarding tool for new cryptocurrency initiatives.  Travia told CoinDesk that one of the players the project had aimed to enlist was recruited by Chievo Verona this summer, but that interest in jetcoin at a team management level quickly grew.  He added:  ""[Jetcoin] explained the concept to the team management and they liked it. They embraced it and are open to have players and fans use jetcoin, and let their merchandise be traded for jetcoins, branded products, etc.""  Going forward, the Jetcoin Institute plans to name certain fans 'Jetcoin Champions', who will become goodwill ambassadors for jetcoin and be supported by the jetcoin community.  Notably, jetcoin is not yet released, and it could be issued on a number of different platforms including bitcoin, Counterparty and Dogeparty. Once the coin is launched, smart contracts would be introduced on a block chain for players, with jetcoin users investing for certain revenues and rights.  Travia explained that he believes the project could gain widespread support as it provides athletes a new and novel way to secure financing based on a contract.  Ethereum's record-setting fundraising  Ethereum's much-discussed ether presale effort concluded this week with the successful sale of 60,102,216 ether, the fuel for its distributed application software platform.  While the exact fundraising for the project is difficult to quantify given the fluctuating price of the bitcoin it raised over the course of its ether sale, observers on Reddit estimated the final total in the $15m–$18m range.  Using figures from Wikipedia, the community suggested this would make Ethereum's crowdfunding round the second-highest ever recorded, trailing the Star Citizen video game crowdfunding, which raised more than $50m through Kickstarter.  With these estimates, Ethereum would notably have also outraised the Ubuntu Edge smartphone, the Coolest Cooler and the Pebble smartwatch, all products that have garnered significant mainstream media attention for their efforts.

42426010,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhuph,1409940923,Gallery: Inside a Top Bitcoin Mine in China,"The profile of the average bitcoin miner has changed dramatically over the course of the currency's short history.  Once the pursuit of hobbyists with powerful CPUs (and later GPUs), mining is now a highly competitive business performed on an industrial scale.  But what is life like inside one of these power guzzling giants? Blogger Bitsmithhttp://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/08/bitcoin/inside-one-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mines/ found out first-hand on a trip to a one of the world's biggest facilities at a mystery location in China. Check out the scenes he witnessed in the gallery below:  As more mining firms pile in, bitcoin's network difficulty is soaring higher and higher. Additionally, the price has been struggling to break beyond $600 for several months now, so the days of near-instant profit are long gone.  When these factors are combined, more powerful – and, crucially, more power efficient – hardware is needed for miners to make a profit.  The resulting 'arms race' is clear to see from these pictures: barely dry cement, giant racks of hardware and a mounting pile of empty cardboard boxes sat in a warehouse that took just fifteen days to construct.  Here, at least, these aggressive tactics appear to be paying off.

42426023,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhvBh,1409937307,Safello Announces Social Media-Inspired Bitcoin Wallet,"Safello is now allowing users to request invitations to its newly launched bitcoin wallet service.  For the release, the Sweden-based bitcoin services company will leverage Blockchain's API, though its wallet service will build upon Blockchain's basic offering, adding an additional social layer that will allow users to easily search for other users with whom they've previously transacted.  The news was released during a panel session at Sthlm Tech Fest, a Sweden-based conference featuring top talent from the payments world such as Stripe and iZettle alongside bitcoin companies such as Safello, Blockchain and KnCMiner.  Safello chose to take a decidedly under-the-radar approach to the release, opting against issuing a formal press release. However, news of the new service quickly found its way to Reddit, an event that CEO Frank Schuil cited as evidence of the demand for the service.  Schuil told CoinDesk that users may need to be patient, as not all requests to access the service will be immediately approach. He said:  ""We anticipate to slowly let users in during this month or next month.""  Emphasizing ease of use  Safello framed its wallet service as one that aims to eliminate some of the more common pain points associated with bitcoin wallets, branding it as ""so easy that even your mom could use it"". Notably, Safello's wallet will incorporate features common to digital address books, allowing users to easily search for friends.  All transactions can be viewed in a timeline and if verified accounts are being used, bitcoin addresses will be replaced by user names, photos and comments. The end result is Safello's wallet history being visualized more in the style of the social timelines that Facebook and Twitter users have grown accustomed to.  The Safello wallet also uses verified accounts to bolster security, a feature that allows users to confirm that the addresses to which they send bitcoin are the intended recipients.  Additionally, Safello does not store any private keys at all, as the wallet uses Blockchain’s API to create wallets.  Safello gains market momentum  The announcement was made at roughly 11:10 BST during a lunch panel session at the conference.  Speakers for the panel included Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary and KnCMiner co-founder Sam Cole, whose bitcoin mining company raised $14m in Series A funding on 4th September.  The panel also include Erik Olofsson of Creandum, the Sweden-based venture capital firm that lead KnCMiner's most recent funding round, and was moderated by 500 Startups venture partner Sean Percival.  The inclusion at the conference is the latest milestone for Safello, which launched in April to become the ""Coinbase of Europe"". That announcement was proceeded by the company's $600,000 funding round in February, a round led by Blockchain's Nicolas Cary and bitcoin luminaries Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver.

42426009,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhunh,1409933591,Charlie Shrem to Forfeit $950k to US Government in Plea Bargain,"Further details have emerged of former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem's plea bargain with US authorities, which saw him plead guilty to aiding and abetting an unlicensed money-transmitting business on 4th Sept.  Reuters  reported that both Shrem and Robert Faiella, a co-conspirator who pleaded guilty separately, both agreed to forfeit $950,000 to the government as a condition of their deals.  According to the New York Times, Shrem entered his plea in an unwavering voice, appearing ""stoic"" and calm – a departure from his usually charismatic presence.  ""I knew that what I was doing was wrong. I am pleading guilty because I am guilty,"" Shrem said in his statement, according to the Times.  Shrem and Faiella's plea bargains provide for jail terms of up to 60 months. The guidelines also include a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the amount of money derived from the crime or double the loss to the victim, whichever is greatest, the Wall Street Journal reported. The final sentence will be determined on 20th January.  Silk Road outlaws  The Manhattan US Attorney, Preet Bharara, said that Shrem and Faiella sold $1m in bitcoin to ""outlaws"" on Silk Road, which ""bought"" the convictions for the duo. The plea bargain was struck with Bharara's office.  This development presents a significant reduction in potential prison time for Shrem. Previously, he faced up to 30 years behind bars if found guilty of offences under the Patriot Act, which would have linked him to drug trafficking and terrorism financing.  The current plea bargain is largely in line with Shrem's expectations. He told CoinDesk on 30th August that he would be happy to be ""moving forward"" and avoiding a trial as the outlines of the deal took shape. He had previously been under house arrest for seven months.  ""Key victory""  The Wall Street Journal reported Shrem's lawyer Marc Agnifilo as saying that the US government's decision to drop a charge of money-laundering against Shrem is a ""key victory"" for the bitcoin entrepreneur.  Agnifilo further distanced his client from the activities on Silk Road, telling Reuters that Shrem was ""one step more removed"" from the underground marketplace, which he described as ""the heartland of illegal conduct"".  Ross Ulbricht, the alleged Silk Road mastermind operating under the alias 'Dread Pirate Roberts', faces separate charges. On 22nd August, the US government filed new charges of narcotics trafficking, distribution of narcotics by means of the internet and conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent identity documents.  Ulbricht is held in New York's Metropolitan Detention Center as he awaits a trial that will begin on 3rd November.  Shrem's lawyer underlined his client's continued commitment to bitcoin, telling the Journal that Shrem would ""doggedly"" pursue a career around the cryptocurrency in future.

42426021,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhv7h,1409929443,Yuan Trades Now Make Up Over 70% of Bitcoin Volume,"The majority of bitcoin transactions carried out over the last 30 days came from yuan trades, it has been revealed.  China-based exchange BTC China tweeted that a total of 71% of bitcoin trades last month could be attributed to yuan users – the Chinese market, in other words.    Did you know 71% of #Bitcoin trades in past 30 days occurred in the #CNY market? Chart via bitcoinity http://t.co/MY3zwvX44D      — BTC China (@btcchina) September 5, 2014      The exchange cited data from bitcointy, which indicates that the majority of transactions were carried out in yuan. Second place goes to the US dollar, with euro transactions trailing at a distant third.  Turning the tables  This particular chart does not paint the full picture, however. To better illustrate China’s impact on the market, it is necessary to look at data prior to September 2013. A year ago the dollar was the dominant currency, but that started to change in late 2013, as the volume of CNY transactions exploded.  In September 2013, approximately one CNY trade was carried out per three USD trades. At the moment, the situation is quite different, as CNY accounts for more than two thirds of all deals and on most days it outpaces the dollar by a ratio of at least 1:3.  It should be noted that BTC China launched USD and HKD trading accounts last July.  Further, most of China's exchanges have adopted 0% fee models for trading, which provides a potential explanation as to why yuan trade may be disproportionately high.  China’s impact on bitcoin  China’s effect on bitcoin prices and the network itself should not be underestimated. The nation is home to some of the biggest bitcoin exchanges on the planet as well as a number of industrial-scale mining operations.  Notably, turbulence in China's bitcoin market has been shown to have a visible effect on the wider industry.  Earlier this year, the market was affected by moths of uncertainty, as rumours mounted that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) would move to ban the currency. Although operations were disrupted, the fears subsided in April, but not before the price of bitcoin took a dive in late March as international traders reacted negatively to the news.  Though the PBOC took no formal action against bitcoin businesses, only reinforcing early December statements meant to separate the country's bitcoin businesses from its financial industry, the uncertainty had a profound effect on domestic exchanges, with a few smaller startups closing their doors.

42426024,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhvDh,1409921365,Can Bitcoin Surpass Credit Cards for Low-Cost Fraud Protection?,"It’s almost essential today for merchants to accept credit or debit cards. Indeed, it is often the only form of payment in a customer’s wallet.  However, in exchange for accepting cards, merchants must pay for a number of services that they may not need or want as part of the blanket fees charged by payment processors.  There are even some examples where merchants offer customers a discount in exchange for paying in cash, such as gas stations in the US, which often advertise a cheaper price to customers using physical money.  The card companies, banks and payment processors cooperate together to charge a good chunk of these fees both to cover the cost of fraud and to protect against it. But can bitcoin offer better, or at the very least lower-cost, fraud protection for merchants and consumers?  Alan Safahi, CEO of ZipZap and a veteran of the payments industry, said that banks should be interested in bitcoin’s potential for lower overhead operational merchant costs, explaining:  “Banks don’t make a lot of money for payment processing. They couldn’t care if they are processing Visa, MasterCard or bitcoin.""  Merchant perspective  One of the biggest issues with credit cards that merchants simply cannot avoid is chargebacks – when a card transaction is reversed after a payment for a variety of reasons.  “For more developed economies with stable currencies, chargebacks is one of the biggest selling points to bitcoin adoption for merchants,” said Michael Dunworth, whose startup snapCard allows users to pay for things online in bitcoin whether a merchant accepts bitcoin or not.  “[Chargebacks are] a drain on all fronts, and an incomparable value-add of accepting bitcoin,” he added.  Safahi's ZipZap allows users to obtain bitcoin from kiosks around the world.  He said the issue of chargebacks comes down to a perhaps needless use of third-party trust. It’s important to remember bitcoin is a system that can eliminate the need for this sort of trust because of cryptography.  Safahi noted:  “Any time you have a group of people that don’t trust each other that need to trust each other, you need consensus and that’s what bitcoin and other digital currencies do really well.”  So, without third-party trust, how does a merchant know to trust a consumer and vice versa when using bitcoin?  Steve Beauregard, CEO of digital currency payment processor GoCoin, said that emerging peer-rating platforms can help lead the way to a new form of trust relationships between parties, explaining:  “With the advances in reputation systems like Yelp! and the peer economy created by services like AirBnB and Uber, you will quickly weed out the scammers from the legitimate consumers.”  Consumer perspective  There’s still not a large contingent of consumers paying for purchases in bitcoin – in part, of course, because many merchants do not yet accept the digital currency.  Tom Longson, CEO of bitcoin gift card startup GogoCoin believes that a strong community of bitcoin purchasers could emerge – similar to the strong enthusiast community that enabled bitcoin to get this far.  He said:  “Loyal customers are very important to small and large businesses. The merchants support the bitcoin ecosystem, and customers support the merchant in return.”  Longson echoed Beauregard, saying that the network effects peer recommendation systems could provide are an opportunity for overall growth.  “The community makes merchants who accept bitcoin better, both in spending power and [by] recommending their service to others,” he added.  There is another alternative to peer-based systems as well. With bitcoin’s multi-signature technology, companies like Purse.io are building escrow bitcoin wallets to enable dispute resolution in the form of three separately held keys.  This would mean one key for the merchant, one for the consumer and another for Purse. When all parties agree, the funds are paid, but, in a dispute, Purse mediates. Such a system could be an alternative to the credit card chargeback.  Purse co-founder Andrew Lee says that consumers will need something like this in order to feel fully comfortable spending bitcoin:  “The world is full of fraudulent merchants. Consumers wouldn't spend with the same confidence if they couldn't dispute a transaction.”  Underlying bitcoin issues  It would seem the chargeback system to prevent fraud in credit cards is flawed, ripe for disruption.  That is exactly how GoCoin’s Beauregard sees it: “The removal of the chargeback mechanism finally equals the balance of power between the consumer and the merchant,” he said.  Universal bitcoin companies like Circle, Coinbase and Xapo will need some form of reversal or mediation mechanism order to ensure a degree of consumer protection.  Credit card companies see no alternative other than to develop competing digital systems to rival bitcoin. Amazingly, after working with payment technology companies like PayPal, the major players didn't do a whole lot in this regard until bitcoin finally came along.  SnapCard’s Dunworth said:  “Given the success of PayPal so early on, then only recently seeing Visa and MasterCard open up their own digital wallet style services (V.me and MasterPass), that was a long time.”  Add to the fact that it is rumored Apple will be partnering with American Express for a mobile digital wallet on iPhone’s iOS 6 operating systems, and it is quite obvious the digital payments industry is expanding quickly.  It is still not clear exactly where bitcoin will fit into the big picture, yet the fact remains that the digital currency enables a rethinking of the standard fraud protection and dispute resolution models.  The big-brand card companies will desperately need to figure out a solution for all of this, especially given that digital and mobile payment efforts aren’t going too well for them.  This is evidenced by the vast majority of people still making in-person electronic payments through credit and debit cards and not the mobile wallets most bitcoin users embrace.  “I think Visa and MasterCard ... they need to embrace it; find a way to work with it. If they don’t come on board, then merchants will start accepting bitcoin anyway,” said Safahi.

42426012,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhuvh,1409909526,How Bitcoin Brokers Trade Millions Without an Exchange,"Exchanges are the most popular way to dispose of bitcoin holdings for fiat currency, with thousands of coins being traded daily. However, when one cryptocurrency startup founder needed to cash in his bitcoin quickly, he didn't log on to an exchange to do it.  Instead, the entrepreneur started asking around for a broker who could settle the issue with an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. The broker he found, through mutual friends, was Jonathan 'Jonny' Harrison, who runs London bitcoin ATM firm Satoshipoint. The two struck up a conversation on Skype and soon agreed to do a deal.  ""Someone told me that he wanted to sell 12 grand-worth, we had a chat on Skype and entered an agreement, and so that was the deal done,"" Harrison said, recounting the trade.  Harrison charges a 5% fee for an OTC trade. Although he says he arranges such trades only occasionally, other brokers specialising in OTC trades have found a lucrative niche in the market. As the bitcoin price surged last year, wealthy holders eschewed exchanges and turned to brokers to lock in their gains with a single big trade.  Tricks of the OTC trade  Trading over the counter offers several advantages over placing an order on an exchange. For one thing, traders get to protect their capital from the effects of price slippage.  Slippage is what can happen when an investor sells a large block of coins on an exchange all at once. If the sell order is large enough, it can cause the price on the exchange to fall as it is filled. As a result, the seller can lose a substantial chunk of the proceeds by the time the entire order is filled.  Just how much of a trade is lost to slippage is difficult to quantify, according to George Samman, a co-founder of BTC.sx and a former portfolio manager at a New York investment firm. In a hypothetical trade where an investor sold 100 BTC on BitStamp at today's price of about $490, he or she would stand to lose up to 10% to slippage.  ""When someone is trying to put a block trade through and there's not enough takers at a certain price level, then the price keeps dropping as bids keep getting lower and lower,"" he said.  Other factors can come into play. Traders could be laying in wait with 'false' orders on the exchange to feel for large blocks coming to market. When some of those orders are filled, savvy traders could cancel the rest of their original orders, sensing that a big block is being traded, and quickly place new orders at lower prices, Samman says.  ""Other traders will just snap it away and the price could drop $10, $15, off of 20 coins being traded in a 100-coin block. And they will keep snapping it up because it keeps slipping and slipping,"" said Samman.  Trust in a trustless environment  Speed and privacy are the other advantages that OTC block trades offer. Sellers needing fiat currency in a hurry might turn to a broker, as would investors who prefer not to entrust their trading data with a large exchange.  In an ironic inversion of bitcoin's trustless protocol, OTC trades are a throwback to markets operated by trusted intermediaries. Mark Lamb, chief executive at London-based exchange Coinfloor, who regularly conducts large OTC trades for clients, charging a fee of up to 1% of the traded amount, said:  ""What you're selling is trust. This OTC broker knows what they're doing, vets the participants and knows the participants are going to settle and the trade is going to go through.""  When a call comes in to sell a block of coins, Lamb hits his address book to look for buyers. When a match is found, Coinfloor draws up contracts between itself and each party. The buyer and seller deal with Coinfloor, not each other. After the contract is signed, both parties must transfer their funds to Coinfloor immediately. Once the broker has received the funds from both sides, the assets are then sent to the appropriate counterparty.  While most of the OTC brokers for big blocks CoinDesk spoke to keep identification documents to comply with know-your-customer rules, OTC traders may believe that they enjoy a greater degree of privacy with their brokers.  ""Customers want to do trade with someone they can trust; someone they trust more than an exchange. They might come to a broker because they may not trust the top few exchanges,"" Lamb said.  Cashing in big blocks  Brokers are most in demand when prices are volatile. Investors are either rushing to lock in gains by selling a big block, or to accumulate more coins when the price plunges.  Harry Yeh, managing partner at hedge fund and venture capital firm Binary Financial, is a regular OTC broker and only carries out trades of at least 50 BTC. He recalled one episode of manic selling, as clients wanted to turn their bitcoin profits into millions of dollars of fiat, and quickly:  ""When the price goes up, the demand for blocks goes through the roof. When the price crashes, everybody wants to sell. Around December 5th, when the whole China thing happened, we had people who wanted to sell $2m–$3m of bitcoin right away.""  Yeh was coy about who his OTC clients were, saying only that he has dealt with ""high net-worth individuals and institutions"". When pressed, he gave up precious little information, saying that clients included ""hedge funds, family offices and private wealth managers"".  According to Yeh, private wealth managers have been contacting him of late as they seek to diversify their clients' holdings to include cryptocurrencies. Lamb was similarly vague about OTC clients, saying only that he served ""high net-worth individuals"", adding:  ""There are people who put a lot of value in executing a full block of 1,000 or 5,000 coins at once.""  OTC trades and the wider market  What effect does all this OTC trading have on the wider market? Brokers say that OTC trades protect the market from exacerbated volatility.  ""The whole goal of the broker is not to disperse the coins into the market. It's to move it between one seller who has decided to sell, to ideally one buyer who would like to get in to hold,"" Lamb said. ""It reduces volatility.""  Samman, of BTC.sx, said OTC brokers have a role to play because bitcoin investors are too green about managing their trading risk. Instead of using a sophisticated combination of trading orders to reduce price slippage for a big block, for example, traders may try to offload a big chunk of coins with a market order, which is filled at the prevailing price.  ""Some of the traders are very inexperienced [...] they're throwing in market orders and thinking that just because they see the price at one level, they're going to get that price,"" he said.  While many exchanges, including the current top exchange by volume, Bitstamp, offer stop-loss orders which can help mitigate slippage, one exchange has gone further. LakeBTC has released a 'hidden' orderbook feature that it calls its ""darkpool"", designed to protect investors against 'financial predators' waiting to exploit the price distortions created by big trades.  LakeBTC's darkpool works by hiding big trades of 50 BTC and up from the public order book. Although the rest of the market can't see the trade, the exchange continues trying to fill it with outstanding orders on the market at the time, the firm's communications director Lisa Li said, adding:  ""You might buy 100 BTC in a single order, but it may get matched with multiple smaller orders, or one single big sell order – it really depends on the sell orders at the time.""  OTC is here to stay  In the opaque world of OTC trading, it's unclear just how much money is changing hands each day. One gauge might be the activity on LocalBitcoins, which essentially functions as an OTC market.  According to Coinometrics data, LocalBitcoins accounted for up to 5% of daily traded volume in the last year. Contrast this with Bitstamp, has accounted for up to 40% of daily traded volume at times this year.  Physical markets, like the Satoshi Square events, and the Bitcoin-OTC IRC channel are other platforms where OTC trading takes place.  As the bitcoin markets continue to mature, it appears OTC trading is here to stay. As Samman points out, trading volumes have shrunk, even in the established equity and commodities markets, as big trades are increasingly done over the counter.  ""The problem with OTC trading is that they are private. People get upset about that and they think there is some kind of manipulation going on. But in the markets today, there is less and less volume. Even in the equity markets, institutions are trading with each other and taking trades offline.""
