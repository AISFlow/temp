42397302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSME,1386615055,Swiss Lawmakers Propose Treating Bitcoin as Foreign Currency,"The Swiss Parliament is considering a postulate that asks for bitcoin to be treated as any other foreign currency. The goal of the postulate, introduced by representative Thomas Weibel, is to eliminate ambiguities and increase legal certainty related to bitcoin.  If it is approved by parliament, it will be submitted before the Federal Council, Switzerland’s principal executive institution. If the Federal Council agrees that bitcoin should be treated like other foreign currencies, it will also evaluate how to implement the postulate. In addition, the executive was asked to examine the potential bitcoin-related opportunities for the Swiss financial sector.  The postulate petitions the executive branch to reply to four basic questions: whether or not bitcoin represents an opportunity for the financial sector, should bitcoin be treated as a foreign currency, what regulatory instruments should be used to establish legal certainty for bitcoin and similar currencies, and what sort of regulatory changes are needed and when can they be implemented.  The postulate was co-signed by 45 members of parliament (out of a possible 200) after they came to the conclusion that bitcoin can create new opportunities for the Swiss financial sector and that measures should be taken to regulate the application of VAT and the execution of money laundering controls.  Over the next few weeks, members of parliament will vote on the postulate. Then, if the majority of members of parliament vote in favour, it will be formally submitted to the Federal Council. If the council responds affirmatively, it will also have to make its position clear to national regulatory bodies such as Finma, the Swiss securities exchange commission.  If all goes as planned, bitcoin could be practically recognized by Switzerland as a legitimate foreign currency. The move would drastically reduce legal uncertainty for bitcoin users, at least in Switzerland, namely the Swiss banking sector. It would allow Swiss authorities to apply existing foreign currency legislation to bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Luzius Meisser, president of Bitcoin Association Switzerland, told CoinDesk:  ""This would be quite revolutionary, as it provides bitcoin with additional legitimacy and could serve as a precedent for other countries. Also, it would pave the way for businesses to use bitcoins without legal uncertainty in Switzerland.""  Meisser believes it is likely the postulate will make its way through parliament, given that around 25% of its members acted as cosignatories.  A partial translation of the postulate has been posted on the Bitcoin Talk forum.  Back in September  , Jean Christophe Schwaab of the Swiss Socialist Party said the only people in Switzerland who know about bitcoin are “geeks, criminals and special police units” and that there is currently very little or no public discussion about digital currency.  He seems to have adopted a more positive view of bitcoin, having acted as one of the cosignatories of the postulate.  Meisser said: ""I spoke to him and he told me that he had changed his opinion regarding outlawing bitcoin, for the meantime, but he remains skeptical overall. The fact that he cosigned the new, positive postulate is very nice.""  Schwaab said he is ""very happy"" that a large number of MPs now know what bitcoin is and care about the possible regulations.  ""I hope that the government's answer will provide background information on bitcoin and regulations in other countries to allow for fair political discussion. I co-signed the proposal, because it is a contribution to this important discussion,"" he concluded.

42397296,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSEM,1386605408,Are India's Regulators Poised to Clamp Down on Bitcoin?,"India's authorities are allegedly preparing a public advisory to warn against the risks associated with emerging digital currencies.  The problem is not with the digital currencies themselves, but some worrying trends involving bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Indian regulators are concerned that increasingly popular bitcoin investment schemes could become a source of volatility, eventually turning into an electronic version of investor fraud.  An unnamed senior Indian official told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that a public advisory may be issued soon to warn against the “possible risks associated with bitcoins”. The official said:  ""Regulators are scrambling for ways to regulate this entire gamut of digital currency, as it is a totally new concept in India, and even the jurisdiction is not clear as yet on who should regulate them.""  Central bankers step up  The news comes just a week after the Chinese and French central banks issued similar warnings. China has formally instructed its financial institutions to stay away from bitcoin, although the currency has not been banned completely. France also warned its banks against bitcoin's potential flaws.  However, the biggest concern doesn't appear to be an economic one. The amount of bitcoin in circulation is still relatively small, especially in the context of vast economies like China, India and France.  Bitcoin doesn't have the potential to undermine stability, but it does pose a risk, as it could be utilised by tax dodgers and money launderers alike. Some security experts believe it could even be used to channel funds to terrorist organisations.  Another problem is the lack of regulation. Although the vast majority of people dealing in virtual currencies have no intention of breaking the law, the unregulated nature of digital currency exchanges has already precipitated the collapse of several trading platforms.  Lack of regulation is a double-edged sword: while it makes bitcoin appealing to some users, it also introduces more risk and volatility into an already unstable market.  India's e-ponzi schemes  As for India, its financial regulators are keeping a close eye on bitcoin, but they aren't regulating it.  However, this may change. An Indian official advised applying lessons learned in the US, where authorities are applying money laundering rules to bitcoin.  These same rules already apply to other financial transactions, thus they would not impact legitimate traders and businesses. In fact, they could be very beneficial in the long run.  One problem for Indian regulators is the use of bitcoin in multi-level marketing schemes, which are basically ponzi schemes involving an actual product that helps them to appear legitimate.  Regulators are worried that such 'e-ponzi' schemes could become very difficult to take down, as all transactions are electronic and practically anonymous.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/09/are-indias-regulators-poised-to-clamp-down-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/204ef8799abad7b1f6bad68ef6526c1dbe5ba715-1024x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSLF,1386597608,Apple Tells Gliph to Remove App's Bitcoin Transfer Function,"Gliph, a mobile messaging app for iOS, has been asked by Apple to remove its key bitcoin-related feature.  The issue at hand is the app's ability to attach bitcoin amounts to messages.  ""We're releasing an updated version of Gliph for iOS that removes the ability to send bitcoin from within the app,"" says Rob Banagale, CEO of Gliph. He noted that Gliph's iOS users can still perform this action via the mobile Safari browser.  In a blog post announcing Gliph's newest update for iOS 7, it outlines the impact of Apple's decision.  ""You can still create wallets, view balances and receive bitcoin in the Gliph app for iOS [and] send bitcoin using Gliph on iPhone, using the same interface as before. Just visit https://gli.ph/m when you need to send bitcoin, and continue using the app for normal push notifications and messaging,"" according to the post announcing the app's latest update.  The language of the post exudes a high degree of optimism about bitcoin and its potential on mobile platforms. It states:    ""Hang with us, we are in it to win it with bitcoin. This is just the pre-season. Gliph’s implementation of bitcoin will come back harder, faster and stronger no matter the platform.""      ""It stands to reason that if either Apple or Google block useful bitcoin apps from their app marketplaces, they hinder the practical use of the currency and thus indirectly reduce the value of bitcoin.""    Gliph's application has been deemed a 'no wallet app' because it utilizes the services of other bitcoin wallet providers instead of building one of its own. It recently removed the wallet app BIPS, however, following a security breach suffered by that company.  There are a number of other features on Gliph for iOS that will keep the app going on Apple's ecosystem. The company's messaging and cloaked emailing services still remain key components.  Users on Android still have the ability to attach bitcoin to messages with Gliph. Google's mobile platform has been much more lenient towards virtual currency-related applications that exists within its Google Play store.  In Gliph's appeal letter to Apple, which has been publicly published, it points out that the company does not offer any sort of wallet services for bitcoin and only facilitates that process. It states:  ""The Gliph iOS app does not hold any bitcoin on behalf of a user in the app or server side. Gliph also does not send or receive any bitcoin. Gliph uses API calls to request that these operations be performed by third party wallet providers. Gliph also does not charge for the service, or take fees from the facilitation of bitcoin transfers.""  Last month, Coinbase experienced problems with Apple when the technology giant removed Coinbase's application from the App Store.  The Coinbase iOS app, which enabled users to buy, sell and send bitcoin, had been live for less than a month before it was removed from the App Store. It is still not yet live again, but is available on Android.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/09/apple-tells-gliph-to-remove-apps-bitcoin-transfer-function,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d79bf017aa013ac9611374c7d4f87bd8330decb8-1300x713.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397294,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSCO,1386591496,World's Largest Bitcoin Exchange BTC China Now Requires ID,"Users of the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, BTC China, claim the site now requires them to provide some form of identification to create or use a trading account.  Logging into BTC China produces the following message: “In response to a recent policy shift, BTC China now requires users to submit identification or a passport number. Existing users will need to provide this information upon login. We apologise for any inconvenience.”  Despite the ID requirement, there does not seem to be an ID verification process for users outside China. Some users posted on reddit that they were able to continue trading immediately after submitting a number.  The exchange still permits only Chinese yuan (CNY) deposits and withdrawals.  People's Bank of China  BTC China’s move comes after last week’s clarification by the People’s Bank of China on bitcoin’s status.  While the Bank appeared to forbid any traditional financial institutions from trading digital currencies themselves, it added that other merchants and bitcoin exchanges should be able to continue with their business, so long as they complied with the necessary Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.  As China’s oldest and largest bitcoin exchange, BTC China has always said it seeks to be open and compliant with any necessary regulations, so the new ID requirement is hardly surprising.  At the time of writing, its bitcoin price was listed as 4,778 CNY ($785).  Elsewhere  Mt. Gox  , one of the original bitcoin exchanges, and still one of the largest (despite its own regulatory headaches), has required ID with verificationhttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20130530.html for deposits and withdrawals in non-bitcoin currencies since May 2013.  Government fears of criminal activity involving large amounts of bitcoin and the abrupt closures of other, smaller exchanges have all led to a general reduction in anonymity for bitcoin users using online trading platforms.  Face-to-face trades of fiat currency for bitcoins via LocalBitcoins, Satoshi Squares and meetup groups, however, remain mostly anonymous and unregulated.

42397300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSGK,1386589806,Snoop Dogg Embraces Bitcoin for His Next Record,"Snoop Dogg, or 'Snoop Lion' as he is known in his latest reggae incarnation, is planning to make his next record available to buy in bitcoin.  Although he isn't exactly an economist, Snoop is an acclaimed artist and a force to be reckoned with in the record industry.  Last week Snoop Dogg tweeted that his next record will be “available in bitcoin and delivered in a drone”. The remark did not go unnoticed, and he got a few replies from bitcoin outfits interested in helping out, including Coinbase and BitPay. Snoop Dogg replied, asking for more information and saying that he wants to “make it happen”.    @coinbase dm your info. I want to make it happen.      — Snoop Dogg (@SnoopDogg) December 9, 2013    We aren't so sure about the drone, but perhaps Jeff Bezos will be willing to help out on that one.  Of course, this may just be a good old publicity stunt. However, the prospect of paying for a few albums on iTunes with bitcoin sounds tantalising to say the least.  Cryptocurrencies and downloadable content sound like a match made in heaven, but it is highly unlikely that the likes of Apple will embrace bitcoin anytime soon.  Like Amazon’s drones, bitcoin is still facing some technical and regulatory issues that will not be resolved overnight.  Oddly enough, bitcoin was also mentioned in The Simpsons last week. It's only fitting that a virtual entertainer brought up the virtual currency, so Krusty the Clown got the line.  While discussing his usual money woes with Lisa, the ever sarcastic Krusty said: “All it takes is some bad luck at the ponies, worse luck in the bitcoin markets, and heavy investments in a high-end bookmark company.”  It was hardly a flattering reference, but both Snoop and Krusty are proof that bitcoin is going mainstream. It is no longer a puzzling concept and a playground for geeks, it is becoming relevant to a much wider audience.

42397304,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSKG,1386583409,San Francisco Doctor Accepts Bitcoin to Protect Patient Privacy,"A doctor and former programmer is using bitcoin's revolutionary payment system as a new way to protect his patients’ privacy.  Earlier this year, Dr Paul Abramson's private practice, My Doctor Medical Group in San Francisco, began allowing patients to pay for their care with bitcoin.  The decision has meant that people who want to keep their healthcare private can hide their medical payments from their bank.  “Some patients wish to maintain extreme privacy regarding their medical care, and have identified that payment in bitcoin serves that end better than other methods,” Abramson told CoinDesk.  “We try to accommodate our patients' requests regarding their privacy as long as they are consistent with our own compliance with strict ethical and legal standards.”  A vocal advocate for privacy, Abramson says he first became aware of bitcoin in 2012. However, he admits his own personal use of the currency is “limited” and “mostly to buy cupcakes at the Cups & Cakes Bakery in San Francisco”.  Privacy-minded patients  “We started accepting bitcoin in early 2013. It was my idea, based on my interest in privacy issues and alternative currencies, and discussions with some of my privacy-minded patients,” he said.  On the My Doctor website, these patients are named as the “most discriminating clientele”.  The site goes on to explain  : “One important part of the confidentiality puzzle is payment. Using a credit or debit card to pay for [medical] services exposes your private information to the financial system and can’t be easily controlled.”  Abramson applies a similarly high standard of privacy to his own practice. He refused to say what payment processor his practice uses, though he admited they moved from a direct wallet approach “for logistical reasons”.  Significant interest  He is similarly tight-lipped about the volume of bitcoin trade his practice has done, except to say:  “We've had significant interest in our acceptance of bitcoin, but a smaller number of people who have actually had bitcoins with which to pay.”  Bitcoin has recently been making a few tentative inroads into the healthcare sector.  This Polish dentist offers a 10% discount to people who pay for treatment with bitcoi, while this Lithuanian orthopaedic surgery is waiting for its first bitcoin-paying patient after deciding to accept the currency in November.  Private sector  Given that the majority of health services in Western countries are free at the point of use, it’s unsurprising that clinics accepting bitcoin payments are in the parts of the health sector where patients pay directly on a treatment-by-treatment basis.  Take dentistry or plastic surgery for example, in November this cosmetic surgery clinic in Florida became the first of its kind to accept bitcoin, while this Argentinian dentist also accepts bitcoin payments.  Dr Abramson is the first to make the argument for using bitcoin in the healthcare arena, because of the privacy implications of being able to make anonymous payments.  In contrast, the clinics above all cited the “avoid transaction fees” argument.  It has been said time and time again that bitcoin isn't 100% anonymous, as a person’s transactions can be connected to their real-world identity when they convert bitcoin into a traditional currency, or vice-versa.  But for keeping information about your health between you, your doctor and nobody else, the very good anonymity granted by bitcoin could be very useful indeed.
