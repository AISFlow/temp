The industry has been facing a long lasted bear trend, with the flagship coin, Bitcoin, nearly down 70% then its ATH of November 2021. Still, the market fear has not ruined the investors&apos; interest in Bitcoin. Data shows that more than half of investors continue to keep their BTC holdings even in the crypto winter. According to the stats viewed by the blockchain analytic firm TipRank, 62% of BTC addresses have not sold their collection of BTC for a year or more. Additionally, the site data as of September 1 indicates that 32% of investors sold their BTC holdings during the previous 12 months.

42373924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWF2j,1662070039,Bitcoin Traders’ Outlook Is So Bleak That Some Analysts See a Buying Opportunity,"Even as signs mount that actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve are poised to drive down prices for risky assets, some crypto analysts are suggesting now might be a good time to make a contrarian bet on bitcoin’s (BTC) price rising.  “Several signals suggest that the crypto sell-off is getting overextended in the short term,” Vetle Lunde, an Arcane analyst, wrote in an end-of-month market report. “This represents an intriguing area to make contrarian short-term bets.”  Alex Thorn, crypto firm Galaxy Digital Group’s head of research, argued that even if a further crash was in the cards, traders who bought BTC in similarly grim occasions in bitcoin’s history could return a profit within as soon as a month. If the largest cryptocurrency by market value were to suddenly sell off, he pegs $17,000 as a key level that would provide strong price support. As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands around $20,000, well off the all-time high around $69,000 reached in November.  “While macroeconomic factors and monetary tightening can cause bitcoin to trade lower in the near term, for several reasons, both technical and fundamental, these levels should be considered opportunistic buying opportunities,” Thorn said in a report.  Cryptocurrencies are having a horrendous year, in line with traditional financial markets such as equities and bonds, amid high inflation and rising interest rates. Bitcoin has tumbled 57% in value this year, while the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped to below $1 trillion from the near-$3 trillion peak in November.  Despite the bleak economic outlook and Fed Chair Jerome Powell doubling down on plans for aggressive interest-rate hikes at last week’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium, a slew of crypto market metrics suggest that depressed prices may offer an attractive entry point.  Historic buying zone  BTC currently is trading below its 200-week moving average, at around $23,000. Over bitcoin’s pricing history, this has acted as a key level to identify value-buying opportunities and has only happened four times before: twice during the 2015 bear market, the 2018-19 market bottom and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic-induced crash.  Every time BTC sank below the average, investors who bought in had positive returns within a month.  “In the past, times when BTC/USD traded below its 200[-week moving average] have proven to be favorable buying opportunities across a range of time periods,” Thorn wrote.  Pain in the short term  As often happens in markets, when the majority of traders bet one way, prices go the other way.  Many crypto traders are expecting a further fall in bitcoin’s price, but the pessimism reached such extremes that the short selling position might prove to be crowded.  Evidence from the bitcoin derivatives market demonstrates that traders have positioned themselves for falling prices, the Arcane report added.  For example, the average daily offshore futures basis dropped negative for the first time since the March 2020 pandemic-induced market crash, indicating extraordinarily gloomy short-term sentiment.  The ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI), an exchange-traded fund where investors can profit on BTC’s price dropping, has experienced significant inflows in the last weeks and reached an all-time high fund size in late August, according to an Arcane analysis, while other funds that manage bitcoin have mostly seen outflows at the same time.  Bitcoin futures currently trade in backwardation; this happens when front-month contracts trade at a higher price than contracts with far-maturity, meaning that sellers dominate the market.  Funding rates for perpetual swaps turned negative and stayed there for the last two weeks, while open interest grew almost uninterrupted since the December 2021 correction.  “Everyone is hedging, and the short trade seems crowded when gauged through historical lenses,” Lunde said in the report. “A long BTC, [ether] ETH, or higher beta altcoin punt with a tight stop-loss [order] seems attractive here.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/01/bitcoin-traders-outlook-is-so-bleak-that-some-analysts-see-buying-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8444405b4b12da1ca2656f56a572a5c74788acea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411096,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC0Za,1662069114,Web3 Is Still Censoring Sex Workers,"Two strap-on dildos flop towards each other atop an image of the Sistine Chapel. The wearer, a woman in fishnets and blue nail polish, goes by Cryptonatrix, and she’s been selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) featuring adult content since late 2020, including this one, called the Sistine Chapel of Smut. But shortly after she first put this NFT up for sale on the marketplace Rarible, she says it disappeared.  Jessica Klein is a freelance writer who has been published in The New York Times, The Guardian and The Atlantic.This feature is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  “They censored me,” says Natrix. “It was really disappointing. I was more upset by the fact that no one else really seemed to care … because a lot of people have hope for this space and decentralization … working against censorship, but it became clear to me really early on that no one cares about that unless it affects them, and very few people would actually be willing to fight for the real values of decentralization.”  This can be a particularly relevant problem for marginalized sex workers, for whom the public rarely goes to bat. (Rarible did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.)  Web3 supposedly promises a new model of the internet, free from the restrictions that plague the centralized Web2 – but for sex workers, the same old patterns of censorship occur even in this brave new era.  “It's still the same, they still have to follow the same rules, they're still governed by FOSTA/SESTA, which means … they censor us, they don't allow us to be on their platform, they don't play nice with us,” says sex worker Allie Eve Knox, who started selling NFTs of her work in 2020. “Web3, any kind of technology, it's still not going to take that away.”  Knox, who describes herself on Twitter as a “vixen, goddess, cryptocutie and findomme,” says major NFT marketplaces “shadow ban” (or make less visible) sex workers’ content just like their Web2 social media counterparts. Plus, sex workers still have to rely on those social platforms, like Instagram and Twitter, to promote their NFTs to wider, adult content-buying audiences. And at the end of the day, the people collecting NFTs and extolling the virtues of Web3 still exist in a universe that marginalizes sex workers.  “So-called Web3 is really just a reflection of this bull&%$# dystopia that we live in, and I can’t expect things to be different [there],” says Cryptonatrix, who also goes by Natrix for short.  See also: Bitcoin's Censorship-Resistance Was a Step Change in History | Opinion  Still, some sex workers who’ve already sold NFTs aren’t giving up on their new revenue stream, even if it’s become an even smaller portion of their income during the ongoing crypto bear market.  “As long as there’s space for us to do our own thing, then we will do our own thing,” says Natrix, “because sex workers are always the most innovative people in whatever we’re doing, whether or not anyone else wants to take note of it.”  The state of sex worker NFTs  Sex workers and adult content creators have historically been among the first to embrace any new type of technology – from VCRs in the 1970s to bitcoin (BTC) in the early 2010s. Continuing that time-honored tradition, many dipped their toes into the recent NFT craze before the masses started going wild about Punks and Apes. But these bearish days, it’s not a particularly popular or profitable way for sex workers to make money.  Natrix estimates that fewer than 100 sex workers are actively minting NFTs right now, based on her experience engaging in the wider NFT community. But she stays away from the NFT platforms that specifically cater to sex workers (more on that later) like TreatDAO, CumRocket and Unique.Fans.  However, there are only a small handful of platforms like those, and one of the higher profile ones, NASFTY, has a website that’s currently “under renovation,” with no word on when it will return or in what form.  TreatDAO’s website lists “450+ creators,” but doesn’t specify how many of those are active users. In an email, a representative from CumRocket, which is still in beta, told CoinDesk that its platform currently has “8,703 buyers registered … and 2,027 creators.” SpankChain, the longest running Web3 company built for sex workers and adult content creators, has worked with about 60 models to mint and sell their NFTs, says Knox, who works with the platform.  Maya Kendrick, 26 and based in Los Angeles, made her first NFTs with the help of SpankChain in September 2021. “It was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be,” she says, because SpankChain handled all the technical aspects. Through her newly minted NFTs, Kendrick also found a way into the wider NFT world, where she describes other project creators as “super welcoming, and happy to have more sex workers in the space.”  Still, NFTs make up a tiny portion of her income. The same is true for Knox.  Adult-focused vs. general NFT platforms  Natrix has had more negative experiences working with “adult”-focused NFT platforms, specifically CumRocket, TreatDAO and Unique.Fans. She describes what she calls some “predatory behavior” by these sites’ operators, including “unprofessional” instances in which they requested content from adult creators before they’d officially joined the site. (A representative from CumRocket told CoinDesk over email that “creators are welcome to join the platform as long as they have a valid form of identification and are 18+ … they certainly do not have to send any free content.”)  Often, Natrix sees these sorts of sex worker-focused platforms as disingenuous. “A lot of them were coming up at this [same] time because … people know that sex workers always need new, better platforms, so they try to take advantage of that, and pretend they’re better [than non-sex worker-specific platforms], but they’re not,” she says.  Those less-specific NFT platforms, like OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare, tend not to be the most hospitable environments for sex workers hoping to promote their content. “We’re never going to be promoted on any homepage,” says Kendrick, as many big NFT marketplaces bury sexually explicit content.  As an OpenSea spokesperson put it, “Sexually graphic content, whether it concerns real people or representations, will be labeled 'NSFW,' meaning it will be available on OpenSea, but it won’t show in searches or as trending.” Collections containing “NSFW” content also cannot be verified on OpenSea.  Knox says SpankChain sold NFTs through OpenSea, and the platform “completely shadow-banned them.” The OpenSea spokesperson told CoinDesk via email, “There is no such thing as shadow-banning on OpenSea,” but acknowledges that the only way to find “NSFW creators and their content” on the platforms is by “clicking a direct link (shared outside of OpenSea).”  See also: Inside a Manhattan Web3 Sex Club | Sin Week  After having issues with OpenSea, Knox started listing her NFTs on Rarible. She says the platform has been “very cool” to her so far – she’s made sales there and has yet to be shadow-banned. She’s also since tested minting NFTs on the Near blockchain displayed on a site called Mintbase, which she’s found to be very welcoming.  “I was able to mint NFTs for less than 3 cents each,” she says. “The company not only retweeted and quote-tweeted, they reached out to me for feedback, welcomed me to the platform, answered my questions about nudity and content, and were so cool about me selling there.” Her work there, though, doesn’t so far feature any nudity.  For Kendrick, the key is moving away from big NFT platforms to making your own contracts as an adult creator – in her case using the NFT-minting tool Manifold. Writing your own NFT contracts instead of going to a platform like OpenSea or Rarible (which don’t require users to make their own contracts), gives creators the “most control possible” over their work, Kendrick says. That’s the real promise of Web3 – creators having more direct autonomy over their output, so they don’t have to rely on middlemen to make a living.  However, there’s a steep learning curve to realize that promise. When we spoke, Kendrick couldn’t walk me through the process of creating a smart contract with Manifold, because she’d only ever done it with Natrix when the two collaborated on an NFT.  Natrix, meanwhile, has created multiple NFTs using Manifold, where she’s become friendly with one of the developers. Still, she sees its shortcomings from a Web3 standpoint: “Technically, they’re still a middleman,” she says.  The future of adult NFTs?  There’s a lot of gray area when it comes to what does or doesn’t constitute “adult” or “NSFW” content. Sex workers often lament how platforms will categorize their nudes as NSFW even if they don’t appear particularly different from a photographer’s nude portraits. The latter, however, tends to get classified as art and remains searchable on NFT platforms.  The point among Web3 proponents, though, is that there shouldn’t be any larger powers deciding what’s “safe” for internet users to see, sell, and buy, and what isn’t – the future of the web is all about removing those gatekeepers.  Ultimately, creators like Kendrick see Web3 content platforms following in the footsteps of their Web2 counterparts – like OnlyFans, which started off as a marketplace primarily used by sex workers but then, once it gained popularity, threatened to boot them off the platform. “The people who run those platforms [are] still trying to operate them like businesses, and we are still a liability to those businesses,” she says.  There are other reasons why NFTs are far from the end-all-be-all for sex workers. The NFTs in a collectors’ wallets are public online, and buyers may not want others to see their wallets full of porn, Natrix suggests.  See also: The Truth About Crypto and Sex Work | Sin Week  That makes it harder for adult content creators to follow a classic NFT success model, wherein the buyers of a certain collection come together to boost the project and each other’s purchases to foster community and drive up the value of the work in which they’ve all invested. “Collectors don’t rally around sexual content,” Natrix says.  All that considered – not to mention the current bear market – the creators who spoke with CoinDesk plan to continue selling NFTs. The technology represents another possible revenue avenue for sex workers, and with their precarious position on so many platforms in both Webs 2 and 3, sex workers can always use more options.  “You go on the platforms that will take you until they won't anymore,” Kendrick says. “I understand sex workers who are using any platform they can until they get shut down from it.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/01/web3-is-still-censoring-sex-workers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ab1a2367ed38e714799bd197799a41743a44e41-889x667.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42373913,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEot,1662069007,Social Media Giant Snap Disbands Web3 Team Amid Mass Layoffs,"Snap (SNAP) is disbanding its Web3 team in a move to slash costs in the face of sharply reduced growth.  Jake Sheinman, co-founder of Snap’s Web3 team, revealed the social media giant’s plans in a tweet announcing his departure from the company on Thursday.  “As a result of the company restructure, decisions were made to sunset our [W]eb3 team,” the tweet read.  Sheinman did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Snap CEO Evan Spiegel revealed executives were worried about the company’s underperformance in July, after the company released its second-quarter earnings.  “Our financial results for Q2 do not reflect the scale of our ambition,” the company acknowledged in a note to investors. “We are not satisfied with the results we are delivering.”  Snap’s Q2 revenue of $1.11 billion, while up 13% from the same quarter last year, came in far below the company’s previous guidance of 20% to 25% and was below analyst estimates.  On Wednesday, weeks after sharing the numbers, Spiegel announced Snap would lay off 20% of its workforce.  “The extent of this reduction should substantially reduce the risk of ever having to do this again, while balancing our desire to invest in our long-term future and reaccelerate our revenue growth,” Spiegel wrote.  The layoffs are expected to hit Snap’s augmented reality (AR) Spectacles team particularly hard, bringing the company’s honeymoon with AR to an abrupt end.  Snapchat’s Spectacles AR glasses launched in 2016, three years after the company rolled out Lenses, its custom AR filters. Last year, the company acquired WaveOptics, the supplier of the AR displays used in Snap’s Spectacles, for more than $500 million, the company’s largest acquisition of 2021.  As recently as July, the company also planned to experiment with a feature that would allow people to import NFTs to Snapchat as AR filters, but it's unclear whether that initiative will move forward amid the forthcoming layoffs.

Market Fear Springs","For the longest stretch of days since the cryptocurrency market was shaken by unrest in July, Bitcoin has dropped below US$20,000 for a sixth straight trading session. On Thursday, the value of the biggest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 3.1% to $19,577. Bitcoin In Free Fall The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been in free fall for the previous ten days as concerns over Wednesday&apos;s FOMC minutes drove its price below $20,000.

42373916,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEtv,1662067390,Second Round of Layoffs at Brazilian Crypto Unicorn 2TM,"2TM – the holding company for Brazil's largest crypto exchange by valuation, Mercado Bitcoin – laid off 15% of its workforce, or about 100 employees on Thursday.  “The economic adversity continues,” said the company in a statement. It’s the second round of job cuts this summer for 2TM, which in June let go of more than 80 workers.  Speaking with CoinDesk, the company also took note of “unbalanced competition” in which foreign crypto exchanges are not following the same reporting and know-your-customer (KYC) standards as domestic players.  “The competitive environment remains deteriorated and unfair, lacking the approval of the legal framework for crypto-activities, as players following the law are penalized by companies that ignore local rules,” said 2TM.  Brazil's Chamber of Deputies has yet to vote on a crypto bill already approved by the local Senate in April. ABCripto, an association of domestic exchanges, has asked the Chamber of Deputies to demand exchanges to already have an employer identification number in order to apply for a license in Brazil. Overseas exchanges – Binance among them – oppose this measure.  Other crypto-related companies in Latin America announcing layoffs recently include crypto exchange Bitso – Mercado Bitcoin's main competitor in Brazil – and Argentina-based exchange Buenbit, which slashed 45% of its staff.  Mercado Bitcoin in July 2021 raised $200 million in a Series B funding round, which at the time valued 2TM at $2.1 billion.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell 1% on Thursday, temporarily falling below the psychologically important $20,000 level. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has above and below $20K for the last six trading days.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin, rose 1.5% on the day. ETH has been essentially flat over the last three trading days, with above-average volume occurring only during Monday’s decline. Since Monday’s close, ETH’s price has moved approximately 1%.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Global Macro: U.S. initial jobless claims of 232,000 in August were below consensus expectations of 248,000, and down from 237,000 in July.  Continuing jobless claims for August were 1.44 million, matching the consensus, but also exceeding July’s figure of 1.41 million.  For digital assets, the better-than-expected jobs data is not likely to serve as a bullish catalyst. Given the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) resolve to slow inflation, stronger employment data is likely to lead to increased consumer demand. The result of this increase (i.e., more dollars chasing a basket of goods) is likely to push prices higher.  According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 75 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate during the FOMC’s next meeting on Sept. 21 have increased to 72%, from 69% a day earlier.  U.S. Equities: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were mixed on Thursday. The Nasdaq fell .3%, while the DJIA and S&P 500 rose 0.46% and 0.30%, respectively.  Commodities: Crude oil prices fell for the third consecutive day, declining 3.7% to $86 per barrel. Natural gas finished 0.61% higher, while the price of safe-haven asset gold as well as copper fell 1% and 3%, respectively.  Altcoins were mixed. Polygon (MATIC) rose 4.5% while maker (MKR) and solana (SOL), decreased 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Absent Near-Term Catalysts, Institutions May See Current Valuations as Attractive  Bitcoin was recently trading below $20,000 on Thursday, continuing a flat trading range that began on Aug. 27. While the price of BTC has traded above and below $20,000 in each of the last six days, in the aggregate the price has moved just 2%.  The average true range (ATR) for BTC has fallen from 2,065 in June, to a current level of 903. ATR is a technical indicator that measures the absolute value of price movement over a period of time. Increasing ATR levels signal increased volatility while a declining ATR (which we currently have) indicates the opposite.  The compression in volatility for BTC, combined with moderate to below-average volume and proximity to its $21,000 point of control (discussed in Wednesday's Market Wrap), or price level with substantial activity, signals a continuation of sideways trading behavior in the near future.  Given the oft-mentioned macroeconomic overhang, BTC doesn’t seem to have a bullish catalyst at the moment.  BTC’s low valuation, however, may be enticing institutions to start buying, particularly as the crypto landscape continues to mature. Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of investment firm IDX, called the current crypto climate a potential buying opportunity:  “With more visible development happening in the crypto ecosystem, many institutional investors are starting to view the current crypto 'winter' as similar to the period after the 'dot.com' bust which ultimately ended up being a generational buying opportunity for technology stocks,” McMillan said.  McMillan added that investors are seeing more interest in cryptos than other assets partly because of their longer-term prospects.  “Investors are still certainly focused on the near-terms risks, but we're definitely seeing a greater appreciation for the growth potential going forward which definitely isn't shared with other asset classes,"" he said.  A look at BTC’s “Commitment of Traders” data shows that larger speculators (i.e., institutional money) are indeed beginning to enter into long positions. The report, published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) each Tuesday provides a weekly snapshot of positions held by traders in futures markets.  The positions of small speculators are denoted in blue, while positions of larger speculators (i.e., institutions) are denoted in green. A look at BTC’s weekly chart shows large speculators moving into a net long position following the 15% decline during the week ended Aug. 19.

42373905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEep,1662063975,Crypto Developer Brothers Leave VC Firm After CoinDesk Exposé,"The Macalinao brothers, two prolific cryptocurrency builders who boosted their once-mighty stablecoin exchange Saber using a web of secret identities and later pivoted to startup investing with a $100 million fund, have left their venture capital firm.  Ian and Dylan, the original co-founders and general partners of Protagonist VC, “are no longer affiliated with the fund or any of its affiliates,” the fund confirmed to CoinDesk. A spokesperson declined to provide a date for their departure but said the brothers are not investors in Protagonist. The brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.  Their departure is a turnabout for a newcomer crypto VC that has already begun to accumulate capital and a growing portfolio of crypto startups. It has invested heavily in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects building on the Aptos blockchain; the Macalinao brothers are seen as influential by the that up-and-coming ecosystem's developers.  The Macalinao brothers built their reputation in the Solana blockchain community. In early 2021 they created a decentralized exchange for swapping stablecoins called Saber that at its zenith purported to represent $4.15 billion (nearly half) of the crypto value locked up on Solana. Part of the allure of Saber was the interlocking DeFi lego bricks that surrounded it: projects like Sunny, Quarry, Cashio, Goki, and Tribeca.  As CoinDesk reported in August, Saber’s purportedly independent projects were all developed by Ian under various pseudonyms in an attempt to drive more value into the Saber ecosystem. In a never-published blog post Ian wrote after one of those projects imploded, he described a “scheme” to double-count deposits using platforms built by anonymous profiles that were actually him.

42373909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEjr,1662063430,"DeFi Platform Kyber Network Discloses $265K Exploit, Vows to Reimburse All Funds","Kyber, a multi-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, discovered a vulnerability to its website code that allowed exploiters to run away with approximately $265,000.  Two “whale” addresses appeared to be impacted by the attack, according to Kyber, which plans to reimburse the losses. Kyber said it discovered the exploit, which let attackers insert a “false approval, allowing a hacker to transfer a user’s funds to his address,” on Sept. 1 and “neutralized” the threat within two hours.  The exploit hit KyberSwap, a decentralized exchange that allows users to swap between currencies on different blockchains. KyberSwap’s blockchain contracts were not affected. The problem stemmed from malicious Google Tag Manager code in the KyberSwap website, according to a statement from Kyber.  “We strongly urge all #DeFi projects to conduct a thorough check on your frontend code & associated Google Tag Manager (GTM) scripts as the attacker may have targeted multiple sites,” Kyber tweeted.

The &apos;derivatives exchange reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently sitting in the wallets of all derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means investors are depositing their coins into these exchanges right now. Since BTC going up on derivatives generally leads to an increase in leverage, such a trend can result in higher volatility in the price of the crypto. On the other hand, the value of the indicator registering a decline implies coins are exiting derivatives exchanges as holders are withdrawing them. This kind of trend may precede a more calmer BTC price.

Lawmakers and governments had reached agreement on the main outline of the legislation, which requires crypto asset providers to register with regulators in to offer services across the bloc, on June 30. But in the absence of a final legal text there is still considerable uncertainty on the law's finer points, such as whether the rules will apply to non-fungible tokens (NFT), which offer proof of ownership of assets such as artworks using distributed ledger technology.  The law is set to create parameters for how each of the European Union's member nations regulates crypto. It's expected to create a common licensing regime, making it easier for companies operating in one member nation to launch in the others, as well as define rules for issues such as stablecoin issuance.  Berger, a German politician who led negotiations for the European Parliament on MiCA, told an online panel hosted by German lobby group Bundesblock that technical work is still underway on the law, which will only start to apply 18 months after being gazetted in the EU’s official journal.  Read more: Here's What Still Needs to Happen Before the EU's MiCA Bill Becomes Law  “I’d say in four to six weeks” the text will be ready, Berger said. “We’re all working on it, eight hours a day, it’s in the process ... but I think in six weeks we should have something ready to present.”  Under the final deal, any crypto service provider with over 15 million active users would be subject to supervision at the European level, Berger said – suggesting all but the largest players will remain under the watch of national regulators like Germany’s Bafin.  But Berger also cast doubt on how exactly NFTs will be treated under the law. The industry is worried premature regulation could choke a nascent and developing sector if the law requires specialized NFT platforms like OpenSea to seek authorization.  “We decided to leave NFTs out” of the law, unless they resemble conventional financial assets, Berger said.  His remarks contrast with those made by European Commission officials – who have suggested the final carveout is narrow, meaning that in practice most NFTs will fall under the law.  In the meantime, crypto market players are waiting to know the exact answer.  “The devil is in the details” for the MiCA law, Patrick Hansen, a crypto venture advisor at Presight Capital, told the event.  If NFTs that are part of a collection or series are to be regulated, Hansen said, “when you look at the current NFT market, this is the vast majority, 95% or more.”  Quotations from Berger and Hansen have been translated from German.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | WALLET,"Jack Schickler, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/01/eus-mica-crypto-law-text-ready-within-6-weeks-lead-lawmaker-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36e170ca660f334faa49de5f684be82948a37ec8-6667x5000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The declines starting about mid-month came after the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting strongly suggested that the central bank will continue to try to fight inflation aggressively.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, sank about 13% for the month, and ether fell about 20%. Yet, data shows that not all cryptocurrencies performed poorly largely because of positive news events involving them. The price increases in a bear market underscore the independence of individual projects to evolve and engage investors with important changes.  Chiliz – a token issued by blockchain-enabled sports entertainment platform Socios.com – was the month’s biggest winner. Its native CHZ token jumped 75.8% in August, according to CoinMarketCap’s data, as the platform received regulatory approval to operate in Italy.  Cosmos’ ATOM token also outperformed the broader crypto market, rising 14.5%. The increase came after the project said it will announce its tokenomics redesign at its upcoming conference in Medellin, Colombia, in late September.  Antelope’s announcement that it would be used as the supporting protocol for EOSIO-based blockchains spurred the 3.6% surge in the EOS token last month. Meanwhile, the price of decred rose 5.1%.  Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, an asset-management firm, called news-related price spikes “healthy to see in terms of asset dispersion” among investors.  “It's interesting because in a bear market, technically, a lot of the tokenomics changes tend to be what drives one's price changes that we see a lot more of, versus in the bull market where it's kind of like any old announcement and people get really excited,” Talati said, referring to the correlation between Cosmos’ tokenomics redesign and its token's price increase.  Negative news leads to price dips  Yet bad news was behind the price declines of other major altcoins. A $6 million exploit on the Solana platform leading to the theft of tokens from more than 9,000 hot wallets in early August led to SOL’s 25.7% decline in August.

42373908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEib,1662056621,Celsius’ Third Bankruptcy Hearing Yields Little in the Way of Customer Relief,"Crypto lender Celsius Networks' customers still want their money back, but a judge appears to be in no hurry to authorize withdrawals – at least right now.  Much of Thursday's three-hour hearing focused on whether custodial account holders should be able to get their funds back, and which types of custodial account holders qualify. Celsius clients believe any custodial account holder – meaning any customer who deposited their funds in a custody account but retained ownership of the assets, as opposed to Earn and Borrow customers who expected some sort of yield or benefit – should receive their funds.  Celsius maintains that only ""pure"" custodial account holders are eligible, and not customers who originally deposited funds in the Earn product and later converted to custody.  Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius Faces Another Group of Customers Who Want Their Money Back  The distinction is important because the lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 89 days after it introduced its custodial wallet to customers. Funds transferred 90 days prior to Celsius’ filing for bankruptcy might be subject to clawback under U.S. law.  Celsius depositors were suspicious of the timing of the filing, but a Kirkland & Ellis lawyer, representing Celsius, denied it was intentional, saying there were “no conspiracies.”  Judge Martin Glenn, of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, did not make a ruling on the matter, and tried several times to end the back-and-forth arguments on the subject.  “The judge is kicking the can down the road,” said Erik Mendelson, director of Blockchain Business Development at OneOf, told CoinDesk. “He wants Celsius' proposal and [the Custody account holders'] declaratory judgement request merged and a court date set to resolve this specific issue.”  Another hearing for the ongoing bankruptcy case is scheduled for Sept. 14, 2022, though the judge also suggested a separate session to hash out the differences may be beneficial. There is also a hearing scheduled for Oct. 6, 2022, to discuss the custody account holders. Both Celsius and the custody account holders will make proposals ahead of that discussion.  In addition to the debate over customer funds, attorneys also discussed how much customer information would be made public as the case progresses. Judge Glenn was initially opposed to redacting creditor email addresses and home addresses on the public docket, but softened after hearing arguments from both sides about the cybersecurity risks. No final decision was made.  Celsius also said it expects some amount of cash relief due to the expected return of a $61 million loan, initially believed to be in stablecoins.  “Those funds are expected to come back into the estate in cash as opposed to in coin,” a lawyer for Celsius told the court. “It’s a minor technicality that happens to help out the company’s cash liquidity.”  Read more: Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Now Says It Likely Has Enough Cash to Last Through End of Year  The judge later took aim at Celsius law firm Kirkland & Ellis over the crypto lender's cash and asset management track record when one of Celsius’ lawyers was discussing the company’s “robust” accounting practices.  “The debtors’ transparency on where the crypto is being held is lacking,” Judge Glenn said.

42421464,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPiH,1662054190,Beyond the Silk Road: Crypto Needs a Regulatory Course Correction,"For all the hype of recent years, the crypto-asset sector does not have a history of showing itself in the best light.  From its genesis in 2009, bitcoin (BTC) was quickly appropriated by criminals intent on making it their currency of choice for prohibited goods. While public-facing responses by governments telegraphed an air of unconcern, internal reactions were quite different. In the early 2010s, I sat in meetings with intelligence professionals muttering about darknet markets using invisible funds that were impossible to trace. This sort of thing tends to put law enforcement on edge, and so it remains.  Joby Carpenter is the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists' global subject matter expert in crypto assets, illicit finance and emerging threats, with 20 years of experience in strategic policy making. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Sin Week.  The perception that crypto is under the sway of criminals has never gone away despite data indicating that illicit activity is at an all-time low compared with legitimate usage. As the application of crypto assets has expanded to include an array of services typically conducted by the traditional financial sector, institutional takeup has grown alongside public adoption and the volume of illegal crypto-transactions has declined proportionally.  The reasons for this shift are structural. It turns out that money laundering, long a primary concern of financial regulators, is harder to do in the crypto sector than we once believed.  For one, crypto’s traceability is a consequence of the fact that blockchain technology serves as a public ledger mapping transactions on a global scale – a function that law enforcement now sees as invaluable.  See also: In Defense of Crime | Opinion  Criminals also face mundane barriers to adoption, including the question of whether low liquidity and price volatility make crypto worth the trouble. In many ways, the risks of the sector are looking more and more like those of cash.  Profit motive  It often seems as if crypto is supportive of crime, or at least neutral to it. And in cases where regulations are followed, founders might best be called reluctant good citizens. Profit seems to be the ultimate guiding principle, not compliance or safety.  Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital and, most strikingly, Terra have all been brought to ground by dubious business models, questionable working practices and a “profit-first” attitude. This has emboldened skeptics who loudly decry crypto assets as a Ponzi scheme or, at best, a solution in search of a problem.  Yet, glimmers of a broader acceptance can still be found. As recent headlines have noted, crypto platforms have facilitated humanitarian funding to Ukraine and Afghanistan. Human-rights advocates have lauded the technology for providing payment rails in unstable economies. Even non-fungible tokens (NFT) have been praised for protecting vulnerable individuals.  This raises the question: Will the crypto sector’s most prominent figures – the individuals sometimes pejoratively described as “crypto bros” – be willing to abandon their laissez-faire attitudes and embrace governmental expectations?  Because if not, it is reasonable to assume the industry’s rocky relationship with law enforcement and regulators won’t be improving soon.  For an example of this, consider the industry’s difficulties meeting registration requirements under national anti-money laundering (AML) laws. While the steps for registration are typically simple, some firms have failed to take them in the apparent belief that they should not be obligated to comply with such rules on a global scale, particularly if the regulations vary across jurisdictions.  Course correction  It’s a problem of the industry’s own making and one that has not gone unnoticed by regulators or the banks that serve as counterparties to cryptocurrency exchanges. In other words, without a course correction more crypto firms will fail when they could have stayed solvent by investing in their AML controls.  That isn’t an inevitability, however. Crypto-asset providers can come in from the cold of the “crypto winter” and demonstrate that they can make the technology both functional and safe.  What can the sector do to improve its standing? Implementing a top-down compliance culture, adequate training and strong risk management controls can ameliorate concerns, though more may be needed to address the damage already done.  To better engage with supervisors, firms should consider testing and validating business models through government-led sandbox exercises that allow for two-way dialogue. Companies should also make clear that they will share intelligence on fraud, market abuse and money laundering threats with regulators and their competitors whenever possible.  See also: When White Hat Hackers Go Bad | Opinion  Market abuse should be treated as a serious threat from organized crime groups and not merely a problem created by unsophisticated opportunists.  Another piece of advice for crypto firms: Stop shielding your products with caveat emptor (buyer beware). If market conditions require tweaking your business model, update your financial-crime risk appetite to reflect that reality. Regulators will appreciate it.  More than anything, the industry should consider whether it wishes to continue to be associated with the Silk Roads of the world or embrace its inherent ability to trace illicit funds and fight financial crime.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Joby Carpenter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/01/beyond-the-silk-road-crypto-needs-a-regulatory-course-correction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/408f8c96e4a00992e965e400aee072d5c8400f76-5333x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421469,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPnR,1662054002,Just Pay Your Taxes,"On Wednesday the first lawsuit using a new whistleblower rule was unsealed, showing that Michael Saylor, the founder and executive chairman of software intelligence firm MicroStrategy (MSTR), is being sued by the District of Columbia attorney general for allegedly trying to evade paying more than $25 million in taxes. The lawsuit, covered on network television news, has stirred concerns that MicroStrategy and/or Saylor may be forced to liquidate some of their bitcoin, putting downward pressure on the crypto’s price.  “As MicroStrategy is one of the biggest Bitcoin holders, crypto investors began to panic about whether Michael Saylor would have to liquidate some Bitcoin to pay for the consequential fines,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in a note.  The fears seem overdone, for now, for a few reasons. But the action should serve as a reminder to crypto boosters that – even though they may hold non-confiscatable assets – they ought to pay their taxes in full. Tax avoidance schemes are legal loopholes, but require significant planning and commitment. (CoinDesk published a comprehensive guide to crypto taxes earlier this year.)  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Further, now that the U.S. government is both signaling increased interest in overseeing the crypto industry and is revamping the Internal Revenue Service – it’s reasonable to assume you’re being watched.  The lawsuit alleges that Saylor perpetrated a scheme for the past decade to avoid taxes to Washington, D.C., claiming he was a resident of Virginia and Florida, two lower-tax jurisdictions. The investigators came to the opposite conclusion, after being tipped off, by tracking Saylor’s private jet flight records, social media posts and from unattributed conversations with Saylor’s peers, in which he supposedly said people were “fools” for paying their income taxes.  The court document doesn’t provide a full amount Saylor, if found guilty, may have to cough up. But he’d owe all unpaid Washington, D.C., taxes for eight years, compounded annual 10% interest payments, a separate civil penalty of $11,000 for each violation and other fines for fraud. That could total upwards of a $100 million, according to the Office of the Attorney General.  The fear that this action could somehow lead to a liquidation crisis in bitcoin (BTC) are a bit unfounded, and tend to confuse the former MicroStrategy CEO (he stepped down last month) with his company. First, the government has to win its case, which might involve unfairly applying the recently passed False Claims Act, one expert cited by the Wall Street Journal said.  It also assumes Saylor couldn’t cover a multimillion-dollar liability, that he’d liquidate his BTC rather than any of the mansions or yachts he owns, and also dump it on the market rather than selling in tranches to avoid slippage. The government must also prove MicroStrategy is implicated in Saylor’s scheme.  Apparently, in 2014, the attorney general claims, MicroStrategy’s then-chief financial officer was “uneasy with this chicanery” and confronted Saylor about the potential corporate liability for his personal tax evasion. In a response, MicroStrategy called the lawsuit Saylor’s “personal tax matter” and said it had no responsibility for “his day-to-day affairs.”  See also: Crypto Startup Salaries: Here’s How Much Devs and Others Get Paid  Saylor also denied the claims, and reiterated he lives in Florida, not in a historic Georgetown mansion or on a yacht docked on the Potomac River, as claimed.  The fears, similar to rumors that forthcoming payouts for Mt. Gox depositors will crater bitcoin’s price, stem from MicroStrategy’s systemic importance in bitcoin. The company spent about $4 billion acquiring BTC, which turned its stock into a bona fide bitcoin exchange-trade fund (ETF). But the company is still well-capitalized and has been generating cash for years. The liquidation price for its bitcoin is around $3,000, company reps said.  Is any of this out of the question for a former CEO that was convicted of accounting fraud? That recommended people sell their homes to buy bitcoin? That leveraged up on his company’s bitcoin stockpile? I mean, let the courts, not social media, decide. In typical Saylor fashion, he apparently once called the District of Columbia “the most powerful city on Earth.” The man has a penchant for overstatement.  The worst case scenario is that bitcoin sees greater than average selling pressure, but that seems unlikely given Saylor's known commitment to the network. This fear, not exactly widespread, seems like the type of pessimism seen during bear markets – where investors are on edge and begin assuming some other crisis is sure to happen.  One thing is certain, for anyone else who isn’t bordering on megalomania is to… just pay your taxes.

This Alabama Regulator Is Fighting Back,"Crypto investors have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into buying up virtual land – and thieves are taking note. According to Joseph Borg, a financial regulator in Alabama, metaverse real estate scammers pose a danger to investors in his home state.  “There are offers for [metaverse] real estate [scams] where they’ll tell you, ‘Get in now while it's hot before the price goes up,’ and everybody buys it and you're left out,’” said Borg, the longtime director of the Alabama Securities Commission. “I put that right up there next to the one that's selling real estate on the moon.”  Indeed, the crypto-verse has a potpourri of “metaverses” from Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape-themed Otherside realm (over $800 million in lifetime land sales) to Decentraland ($330 million), The Sandbox ($295 million) and more. One dashboard on crypto data site Dune counts the top 32 virtual worlds.  That’s not to say these land sales are inherently fraudulent. Speculators aside, some investors see value in buying a piece of digital real estate and then building their virtual worlds atop their plot. Decentraland is full of otherworldly architecture and virtual shtick.  Read more: BAYC Team Raises $285M With Otherside NFTs, Clogs Ethereum  But some of those builders are allegedly fraudulent. In May, Borg’s ASC and four other state-level financial regulators ordered a metaverse casino with alleged Russian connections to cease sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The regulators claimed the casino, called the Flamingo Casino Club, was a front for scammers.  Actually locking up the alleged scammers is another matter.  In order to stick it to the scammers, regulators must first identify them, Borg told CoinDesk. But doing so can be tough in the metaverse, where fraudsters can cloak themselves in the veil of internet anonymity, which these days means masquerading in sometimes zany ways, Borg said.  “Saying [we're going to] issue an order against the guy who looks like a duck with a hat on in the metaverse doesn't do us any good,” Borg said. “We got to track down a computer, trace it and figure out where their money's going and how they're operating.”  In the absence of identifiable persons of interest, and left with little legal recourse as a result, the ASC has issued an advisory cautioning people about the dangers of investing in potential metaverse scams.  That doesn’t mean the commission, which has muscled crypto’s bad actors before, has given up on tracking criminals, however. Borg said ASC is still gunning to put a lid on metaverse real estate scams and hopes to issue orders against those involved in the scams once they can be identified.  Read more: Alabama: The Unlikely Frontline for America's Crypto Fraud Crackdown  And while those efforts are underway, the commission is taking steps to educate would-be investors about how the metaverse really works.  “It’s ‘get into the real estate market now because everybody's going to want a piece,’” Borg said. “But, of course, you can create as much [real estate] as you want, because you can have a multitude of metaverses, but people don't understand that yet.”  The Flamingo Club Casino case, and many like it, Borg says, demonstrates how the metaverse can be not only a land of opportunity, but also a land of large losses, especially for the uninformed investor.  “Bad actors are now leveraging interest in [metaverse] opportunities and products,” Borg said in a press release Wednesday. “Virtual reality can leave you virtually broke.”  Read more: Metaverse Real Estate – Next Big Thing or Next Big Boondoggle?",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/01/metaverse-scammers-have-a-bridge-to-sell-you-this-financial-regulator-is-fighting-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/529523994b073558942d6c132ddf3bbe0b86391a-1897x1423.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Part of this slow adoption can be attributed to the technology&apos;s inherent traits: that it occurs very gradually until 8-10% before exploding in usage.

42411092,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC0Sy,1662048707,'I Would Never Date a Crypto Guy Again.' What Women Say About Dating in Crypto,"“I would never date a crypto guy again,” said a software engineer based in New York after she ended a seven-month relationship with the founder of a Web3 startup.  The stereotypical “crypto bro” – defined by the Urban Dictionary as “a person with a weak grasp on cryptocurrency applications yet has strong-formed opinions on the ‘best’ ones’” – is known to have committed at least a few of the biblical seven deadly sins: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  He is the sloth, because the goal is to be rich, not look rich. He is greedy, because he is always tweeting about coins going “to the moon.” He is a gluttonous twentysomething partygoer, always overindulging in the open bar. He is wrathful, always seemingly able to start a fight on Crypto Twitter. Lastly, he is proud. Proudly displaying an NFT (non-fungible token) in his studio apartment that he claims to be contemporary art, which he loudly bought for six-figures when his favorite celebrity quietly changed their profile picture to a cartoon monkey.  Yes, these “sins'' can be found in every human being in every industry. But why is it so prominent in crypto?  For CoinDesk’s Sin Week, a software engineer, a theater performer and a weathered crypto sis share their experiences of dating men in crypto … and how that turned out.  My Web3 ex went on fake business trips with imaginary money  A New York software engineer met up with a 23-year-old Ivy League dropout … ahem Web3 startup founder from the West Coast. She went in for a “casual business meeting.” He thought it was a date. The romance blossomed from there. (For privacy reasons, we’re not revealing any real names here.)  He was charming and charismatic, and most importantly, investors loved him. But for the software engineer, not so much.  “He was invited to a lot of very upscale events with potential investors,” she said. But, he always traveled solo because these parties always came up at the last minute. They tended to be in Austin, Texas, Puerto Rico or Atlanta, and they always happened to be on a yacht.  Read more: How to Pay for Porn With Crypto  But he didn’t mind all that traveling, she said. These “business trips” were financed by his dad, his de facto angel investor. “His dad really wanted him to go back to school and get a corporate job,” she said. “And that created a lot of tension for them.”  Working in a traditional 9-5 job and with almost-zero experience in crypto, she couldn’t sympathize with his skewed outlook on money or with the fact that he never had a wage-earning job. And the cherry on top? “He would wear very cheap clothing. He put in no effort,” she said. “And it was [supposed to be] a power move.”  Toward the end of the relationship, his company grew by crazy valuations. But, he ditched it to start a new one, around the same time the romance died.  “I’m really not interested in ever dating a crypto guy ever again,” she said.  “I was really frustrated by the ‘be your own boss’ mindset,” she added. She said being a founder “really changes how you perceive yourself and what you expect from other people … and he carried that into his personal relationships.”  After seven months of dating and many regrets, the software engineer did learn something about the crypto men: They pride themselves on accomplishing more than they actually have and without acknowledging their privileges in life.  My sugar daddy really wanted to be my hotshot coindaddy  The 24-year-old actress/waitress in New York started talking to a guy she met on seeking.com at the height of the pandemic. He immediately asked for her CashApp and she assumed that he was a bot.  After receiving $1,500 on CashApp, she met up with her sugar daddy in New York. He was a married man in his 40s.  The perks were obvious at first: 10-course tasting menus and $500 cash at the end of each meeting. Then, he wanted to give her something better than cash – bitcoin.  He is the sloth, because the goal is to be rich, not look rich.  “I know you don’t know a lot about this,” he told her, “but I do, and I know this is going to be good for you.”  “To this day, I’m still not totally sure what he did [for a living],” she said, though she recalls a lot of phone calls being made to China.  Sugar daddies on seeking.com, the “best site for attractive and successful people,” are especially interested in sugar babies in creative fields, the theater performer says. “Because a lot of these people have like … dreams that never came true,” she said.  But this sugar daddy was more interested in being her “hotshot mentor,” who teaches her about bitcoin and crypto. He wasn’t trying to give her crypto to hide their transactions from his wife, she clarified. “It was like a very fatherly thing,” she said, because her sugar daddy was thinking about investing in her future.  “For people who understand this stuff a little less … I don’t want this imaginary coin,” she said. “I want [money], and I want it now.”  In the end, he wanted more intimacy than she could give. She broke it off. And she never received the bitcoin.  My paper hands ex-boyfriend told me to sell, so I dumped him  For the more weathered crypto sis, there’s nothing worse than dating a newly converted crypto bro who’s talking about dollar cost averaging at the top.  The 42-year-old hair and makeup artist made a lot of money trading crypto during the bull market. She was living the dream life on a beach in Puerto Rico, sans capital-gains taxes.  In 2016, she bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin on Coinbase, because her boyfriend at the time had “serious regrets” about not investing in crypto early. So she wanted to show him that it wasn’t too late.  But, “he never entered the game,” she said. “I took all the risk, and then I had to hear about how it was not responsible.”  In the end, the guy who thought he missed the boat convinced her to sell at a loss. “It really bummed me out,” she said. “And then I had to break up with him because what choice did I have?”  When your outlook on money isn’t aligned with your partner’s, your relationship is doomed, she said.  Fast forward two bull markets later: She made her way to “crypto haven” where it’s full of people concentrated on the future of funny money.  But the crypto community on the island is so small that you could build a reputation if you had been a “cynical bitch” to someone who just wanted to talk crypto on a date. For instance, she held back from saying “are you sure?” on a date with a bro who had put all his money in a meme coin. “I can basically predict the future of what this person would be like in a relationship,” she said. “I wouldn’t be able to trust him to be serious.”  But, the worse bro of all, is a crypto newbie preaching about DCAing (dollar cost averaging).  “The non-newbie in me said ‘Oh honey, just you wait. You’ll be crying like the rest of us soon,’” she said.  And she was right.  She later faced a $100,000-plus loan on crypto lender Celsius Network that she couldn’t pay back. And as the entire crypto market began to collapse over the summer, it “paralyzed” her to continue trading.  Luckily, a hedge fund manager she had met at a crypto meetup was generous enough to help her get out of her loan. He told her to “take the money, trade it for a couple of years, then pay me back.”  The makeup artist is now long ethereum, holding ETH tightly with the intention of paying the hedge fund guy back.  The allure of dating in crypto and Web3  All these “sins” seem to be superficial when you think about the typical crypto bro.  “You’re seeing a lot of people who didn’t have access to certain things now have the ability to access it and make full use of it,” said a founder of a dating decentralized autonomous organization who goes by the name v1. “That is a very big depiction of … the superficial demonstration of wealth.”  So what is the actual allure of dating someone in crypto and Web3?  He is wrathful, always seemingly able to start a fight on Crypto Twitter.  A 2022 eToro survey found 33% of respondents said they would be inclined to date someone who mentioned crypto in their dating profile (the sort of result you might expect from a company selling the crypto lifestyle). And only 20% said they would view it as a turn off.  All these negative characteristics are more prominent “because we’re very flashy about it on social media,” v1 said.  So much of Web3 is about leaving behind your Web2 identities and so much of crypto is your online personality, she said. Your opinion is going to have penetrating effects, especially when you blast your views to a whole subsection of the internet known as Crypto Twitter.  But that increasingly digital identity isn’t necessarily a bad thing. V1 says it could actually make dating more secure and accessible.  “I’m going to sound like a total crypto bro right now,” she jokingly said. “But, attraction is mutually zero-knowledge.”  Just like the original ethos of Bitcoin is to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions where the identity of the sender and receiver wasn’t important or needed, in the modern dating world, does your age, appearance or family background really matter?  The conference and meetup culture in this industry can make people more forgiving and open-minded, v1 said.  “I could be chatting or following this person for five years, but never meet him until a conference in Barcelona, for example. You’re willing to understand this person outside the traditional identity factors and get to know them from their favorite NFT or whatever coin they’re shilling that week,” v1 said.  “I don’t think there’s any industry that’s more approachable than crypto.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/01/i-would-never-date-a-crypto-guy-again-what-women-say-about-dating-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67aba55abd9bc3ddff911479a5b8aa52906f2ec5-1915x1436.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373919,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWExh,1662048000,"New Global CBDC Platform Could Cut Payment Costs, IMF Says","Staffers at the International Monetary Fund Thursday called for a global platform for cross-border payments, and reiterated calls to regulate a crypto sector that officials say is unstable, inefficient and riddled with fraud.  The international organization dedicated its quarterly magazine, Finance & Development, to the “money revolution” – including a contribution from CoinDesk’s Michael Casey. But other authors offer scant hope for crypto advocates, with public officials largely favoring state-backed solutions such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  The magazine also touched on health, fiscal policy and climate change.  Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, wants the IMF to develop a new system to cut the costs of international transfers. The platform would accept CBDC payments, hold them in escrow and issue tokens against them, he said.  “The private sector would be able to extend the uses of the platform by writing smart contracts,” Adrian said, promising further papers on how the world’s central banks could work together on the project.  Figures published by the IMF suggest that about 97 countries are researching, testing or deploying a CBDC, raising the question about how the different CBDCs would work together to enable cross-border payments – a process that would be costly and unreliable under the current, traditional finance system known as correspondent banking.  In March, a project that included Australia and South Africa concluded that cross-border CBDC platforms are “technically viable,” but officials have been more skeptical about the potential of a private crypto firm taking over the reins.  Read more: Why Is the IMF So Afraid of Cryptocurrency?  The IMF’s own wariness of bitcoin is now echoed by other international bodies, such as the Bank for International Settlements, the Switzerland-based body made up of the world’s major central banks.  “Any legitimate transaction that can be carried out with crypto can be accomplished better with central bank money,” BIS General Manager Agustín Carstens wrote in an article published Thursday. “Crypto is neither stable nor efficient … its participants are not accountable to society. Frequent fraud, theft and scams have raised serious concerns about market integrity.""  Those concerns are echoed by jurisdictions such as Singapore, whose central bank governor Ravi Menon wrote that “private cryptocurrencies – of which bitcoin is probably the best known – fail as money.”  Menon repeated previous promises to impose further restrictions on people’s access to crypto and said the case for a CBDC that can be used by ordinary citizens is “not compelling for now.”  Read more: Singapore's Central Bank Wants to Foster Digital Assets, Restrict Crypto  But with jurisdictions such as Japan, the U.S. and the European Union all drafting new laws, the plethora of national and regional laws on crypto is starting to cause concern, as incompatible regulations could deadlock the global financial system.  “The worry is that the longer this takes, the more national authorities will get locked into differing regulatory frameworks,” Aditya Narain, deputy director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, wrote in a paper. He called for a global response to be coordinated, consistent and comprehensive, to cover “all actors and all aspects of the crypto ecosystem.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/01/new-global-cbdc-platform-could-cut-payment-costs-imf-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3218a4356ea756d35a1afb899d9d3046afe7ecb-5352x4014.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sommers also spent time as the policy director and head of government affairs for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), and also worked for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  “Adding Jill's wealth of experience in the derivatives landscape is an invaluable resource for our board as we traverse through the evolving digital asset ecosystem and its integration into the broader financial market structure,” FTX.US Derivatives CEO Zach Dexter said in a statement.  In May, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faced a roomful of derivatives industry giants and regulators to argue for his company’s proposal to directly clear transactions through the CFTC without traditional intermediaries.  Additionally, in May Bankman-Fried and his government relations and policy team made a stop in Washington, D.C., to speak with Biden administration officials. The visit came at a time when U.S. lawmakers are considering bills that would clarify whether the CFTC or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should act as the crypto industry's primary federal market regulator.

The Ethereum chain with the PoS consensus mechanism will retain the seven-year-old ether (ETH), which was recently trading at $1,570, as its native token. The PoW chain, representing a group of miners opposing the impending Merge, or switch to PoS, would have a new token called ETHPOW.  If the chain splits, ETH holders will receive ETHPOW free of cost. What's not known is the value of the ETHPOW token.  One way to gauge the potential value is to look at the difference between spot ether and futures prices, according to Paradigm, which focuses on over-the-counter trading for institutions.  As of Wednesday, ether Sept. 30 expiry contracts listed on major exchanges traded at a discount of $18 to the spot price, indicating the market is expecting the ETHPOW token to draw a price of at least $18 at inception.  ""We can infer how much the market estimates ETHPOW will be worth from simply looking at spot-future basis, since spot = PoS + PoW, while future is just PoS,"" Paradigm said in a Merge-focused blog post published Wednesday. ""Currently, the basis is implying ETHPOW to be priced ~$18, which is ~1.5% of ETH market cap.""  Trading giant Cumberland voiced a similar opinion last month, saying, ""we can infer how much the market estimates ETHPOW will be worth from the spot-future basis.""  The logic behind considering the negative $18 basis as a possible ETHPOW price is that the discount represents the risk-free cost of collecting the potential forked tokens. So, if traders are willing to pay $18, they must expect the token to be priced at $18 or higher.  Read the full story here.

42373911,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWEmN,1662039534,Crypto Lender Celsius Files to Return Custody Clients' Funds,"Crypto lender Celsius Network, which is just over a month into bankruptcy proceedings, filed to return custody holders' funds to them early Thursday, ahead of a separate hearing to address ongoing questions about its efforts to restructure and relaunch its operations.  According to the filing, Celsius has about 58,300 users who collectively deposited over $210 million with its custody and withhold, with 15,680 customers holding ""Pure Custody Assets"" worth around $44 million. The Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which is overseeing the case, scheduled a hearing for Oct. 6 to discuss the matter.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy protections in July after halting all withdrawals in June. The crypto lender's customers have written numerous letters to the court explaining the hardships this has imposed on them, with several asking the court to have Celsius just re-open withdrawals and liquidate its own assets if need be to make customers whole.  Celsius' filing comes a day after an organized group of 64 customers claiming around $25 million in custody holdings also petitioned the court for their funds back.  The argument is that unlike Celsius customers using its Earn or Borrow products, customers with custodial accounts still maintain ownership of their crypto assets. Celsius is merely acting as the storage provider. Therefore, these funds belong to the customers, not to Celsius' estate.  ""Following their analysis, the Debtors have identified significant cryptocurrency assets that they do not believe are property of their estates, and as to which the Debtors do not believe that they have any colorable causes of action under applicable law,"" the filing said. ""Accordingly, the Debtors believe it is fair and appropriate to permit customers to withdraw those cryptocurrency assets at this time. By this Motion, the Debtors seek authority to permit certain customers to withdraw their cryptocurrency from the Custody Program and Withhold Accounts – in accordance with procedures and other conditions set forth in this Motion.""  Celsius is filing for a narrow re-opening of withdrawals, saying not every customer would be eligible.  ""For all Withdrawable Assets, the Debtors need to consider the extent to which they may hold a right to setoff against obligations owed to customers, including the customers’ obligation to repay loans under the Borrow Program. Accordingly, the Proposed Order carves out from the relief the reopening of withdrawals for any customer with any outstanding loans under the Borrow Program,"" the filing said.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/01/crypto-lender-celsius-files-to-return-custody-clients-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bafeba86d377ea3dbd61571e6f43c2d8e5244da6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Four seasoned partners and one associate have all left Anderson Kill’s Blockchain and Virtual Currency Group, launched in 2018, to join Brown Rudnick’s Digital Commerce practice, which now has more than 40 members.  The practice group’s list of clients includes several major players in the crypto industry, including crypto exchange Binance, the Cardano blockchain and the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation.  Partners Stephen Palley, Matthew Richardson and Preston Byrne will be based in the firm’s Washington, D.C., office, while partner Hailey Lennon will be based in Orange County, California. Associate Jeff Karas will work in the New York office.  Palley will take the helm as the co-chair of the firm’s Digital Commerce practice, alongside New York-based partner Clara Krivoy.

The team brings with them a breadth of experience and knowledge in various crypto-related issues, including regulation and compliance, international law, and litigation.  “We are delighted to welcome this team to our Firm,” said Brown Rudnick CEO Vince Guglielmotti in a press statement. “Our clients are increasingly in the digital asset space as founders, investors or traditional corporate entities looking to use technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies as part of their business.”  The move appears to be part of a larger push at Brown Rudnick to boost its technology practice.

42421474,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPsb,1662036600,Advisors Need to Refine Their Definition of Crypto,"Crypto and digital assets are full of new technological terms and jargon that might be daunting or confusing to advisors and clients. For that reason, having some basic, clear definitions of crypto terms might be helpful when answering client questions and serve as a foundation for an advisor’s further incursions into the realm of crypto education.  Alas, digital assets are a very busy space, and the idea was quickly abandoned in favor of keeping up with some of the fast-moving news within the crypto for advisors space. It’s no coincidence that over the past 12 months the financial services industry has made significant progress in developing technology and processes so that financial advisors can begin to help their clients with a digital assets allocation.  Perhaps it’s time to revisit the glossary concept. In our first and only entry into it, we talked to Tyrone Ross (then-CEO of Onramp Invest) and Ric Edelman (founder of the Digital Assets Council for Financial Professionals) about some of the more confusing crypto terms for financial advisors, and we found that the problem began at the beginning – what should we be calling these assets? You’ll notice in this article I have used crypto, cryptocurrency and digital assets almost interchangeably.  Let’s go back to the beginning to make sure we all understand what we’re talking about here – because while crypto-curious clients have already done this research, many clients will come to advisors with the fundamental questions.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  What is cryptocurrency?  Simply put, a cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency or money built on a blockchain.  Take bitcoin (BTC), the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (with a small b), the crypto token, is built on Bitcoin (with a large B), the protocol, a blockchain. The blockchain is, in very simplified terms, a record of every transaction that occurs on the Bitcoin network.  On a blockchain, transactions are grouped into blocks, which are verified by computers on the network. In Bitcoin’s case, these computers are miners in a process called ""proof-of-work."" But in other “proof-of-stake” cryptocurrencies, these are other crypto holders who “stake” some of their holdings to help verify transactions. Over time, the Bitcoin protocol links successive blocks together in chronological order, creating a blockchain.  Read more: The Investor’s Definitive Guide to Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake (Abridged)  Why is a blockchain valuable?  The blockchains underlying bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies provide several facets of value.  One of these facets of value is the consensus-based verification process for transactions, which eliminates the need for a trusted third party to facilitate the transfer of assets or wealth between people or other entities. Blockchains like Bitcoin’s protocol are not controlled by banks or governments – they operate independently.  Another facet of value is that information on the blockchain is permanent and immutable. We can always see who has done what and where, a very powerful tool for both investors and regulators.  Most importantly, however, is a third facet of value. Blockchains can, for the first time, digitally define scarcity. Previously, scarcity did not really exist in the digital realm. A file could be copied indefinitely. For example, if I was sending a copy of the draft of this story to another computer over my home network or the internet, I was effectively creating a copy of this file before sending it away – meaning this file would exist in two places. If I were sending it to four different editors, I would have made five copies of this article, all of which could be independently proofread and edited by a different person and leading to a potentially long, difficult process to reconcile the differences in editions and versions.  A blockchain creates a single source of truth for all of the participants on the network, which was a necessary precursor to the advent of digital money – it wouldn’t do to have users able to send or spend the same dollar multiple times. There had to be a way to eliminate or throttle the duplicative nature of files. Hence, the verification work of the blockchain ensures that once a bitcoin or a fraction of a bitcoin is spent, it is forever transferred from one party to another and cannot be re-spent.  Read more: The Double-Spend (What Bitcoin's White Paper Solved Forever)  Back to lowercase bitcoin  What does all this have to do with cryptocurrency? A blockchain needs computing power to verify transactions – people, with their computers, need to participate for the system to work.  So the inventors of Bitcoin, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, created a way to incentivize users to participate on the new network as miners – by compensating them with tokens that could be used as a store of value or to transfer value. That way, every time a user verifies a block of transactions, they are compensated with some bitcoin tokens.  Of course, there’s a lot more to crypto, even bitcoin, the grandfather of crypto. We can get into satoshis (the smallest fraction of a bitcoin). We can get into the supply cap – there's a finite amount of bitcoin that will ever be mined. And we can get into bitcoin’s supply issuance schedule. But for those clients coming to advisors and asking what a bitcoin is and what a cryptocurrency is, we have some basic answers.  Read more: What Happens When All Bitcoin Are Mined?  Other terms  Cryptocurrency has become the popularly embraced term for these particular blockchain-based assets. “Crypto assets,” a term favored by Ross (the former Onramp CEO), expands the definition to include non-fungible tokens, or NFT, which are blockchain-based tokens offering a digital definition of uniqueness, not just scarcity.  Then there’s the even broader term “digital assets,” favored by Ric Edelman, that encompasses the entire universe of cryptographic tokens and derivatives, plus a number of innovative asset classes and decentralized finance projects.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/01/advisors-need-to-refine-their-definition-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e5ad30cb77ff75f9852a780e9b80fa30d9f4053-5527x4145.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422453,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lBPh,1662034181,"Potential Ethereum Hard Fork Token ETHPOW May Trade at 1.5% of Ether's Price, Futures Suggest","If you have been following the crypto market for some time, you probably have heard that Ethereum, the world's largest smart-contract blockchain, may undergo a hard fork later this month, splitting into a proof-of-stake (PoS) chain and a proof-of-work (PoW) chain.  The Ethereum chain with the PoS consensus mechanism will retain the seven-year-old ether (ETH), which was recently trading at $1,570, as its native token. The PoW chain, representing a group of miners opposing the impending Merge, or switch to PoS, would have a new token called ETHPOW.  Crypto analysts figure that if the chain splits, ETH holders will receive ETHPOW free of cost.  One way to gauge the potential value of ETHPOW is to look at the difference between spot ether and futures prices, according to Paradigm, which focuses on over-the-counter trading for institutions.  As of Wednesday, ether Sept. 30 expiry contracts listed on major exchanges traded at a discount of $18 to the spot price, indicating the market is expecting the ETHPOW token to draw a price of at least $18 at inception.  ""We can infer how much the market estimates ETHPOW will be worth from simply looking at spot-future basis, since spot = PoS + PoW, while future is just PoS,"" Paradigm said in a Merge-focused blog post published Wednesday. ""Currently, the basis is implying ETHPOW to be priced ~$18, which is ~1.5% of ETH market cap.""  Trading giant Cumberland voiced a similar opinion last month, saying, ""We can infer how much the market estimates ETHPOW will be worth from the spot-future basis.""  The logic behind considering the $18 basis as a possible ETHPOW price is that the discount represents the risk-free cost of collecting the potential forked tokens. So, if traders are willing to pay $18, they must expect the token to be priced at $18 or higher.  Dissecting the risk-free trade  Traders stand to receive ETHPOW free of cost if they hold ETH and will receive nothing if they take bullish exposure through the futures or options market. So, ether's price can be taken to represent the value for ether as well as for a potential ETHPOW token.  Holding ETH to earn ETHPOW, however, means being exposed to ETH's price volatility. A decline in ETH's price would eat into money made from receiving ETHPOW for free and liquidating in the spot market.  So, the ideal strategy to make risk-free money is to buy ETH and short September futures – the so-called spread trade. That way, ETH holders can pocket ETHPOW without any directional risk. Assume a trader took the trade on Wednesday, when futures were priced at an $18 discount. The discount is essentially the cost of collecting ETHPOW tokens risk-free because futures sold at a discount of $18 would eventually converge with the spot price.  Paradigm said:  ""If you had the notion that the PoW fork was going to be well used by market participants you could put on a very simple spot vs. future for $18 and end up with a significant amount of PoW tokens which might end up being worth a good sum of money. So simplistically, you are betting $18 to potentially get a PoW token which hopefully is worth more than that $18 - it might look like a basis trade, but it feels like an option to me!.""  The futures premium/discount narrows as expiry nears and eventually converges on the spot price on the day of the settlement.  The hedged long spot trade aimed at collecting ETHPOW without directional risks is one of the most popular ways of trading the impending Merge.  ""With our newest integration with FTX, the spot/30 Sep future spread price of around $18 can be seen as a derivative market of how much traders are willing to pay to be long spot/short futures to receive ETHPOW tokens,"" Patrick Chu, head of institutional coverage for the Asia-Pacific region at Paradigm, told CoinDesk. ""We have seen a large uptick in clients since the start of the partnership.""  Last month, Paradigm, in partnership with crypto exchange FTX, launched single-click execution of the spread trades.  The value for ETHPOW tokens suggested by futures basis is significantly lower than the price that IOUs representing the token are currently trading at on exchanges MEXC, CoinW, Phemex, Bitrue and Gate.io. At press time, the ETHPOW IOUs traded at $50, according to CoinMarketCap data. Prices reached as high as $140 early last month, indicating frenzy around the potential hard fork token.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/01/potential-ethereum-hard-fork-token-ethpow-could-trade-at-18-ether-futures-suggest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d49d45d4c4c931e3c76ff1cc9333d673a619d93a-1807x1355.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While most risky assets, including digital ones, have rallied strongly from June lows, the chance of a more hawkish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the likelihood that higher interest rates will persist for longer haven't been fully priced in, Alkesh Shah, head of digital asset research, said in the podcast.  “Risk assets, including crypto and digital assets, are likely experiencing a classic bear market rebound after a significant sell-off,” Shah said.  The bank’s token flow analysis shows that crypto buying momentum is fading and investors are defensively rotating into stablecoins. That is because of the uncertainty about whether broader financial markets are in a “bear market rally” – a short-term rebound during a more pervasive decline – and whether slower-than-expected growth, especially next year, could lead to more weakness for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The Merge, the first of five planned software upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain, planned for later this month, will be a major milestone for the digital assets sector, Shah said, because it will remove one of the “major adoption barriers” for applications built on the network, such as non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) and stablecoins, by reducing energy usage by over 99%.

The deal, which had reportedly been agreed in principle, would have seen Crypto.com take over as sponsor from Russian-state owned energy company Gazprom. UEFA, Europe's governing body for soccer, cancelled the Gazprom contract in March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Crypto.com scrapped the deal because of regulatory concerns in the U.K., France and Italy, with legal issues surrounding the scope of its licenses to trade and operate, SportBusiness said.  The Singapore-based exchange has taken a gung-ho approach to sports advertising over the past year, signing a 20-year naming deal with the Staples Center in Los Angeles for $700 million and piling $150 million into Formula One racing sponsorships. It also also paid $100 million for an advertisement featuring Hollywood actor Matt Damon as it looked to cash in on last year's bull market.  Since then, however, cryptocurrency prices have tumbled.

42422457,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lB9h,1662025778,Bitcoin Mining Middleman Compass' Georgia Facilities to Close as Energy Prices Soar,"Two Georgia facilities used by Compass Mining, a middleman that allows retail investors to participate in bitcoin production, are closing as power costs in the U.S. state soar.  The owner of the sites is shutting down because the local utility provider has increased prices, a major cost for bitcoin mining, by more than 50%, Compass co-CEO Thomas Heller told CoinDesk on Thursday by email. The company heard the news from the facility owner yesterday afternoon, he said.  Compass Mining allows retail investors to buy small amounts of mining capacity in sites around the world. It doesn't own any of the facilities available on its platform. The company has had issues with downtime, delays in deployment and mining rigs stuck in Russia, so much so that Whit Gibbs stepped down as CEO in June and the new management cut 15% of staff.  The Georgia site was hosting about 5,000 machines for Compass customers, or about 15 megawatts (MW), Heller said. The operator is hosting a total of 8,000 machines, or 25 MW, for Compass, the co-CEO said.  Customers can have their machines shipped to a site in Texas, a process that's likely take about a month, according to the screenshot of an email to customers posted on social media. Compass will work to minimize the downtime and will issue credits to customers affected, Heller said.  The Texas facility has experienced troubles of its own. Its connection to the electricity grid was delayed so had to run on generators for a while. Those, however, weren't operating all the time because of heat and other reasons, Heller said, leading to downtime for the mining rigs. In July, Compass offered to move the Texas machines to Georgia because of the site's low uptime. Compass later said it wouldn't proceed with the move, citing the high energy prices in Georgia.  In August, the Texas site was connected to the grid and uptime has been ""very good,"" Heller said. The facility is expected to run at over 100 MW of energy, but Compass allocation of that will reach only 25 MW by the end of September, according to the screenshot.  The Georgia facilities were ""very solid until now"" because the operator was very good. Compass expects the same to hold true for the Texas site, which is managed by the same company, Heller said.

That&apos;s different from other regions like Europe and North America, where adoption is primarily driven by speculation. The study shows that emerging markets are seeing consumers and businesses alike adopt crypto for specific reasons, such as payments and money management. The primary reasons for commissioning this study were to shed more light on these questions of crypto adoption, and also to send a message to the wider industry that in order to move forward and progress, there needs to be a shift of focus beyond simply trading and profiteering.

Rari allowed users to supply and borrow any asset in its Fuse pools to earn yields. Users can set up their own pools with a basket of Ethereum-based assets, such as Babylon’s tokens, and other users can deposit funds into those pools to earn yields. The yields are generated as rewards for trading activity on those liquidity pools.  Babylon stored some $30 million in various cryptocurrencies at its peak and was among the top lending pools on Rari with $10 million in user-supplied assets.  The Babylon protocol took a 0.5% management fee and a 5% performance fee on yields offered to users, who supplied its native BABL tokens as collateral for loans on the platform.  But the situation went downhill after Rari cancelled a planned reimbursement to users affected by the exploit, Babylon founder Ramon Recuero said on Wednesday.  Babylon lost $3.4 million during the Rari exploit, and its users withdrew over 75% of their assets in the following days at the time.  As such, the Babylon team was vying to reach $50 million in user-supplied assets, following which it would become sustainable due to the fees charged to users in return for the yields offered. The Rari exploit, coupled with a steep fall in BABL token prices, led to “the point of no return” for Babylon as a sustainable protocol, said.  “Token price crashed from $20 to $5,” Recuero added, “removing any possibility of fundraising future activities from token sales. The token supply is limited, non-inflationary and only 10% remains in the treasury.”  Recuero said the team would return all remaining assets to BABL holders in the coming weeks, including all tokens vested to the founders.  Meanwhile, the price of BABL fell 92% in the past 24 hours, data shows, as traders reacted to the development.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/01/crypto-asset-manager-babylon-finance-will-shutdown-after-failing-to-recover-from-rari-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b035bcebbf5348a357c34d15ba57387738402ebc-3353x2514.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422445,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lBBh,1662020705,Crypto Lender Celsius Faces Another Group of Customers Who Want Their Money Back,"A group of custodial-account holders at Celsius Network has formally asked the court overseeing the crypto lender’s bankruptcy case to authorize the return of their funds.  The ad hoc group petitioned the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on Wednesday for a declaratory judgment to require Celsius to allow withdrawals from the custodial accounts. Celsius filed for bankruptcy proceedings in July after freezing withdrawals in mid-June. The company is hoping to restructure its operations and use revenue generated from a still-being-built mining operation to survive.  The group is composed of 64 people who hold at least $22.5 million in cryptocurrencies with Celsius’ custody service, according to the filing. It is separate from the Unofficial Committee of Creditors (UCC), another organized set of Celsius customers.  According to the filing, the group’s cryptocurrency is deposited in custodial accounts rather than the yield-generating “Earn” product. This means Celsius should have held the funds in segregated storage on behalf of the group’s members, who retain title to the funds, according to the filing. Because of this, the filing claims, the customers should be able to receive their funds back separately from the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings.  “The Court made clear at various hearings that if Custody Assets are not property of the estate, such assets should be returned to users,” the filing said. “Following discussions with the Debtors and their advisors and the Creditors’ Committee and its advisors, Plaintiff has been unable to obtain return of its Custody Assets, and the Debtors have not lifted the freeze with respect to Plaintiff’s Custody accounts.”  The account holders say Celsius still has in its possession the same type of cryptocurrencies that they deposited, and the funds remain separate from the rest of Celsius’ funds. The firm, therefore, has the ability to allow them to withdraw their funds, it just hasn’t done so.  “The Debtors’ continued refusal to honor withdrawals of all Custody Assets has created tremendous hardship on their users as set forth in hundreds of letters filed on the docket and in statements made by users at hearings in the Chapter 11 Cases. As it is not the Debtors’ property, the Debtors should not continue to hold Custody Assets during the Chapter 11 Cases and cannot use them to pay the Debtors’ creditors’ claims,” the filing said.  The filing goes on to explain the distinction between Celsius’ custodial-account holders and customers of the Earn program.  The effort to create this ad hoc group has taken several weeks. CoinDesk first reported on Aug. 1 that some customers felt Kirkland & Ellis, Celsius’ law firm, could have filed to have the funds returned well before Wednesday.

42422448,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lBFh,1662018087,Helium Proposes Shifting its Entire Network to Solana Blockchain Months After $200M Raise,"Developers behind the Helium network – a grid of medium-range wireless hotspots pitched as an alternative to hard-wired internet service – are proposing to migrate away from the project's own blockchain onto Solana, in pursuit of faster transaction speeds, higher uptimes and more interoperability with other blockchains as key reasons.  The Helium Foundation wrote in a Medium post this week that the new proposal from the Helium core developer team would improve the operational efficiency ""significantly.""  The proposal to move toward Solana and away from Helium's own blockchain, officially known as HIP 70, ""addresses network speed, reliability and scalability,"" the foundation said.  According to the post, members had spent ""countless hours keeping up unprecedented growth"" and that reliable ""proof-of-coverage activity"" and ""reliable data transfer activity"" have ""proven to be a challenge for users."" The Helium Foundation said it ""fully supports"" the proposal, and that it had been under discussions with Nova Labs – the company behind the project – for months.  Nova Labs announced $200 million of fresh funding in March.  A Discord call is planned for 4 p.m. ET (8pm UTC) Thursday for Helium community members to discuss the proposed migration to Solana. According to the Medium post, voting opens on Sept. 12 and concludes Sept. 18.  Shifting tokens  The developers propose shifting all Helium-based tokens, governance, and economics around the network’s native HNT, DC, IOT and MOBILE tokens onto Solana. The move would help scale the Helium network, developers said, which has grown to over 1 million “hotspots” in recent months. Helium would also be utilized with ongoing Solana projects, such as the Solana Saga smartphone, developers said.  A key part of Helium's consensus mechanism was said to be unable to handle network demands, which prompted developers to shift away from the Helium blockchain.  The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof of Coverage” (PoC) to verify that hotspots are located where they claimed. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis, that hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are creating from that location.  Hotspots enable anyone to own and operate a wireless network for low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices while providing coverage for devices using Helium LongFi in return for HNT rewards.  PoC is an intensive and complex program, however, and has “proven to be a challenge for users” in recent months, as per developers. The increased load on the Helium network has caused issues with the transfer of data packets between users.  Scrapping proof-of-coverage  Developers have proposed to scrap the PoC mechanism entirely as part of the shift to Solana – a move that shows the currently used consensus mechanisms on the Helium blockchain were not able to handle network applications in their current form.  Scrapping the use of PoC would help make the Helium network “become much simpler,” developers said.  “Solana is a layer 1 blockchain that focuses on the importance of scalability and speed,” developers said, adding the network does not compromise on security or scalability. Solana has faced uptime issues in the past, however.  The proposal comes months after Helium raised $200 million in a Series D funding round at a $1.2 billion valuation in February in a round led by Tiger Global and FTX Ventures, who joined existing investors Multicoin Capital and a16z. All these firms have previously invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the Solana ecosystem.  UPDATE (15:20 UTC): Adds details from Helium Foundation proposal.

42422454,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lBRh,1662007518,California Assembly Passes Crypto Regulation Bill That Requires Bank-Issued Stablecoins,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom is set to sign a recently passed bill that would require digital asset exchanges and other crypto companies to obtain a license to operate in the state.  The Digital Financial Assets Law, dubbed California’s ""BitLicense,"" takes after New York’s BitLicense regulation, which came into effect in 2015. California’s law, if signed by Newsom, a Democrat, would go into effect in January 2025.  “While the newness of cryptocurrency is part of what makes investing exciting, it also makes it riskier for consumers because cryptocurrency businesses are not adequately regulated and do not have to follow many of the same rules that apply to everyone else,” Assembly Member Timothy Grayson (D-Concord), the bill’s sponsor, said in a prior statement.  Among the requirements is a prohibition, which would be phased out in 2028, on California-licensed entities dealing with stablecoins, unless that stablecoin is issued by a bank or is licensed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. This is similar to a proposed (and never passed) bill in the U.S. Congress that would require stablecoin issuers to have a bank charter.  Another clause in the stablecoin section of the bill would require stablecoin issuers that hold securities as a reserve to have an amount ""not less than the aggregate amount of all of its outstanding stablecoins issued or sold in the United States."" In addition, the bill stipulates that the aggregate market value must be computed using the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of the United States. GAAP is a common set of accounting rules, standards and procedures issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).  The Blockchain Association, an industry trade group, tweeted that the bill would “create shortsighted and unhelpful restrictions that would impede crypto innovators’ ability to operate and push many out of the state.”  This is the second attempt California has made to create a ""BitLicense"" regime. The first, in 2015, failed and was made dormant after opposition from a state senator.  Within California's assembly, the bill received 71 yes votes and zero no votes. Nine members of the assembly abstained from voting. On the Senate floor, the bill received 31 yes votes and six no votes, with all six no votes coming from Republican senators.  Newsom has until Sept. 30 to sign or veto the bill.  UPDATE (Sept. 1, 2022, 02:15 UTC) – Updates headline, adds information throughout.  CORRECTION (Sept. 1, 2022, 03:15 UTC) – Clarifies that stablecoins would be required to have been issued by a bank or a California- licensed financial institution.  CORRECTION (Sept. 1, 2022, 03:15 UTC) – Corrects phrasing regarding the implementation of the stablecoin clause. It will be phased out in 2028 rather than implemented.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/01/california-assembly-passes-bitlicense-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c56aab44980859b9cd864c0bf7741056852458b-1333x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Burrows in Above $20K  By James Rubin  Fresh from its Tuesday rally back above the psychologically important $20,000 threshold, bitcoin burrowed in.  The largest cryptocurrency in market value was recently trading at roughly $20,100, up about a percentage point over the past 24 hours as investors looked ahead nervously after a month to forget in crypto markets. BTC has fallen more than 13% in August and nearly 20% since the middle of the month when a surge steeped in the false hopes of a return to more moderate monetary policy (since dashed by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in Jackson Hole, Wyoming) sent the price up near $25,000.  The Fed is ""talking tough, tough, tough, which is why stocks and cryptos have been falling,"" Glen Goodman, crypto consultant at exchange eToro, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Ether was recently changing hands at roughly $1,550, also rising more than a percentage point from Tuesday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has dropped 7% in August and more than 20% since mid-month euphoria about the Merge, the Ethereum blockchain's hotly anticipated protocol switch from a proof-of-work to more energy-efficient proof-of-stake sent spurred an ether price spike over $2,000.  Other major altcoins spent much of the day in the green, with LUNA and MATIC both up more than 2% at one point. ADA was recently down 1.3%.  Equities  Stocks that have correlated with cryptos for much of the year went a different way on Wednesday, falling for a fourth consecutive day. The tech-focused Nasdaq declined more than 0.5%, while the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) tumbled 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively to cap their own devilish month. The Nasdaq and S&P each plunged more than 4% after emerging from bear market territory during August's first week.  Central bankers and others trying to make sense of the confoundingly resilient employment market received some logic in management services firm ADP's August employment report that showed private-sector employers adding an unexpectedly low 132,000 jobs during the month. The total was 60% below the average of the previous three months and offered one of the few recent signs that labor markets may soon be slowing. Still, the reading is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve from its commitment to boost interest rates aggressively to tame inflation, even at the expense of a continued economic contraction that is frightening asset markets.  In crypto news, South Korean customs authorities on Tuesday arrested 16 people involved in illegal foreign exchange transactions, reported local outlet Newsis. And as CoinDesk's Danny Nelson reported, Credit Suisse held tens of millions of dollars in “digital assets” for its clients at the end of the second quarter, according to regulatory filings. The disclosure underscored how traditional financial institutions are inching toward crypto custody.  eToro's Goodman called September ""the cruelest month for stock markets"" going back to the 1950s, noting cryptos' recent link to equity markets, and he also highlighted bearish sentiment on Twitter about the coming month. But summoning his inner contrarian, he added that he couldn't ""help but think the opposite.""  ""Looking at the stock and the crypto charts that are correlated to them, they look bearish, but it's not a predetermined conclusion that we will definitely get down to that level and then go even lower,"" he said. ""There is hope that stocks and bonds, [and] cryptos could turn around.""

No, Says Waves Founder Sasha Ivanov  By Shaurya Malwa  Waves founder Sasha Ivanov dismissed criticism of the protocol’s recent decision to add the new SURF token as part of the basket of tokens that backs its USDN stablecoin, which some detractors say has “created a model similar to UST,” referring to Terra's algorithmic stablecoin.  Ivanov explained to CoinDesk over several Telegram messages on Wednesday that USDN’s model involves four tokens in its mechanics – WAVES, NSBT, USDN itself and SURF – with all of them supplying liquidity to, and helping USDN retain, its $1 peg.  “UST was backed by nothing – LUNA [the token] was burned to create UST. It was never intended to be backed up by anything other than the algorithm,” Ivanov explained. “The opposite is true of USDN. WAVES tokens are held in a smart contract to collateralize USDN.”  Algorithmic stablecoins are backed by a basket of tokens and rely on smart contracts and arbitrage mechanisms to hold their peg to a chosen currency, usually U.S. dollars. In USDN’s case, users must lock in WAVES in Neutrino's smart contracts to mint USDN, while USDN redemptions have the opposite effect of destroying the stablecoin to unlock WAVES supply.  Waves’ native USDN stablecoins fell to nearly 90 cents last week after a liquidity crisis caused the tokens to lose their intended peg with U.S. dollars, causing wider crypto market concerns.  Sasha Ivanov has previously raised these concerns. ""We have to work on the algorithm. And what happens now is kind of inevitable, which is just a test of the whole system,” he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program in June.  USDN's lost peg  The concerns resurfaced last week as USDN lost its peg, which concerned some analysts.  “Even though all purchases made with this token add to USDN backing, the move created a model similar to UST by relying on a secondary token to support the stablecoin's peg by providing liquidity,” Iakov Levin, CEO of crypto yield platform Midas, explained in a message to CoinDesk.  Levin further stated that market participants were likely removing liquidity from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms ahead of the upcoming Ethereum Merge upgrade. “No one is keen on supporting the peg of another algorithmic stablecoin. This model potentially leads to dire consequences and extreme fragility of the peg,” he told CoinDesk in Telegram messages.  Ivanov, however, pinned last week’s USDN deppeging to Vires Finance, a lending platform built on Waves. The depeg has happened due to the repayment plan implemented by the community vote on Vires finance,” Ivanov said. “$1 million USDN is released daily in repayment to Vires depositors, and it seems that amount is too high to be sustainable for the peg of USDN.”  Vires previously faced scrutiny from market participants in April, when several Twitter handles accused the Waves team of manipulating the price of its native token through the platform. Ivanov dismissed the allegations at the time, accusing Alameda Research of manipulating waves prices and running a hostile media campaign to trigger a panic selling.  Meanwhile, the possibility of depegged stablecoins remains a worry among the crypto community, a part of which is plagued by fears of a UST-like repeat months after the Terra ecosystem crashed and wiped off some $28 billion in value from related applications.
