35619742,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651384,1730671229,Solana DeFi Momentum Soars With $5.7 Billion Locked In Q3,"Solana continues to prove that it’s one of the top blockchains for this cycle. After its rally, which gained 35% over the past 60 days, the popular Layer 1 blockchain is back in the news with more on-chain activities. According to recent data, Solana’s DeFi Total Value Locked or TVL increased to $5.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 26% improvement from the previous quarter. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Kamino, a crypto lending service, leads the count with $1.5 billion in TVL and an impressive 7% Quarter-on-Quarter growth, helped by jupSOL and PYUSD additions. Recent data also suggests that Solana’s market cap is now $3.8 billion, an improvement of 23%, boosted by the integration of PayPal’s PYUSD. DeFI Continues To Drive Growth For Solana Solana DeFi tops the chain’s activities with a total locked value, worth $5.7 billion. This latest SOL data reflects a solid 26% growth QoQ, pushing the blockchain to become third largest in this metric, surpassing Tron. In a Messari report, Solana’s TVL increased due to increased activities for Kamino, which accounted for $1.5 billion of the total contracts locked. Kamino’s recent quarterly figure represents a 57% rise, thanks to the recent integration of jupSOL and PYUSD. Aside from Kamino Finance, Solana’s blockchain featured locked assets for Raydium, with $1.1 billion, and Jupiter, with $749 million. Kamino Finance’s impressive performance is linked to its Kamino Lend V2 launch, offering a permissionless vault and market layer. Analysts expect Kamino Finance to continue its dominance by adding new projects like the Spot Leverage and Lending Orderbook. Solana DEX Shows Signs Of Slowing Down Solana’s DEX activity was down 10% QoQ but rebounded a bit by October. The average daily volume on the blockchain’s exchange hit $1.7 billion, largely because of a fall in meme coins. Raydium retains its dominance on Solana’s DEX, with a 51% market share, although its daily average volume dipped by 13% to $852 million. The volume increased by $350 million with the release of Moonshot, a crypto mobile trading app. Jupiter also stayed at the top, cornering 43% of the total spot exchange volume. Recent developments, including the release of Jupiter Mobile and the integration of Google Pay and Apple Pay, helped the platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? SOL’s Stablecoins Get Help From PYUSD In the same Messari report, PayPal’s PYUSD lifts SOL’s stablecoin market. The PYUSD was launched in May in Solana, which is mainly instrumental in its market cap growth, which now stands at $3.8 billion. With exciting features like programmable transfers and transfer hooks, PayPal’s PYUSD became instantly popular. Aside from PYUSD, USDC also contributes to Solana’s stablecoins market. Circle’s integration of Web 3.0 services for SOL provides enterprise functionality features like fee sponsorship and programmable wallets, allowing developers to integrate multi-chain solutions quickly.

According to price data, Bitcoin has just completed a retest of the downward sloping trendline that has limited its price rallies since March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? As analyst EGRAG CRYPTO pointed out, the only thing left is for a complete body closure on the weekly timeframe. This closure will be pivotal in determining the next phase of Bitcoin’s price action, potentially setting the stage for a rally into new price territories. Bitcoin Completes Trendline Retest Technical analysis of the Bitcoin price indicates a breakout from a resistance trendline in the middle of October. Although this breakout saw the crypto breaking above $68,000 for the first time in three months, a consolidation shortly after suggested the work wasn’t done yet. However, Bitcoin started the just concluded week on a good form. Particularly, BTC rallied in the last three days of October from $66,900 on October 27 until it reached $73,540 on October 29. This represented an increase of about 10% in just two days. Interestingly, this was enough to complete a successful breakout of this resistance trendline. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin has successfully broken out and confirmed a retest phase. However, the breakout noted by the analyst is in a larger timeframe on the weekly candlestick chart. Looking at the Bitcoin price chart below, the initial breakout noted by EGRAG CRYPTO goes as far back as February 2024, when the top coin broke out above $47,000. What this means is that when looking at the weekly timeframe, Bitcoin’s journey to the peak/all-time high of $73,737 on March 14, the correction up until a low of $49,800 on August 5, and the recent return above $73,000 are all part of one large breakout and retest move that has played out for the last 38 weeks. What’s Next For Bitcoin? This sequence of price movements paints a picture of Bitcoin’s resilience and a prevalent bullish sentiment among traders. According to EGRAG, the pattern is super bullish and he expects the crypto to continue on this run. In terms of a price target, the analyst suggested a potential rise to the $90,000 to the $110,000 range by December 2024. This represents 32% and 62% returns, respectively, from the $68,000 breakout. Interestingly, EGRAG also noted that the only thing left to certify this run is for the price to close the week in a green zone. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K?

Implied volatility in EUR/USD and U.S. Treasury notes surges to at least one-year highs.  Markets price a significant risk premium around the impending U.S. elections.  An options-based measure of expected price swings in bitcoin {{BTC}} has hit a three-month high amid indications from betting markets of a tightly contested U.S. presidential race in crucial swing states.  Leading crypto options exchange Deribit's bitcoin implied volatility index (DVOL), a closely watched gauge of expected price swings over 30 days, rose to an annualized 63.24%, the highest since late July, according to charting platform TradingView.  BTC's seven-day implied volatility, which captures the Fed meeting due Thursday and expected election results on Friday, has jumped to an annualized 74.4%, significantly higher than the 7-day realized or historical volatility of 41.4%.  That indicates ""a significant risk premium around the elections,"" Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast.  Early Sunday, the probability of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump winning the critical swing state of Pennsylvania weakened sharply to 53% from 61% on the decentralized predictions platform Polymarket.  Meanwhile, the New York Times/Siena poll of likely voters released early Sunday showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with Harris leading by two points in a Marist survey that includes undecided voters. In U.S. politics, a swing state is any state a Democrat or Republican candidate could reasonably take. The presidential election is due on Nov. 5, with results to be announced on Nov. 8.  BTC almost hit record highs early this week, rising to $73,500 Tuesday as betting platforms pointed to a comfortable Trump lead. Since then, however, Trump's odds and BTC's price have retreated, with the latter falling below $68,000 early today.  Vol spike in legacy markets  Options-based metrics, measuring expected price turbulence over four weeks, have also jumped in foreign exchange and U.S. Treasury markets.  The Ice BofA Move index, a measure of 30-day implied volatility in Treasury notes, jumped to 135% Friday, the highest since October 2023.  Increased volatility in the U.S. Treasury notes, which play a significant role in global leveraged financing, causes liquidity tightening and often leads to traders trimming their exposure to risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.

35608862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651317,1730656830,"Bitcoin May Slide To $65,000 As Critical Support Level Fails – Details","The price of Bitcoin has experienced some instability in the last few hours declining by almost 3%. This negative price action drives more attention to the largest digital asset, especially with the US election fast approaching. While many analysts are now skeptical of Bitcoin’s immediate movements, pro-trader Justin Bennett already issued a cautionary insight into the asset’s future. Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin During The US Election, Expert Reveals Bitcoin Breaches Crucial $69,000 Support Zone In an X post on November 1, Bennet shared an analysis of the BTC market, proclaiming the dip below $70,000 as a concerning development. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency had risen by over 23% in the past three weeks to trade briefly above $73,000 before experiencing a pullback to around $69,000 on Friday. Interestingly, Bennet stated that $69,000 represented a critical support zone for Bitcoin. He emphasized the importance of the token’s value staying above this price level, describing it as the “last line of defense” for the market bulls. In the last few hours, Bitcoin has fallen below $69,000 reaching around $67,900. According to Bennet’s prediction, Bitcoin could now slump as low as $65,000 where its next major resistance lies. Importantly, such a decline will indicate the digital asset has yet to break out of a consolidation range stretching over the last eight months. In terms of future price gains, Bennet has stated his expectations of Bitcoin to eventually surpass its all-time high (ATH) at $73,750, albeit he remains uncertain of how low the asset will trade before achieving this feat. Since hitting its ATH in March, Bitcoin has only produced a range-bound price movement between $55,000-$72,000 even despite positive market indicators such as Fed rate cuts and significantly high inflows in the Spot Bitcoin ETF market. However, a traditionally bullish Q4, the potential of sustained heightened ETF inflows, and the upcoming US election signals an imminent possible price breakout for the crypto market leader. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL? Bitcoin Sentiment Bullish As US Election Approaches Despite recent price loss, data from CoinMarketCap shows the general market sentiment on Bitcoin remains highly bullish ahead of the US general election. Historically, the maiden cryptocurrency has always experienced a decline in the days leading to the election with price drops of 10.2% in 2016, 6.1% in 2020, and most recently 6.3% in 2024. While there is still the possibility of further price losses before D-day on November 5, investors are likely to be unfazed as Bitcoin’s price has always gone parabolic after the elections. At the time of writing, the crypto market leader continues to trade around $68,175 following a 2.52% loss in the past day. However, the daily trading volume is down by 53.91% and is valued at $21.76 billion.

35603261,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651354,1730649656,Solana Likely To Target $200 ‘If It Holds Current Support’ – What To Expect,"Solana (SOL) is currently trading at a crucial demand level near $163, following a retrace from local highs around $183. This price is a critical support area that could determine the direction of SOL’s upcoming price action. Losing this level could signal a deeper correction, which would intensify selling pressure and potentially push SOL to retest lower support levels. However, top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis suggesting that if SOL can hold this “green zone” around $160, it could pave the way for a rebound. Daan notes that in the most optimistic scenario, SOL could hold this support and start a gradual climb, ultimately aiming to test the downtrend line that has kept it in check. This setup would keep SOL’s bullish structure intact, creating a potential entry point for investors eyeing a bounce. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL? With the broader crypto market showing volatility and Solana facing this pivotal level, the next few days will be crucial. Traders and investors are closely watching to see if this demand zone can support a reversal, potentially leading SOL back toward recent highs. Solana Holding Strong Despite Uncertainty Solana (SOL) has managed to hold above the key support level around $160, despite the recent market volatility and uncertainty. This level is crucial for SOL’s price structure, as it’s a strong demand zone that could act as a foundation for the next upward move. Crypto analyst Daan recently shared his perspective on X, revealing that SOL’s “most bullish case” would be for it to hold this “green zone” around $160, allowing it to gradually grind back up toward the descending trendline that has capped recent gains. In Daan’s view, the next attempt at this trendline could likely result in a successful breakout, with the potential to push SOL’s price above $200. He suggests that waiting for confirmation of this breakout could be a sound strategy for cautious investors, as there is still ample room for upside even after a confirmed reversal. His analysis highlights a confident outlook on SOL’s potential recovery, seeing this accumulation zone as a promising buying opportunity. However, Daan also acknowledges that there’s still a degree of downside risk. If SOL fails to hold above this $160 level, a deeper correction could follow, potentially driving SOL to test lower support levels. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? For now, the market will watch this support level closely as a critical indicator of SOL’s short-term trend. Holding above it would signal strength and open the door for a potential rally, while a breakdown could lead to a more extended bearish phase. As the overall market sentiment remains mixed, Solana’s next moves will be critical for traders and investors alike. SOL Price Action Solana is currently trading at $163 after tagging the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA), a critical indicator of short-term strength. Holding above this EMA signals a bullish outlook for SOL, suggesting that buyers are stepping in to support the price at this level. If SOL can maintain momentum above the 200 EMA, it could build a foundation for a potential rally to new local highs, possibly challenging the recent peak around $183. However, the $160 level remains a crucial support area. Losing this support would likely trigger significant selling pressure, potentially driving SOL down to the $150 range, where further demand may emerge. This zone would be closely watched by investors looking for potential accumulation opportunities, as a dip could provide favorable entry points for long-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? In contrast, a strong push above the current demand level would confirm renewed bullish momentum, paving the way for SOL to target and possibly surpass recent highs. As SOL hovers around this key technical zone, traders will be watching for any decisive movement that could signal the next direction, whether it be a continued uptrend or a retracement to lower demand levels.

35597348,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651327,1730642430,Spot ETFs Fail To Ignite Bitcoin Growth – Analyst,"The Spot Bitcoin ETFs have become a major headliner recently due to heightened levels of market inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, these ETFs have attracted over $5 billion in investments over the past three weeks coinciding with an impressive Bitcoin price rally of over 23%. However, amidst this euphoria, macro investment researcher Jim Bianco says these Spot ETFs have contributed no significant growth to the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bring In No New Money, Only Recycled Investments In a series of X posts on November 2, Bianco claimed the Spot Bitcoin ETFs despite their impressive inflow record do not attract any new investments to the underlying asset. Firstly, The analyst applauds the performance of these institutional funds some of which rank as the best-performing ETFs of 2024 following their launch in January. However, Bianco highlights BTC has failed to surpass its all-time high value of 73,750 set eight months ago despite the Spot Bitcoin ETFs accruing over $12 billion in inflows since BTC within the same period. Rather than being less than 4% down from its ATH, the analyst explained that such high inflows should have since pushed premier cryptocurrency beyond the $100,000 mark especially considering other positive indicators such as Fed rate cuts, the halving, and public endorsement by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump. For context, Bianco references the Gold ETFs with a record of over $6 billion in inflows since March 13, resulting in a 25% increase in gold’s market price during that period. The market analyst postulates that this price growth can be attributed to the “new money” flowing into the Gold ETFs. However, recycled funds shifted from on-chain wallets or centralized exchanges account for the majority of the investments in Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Jim Bianco backs this theory with a report from Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas which highlighted a decline in the exchange’s bitcoin retail traders over the last few months. Furthermore, he also points to the average Spot BTC ETF trade of $16,000 compared to the average gold ETF trade of $72,000 which is consistent with investments from wealth managers and institutions. In conclusion, Jim Bianco states the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not attracting any “new money” but merely circulating existing investments in Bitcoin, which he describes as a concerning trend that may grant traditional financial institutions (TradFi) more influence in the crypto market as against the ethos of decentralization. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Climb To $0.209 — Here’s The Level To Watch Bloomberg Analyst Fires Back At BTC ETF Criticism Popular Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has issued a strong rebuttal to Bianco’s take on the Spot Bitcoin ETFs which he describes as merely “mental gymnastics”. Balchunas has lauded the performances of these ETFs which he believed have played a crucial role in driving Bitcoin’s price from $35,000 in January to the present market price of almost $70,000. The Bloomberg analyst describes the Spot Bitcoin ETFs as “powerful” due to their low cost, high liquidity, and association with an established brand name and advises against betting against them. At the time of writing, BTC. continues to trade at $68,100 reflecting a 2.55% decline in the past 24 hours.

35597249,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651269,1730642310,Free Web3,"Web3 Liberation from Postmodernism’s Stranglehold: The Art Renaissance By VESA Postmodernism isn’t just an art issue—it’s everywhere. This single, pervasive philosophy has seeped into big tech, corporations, legislation, media, and nearly every major institution, often strangling genuine creativity, diversity of thought, and depth. For comparison, there are around 200 other philosophies, 4,300 religions, the male perspective, homemaker moms, the working class, the diminishing middle class, the scientific paradigm, and much more that are left out of gallery circles simply because they don’t fit the dominant narrative, which paradoxically claims to be the one that’s repressed. It’s really a luxury belief for the modern aristocracy—a tool for control—and the Marxist roots always emerge when pressure is applied. Postmodernism’s defining trait is deconstruction, pulling apart concepts and ideals without ever offering a cohesive path forward. It’s a circular maze that keeps doubling back on itself, producing increasingly bizarre conclusions to solve the very problems it creates. Real solutions lie in expanding the field of view beyond this single frame, embracing a diversity of philosophies, religions, and perspectives that have grounded humanity for millennia. The real power of Web3 lies in its ability to do just that: to break art and culture out of this one-note narrative, empowering creators and thinkers alike to explore beyond the limits imposed by postmodernism. This is what we missed in the first run of NFT’s importing the same postmodern experts from the realm we were trying to break free from. That and some better tech solutions for sustainable art, as some of the falling platforms have showed. We first had a true avant-garde scene, which was then quickly eroded by the millions upon millions showered on end-stage postmodern expressions, championed by people who either (a) didn’t realize how tired it all was or (b) were heavily financially and ideologically incentivized to support it. Funny, not funny It turns out that holding contempt for ideas and their significance means that, time and again, the working class ends up being ruled by them. While I understand why this is amusing to some, I see how many are now disillusioned, as the humanities have been overtaken by a single, monolithic ideology. Similarly, the U.S. intelligentsia’s “flyover states” disdain is now facing a reckoning with the MAGA hat in a very different way after 40 years of indulging in postmodern ideas and scorn. The underbelly of the speech in A Bug’s Life is surfacing, too. You can’t only summarise postmodernism to be woke and Marxist, but you aren’t far off. In case you want to hear the foundations, Steven Hicks has a brilliant analysis and summary of it. You might have to spend 3hrs to save your life & community to get it, so it’s not that long, really ⚡️ Part I – Philosophy foundations Part II – Relevance now For five long decades, postmodernism has held art in a chokehold, enforcing its narrow, often cynical, view of reality. Art became a reflection of society’s fragmentation, alienation, and obsession with irony—what I call the “postmodern monolithic rule.” While postmodernism initially sought to challenge established norms, it has since become the new establishment, dictating an increasingly restrictive narrative. The art world under postmodernism has marginalised genuine exploration, profound beauty, and universal human truths. This is where Web3 steps in, not just as a technological shift but as a liberation front for artistic expression. That was the point. Not just monetising what ever, but to actually set culture free. Web3 allows artists to break out from the centralised grip of traditional galleries and critics, unleashing a decentralized platform where new ideas can flourish – however this means the scene has to support that, instead of the next duck tape banana or drooling ape AI pic. Through NFTs and blockchain, creators can finally bypass the gatekeepers, reaching audiences directly and letting their art speak unfiltered. It’s the anti-postmodern era we’ve been waiting for—one that values authenticity, courage, and depth over calculated irony and shallow critique. The freedom to explore and create in as vast a way as the internet has already guided us to be for the past twenty years. What is the Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch. From paradise to hell, the lesson path is clear in the end stage. These aren’t just imaginative nightmares. They’re warnings about human nature — and what a world without religion is like. Feel familiar a bit? The twet link will explain it further. Outside the restrictive frame of postmodernism lies a rich expanse of artistic traditions and narratives that we’ve been missing out on. Imagine a return to the timeless pursuits of beauty, harmony, and spirituality, merged with the advancements of digital technology. Art that celebrates connection, transcendence, and human potential. Web3 offers the tools to bring these visions to life, and artists are now free to explore themes of mythology, futurism, abstraction, and even divinity—all without needing to conform to a single ideology. This isn’t just art for art’s sake; it’s art for humanity’s sake, and it’s been a long time coming. Authenticity as an Artist: From Cave Paintings to the Metaverse Art isn’t a recent trend—it’s a core aspect of the human journey that dates back to our ancestors painting on cave walls. In today’s world, however, many artists find themselves constrained by expectations to follow specific trends, often losing their authenticity along the way. True artistry isn’t about following popular movements or creating what’s fashionable. It’s about tapping into a lineage of creativity that spans thousands of years, one that includes everything from the first tribal carvings to the masterworks of the Renaissance, all the way to the digital landscapes of the metaverse. Why did Graham Hancock’s Ancient Apocalypse suddenly get attacked as racist, with Hancock himself labeled a white supremacist, despite his thirty-year marriage to a woman of color and his long-standing praise of ancient cultures worldwide throughout his journalistic career? You guessed it—postmodernism, as the series collapses the narrative. I’ll write more on that later. Inside the art world, for the most part, you might hear of Mayan culture and traditions, but not the parts that contradict postmodern ideas. Being an authentic artist means immersing yourself in this vast ocean of history and expression, drawing inspiration from the past and future alike. The beauty of Web3 is that it allows artists to travel across these realms without restriction. The blockchain and NFTs don’t just democratize art; they create a space where we can explore new forms of expression while staying grounded in the wisdom of our creative ancestors. The metaverse, for instance, offers the opportunity to merge the digital with the timeless, creating interactive experiences that honor the depth and spirituality of older art forms while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. When you explore the richness of art history, you find yourself standing on the shoulders of giants. Authentic art doesn’t mimic or simply react—it builds bridges. It’s about discovering your voice in this vast chorus and using every tool available, whether it’s oil on canvas, sculpture, or VR. Web3 and the metaverse make this journey even more exhilarating, providing artists with a canvas as expansive as their imaginations. True artists dig deep, break molds, and remind us that art is not bound by time or technology but by a timeless quest for truth. Imagine the uproar, the fuss and emotional outbursts if there was to be a grand unveiling of an openly conservative gallery? The Heretical Idea: Curate Your Own Galleries Outside the Establishment Here’s a heretical idea for cultural curators and artists: Forget trying to break into the art world if you don’t feel represented. Start your own galleries, curate your own shows, and let Web3 be your platform for sharing art on your own terms. It’s cheap to start an online gallery. Web3 has made this entirely possible. With decentralized platforms, artists can sidestep traditional gatekeepers, reach global audiences, and create communities that appreciate and support their work. Curating your own gallery isn’t just an act of defiance; it’s a celebration of creative freedom. Imagine artists coming together to form collectives that highlight unique styles, new voices, and daring themes that the conventional art world might consider “too much.” With NFTs and blockchain, you have the tools to bring these exhibitions to life without relying on anyone else’s approval. Curating your own gallery in the Web3 space doesn’t just disrupt the old system; it builds a new one based on collaboration, innovation, and authenticity. This is where real artistic diversity can thrive, unbound by the constraints of a single ideology. Artists can create galleries that reflect their own vision, themes, and messages—whether that’s surrealism, futurism, spiritual exploration, or socio-political commentary. The freedom to shape your own narrative is the most powerful tool artists have, and Web3 is the key to unlocking it. It’s time to stop waiting for permission and start creating spaces that embody the true spirit of art: raw, fearless, and unfiltered. TDR Notice that all these artists and collectors below are doing this poll by not making their views public. I’ve been standing up for this, in the free speech spirit, since I came in from 2017, and was put in the web3 Western culture jail for it (mostly) since. Here is an earlier article to prove it. 7-years ago So, have your postmodernism, it’s fine, I’m not trying to take your voice away from you, but actually deliver on the inclusion promise so everyone can come to play. The virtual is for everyone, not just one dominant ideology that leaves out most of the world. There are so many avenues to explore, but if artists don’t even dare to voice any nuance, let alone take a side in the most polarising election of my lifetime, then something is deeply wrong. As for the cover image, I have my reservations about Trump, even if there’s a potential Web3 landslide against the pro-censorship camp led by figures like Kamala. My concerns are less pronounced with Elon Musk, Ron Paul, RFK, Tulsi Gabbard, and increasingly JD Vance after listening to him on Rogan. While most visual artists sat this one out—even in Web3—the comedians have shifted the landscape, outpacing us 6-0 in terms of relevance. The thing is, even if Trump is guilty of a lot, he and his team of “X-men mutants” have become voices for Bitcoin, free speech, opposition to big pharma, and perhaps even psychedelics, squirrels, and the like. For the first time in my life, a political campaign is actually addressing ideas that interest me. Of course, as I am not a US citizen, you don’t have to worry about my vote even if you absolutely hate everything I just wrote. None the less, this election will greatly influence my life, and it is addressed in the web3 citizen of the world spirit.

Just about 96 hours ago, the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} was within a few dollars of breaking through its all-time high above $73,700, perhaps helped along by a surge in momentum for crypto-friendly GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

35591914,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651342,1730635212,Dogecoin Analyst Reveals Buying Opportunities At Lower Prices – Details,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at a pivotal level following a 17% retrace from its recent highs around $0.179. This pullback has brought DOGE to a significant demand zone, catching the attention of top analyst Daan, who recently shared a technical analysis identifying this level as an opportunity for accumulation. According to Daan, the current support zone could act as a launchpad if buying pressure intensifies, positioning DOGE for a potential rebound. However, the upcoming days are expected to bring heightened volatility and uncertainty, primarily due to the approaching US election and its anticipated impact on financial markets. As broader market sentiment often influences Dogecoin, this period could present swings in price as traders adjust to both political developments and economic responses. Related Reading: Solana Headed For Correction Before Bounce – Analyst Sets $180 Target The key now is whether Dogecoin can hold above this demand zone. If buyers step in and support builds, a recovery could see DOGE reattempt recent highs or push even further. Conversely, failing to hold this level might lead to a deeper retrace. Investors are closely watching this area, recognizing that Dogecoin’s next moves will be shaped by internal technicals and external market conditions in the days ahead. Dogecoin At Key Levels Crypto analyst Daan recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting that Dogecoin is approaching what he sees as prime accumulation levels. With DOGE trading around the $0.151 mark, Daan notes that this price point has acted as a resistance zone for several weeks, making it a key area for potential buying. In his analysis, Daan points out that the upcoming US election adds a significant layer of uncertainty to the market, dubbing it a “toss-up” for short-term price direction. He explains that the election outcome could impact both traditional and crypto markets, which may lead to temporary downward pressure or a surprising upward movement depending on results and broader market sentiment. Yet, for Dogecoin specifically, he believes that if the price continues to decline to these strategic levels, the risk/reward ratio could be favorable for buyers looking to “take a punt.” Daan also notes that Monday could bring further opportunities if DOGE dips lower, though he advises caution due to the likely volatility in the coming days. The analyst emphasizes that while these are risky conditions, the chance to accumulate DOGE at historically significant levels may pay off if the broader market sentiment aligns favorably post-election. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL? Ultimately, the coming days for Dogecoin look to be both volatile and uncertain, and whether it holds the $0.151 mark or dips further could set the stage for the coin’s next move. Investors watching DOGE closely are mindful of both the technical setup and external market factors, hoping for a possible rebound in this tumultuous environment. DOGE Technical View Dogecoin is currently trading at a key level of $0.151, where previous supply has now shifted to a crucial demand zone. This level will be essential for bulls looking to regain momentum and push DOGE toward new highs. Holding above $0.151 is vital for establishing a foundation that could propel the price higher, providing the market confidence needed for a potential upward trend. However, if DOGE fails to sustain this level, it could trigger a pullback toward the next major demand zone around $0.135. This lower level has acted as support in the past and could serve as a crucial point for accumulation if selling pressure increases. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? The coming days will reveal whether buyers can defend this $0.151 zone or if a deeper correction is on the horizon. Breaking above current levels would give DOGE the bullish push needed to test higher resistance zones and potentially establish a stronger uptrend. Conversely, losing support here would signal that sellers are still in control, setting DOGE up for a retest of lower demand levels.

This negative single-day performance ended what was another impressive weekly outing for the crypto investment products. Bitcoin ETFs Shine While Ethereum ETFs Continue To Struggle After a strong performance throughout the month of October, the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t register a perfect start to November. According to data from SoSoValue, the BTC exchange-traded funds posted a net outflow of $54.9 million on Friday, November 1. Breaking down the data, Fidelity’s FBTC surprisingly accounted for almost half ($25.64 million) of the outflow recorded on Friday. This figure was followed closely by Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB’s $24.13 million, the second consecutive outflow day for the fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Crucial To Sustain Current Buying Pressure – Details Grayscale’s GBTC, which usually contributes to the outflow days for the Bitcoin ETFs, recorded only $5.51 million in capital outflow. Other funds that recorded an outflow on Friday included Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’s HODL, and Valkyrie’s BRRR, with outflows of $5.64 million, $5.86 million, and $1.66 million, respectively. Interestingly, BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund IBIT didn’t see any inflow or outflow on Friday. Prior to this zero-inflow day, the trillion-dollar asset manager’s fund had seen capital influx for the last 14 consecutive days. In fact, IBIT posted its highest inflow day in the past week, with an influx of $872 million on Wednesday, October 30. While the Bitcoin ETFs posted outflows to end the previous week, the negative single-day action barely made an impact on the weekly performance. According to data from SoSoValue, the US BTC funds registered a $2.22 billion cumulative weekly inflow in the past week, the highest value since March. While the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have been producing remarkable performance in recent days, their Ethereum counterparts have not exactly impressed. After witnessing an almost $11 million outflow on Friday, the weekly capital influx was slashed to approximately $13 million for the spot Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin Price Overview Investors will be hoping that the Bitcoin ETFs will resume inflows when trading opens on Monday, considering its recent positive impact on price. The price of BTC almost touched its all-time high of $73,737 on Tuesday and Wednesday when the ETFs recorded their highest inflows in more than five months.

35580814,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651225,1730620808,Trump’s Crypto Token Offering: $300 Million Goal With Minimal US Participation – Details,"World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) initiative endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has disclosed that its ambitious $300 million crypto token offering is largely aimed at international investors. To date, fewer than 350 US investors have engaged with the project, raising questions about its domestic appeal amidst a landscape of regulatory scrutiny led by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). World Liberty Financial’s Offshore Focus Operating out of Wilmington, Delaware, yet managed from Puerto Rico, World Liberty recently filed a notice with American regulatory bodies, announcing its intent to sell only $30 million worth of tokens within the United States. Once this threshold is reached, the crypto venture company plans to halt the US offering, despite having approximately $288.5 million worth of WLF tokens still available for sale. Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin During The US Election, Expert Reveals Zachary Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty, indicated in a September interview streamed on X (formerly Twitter), that the company plans to leverage Regulation S—a provision that allows the sale of tokens to non-US investors without requirements typically imposed by US securities laws. The limited interest from US investors may stem from the SEC’s rigorous approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, which has prompted many token issuers to focus their efforts offshore. Trump’s involvement, along with that of his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, is highlighted in the company’s filings. However, the document clarifies that their names are included for “informational purposes” and do not imply an official endorsement of the offering. Capital Raising In A Complex Crypto Landscape During the September interview, Folkman discussed the potential for non-US sales through Regulation S, but he refrained from detailing the distribution of tokens between domestic and international buyers. US investors have been approached through a different regulatory pathway—Regulation D—which allows companies to raise unlimited capital from accredited investors, defined as individuals with a net worth exceeding $1 million, excluding their primary residence. Both Regulation D and Regulation S are designed to streamline capital-raising processes for companies. However, Regulation D imposes stricter investor protections and disclosure requirements. For instance, companies utilizing Regulation D must publicly disclose details about the offering, including the total amount raised and the number of participating investors. Folkman noted the necessity of verifying that US buyers meet accredited investor criteria, a process that adds another layer of complexity to the offering. As of October 15, World Liberty reported raising $2.7 million under Regulation D by selling tokens to 348 investors. In contrast, analytics from Kaiko show that around 17,000 unique addresses have held the asset at least once, suggesting broader interest that may not be reflected in US sales alone. Related Reading: Worldcoin Rejection At $2.1 Sparks Concerns Of Prolonged Downtrend The divergence between US and offshore sales could be partially attributed to the anonymity afforded by Regulation S, which does not require private companies to disclose capital-raising details or verify the financial status of buyers. Nevertheless, the regulation mandates that offerings be limited strictly to non-US persons, ensuring compliance with international investment rules. Folkman emphasized the company’s commitment to adhering to regulatory standards during his interview, stating, “We would expect that any potential non-US token sale would be limited to non-US persons and comply with applicable restrictions under what is known as Regulation S.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trumps-crypto-token-offering-300-million-goal-with-minimal-us-participation-details/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Solana had a wild market ride in the last two years, defined by extreme volatility. In 2022, JIM CRAMER CALLED PEOPLE BUYING SOLANA AT 11$ AS “STUPID” And Solana is trading over 170$+ now. Bro @jimcramer is that you ser? Lemme be stupid but am still up than your whole stocks. pic.twitter.com/cQ8986ean9 — Crypto King👑💎.eth.sol (@cryptosanthoshK) October 30, 2024 After the FTX fiasco, Solana hit single digits, provoking backlash and criticism from analysts and commentators, including Cramer. The anchor belittled the SOL holders as “idiots” when the token was trading at $11. Today, Solana is one of the best-performing tokens, which trades at $168, reflecting a 1,400% increase since the comments aired. This prompted many observers in the crypto community to popularize the “Inverse Cramer” effect. Crypto Holders Now Popularize The Inverse Cramer Effect Like most tokens, Solana experienced extreme volatility in the last two years. Jim Cramer was one of the most vocal detractors of the token, saying that holders of SOL “are idiots” and that these are con projects. In the same TV show, he added that SOL holders should not own and buy these tokens in the first place. However, current pricing for SOL paints a different picture. Plenty of other situations showcased Cramer’s wrong or poor judgment. Since there were several bad calls from Cramer, many in the crypto industry have coined the term “Inverse Cramer Effect.” In short, many observers suggest that the best trade should be the opposite of what Cramer says. Today, you can even find the Inverse Cramer ETF, which Tuttle Capital Management institutionalized. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? Cramer’s “Idiot” Comment’s Aftermath Today, CNBC’s Cramer continues to get media attention. In September, several Twitter/X users and analysts reacted to Cramer’s bearish outlook for Bitcoin, saying that a market rally for the top crypto is next. Although Cramer’s take is laughable or even frustrating at times, his observations can also help the crypto community move forward. These contrarian opinions and comments remind holders and traders to be careful with narratives and “praise releases.” Practicing due diligence is always better when trading SOL or other tokens.

The report highlights a mixture of growth and challenges faced by the blockchain amid broader volatility in the cryptocurrency market during that period. Solana Stablecoin Market Cap Rises To $3.8 Billion One of the standout metrics from the report is the growth of Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi), which rose by 26% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to reach $5.7 billion. This growth positioned Solana as the third-largest network in terms of DeFi TVL, surpassing Tron in late September. Notably, the TVL denominated in SOL also increased, growing by 20% QoQ to 37 million SOL. Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin During The US Election, Expert Reveals Kamino emerged as a leading player within the Solana ecosystem, experiencing a 57% growth in TVL, ending the quarter with $1.5 billion and capturing a 26% market share. This surge is attributed to the integration of new tokens, including PayPal’s USD (PYUSD) and jupSOL, which have enhanced the platform’s appeal. Despite the overall positive trends, decentralized exchange (DEX) volume experienced a slight decline, reflecting a downturn in memecoin trading. Average daily spot DEX volume fell by 10% QoQ to $1.7 billion. Per the report, the diminishing interest in memecoins was evident, as only two tokens—WIF and POPCAT—managed to make it into the top ten by trading volume for the quarter. In contrast, Solana’s stablecoin ecosystem showed resilience, with the market cap for stablecoins growing by 23% QoQ to $3.8 billion, solidifying its rank as the fifth-largest network in this category. On the non-fungible token (NFT) front, however, the performance was less favorable. Average daily NFT volume fell by 27% QoQ to $2.5 million, with Magic Eden maintaining a dominant market share despite experiencing a 44% decline in volume. Network Activity Thrives Despite the challenges, the number of funding rounds for projects within the Solana ecosystem saw a reduction of 37% QoQ, with only 29 projects announcing funding. Yet, the total amount raised soared to $173 million, a 54% increase QoQ and the highest quarterly funding since Q2 2022. Network activity remained robust, as evidenced by a 109% increase in average daily fee payers, which reached 1.9 million. Additionally, the average daily new fee payers grew by 430% QoQ to 1.3 million, signaling a growing user base. Related Reading: Worldcoin Rejection At $2.1 Sparks Concerns Of Prolonged Downtrend The average transaction fee on Solana increased by 6% QoQ to 0.00015 SOL (approximately $0.023), while the median transaction fee dropped by 19% to 0.000008 SOL (around $0.0013). As of October 15, Solana’s market capitalization also grew by 5% QoQ, reaching $71 billion and maintaining its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, trailing only Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Binance Coin. However, the Real Economic Value (REV) of Solana, which tracks transaction fees and miner extractable value (MEV) for validators, decreased by 25% QoQ to 1.3 million SOL (approximately $196 million), with 56% of this total coming from transaction fees. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $166, down 5% for the seven day period.

Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast,"A top executive of a New York-based global investment firm made an audacious claim that Bitcoin breaching the six-figure price will happen very soon. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said that in the next two years, BTC will be traded at $176,000, joining other crypto investors who believed that the oldest cryptocurrency is ripe for a six-figure price per coin.

Bitcoin To Rally Threefold Scaramucci hailed the alpha crypto asset for sustaining a price surge in only a short period, adding that it sees the digital asset to further surge in the next two years. Scaramucci’s statement was timely as BTC today regained its momentum and once again hit the $70,000 level after the crypto scared many investors as the digital asset slid further down to $68,000 yesterday. According to Scaramucci, he has an ambitious prediction on Bitcoin, saying that by mid-2026, the cryptocurrency will be traded at $176,000. In the previous days, several notable crypto personalities shared the same vision with Scaramucci of the likelihood that BTC will hit the six-figure mark. One of which even predicted a price of $220,000.

A Kamala Harris Supporter Scaramucci is among the few known crypto investors who announced their support for the presidential candidacy of current US Vice President Kamala Harris. Scaramucci disclosed in previous interviews that Harris would be endorsing Bitcoin once she got elected to the White House. The SkyBridge managing partner has been working closely with the camp of the Vice President to craft policies that will allow cryptocurrency to thrive under her administration. He added that there had been development in Harris’ crypto agenda which he plans to reveal soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Claims Address Dominance With 43% Lead—Will It Keep Rising?

The SkyBridge founder described the firstborn virtual coin as the digital gold of the cryptocurrency world. He noted that other leading financial experts, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, also believe in the Bitcoin-gold comparison, predicting that BTC would reach half of the gold’s market cap. He suggested that it would take Bitcoin about 10 years to attain such a milestone which would greatly benefit its investors since they would get a tenfold return on their BTC investments. At the time of writing, gold is being traded at $2,754 per ounce, a new all-time high, and boasts a market cap of $18.494 trillion.

This massive token burn, as reported by the Shibburn tracking platform, coincides with a notable uptick in Shibarium transactions. Considering the significant volume of tokens burned in these large-scale SHIB transactions, this development could potentially serve as a catalyst for a rally, propelling the Shiba Inu price towards the $0.00008 milestone. Shiba Inu Burn Rate And Shibarium Transactions Skyrocket The Shiba Inu community has been filled with optimism as reports of an increase in SHIB burns spread across the crypto market. Just this week, recent data revealed that the Shiba Inu burn rate, which measures the number of tokens permanently removed from circulation, has seen a dramatic increase in the last few days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeezes Tighter Than It Was Before 2021 Rally, What This Means The Shibburn tracker reported a massive 24,271% increase in SHIB burns in a single day, destroying approximately 5,674,617,337 SHIB tokens. Earlier this week, Shibburn unveiled yet another significant rise in Shiba Inu burns via X. According to the SHIB burn tracking platform, the rate of tokens burned on October 31 had increased by an astounding 373,969.11% in just one day. This massive burn rate resulted in over 5.6 billion SHIB tokens sent to dead wallets. Furthermore, in the last 24 hours Shiba Inu recorded a historic moment as $100,019 worth of SHIB tokens were burnt in a single day. Notably, the SHIB burn rate has not been the only metric rising in the SHIB ecosystem. Lucie, SHIB’s marketing lead revealed in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, that the daily transactions on the Shibarium Layer-2 network has skyrocketed to 3.89 million, recording a total transaction count of 446,904,690 at the time. The Shiba Inu marketing lead commemorated Shibarium builders, particularly WoofSwap for its steadfast commitment towards driving growth and innovation in the Shibarium ecosystem. Lucie disclosed that last year, WoofSwap had achieved a major milestone for the Shibarium network after they initiated a significant minting push that contributed to Shibarium burning nearly $1 million worth of SHIB tokens. Can Recent Rise In SHIB Burns Fuel Surge To $0.00008? The ongoing increase in SHIB burns, coupled with the recent rise in Shibarium transactions, marks a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu community. This achievement reflects the community’s desire for additional SHIB burns aimed at enhancing the token’s scarcity and driving more demand. Related Reading: PEPE Midterm Price Prediction: Is A 326% Rally To $0.00003474 Possible From Here? Typically, when a cryptocurrency is burnt, it means that it has been completely wiped out of circulation, which often creates scarcity and can lead to a potential price increase as demand for the cryptocurrency rises. In the case of Shiba Inu, the meme coin has a total circulating supply of 589.26 trillion SHIB. Of this substantial supply, 410.7 trillion SHIB tokens have been burned, representing nearly half of its original total supply of 1 quadrillion at its launch hour four years ago. Continuous SHIB burns could see the price of Shiba Inu rallying back to former all time highs of $0.000086. Moreover, the optimism generated from the burns is set to drive demand and potentially fuel gradual increase in the SHIB price to $0.00008. As of writing, the price of Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000017, marking a 2.3% rise in the last 24 hours. A price increase to the $0.00008 mark would require Shiba Inu jumping by approximately 370.59%.

35558171,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651268,1730592017,Dogecoin Price Could Climb To $0.209 — Here’s The Level To Watch,"The crypto market saw one of its most positive weeks in the last seven days, and Dogecoin was one of the major beneficiaries of this momentum shift. According to a popular crypto pundit, the meme coin appears not to be done yet, as it readies itself for another move to the upside. Here’s Why $0.169 Could Be Pivotal To DOGE’s Future In a new post on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has put forward an exciting outlook for the price of Dogecoin over the next couple of days. According to the market expert, the largest meme coin looks primed to cross the $0.2 landmark as the month of November drags on. This bullish projection is based on the formation of a bull flag pattern on the Dogecoin four-hour chart. The bull flag is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a period of steady upward movement (the flagpole) followed by a short period of price consolidation or slight downward movement (the flag). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Correction Triggers $296 Million In Liquidations – Can BTC Still Hit ATH? Typically, the bull flag is an excellent upward continuation pattern that could suggest the persistence of a positive run. The trick is to wait for the breakout of the flag (the price consolidation) before confirming the continuation of the upward trend. This breakout from the flag often results in a move higher, usually measuring the length of the prior flag pole. According to Martinez, this pattern appears to be playing out on the Dogecoin four-hour chart, with the trigger point lying around the $0.169 mark. The analyst noted that there is a major resistance around $0.168 and a successful close above this region could see the DOGE price run up towards its 2024 high. Using the length of the first flagpole, the price target for Dogecoin is placed at around $0.209, which would represent a 29% rally from the current price point. While a move to $0.209 would reflect a major leap in the meme coin’s price trajectory, DOGE would still be about 250% adrift of its all-time high price of $0.7316. Dogecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Dogecoin stands at around $0.1603, reflecting a mere 1.1% in the past day. While the meme coin seems to have slowed down in the last 24 hours, its weekly performance still places it amongst the best-performing assets in recent weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the DOGE price is up by nearly 20% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH?
