42404383,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhz8z,1585951919,MakerDAO Foundation Plots Its Own Demise,"MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen told CoinDesk late last year the MakerDAO Foundation had two years left before its planned obsolescence.      It sounds like it may take a bit longer but recent moves suggest the organization really is serious about shutting down.      First, it turned control of the supply of undistributed governance tokens, MKR, over to MKR holders at large. Then, on Thursday, Christensen detailed a three-plank plan that would get community governance to the point where MakerDAO users wouldn't even notice when the foundation shuts its doors.      That said, that institutional knowledge won't evaporate, Christensen assured listeners. ""The Foundation team will not leave the community. The team will change and be in a different form,"" he said.      It's been said we are in the middle of a resurgence in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). MakerDAO is arguably the most important app on Ethereum and for it to become a full DAO successfully would be a major step in that trend – one with repercussions that could be felt much longer than the meltdown of ""The DAO"" in 2016.      The crux of the idea is to fully decentralize the MakerDAO Foundation so that different parts of its work will be done by different organizations. Those workers would be employed, ultimately, by MKR holders.      ""It's important that we now as a community begin to prepare governance for taking over full responsibility of the system,"" Christensen said.    Calls to open source the Fed may someday stem from MakerDAO's success.    Which almost amounted to a fourth plank. A recurring theme in Christensen's talk was that the deployment of what he called a new ""governance paradigm"" needs to start soon so that the community can get used to it by doing it. By doing it, they will improve it and themselves get better at using it so that when the foundation is really gone, it will no longer be necessary.      ""The rollout of the self-sustaining MakerDAO initiative is going to be a very much a step-by-step process that will happen very carefully and deliberately,"" Christensen said. ""About two years from now, that's when the foundation will begin dissolving, and the dissolution will itself be a gradual process.""      Chris Burniske of venture firm Placeholder sees a bright future following these moves.      ""Maker is already the most transparent and inclusive credit facility the world has, and decentralizing its operations will be key to hardening the system against adversarial actors and scaling it into a global utility,"" Burniske told CoinDesk. ""Calls to open source the Fed may someday stem from MakerDAO's success.""    Plank 1: Elected Paid Contributors (ECPs)    MakerDAO needs to break up the various kinds of work it does into different organizations around the world, Christensen said.      There could be a few development teams, a few marketing teams and a few teams working on government relations in different countries, all depending on what the protocol needed.      The idea is that groups would come to MKR holders with proposals and budgets, and if those globally dispersed MKR holders liked the concept, they would fund the project. Decred has been doing something similar for a while.      Still, ""The crucial element of compensation by the protocol needs to be developed,"" Christensen said.      He also said there are parts of the foundation now that can spin off and become standalone entities, pointing specifically to MakerDAO's exchange, Oasis.      On some level, it's already doing this. Christensen said MakerDAO already has fairly independent bodies now, listing out the risk team, the governance facilitator and the oracle team.    Plank 2: Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs)    The improvement proposal model goes all the way back to the beginnings of the internet itself, and each corner of crypto has its own version.      MakerDAO has an extremely loose and informal early history and it is moving now into a much more formal structure, but one that reflects crypto’s values of decentralization.      ""At its core, the goal is to formalize and structure what is already happening organically in the community,"" Christensen said. ""Maker Improvement Proposals are a way to completely formalize and structure this concept and then make the process entirely transparent end-to-end, so there's no black box.""      Christensen described this as the next thing the community really needs to move on. The MakerDAO Foundation’s Charles St. Louis published a forum post on April 1 about the timeline for rolling this out.      The foundation would release 13 specific MIPs for the community to consider on April 6, he wrote.      Joey Krug, co-chief investment officer of Pantera Capital, told CoinDesk he felt the move is a return to MakerDAO's grassroots. ""To date, the foundation has almost a bit too much control, in my opinion, and to see it become more community-driven would be a great thing.""    Plank 3: Vote Delegates    Voter participation needs to be improved on MakerDAO. To do so, there needs to be a way for small holders who care but are not super informed to participate, by delegating their tokens.      This is a well-established process on Tezos, for example, but Christensen argues that inability to delegate has kept small holders and extremely security-conscious holders from voting their MKR.      Vote delegates are ""people or entities that are assigned votes by MKR holders,"" Christensen said. ""The foundation believes that vote delegates are incredibly important in order to really overhaul the way that voting currently works.""      Christensen said the job of delegates will be to take positions and engage in public debates in the forum, in the way elected leaders would. This way, delegates will earn the support of voters who will back their views with their tokens.      In short, it's representative democracy but one where a voter can change their representative in real time.      ""Smaller MKR holders actually have a lot of MKR. It is the biggest voting bloc, but right now there is no way for them to pool their votes,"" Christensen said. Once they can, he believes they will have real clout.      Crypto entrepreneur Ric Burton is bullish on vote delegation in the DeFi world. He has already stated his intention to serve as a delegate for holders of the Compound governance token (COMP), and he would like to do this same for Maker.      ""I want to become a protocol politician for the MakerDAO,"" Burton told CoinDesk.      Burton’s goal is to be a countervailing force to some of the largest holders of MKR. ""I will amass delegated votes from the masses to keep Paradigm, A16Z & Dragonfly in check,"" he said.    Logistical questions    If vote delegates are MakerDAO’s legislative body, ECPs and the domain teams are its executive branch.      Christensen called ECPs ""public servants,"" carrying out the will of the big picture articulated by MKR holders.      ""Domain teams, I see them more as following the results of votes and implementing that, rather than they themselves being political actors,"" Christensen said.      All of this raises a lot of practical issues. Such as, who will pay the people who work for MakerDAO. That is, who will actually sign the checks.      There's a lawsuit being organized right now against the protocol by borrowers whose collateral was wiped out by a $4 million attack on March 12. Which part of the DAO would face a lawsuit?      Christensen acknowledged that these are good questions and they aren't answered yet. In a way, he said, they will never fully be answered, because it will all need to change over time, but it's important that the community starts practicing running itself – and soon.      ""It's not just that the tools aren't in place, but that the community needs a lot of experience using these tools,"" Christensen said.      The aftermath of the March 12 vulnerability was certainly a test, one that required filling a deficit in the ETH collateral backing dai stablecoins. Avichal Garg of Electric Capital, a MKR holder, told CoinDesk he was impressed by the quality and the dispersed nature of the conversation.      ""I was very impressed at how it was both extremely effective and extremely decentralized. It felt like multiple pockets of people around the world coordinating and the community basically made all of the right things happen with minimal involvement from the Foundation,"" Garg wrote.      When CoinDesk spoke to Christensen at length in 2019, it was clear he was ready to move onto other things, but he also didn't want his creation to go awry without him.      He wants the community he founded to gradually get experience with self-sovereignty over time. In a way, it seems like Christensen envies the way Satoshi disappeared early.      ""By the time the dissolution of the foundation happens,"" Christensen said, ""it won't even matter, no one will care.""",NEUTRAL,COMP | ETH | MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | ETH | EXCHANGE | MKR,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/03/makerdao-foundation-plots-its-own-demise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10103ef8862c7d7003d080d9537abb0d4092e3a2-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404378,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhz44,1585948621,BIS Researchers Say Coronavirus Could Spur Central Banks to Adopt Digital Payments,"Researchers at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) think COVID-19 may accelerate the adoption of digital payments and sharpen the debate over central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      The bank issued its forecast in BIS’ April 3 Bulletin. COVID-19 is changing the public's relationship with cash, BIS said, despite the scientific community’s consensus that coronavirus transmission via banknote is relatively unlikely.      “Irrespective of whether concerns are justified or not, perceptions that cash could spread pathogens may change payment behavior by users and firms,” the researchers said.      For starters, countries may expand digital payment infrastructure with more online, mobile and contactless options after COVID-19. Digital adoption actions could have an “especially severe impact” on millions of older and unbanked people, though.      “If cash is not generally accepted as a means of payment, this could open a ‘payments divide’ between those with access to digital payments and those without,” researchers said. Cash may therefore stage a comeback, the researchers admitted, but the pandemic “also calls for CBDCs.”    Phasing out cash    CBDC could bridge society’s need for digital payments with its responsibility to those who cannot easily access them. There are a few caveats: Central banks would have to tailor their CBDCs to “the context of the current crisis,” by making payment contactless and accessibility universal, the researchers wrote.      “The pandemic may hence put calls for CBDCs into sharper focus, highlighting the value of having access to diverse means of payments, and the need for any means of payments to be resilient against a broad range of threats,” they said.      Indeed, some politicians are already proving the researchers’ prediction true. Jorge Capitanich, governor of Argentina’s Chaco province, advocated for “digital currency transaction systems” that phase out cash usage in an April 1 coronavirus teleconference with President Alberto Fernández.      Capitanich did not respond to a request for comment.      The idea of a digital dollar also appeared numerous times in the U.S., after language describing a central bank-operated system appeared in three different bills, including one by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown.    Contaminated bills    Researchers also examined the question of whether the outbreak is having an impact on cash usage.      “The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented public concerns about viral transmission via cash,” researchers said.      They found different countries manifest their fear in often contradictory ways. Cash circulation surged in the U.S. while in the U.K. ATM withdrawal volume plummeted; some central banks sterilized reams of banknotes while others asked retailers to stop refusing cash, or called on the public to place science over fear.      Fear, however, appears most rampant in economies with small denomination bills like the U.S., U.K., Australia and others, the researchers found. Such countries spent the last 30 days googling banknote transmission terms with higher average search intensity than their large-denomination bill counterparts.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/03/bis-researchers-say-coronavirus-could-spur-central-banks-to-adopt-digital-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2907914c9092ecc52ea3a24d80f5563ffb8b5fc1-1420x918.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404382,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhz62,1585942473,How Blockchain Tech Can Make Coronavirus Relief More Effective,"Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard.      As COVID-19 forces the United States economy into a recession, millions of families have been devastated by job loss or work reduction. According to the Labor Department, more than 10 million Americans filed claims for unemployment insurance in the last two weeks of March, a 20-fold year-over-year increase. April 1 rent deadlines caused panic for commercial and residential tenants. College students have been evicted from school dorms; some are now returning to a home of newly unemployed parents wondering where and how they are going to buy food. The U.S. Congress argues over how much money individuals will receive as part of national relief packages to offset these losses.      As of this writing, Congress has passed the CARES Act, which will provide a temporary increase in Unemployment Insurance and deliver up to $1,200 for adults and $500 for children. It is also debating an upcoming “Phase 4” stimulus. For most families, this will not be nearly enough to cover the lost income from the shutdown. The full impact of this has yet to be seen.      See also: Frances Coppola - How Central Banks Could Use Digital Cash to Deliver Universal Basic Income      Just as troubling as the financial inadequacy is the cost of uncertainty. For almost a month, Congress has quarreled over relief program choices such as payment size, frequency, qualifications, among others. Further, once a relief bill is passed, no one can say how long it will take the money to arrive. As a result of this uncertainty, families spend as little as possible, and panic. This feeds the growing economic and societal damage of the economic policies required to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.    Show commitment    An essential condition for effective relief: commitment.      In situations like these, commitment has tremendous economic value. In economic terms, commitment is the observed inability of an individual or organization to deviate from a specified course of action. If Congress were to agree in advance to a set of conditions for monetary transfers to individuals in which they would guarantee to distribute money promptly whenever the economy hit a set of predefined, negative macroeconomic indicators, families could worry less. Tenants could continue to pay rent and consumers would be more confident in continuing to spend. Through commitment to relief payments, the government could reduce the size of a looming recession and increase the speed of recovery.      The economic power of commitment is widely recognized by economists and it extends beyond economic stimulus payments.      See also: Catherine Coley - The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      When looking at Universal Basic Income, for example, the benefits rely on individuals receiving a guaranteed monthly payment of a specified amount, no matter what. Economists have shown that monetary policy can be more effective when commitment is an option. Recently, economist Claudia Sahm has argued for automatic stabilization, which would involve implementing automatic payments to individuals based on an algorithm generated from macroeconomic indicators.      But from monetary policy to fiscal stimulus, the key question is how can a government credibly commit to taking specific actions in the future? What prevents Congress from passing legislation promising future relief payments, only to later repeal or override them? Until distributed ledger technology (DLT), this question had no good answer. Now Congress can show its commitment through DLT.      As the DLT industry further develops, the technology’s underlying properties and benefits will become more clear. At Prysm Group, we developed a framework to identify these to-be-discovered industry changers.      We call this framework the 3 Cs:    Coordination: DLT allows a group of stakeholders to coordinate on a shared database for their common use. It creates a source of instantly verifiable information among this group, reducing the frequently substantial costs of communicating and reconciling data across different sources.  Commitment: Distributed ledger technology, together with smart contracts, allows participants to commit to future actions and outcomes using code to enforce them. This reduces inefficiencies that arise due to contractual incompleteness, such as the risk of one of the parties reneging on a previous agreement and the cost of enforcing agreement.  Control: Distributed ledger technology enables stakeholders to retain local control of their data, thereby balancing bargaining power among participants. It allows these stakeholders to capture more of the value they create, improving incentives for participation and investment.    DLT can add credibility to automated relief payments.      In a potentially not-too-distant world where the U.S. government had a dollar-backed stablecoin running on a permissioned ledger, the elusive answer to the question of how to credibly commit to government payments can be addressed. This commitment is delivered through the use of smart contracts, with an additional layer provided by the ledger’s distributed consensus mechanism.    Smart contracts    If Congress were to pass legislation specifying relief payments will be made when the economy exhibits certain macroeconomic patterns, these transfer conditions could be implemented through publicly verifiable smart contracts on the ledger. DLT enables individual recipients to have their own wallet and permit trusted oracles run by impartial sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Labor Department to provide the underlying data.      Once the required macroeconomic events take place, the smart contracts are engaged and payments are automatically made. Individuals are able to observe the macroeconomic data and precisely predict when and how much money may be headed their way during times of crisis.    Distributed consensus    Smart contracts alone are of limited value if a single entity can unilaterally edit or delete them. This is why the second layer of commitment that distributed ledgers provide — via the consensus mechanism — is also important.      A supermajority of nodes in a distributed ledger are required to update the ledger. The ledger’s nodes in a use case of this magnitude need to be institutions that are nonpartisan and charged with maintaining the health of the economy. For example, each regional Federal Reserve bank could serve as a node. Then Congress, the President, or any other single party cannot unilaterally cancel or delay payments when a crisis arrives. The nodes collectively ensure no last-minute changes are made unless most of them agree.      See also: Stephanie Hurder - Why Enterprise Blockchains Fail: No Economic Incentives      Of course, regular review of the form and conditions for the automatic payments will need to be completed. Legislation should specify a deliberate, well-thought-out process for their review, which the nodes will enforce.      Thanks to smart contracts and distributed consensus, consumers are reassured their payments will not suddenly disappear when they are most needed. DLT can alleviate unnecessary societal stress, minimize the plunge, and perhaps lead to quicker economic recovery.      Implementing a major government program via DLT would require a number of advances, both technical and political. The adjustment to large-scale use of ledger-based currencies will be a significant one. However, minimizing the economic and societal impact of uncertain times, like those of the past month, is just one of the many to-be-discovered benefits the introduction of the Digital Dollar can deliver.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/03/how-blockchain-tech-can-make-coronavirus-relief-more-effective,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd67ba58d19fcee197c071aeb75a94f001d5afad-1480x869.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Larry Donnell and Shuwana Leonard were charged Friday with defrauding investors by allegedly stealing nearly $500,000 in the sale of bogus stock certificates and shilling an alkaline water-backed cryptocurrency and a non-existent bitcoin mining operation.      The Leonards are accused of specifically targeting the African-American community in this alleged scheme. Their companies, Teshua Business Group and Teshuater, are also named as defendants.      The Leonards allegedly attempted to sell phony stock in their alkaline water bottle company, Teshuater, which they said would yield “short-term investment returns of up to 3,000 percent” according to the complaint. This raised $291,044.07.      Larry Leonard is also accused of shilling Teshuater’s “fully functioning cryptocurrency,” TeshuaCoin.      The complaint says he compared TeshuaCoin’s usability to bitcoin (BTC) and touted its “unique” attribute – it was backed by Teshuater’s bottled alkaline water. The SEC alleges TeshuaCoin was not actually backed by Teshuater. Leonard allegedly raised $170,395.20 out of his target $20 million through this scheme.      Leonard allegedly stole an additional $25,544.96 from investors in Teshuater’s non-existent bitcoin mine. The SEC said he failed to disclose the speculative nature of bitcoin mining and never actually invested the stolen funds in the mine.

Hong Kong-based Hex Trust is partnering with the enterprise blockchain company to offer banking clients another option for issuing security tokens. The custodian began working with R3 when one of its clients issued collateral tokens for derivatives on Corda.      “A lot of the new demand coming is for Corda-based tokens or other similar blockchain-based protocols,” Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini said. The custodian joins the roughly 10 other custody firms R3 works with globally.      Hex Trust will integrate with R3 through the Corda software development kit (SDK) for tokens that was released in July 2019. R3 clients can take advantage of Hex Trust’s custody solutions while Hex Trust clients can take advantage of the Corda blockchain.      While neither firm could name specific projects, Hex is working with one of the “largest Asain banks” and R3 has several security token projects in the works.    Expansion map    Hex Trust’s technology was built with banks and other traditional financial institutions in mind. It offers hardware security modules from IBM, is connected with the SWIFT payment network and has integrated with the top 10 blockchain protocols by market capitalization.      Hex Trust also has a trust company license and holds a trust or company service provider (TCSP) license under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance in Hong Kong. The custodian is entering the Monetary Authority of Singapore sandbox and applying for the capital markets custody license in Singapore. It’s also been provisionally authorized by Germany's Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) to provide crypto custody services and is applying for the crypto custody license in Germany as well.      “The license helps to identify the roles of custody players and what they can do and what they cannot do for traditional institutions like banks and asset managers,” said Doris Teo, R3’s strategic account director for the Asia-Pacific region.      Hex Trust expects to see more demand for security tokens as Hong Kong and Singapore open up sandboxes for exchanges to trade such assets and as other European Union countries develop new licensee frameworks for crypto custody.      “I’d say the most important thing is the asset lifecycle,” Hex Trust’s Quaglini said. “Tokens designed digital on blockchain allow transactions to happen 24/7.

In an ask-me-anything (AMA) Friday, CEO Changpeng Zhao said his exchange has committed at least $2.4 million in crypto to buy sorely needed COVID-19 medical supplies and plans to donate up to $2 million more through its philanthropic arm, the Binance Charity Foundation (BCF).      “We are donating physical supplies, masks, other medical supplies, hopefully, eventually, ventilators.” Zhao said. He estimated Binance’s total contributions will add up to “somewhere around $5 million.”      While Zhao said Binance had already donated the $2.4 million, BCF’s website only noted $1 million donated so far.      Zhao said these supplies are shipping directly to hospitals in need. BCF’s early efforts focused on China: it has delivered hundreds of thousands of personal protective equipment (PPE) items to 300 Chinese hospitals as of March 20, according to BCF’s website.      PPE will now flow to other sickened countries.      “I think there's a shipment going to Italy this week,” Zhao said, “and then hopefully we will be able to cover the U.S., Germany and some of the other countries that are really severely impacted.”      BCF has also raised about $200,000 in crypto from the public, according to Zhao.    AMA    Much of the AMA focused on Binance’s recent acquisition of CoinMarketCap (CMC). Zhao repeatedly said he has no plans to interfere with CMC’s independent operations or turn it into a traffic feed for Binance, already the world’s largest exchange by volume.

It was the lowest level since Dec. 5.      Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of how risky or volatile an asset would be over a specific period. It is computed using the prices of an option and the underlying asset and other inputs such as time to expiration.      The compression of this spread implies that cryptocurrencies' fortunes are tied more strongly than before to each other. But the force driving them together could be the turmoil in the mainstream financial markets, due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.      “The market is macro-driven and does not expect a lot of ‘dispersion’ between the different coins and anticipates a convergence of ether and bitcoin price volatility,” said Emmanuel Goh, CEO of Skew.      See also: Bitcoin Extends Rally as Trading Volume for CME Futures Hits Three-Week High      Volatility essentially represents uncertainty and has a positive impact on option prices. The higher the uncertainty, the stronger the hedging demand is for both call (bullish bet) and put (bearish bet) options.      However, it does not tell us anything about the direction of the next move. High implied volatility simply means the underlying asset has the potential for big price swings in either direction.       The ether-bitcoin implied volatility differential topped out at a record high of 33 percent on Feb. 22 and has been falling ever since.      “Option-implied volatilities are driven by the net buying pressure for options and historical volatility,” said Lukk Strijers, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit.      Trading places    Ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies were outperforming bitcoin in February. Bitcoin’s dominance rate, or share of total market capitalization, had declined to a seven-month low of 62.58 percent on Feb. 24.      Hence, it's no surprise that, in February, markets were anticipating a higher ether price volatility compared to bitcoin.      “The increase in investor interest in ether led to a rise in ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread,” Strijers said.      The situation changed in March, as macro factors became the focal point, diverting attention from altcoins to bitcoin – a safe haven from global turbulence, at least according to its proponents, and a benchmark for crypto markets.      However, instead of rising, bitcoin fell sharply in tandem with stocks, as the demand for cash, mainly U.S. dollars, surged amid the coronavirus-led uncertainty in the financial markets.      The bellwether cryptocurrency tanked by nearly 40 percent on March 13.      “The massive drop resulted in a relatively larger increase in bitcoin’s implied volatility versus ether’s implied volatility, causing the spread to narrow,” Strijers told CoinDesk.      In this way, the ether-bitcoin implied volatility differential’s drop to multi-month lows is indicative of a macro-driven market.      Another reason bitcoin faces heightened volatility over the next three months, as suggested by the ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread, is the cryptocurrency’s next mining reward halving, expected in May.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained       A lot has been said about the potential impact on bitcoin’s price of the upcoming 50 percent emission cut. Most experts are of the opinion that the drop in the pace of supply expansion will bode well for the price. As a result, investor interest in bitcoin is likely to remain high compared to ether.      Further, the coronavirus pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down and is threatening to push the global economy into a prolonged recession. Again, the macro uncertainty would keep the focus on bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/03/ether-bitcoin-price-volatility-spread-hits-4-month-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60986d7a17401fe91914d9adccde0f504f94ba14-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404353,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwUg,1585935530,"Blockchain Gaming, Messaging Apps See User Growth Amid Coronavirus Lockdowns","Screen time around the world is way, way up, which has led to a relative surge in a small corner of the cryptocurrency space, its more casual and entertaining one.      The irony here is bitcoin (BTC) was born from an economic downturn, and most diehards would have thought this would be crypto's time to shine. And yet, as a financial asset, the top cryptocurrencies have not done well at all in recent months. In fact, crypto appears to be retreating into stablecoins.      And while the HODLing set has generally pinned little hope on crypto's games and toys, they seem to be the first facet of the industry to see a silver lining in what otherwise looks to be an economic catastrophe.      Messaging    Status raised a reported $107 million in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) in order to build a crypto-powered answer to WhatsApp with a built-in Ethereum wallet. The Crypto Winter of 2018 hit Status hard, however, forcing the startup to let go of 25 percent of its staff in December of that year.      Things now seem to be looking up for the chat app.      ""With the rise of government surveillance increasing across the globe as an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, we suspect people are turning to privacy preserving tools like ours,"" Status marketing chief Jonathan Zerah told CoinDesk in an email.      The company released version 1.0 in mid-February, though earlier alpha and beta versions had been out since February 2017.      ""Status has seen an increase in both installs of the mobile application as well as active peers in the messaging network,"" Zerah wrote. “Around March 17 (just over one month after the initial release of v1.0) we noticed a ~50 percent increase in daily installs from the previous day.""      Kin ecosystem    Kin is a blockchain that arose from a messaging app, Kik. It has since sold off that asset and the company is now running entirely on making its fork of Stellar into the most popular blockchain in the world.      The whole focus of this blockchain is putting micropayments inside the fun, time-wasting activities that made things like Instagram and Pinterest into behemoths.      Kin says it had over two million spenders in March. That means people earned kin tokens in one of the network’s 50 or so apps, basically always spending them in the same place. In fact, Kin’s Kevin Ricoy told CoinDesk the firm was on track to see three million spenders by March 31.      This surfeit of attention has proven to be an opportunity for social applications in the Kin ecosystem.      MadLipz is an app that lets users take a clip from any sort of video and easily dub a voiceover on it, usually intended for comic effect.      Amir Alikhanzadeh, MadLipz CEO, told CoinDesk, ""It's not always about just the entertainment value. Humor is a powerful tool to indirectly vent about conditions and situations that people face."" MadLipz has also opened up a virus-specific channel.      The app saw a 42 percent jump in weekly active users for the week of March 15 versus the week of March 8, to 615,000 weekly users. Further, people were spending 14 minutes per session on the app versus 11 minutes before. Notably, the team has seen disproportionate spikes in usage in countries just after lockdowns have been announced, which has also led to a big overall spike in new users.      Another big Kin app, Rave, which allows users to consume media together and chat about it in real-time has also seen an uptick in usage.      ""We've gone from around a million MAU [monthly active users] to multiple million MAU,"" Rave CEO Michael Pazaratz told CoinDesk in an email. Users spend an average of 45 minutes in the app per session, Pazaratz said (because they do things such as syncing up a TV show or movie with a friend located elsewhere).      Apps like MadLipz and Rave plug into Kin because the blockchain rewards apps that drive the most crypto-economic activity each day via its Kin Rewards Engine. App creators can then sell that kin to fund their operations. However, crypto earned by users in kin apps still can't be taken out and used elsewhere, though the team promises that day is coming.      Games    The boon to games has not been limited to mainstream titles.      Games with crypto at their core but mainstream appeal have also seen strong gains. War Riders, a sort of Mad Max adventure that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to give users game access, also has its own currency token called benzene.      ""We’ve been seeing about 70 percent jump in new users and average time spent in the game increased drastically,"" Vlad Kartashov, CEO of Carfied, the company behind War Riders, told CoinDesk.      War Riders is free to play, sort of. It requires an NFT representing one of the vehicles to access the game. The company decided to run a promotion last weekend to hook interested users, giving away free war vans to people curious about trying the game. Over 300 people picked up a free van and there's another similar promotion coming soon.      For context, the least expensive War Riders vehicle sells for about $5 in ETH on OpenSea right now. Others sell for hundreds of ETH, however.      Lucid Sight is a game company that has worked very hard to appeal to the mainstream market without making its crypto elements too obvious. It has brought Star Trek and Major League Baseball to the blockchain, primarily relying on NFT technology to give users who care about these things true ownership.      Lucid Sight CEO sent CoinDesk data on its space game, CSC, which incorporates ""Star Trek""-themed spaceships among many many others. They are seeing more players at a time and people are playing far longer. Session times are up to 60 minutes, from 20 minutes before the COVID-19 crisis.      Further, a lot more spaceships are selling. The market cap for CSC in-game items is up $10 million. Lucid Sight has seen 70 percent more sales over the month, as well, to 60 million items.        Virtual worlds    In a corner of the crypto world that's part game, part social network, there is Cryptovoxels, a very indie sort of Sim City experience, led by Ben Nolan.      ""We were seeing concurrency of five to 10 logged in users before lockdown and an average of 40 to 50 now,"" Nolan told CoinDesk.      Two community leaders in Cryptovoxels decided to put the call out for a virtual reality party dubbed ""Get Out While You Stay In."" Forty to 50 people were hanging out virtually and artists in the community made special works to decorate the common space.      ""We had to do a bunch of work to get the world to scale OK to the event, but I think it went down pretty well,"" Nolan said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/03/blockchain-gaming-messaging-apps-see-user-growth-amid-coronavirus-lockdowns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f565f26509d7d5fd9793bf523b923d4e597c4b5e-1375x974.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404359,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwYc,1585929900,Looking for a Safe Haven Digital Asset? Try Gold,"Olga Feldmeier is CEO and co-founder of SMART VALOR, a European digital asset platform for trading, staking and issuance. She previously held executive positions at UBS and Barclays.      The rapid spread of the coronavirus caught most of us completely unprepared, including most of us in finance.      Now is the time for most people to adjust their financial holdings. The flight to safety pushed many to the U.S. dollar. However, the safety of dollar has also been put in question with the announcement of quantitative easing and other money supply increasing measures. .      See also: Tobias Huber - How Financial Models Could Move Bitcoin’s Price After the Halving      Having served an eventful tenure as the head of sales at the Wealth Management Division of UBS, the world's largest wealth management bank, I learned that the speed of adjustment of the client portfolio in moments of crisis can have a crucial influence on its overall long-term performance.      The key problem is how to switch. When everything is on fire, it is difficult to see what will save your savings. Everybody is looking for the safe-haven assets negatively correlated to the overall market. Many of us hoped it would be crypto. We hoped ""digital gold,"" bitcoin (BTC), would always move in the opposite direction to the general market. Yet, recently we learned bitcoin could fall from the sky like any other asset. On March 12, it dropped about 50 percent, in line with other financial assets.      Looking at the price development of bitcoin in the last 10 days, to me it looks like the high level of volatility is here to stay. Will bitcoin surge back to $20,000 or more, supported by further money printing, the collapse of the banking system or the halving event in May? Or will it keep crashing like last month with volatility spikes attached?      Nobody knows for sure. But one thing is clear. In times of crisis, holding too much in crypto is not advisable. Even for me, as an outright Bitcoin maximalist, and holding the majority my savings in cryptocurrency, I must say: Now is the time to hedge.      See also: Ether-Bitcoin Price Volatility Spread Hits 4-Month Low      But what does this hedge look like? If it is not the US dollar and real estate, what else is out there for us? The natural answer is gold.      Let’s look at the historic correlation between gold and the stock market. In a crisis, it tends to be negative, meaning that gold’s price rises as stock markets fall. Through wars and the worst recessions – including the Great Depression in the 1930s – we have experienced a massive rise in the price of gold. During the last two recessions of 2000 and 2008, gold protected the portfolios of investors like no other asset. During the Global Financial Crisis, gold’s price grew by more than 200 percent. This is why gold is generally referred to as a safe-haven asset or chaos hedge.    Why now is a good time    The stock market collapse, in which S&P 500 slipped around 30 percent since its peak in late February, has yet to see its counterbalance in the corresponding rise in gold’s price. So far, the gold price is up 10 percent during the last two weeks. Why hasn’t this happened yet? The reason is that during the initial stage of a stock market crash, market participants need to unbundle leveraged positions, liquidating – among other assets – their gold positions. The price is flat on the year-to-date basis, hovering at around $1,500/oz at the time of writing.      Another metric, the total holdings of gold, reveals that investors have been preparing for a shift in the economic cycle for a while now. The total holdings of bullion-backed exchange-traded ETFs are at the record high, having doubled from 1,450 to 2,700 tons during the last four years, according to Bloomberg.    One can expect further devaluation of the greenback in the near future.    Lastly, there is a rather inverse relationship between the value of the US dollar and gold. The US dollar lost 93 percent of its value over the last 100 years. And this journey is long from over. Looking at the US's massive $23 trillion national debt and the recent monetary policy decisions by the US Federal Reserve, one can expect further devaluation of the greenback in the near future. As a matter of fact, last week, the US Federal Reserve decided to lower the benchmark interest rate from 0.25 percent to 0 percent and relaunched its quantitative easing program and other programs mounting to $2 trillion stimulus package.    The role of blockchain    Today, the predominant way to get gold exposure is through physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). To invest in these ETFs, you either need to have an account in the bank that offers such instruments or open an account on a trading platform offering gold ETFs. This is the old world. Decentralized finance does away with barriers like these.      Both physical gold ETFs and tokenized gold represent ownership rights in physical gold stored at some secure vault. Also, both can be traded on exchanges and represent a relatively liquid asset. The difference between ETF and tokenized gold is that traders can send the token globally, peer-to-peer, in a few minutes to anybody anywhere who has a blockchain address. No bank account necessary.      Tokenized gold can be used not only as a store of value but also as a means of payment, whereas it can travel completely outside of the banking system. It becomes the type of money we used before Bretton Woods did away with the Gold Standard. Should state defaults and bank runs become daily news, it could be the money the world turns to again.      See also: Crypto Exchange and Custodian Smart Valor Goes Live in Switzerland      While governments are looking at ways of tokenizing national currencies, and companies like Facebook are working on digital corporate money, all of this might come too late. The world in crisis will need a fast and reliable transfer mechanism for stable money that everyone trusts. This is how the global financial crisis might become that catalyst that catapults blockchain-based digital assets such as tokenized gold to mass adoption.      For this to happen we need three things: token issuers, exchanges and trust. The role of token issuers is to reliably put appropriate amount of precious metal behind each token issued. Exchanges enable trade and provide liquidity. (Paxos was an early pioneer, issuing the gold-backed PAXG token, which is today the only fully regulated gold token that you can redeem for accredited gold bullion bars.) The recent addition is Switzerland-based SMART VALOR, where I'm CEO. Last week it became the first European crypto exchange to embrace PAXG and enable direct on-ramps and trading in Swiss Franc, GPB and EUR via bank wire or credit card payment.      The third component – trust – will be hardest to achieve. In the eyes of traditional investors, crypto exchanges are not a place of trust. You could see this last week as the streets of many European cities were filled with people lining up in front of gold shops. Clearly, they do not trust their banks to hold that gold ETF for them. But many of us in the crypto space may trust tokened or digitalized gold ownership.

42404346,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwNn,1585926000,P2P Exchange Hodl Hodl Takes First Step in Bringing Private Bitcoin Trades to BlueWallet Users,"While the cryptocurrency space has moved well beyond its cypherpunk origins, some platforms are still determined to let users keep their transactions to themselves.      In the works since late 2019, BlueWallet, a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet for iOS and Android, is integrating with Hodl Hodl, a peer-to-peer exchange, to add private bitcoin (BTC) trades to the app.      Now, the wallet's users can view available orders on the exchange, but a full integration is coming in “several months,” BlueWallet co-founder Igor Korsakov told CoinDesk. Once complete, BlueWallet users will be able to buy and sell bitcoin directly with other users via the app.      “They have a non-custodial wallet, we have non-custodial trades. Nobody else in the bitcoin space has done this yet,” Hodl Hodl CEO Max Keidun said.    No checks    Hodl Hodl is a peer-to-peer exchange that as a matter of principle does not perform know-your-customer (KYC) checks. That's because the team does not believe providing identification does any good for bitcoiners – on the contrary, it makes their personal data subject to potential hacks and leaks, the founders said.      “We chose Hodl Hodl because it’s the only peer-to-peer marketplace that isn’t doing KYC and isn't going to,” BlueWallet's Korsakov said. “This will be very important in the coming battle for privacy in bitcoin.”      That ""battle"" is between the proponents of pseudonymous, private transactions and the more numerous pro-KYC/anti-money laundering (AML) companies choosing to comply with requirements from global financial watchdogs such as the Financial Action Task Force. BlueWallet places itself firmly in the first group.      “In 2020, this battle will be in full swing, as the regulators are pressing more and more, and exchanges are easily handing over their users’ data, introducing KYC, working with blockchain analytics firms and rejecting the coins from suspicious transactions,” Korsakov said. This hurts the fungibility of bitcoin and destroys the presumption of innocence for users, he believes.      “We’re not going to do any surveillance,” Keidun agreed. “Plus, virtually any coins could touch the dark web marketplaces at some point.”      See also: BTCPay Server Now Processing Blockstream’s Liquid Assets      Hodl Hodl is serving about 25,000 users globally at the moment, according to Keidun. The marketplace has recently joined a number of other exchanges using the Liquid sidechain by Blockstream for faster transactions.    Taking it mobile    To trade bitcoin on Hodl Hodl, a user needs to find a counterparty and create a two-out-of-three multi-signature escrow (that gives a key each for both parties in the trade, with a third held by the exchange).      The seller locks bitcoin in the escrow and releases it once they see the buyer has sent a fiat currency payment via an agreed method. In case of a conflict, Hodl Hodl can the third key to resolve the dispute and release the funds either way.      “As we don’t store users’ funds, creating a standalone mobile app would be nonsense. As in this case, we would have to create a wallet as well and take care of the funds. So we chose to integrate with already existing wallets,” Keidun said. Hodl Hodl is in talks with other wallets as well, he said, but could not disclose any names.      Also read: Ripple Engineers Publish Design for Private Transactions on XRP Ledger      Building the multisig escrow for a mobile interface is no easy task, Korsakov conceded.

The fund, which holds between $6 million and $10 million in assets under management, appears to have fallen victim to the coronavirus crisis. March 12, aka “Black Thursday,” was the worst of it, driving bitcoin (BTC) prices down over 40 percent.      “We don't talk about our products publicly given we're regulated,” David Fauchier, Cambrial’s co-founder and chief investment officer, told CoinDesk. “We'd have to run any response through our [regulatory] umbrella and we're a little busy right now.”      Launched in 2018 and regulated by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Cambrial Capital team includes Ha Duong, Edward Nelson and Alex Obadia. The two sources said Cambrial has an impressive and respected team in the industry, adding that the coronavirus “black swan” had brought with it an onslaught of margin calls.      A fund of funds is where a pooled investment is diversified across multiple other fund managers who specialize in a variety of strategies. Outfits like Cambrial include tactics such as arbitrage, market making, OTC trading, mean reversion and so on.      Given their diversification, these types of funds are sometimes called “market neutral.” But crypto investing of any kind is high risk and Cambrial is not the only trading business to be pushed over the edge during last month’s markets rout.      Crypto hedge fund Adaptive Capital announced it was shutting down its fund and returning the rest of its capital to investors about a week after the crypto markets plunged in March.      However, some players in the crypto fund-of-funds space remain positive about the present opportunity.      “Most investors can’t access the leading prop shops (Jump, Tower, Two Sigma, Brevan Howard, Jane Street) that do algo-trading on digital assets,” said Yuval Reisman, co-founder of crypto fund YRD Capital. “We allow access to the same strategies, many times, by investing in people that left these funds and launched their own fund.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/03/cambrial-capital-to-shut-down-after-coronavirus-tanks-markets-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36e5d0981f2f9b08bd92d015348b40f3579de453-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404350,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwRj,1585917260,FBI Used Bitcoin Trail to Catch Russian Rapper Accused of Money Laundering,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) used bitcoin wallet activity and an old exchange account as key evidence to arrest a Russian rapper on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering.      In an affidavit unsealed earlier this week, FBI special agent Samantha Shelnick said she and her team had used the digital paper trail to uncover a major money-laundering operation, run by a shadowy criminal organization known as QQAAZZ. The rapper, Maksim Boiko, is believed to be closely connected to the leaders of the gang.      QQAAZZ received and laundered money for cybercriminals by changing fiat currency into crypto. The group had signed up for multiple exchanges, including Coinbase and Bitstamp, with the username ""Atrofi95."" As these exchanges have KYC (know your customer) checks, FBI officials linked the accounts back to an email account controlled by an Aleksejs Trofimovics who, as the affidavit claims, regularly communicated with phone numbers associated with Boiko.      Boiko's phones, used to communicate with Trofimovics, included multiple screenshots of bitcoin wallet addresses and transactions of up to $35,000. On further investigation, many of these pictures were found in conversations between Boiko and other suspected QQAAZZ members.      See also: The FBI Is Now Reaching Out to QuadrigaCX Victims      Suspicions were first raised for officials after Boiko and his wife tried to enter the U.S. with getting on for $20,000 in cash in January of this year. There were also multiple pictures on his phone, stretching back to 2015, showing him posing with large bundles of money. At the time, Boiko said the money came from revenue collected from rental properties in Russia, as well as investments he had made in bitcoin.      Per the FBI complaint, filed in theWestern District of Pennsylvania, Shelnick said the agency also found multiple conversations between suspected cybercriminals and someone by the name of ""gangass.""      They linked this pseudonym to Boiko via an account on BTC-e, a crypto exchange shut down in 2017 on suspicion that it was used to facilitate money laundering. Boiko had registered with an email containing his rap name, ""Plinofficial,"" and the moniker ""gangass"" as the username.      Boiko, who now stands accused of conspiracy to commit money laundering, has continued to release music under the label Smells Weed Music. He was still active on Twitter earlier this week. On Monday he said: ""In Miami, zombie land is real. Everything is closed altogether.""

42404363,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwcY,1585915216,Bitcoin Extends Rally as Trading Volume for CME Futures Hits Three-Week High,"Trading activity for bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has picked up pace as bitcoin has extended its recent rally to levels above $7,200.      CME traded $347 million worth of futures contracts Thursday – the highest since March 16. On that day, futures witnessed a trading volume of $414 million, according to data provided by research firm Skew.      Thursday’s spike in trading volumes marked a 294 percent rise from the preceding day’s tally of $88 million.      Open interest or open positions on futures ticked higher to $170 million on Thursday to hit the highest level since March 11. While open interest denotes the number of contracts that are open or active, volumes represent the number of contracts traded during a specific period.      Institutional interest in the derivatives space, which began heating up in the fourth quarter of 2019, surged in the first six weeks of this year. For instance, daily trading volume for bitcoin futures on CME rose from $176 million on Jan. 2 to a record high of $1.1 billion on Feb. 18.      See also: ‘They Have the Users’: Binance CEO Explains Why He Bought CoinMarketCap      By March 6, however, volumes had dropped to $88 million. Open interest also declined from the record high of $338 million to $113 million in the five weeks to March 20.      Other exchanges also saw a similar drop in the activity. The aggregate or total open interest in futures listed across the globe fell below $2 billion in March, having hit highs above $5 billion in mid-February, according to Skew data.      The sudden slowdown in the activity coincided with the global dash for fiat, primarily U.S. dollars, triggered by the coronavirus-led slide in the global equity markets. Institutions likely took a break from the crypto derivatives market amid the crisis.      As CME is again witnessing higher numbers, activity on other exchanges, too, is picking up, as evidenced by the rise in aggregate daily volumes to $19 billion, the highest since March 23.    Rally return    The volume numbers have improved alongside a recovery in bitcoin’s price. The top cryptocurrency by market value rose above $7,200 on Thursday – a level last seen on March 12, when bitcoin’s price had collapsed by nearly 40 percent, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $6,950, representing a 2.4 percent gain on the day.      From a fundamental perspective, the rally from lows under $4,000 seen in March could continue as on-chain metrics have recently bounced out of, or are currently sitting in, zones that have historically signaled bottoms, blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode noted in its weekly newsletter.      Technical charts, too, are biased bullish.    Daily chart    Bitcoin closed above the upper edge of a pennant pattern Thursday, signaling a continuation of the rally and opening the doors for $8,000 – a level last seen on March 12.      The cryptocurrency bounced up from the upper end of the pennant (former hurdle-turned-support) early Friday, reinforcing the breakout. As a result, bitcoin may soon test the resistance of Thursday’s high near $7,200.      However, if buyers fail to keep prices above $7,000 for the second day in a row, a pullback to $6,200 could be seen. The cryptocurrency has already failed three times in the last two weeks to establish a foothold above $7,000.

42404352,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwTh,1585908000,Why Are Crypto Companies Going to Abu Dhabi?,"For cryptocurrency startups seeking the stamp of legitimacy that comes with regulation, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has become a draw.      Being on the borders of a desert, where temperatures easily surpass 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer, life in Abu Dhabi is a struggle. With little natural drinking water, the city has to desalinate seawater just to provide enough drinking water for its 1.5 million inhabitants.      The modern skyscrapers and the lush public gardens are part of a different reality: Abu Dhabi presents itself as an oasis. As the UAE continues to diversify from oil, the city's wealthy rulers want to entice new businesses, including those in the cryptocurrency industry.      Several industry members told CoinDesk that Abu Dhabi – specifically the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the city's international financial center – has become an attractive jurisdiction for crypto companies large and small since it introduced digital asset regulation in June 2018.      Richard Teng, CEO of the ADGM's chief markets watchdog, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), told Coindesk it had ""received strong interest"" from industry players about operating as a licensed crypto business in the jurisdiction.      There are reportedly as many as seven or eight cryptocurrency companies, and a similar number of ancillary services, interested in moving to Abu Dhabi.      These include some household names. Kraken has already initiated the licensing process and is working with the FSRA to make its offering compliant with local laws. Chief Operating Officer Dave Ripley told CoinDesk Abu Dhabi was attractive because it is a ""strong, growing and free market [that is] becoming more and more global.""      The Huobi exchange is also in the process of setting up an office in Abu Dhabi. Ciara Sun, Huobi's head of global business, said the firm hopes its new premises would serve as the regional base for the Middle East. ""It's a great market, blockchain adoption is growing fast in the region."" Sun declined to say how far Huobi was along the licensing process.      Blockchain payments startup Ripple is in dialogue with the FSRA, a person familiar with the situation said. A spokesperson for the firm did not respond to a request for comment.      See also: More Than Half of Financial Advisors Want Better Regulation Before Investing in Crypto      In a nutshell, the ADGM's crypto framework provides a full list of standards and expectations on key financial market components, like anti-money-laundering, market integrity, customer protection, safe custody of assets and governance models, for any business looking to operate as an exchange, brokerage or custodian in the jurisdiction.      Although no business has been given a full license yet, Christopher Flinos, the co-founder of crypto over-the-counter and custody platform HAYVN, has held in-principle approval – a nod, effectively – from the FSRA for the past 10 months. He told CoinDesk that HAYVN had looked at other jurisdictions but settled on Abu Dhabi because its regulation ""was much better than anything else.""      As his company deals with institutional clients, many of which have strict due-diligence requirements, Abu Dhabi's stronger regulatory regime was better for business, Flinos said.      ""All I care about is that the regulatory framework in which HAYVN operates is good enough so that when I'm sitting with a U.K. pension fund, and I'm trying to allocate a small percentage of their overall portfolio into cryptocurrency, they appreciate HAYVN is regulated as if we are a financial institution,"" he said.      See also: FATF Says US ‘Largely Compliant’ With Virtual Currency Recommendations      There are other, more strategic reasons for moving to Abu Dhabi. ""The whole [regulatory] regime in Abu Dhabi is pretty much lifted from the U.K,"" explained Tim Aron, director of decentralized exchange DeversiFI and a London-based barrister.      Before becoming FSRA CEO in 2015, Teng was director for corporate finance at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). As the FSRA hires many of its officials from the financial regulatory bodies of other countries – such as the U.K's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – Aron suggested Abu Dhabi's regulation might be a precursor for future crypto regimes in other countries.      ""The language and the legislation are almost exactly the same, so anyone who is familiar with U.K. regulation would find their way around Abu Dhabi regulation pretty simply,"" Aron said. ""The reason we, and possibly others, are thinking about this is that we've got an eye on the possibility, and the likelihood, in the near future there will be a move towards regulating spot crypto.""      There are, of course, other jurisdictions offering some sort of cryptocurrency licensing framework: Malta and Liechtenstein have their own cryptocurrency regimes, with Singapore having gradually incorporated digital assets into its existing payments regulation.      But part of the appeal of Abu Dhabi, according to the companies moving there, is it is almost like an exclusive club: It is devilishly difficult to get regulated there. Only 5 percent of initial applicant-companies are invited to apply for an ADGM license, according to Teng, a process that can take upwards of 14 months.      Some of the businesses pushing for an Abu Dhabi license, like Kraken or Huobi, are already global players. But many, like DeversiFI and HAYVN, are smaller and see having passed such rigorous scrutiny as a ticket that will enable them to offer their services in other jurisdictions.      HAYVN is setting up offices in London, Singapore and Zurich, as branches of the Abu Dhabi office. Although there is no equivalence regime with the U.K., Aron said approval from FSRA, with the same standards and right protections as the FCA, would likely make U.K. authorities more amenable when the time came to get regulated there.      Also read: Regulatory Issues Need More Clarity in 2020      ""We could all be sitting in the Seychelles and providing these services,"" Aron continued. But having a regulator ""looking over your shoulder and essentially giving a stamp of approval"" generally gives customers a little bit more comfort, he added.      And not just customers. In an industry like crypto, where the outlook for regulation is so uncertain, something like the ADGM license may give businesses much-needed reassurance they are in the clear.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/03/why-are-crypto-companies-going-to-abu-dhabi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae3772d7487fb47f0626dff272fd1cdfba88b96a-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404360,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwaa,1585904400,Corporate America Knows the Bailout Is Baked In,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      In the year 1730, the Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon described the uneven effect of newly issued money as it enters society. He made two common-sense observations: that money must enter the economy at a specific point of ingress; and that the devaluation that often follows issuance does not happen immediately, but over time, as the economy incorporates the new monetary issue. This means that the first spender has an advantage. Society hasn’t had the chance to recognize their dollars are worth slightly less yet.      A “Cantillon insider,” consequently, is an individual who is able to monetize proximity to the printing press. (As far as I can tell, the term was coined by Nick Szabo.) In western countries, inflation-derived handouts typically do not happen transparently, because the population would be scandalized to witness them. Instead, they happen obliquely, and they are justified with recourse to euphemisms in op-eds insisting the government must do something. So let’s explore specifically how the latest fiscal and monetary outlay – equivalent to 25 percent of one year’s worth of America’s entire productive capacity – is being unevenly distributed. In short:    The U.S. government is selectively distributing funds to entities most adept at positioning themselves for handouts  The U.S. government is directly rewarding corporate failure and discouraging the standard process of capitalism    A stimulus consisting solely of payouts to individuals or households would be far more direct, and much fairer, than the obscure and arbitrary handouts the state has devised instead. Instead, the stimulus is directed towards keeping corporations intact rather than having them suffer messy liquidations or restructurings.    Corporate America has embraced fragility    So do shareholders in these insolvent publicly traded companies deserve bailouts? Is it possible they, through no fault of their own, suffered an unfair fate and deserve to be rescued? To evaluate this, we must consider their capital allocation decisions over the last decade. Overwhelmingly, this involved repurchasing their own stock. While there is nothing inherently wrong with buybacks, they have, of late, been employed by corporate executives with a gusto that would make Crassus look miserly.      When a company perceives there are no productive projects left to invest in, is it common to distribute some of their earnings to shareholders, either through buybacks or dividends (the former are more popular because they are tax-advantaged). The other instance when buybacks are defensible is when management believes the stock price is undervalued. But valuations are not low – they are historically rich, on a relative basis.      And when a company not only dedicates its free cash flow almost entirely to buybacks but combines it with an insatiable appetite for debt, as virtually the entire corporate sector has done for the last decade, something is clearly amiss.      See also: Nic Carter - Crypto Progressives Become Conservative With Their Own Chains      What our largest corporations have done is trade a short-term appreciation in the share price (which rewards executives, who are primarily compensated with stock options), for long-term fragility. Lacking a strong balance sheet buffer, the slightest amount of volatility is sufficient to render a company insolvent.      So why would boardrooms and the C-suite make this trade? Surely they knew that a low-volatility regime could not last forever. Even though the virus was unforeseeable, a crisis (of some kind or another) was not. The best answer I have is they internalized lessons from 2008-09. They guessed that, come an economic slowdown, they would be able to successfully lobby the government for a bailout. And this was a good bet, because our society is allergic to failure, choosing instead to stifle all trouble with the opiate of easy money. We set a lingering precedent in 2008-2009, and now we have opted to double down on the arrangement.      Now what alternative would I propose, you may ask?      Very simple: Pass legislation allowing standard liquidation or restructuring processes to be expedited, so creditors can take over, companies can be bought at fire sale prices, capital can churn and the corporate sector can refresh itself as we start to extricate ourselves from the viral gauntlet. Remember: When companies go bankrupt, their assets do not disappear. The shareholders take a loss and restructuring or a sale occurs. As for the government stimulus, allocate it exclusively to households so they can support themselves during a forced lockdown. Make everyday folks, and not corporate shareholders, the Cantillon insiders. If corporations fail, equity holders should bear the necessary cost of their poor governance decisions, creditors should take over, and boardrooms should learn the meaning of risk once again. It will be a lesson they never forget.      What many misunderstand is that this is not primarily a debate about the devaluation of the dollar. It’s entirely possible we escape inflation – although I expect that now extreme fiscal and monetary operations have been normalized, policymakers won’t want to give up their new toys so easily (see President Trump’s plea this week for a new $2 trillion infrastructure plan). No, even if the dollar somehow retains its purchasing power as the U.S. government mortgages itself to the hilt, the distortions will persist.      What is happening now is a straightforward reallocation of society’s resources. The specifics have been well covered elsewhere. We all know that airlines spent 96 percent of their free cash flow on buybacks, and will now be bailed out. We know executives at bailout candidate Boeing siphoned $5.4 billion from the company, that dilution veiled through the clever employment of buybacks. All of this while refusing to invest in its fleet, leading to the deaths of 346 innocent souls. Then we have tax breaks to the tune of $170 billion for real estate investors, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. And, of course, we have complete non-sequiturs, like $100 million earmarked “for the arts,” of which $25 million is directed to the Kennedy Center. These are the entities your government is preferentially rewarding with easy money, under the guise of rescuing the economy.    The message is very clear: failure and risk taking is rewarded and encouraged.    It’s undeniable that money entering society benefits those with the greatest proximity to the spigot. Honest economists evaluating the government’s stimulus plan should bite the bullet and concede these distortions are simply the cost society must bear in exchange for stability, rather than feigning that they don’t exist. They should explain to everyday Americans their direct handout is minuscule compared to the total size of the stimulus and that Congress prefers corporatism as the dominant organizational mode of society, even if the outcomes are profoundly unfair.      Let me remind you why this is catastrophic for society and for the genuine capitalist impulse. Bailouts are not one and done. The market remembers. The dangled implicit promise of a bailout creates an institutional environment which selects for the most risk-seeking, pro-lobbying companies. And this isn’t the beginning: what is happening now is the culmination of a system which was entrenched for good in 2009.    Moral hazard    Think of the corporate environment like an ecology. Under normal circumstances, companies which unsustainably accumulate debt and return capital to shareholders instead of investing it in the business or retaining it as a buffer enter a fragile state, and suffer adverse consequences when faced with a crisis or shock. Their equity holders may be totally wiped out. However, in the pre-crisis period, they outperform their more conservative peers. The existence of this downside risk is what keeps reckless behavior in check.      If you eliminate the negative consequences of risk taking, you reward these risk-seeking entities. Now the calculus is different. The companies taking on leverage and refusing to buy insurance (in the form of capital retained on the balance sheet) outperform in the short andlong term, as the government writes them a gigantic free put option in the form of a bailout. The message is very clear: failure and risk taking is rewarded and encouraged.      See also: Nic Carter - Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      The consequence is more restrained businesses that act responsibly and hedge against tail risks end up getting outcompeted, as they end up overpaying for insurance the government is giving out for free. The dominant corporate activity shifts away from innovation, R&D, and CapEx, towards ensuring shareholder equity is protected in a crisis by a watchful, paternalistic state. So this evolutionary environment yields a homogenous set of corporates that are socialized into taking on debt, aggressively returning capital and devoting energy towards wasteful lobbying efforts. We are left with a quasi-nationalized system.      Standing in the way of the standard insolvency, restructuring or liquidation processes that undergird effective capitalism is a violation of nature: It arrests the destruction of capital and the revaluation of businesses. Individual mortality is what guarantees the thriving of the collective; conversely, prohibiting failure guarantees the stagnation of the whole. If failure becomes unacceptable, the members of that corporate setting reconfigure themselves to exploit the life-giver, to zombify and stagnate. We simply must permit businesses to fail.      After the government rewarded the directors of insolvent financial institutions during the crisis of 2008-2009, the best we could muster as a response was a ragtag bunch of protestors in New York City's Zuccotti Park on the left, and the Tea Party and Ron Paul on the right. Today, these movements have been utterly defanged: There is no party that endorses fiscal responsibility or monetary restraint. Printing, easing and spending at the expense of tomorrow – these are some of the only shared hobbies of the Democrats and the Republicans.      The truth is, both parties are profoundly beholden to the managerial class and this zombie-capitalist system they have incubated. The progressive movement tried valiantly to rid the Democratic Party of its corporate influence; the movement was brutally quashed not once but twice. And the Republicans have scarcely ever resisted the capital-political complex.      Ultimately, policymakers will make their choice. But unlike in 2009, the population is more prepared now. Even though we have been temporarily cowed by the virus, the outrage will be no less fierce. The solution lies not within politics, but outside of it altogether: No vote can arrest this slide. The only genuine choice is dissociation altogether.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/03/corporate-america-knows-the-bailout-is-baked-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

OneConnect Financial Technology, which is the fintech arm of China’s largest insurance company, Ping An Insurance, has entered into a joint program with the China Merchants Port Group (CMPort) to build a logistics system based on blockchain for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, according to a March 31 report by the China News Service, a state media publication.      “Since the central government’s directive to develop blockchain technology from last year, Shenzhen customs, China Merchants Group and Ping An have started to work together to study blockchain applications in cross-border logistics,” Xiaoying Chen, director of Shenzhen Customs said in the report.      The platform will include information from Chinese custom services, port operators, logistics companies, financial institutions and export and import firms in one single system via shared databases on chain. One of its goals is to offer a more efficient tracking system at a lower cost. Financial services will also be more accessible to the trade companies.      See also: ‘They Have the Users’: Binance CEO Explains Why He Bought CoinMarketCap      The system will have five databases to manage information about trade companies, goods, logistics, contracts, and documents and certificates. It could help government agencies to better supervise international trade and reduce processing time for financial institutions to provide export and import firms with trade finance services.      OneConnect is one of the four “fintech unicorns” groomed by the state-backed Ping An group. One of its focuses is to apply blockchain to traditional financial services through its cloud technology.      SoftBank led a Series A round in OneConnect with a valuation of $7.5 billion in 2018. The firm went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November last year. However, the initial public offering raised $359 million at a market value of $3.63 billion as of its first trading day on Dec. 13.      The China Construction Bank – a national commercial bank – also invested in a blockchain-based trade finance platform where exporters and importers can connect with banks and lending agencies for short-term financing. The bank said last October trading volume on the platform had exceeded $53 billion since its 2018 launch.

42404355,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwWe,1585888200,"Manufacturers Mark Down Bitcoin Miners as Price Drop, Halving Change Calculus","Bitcoin mining machines are on sale.      Last month’s crash in cryptocurrency prices has prompted manufacturers to sell inventories at a discount, in some cases as steep as 20 percent, over the past few weeks. Both the newest models and slightly older machines have been marked down.      Complicating the matter is the imminent bitcoin (BTC) halving in May that will reduce the network's mining reward by half, causing most miners to be less profitable if bitcoin’s price doesn’t increase significantly by then.      See also:Bitcoin Halving, Explained      For instance, DJ Miner, an overseas distributor for Shenzhen, China-based MicroBT, was advertising about $2,500 per unit of the manufacturer’s flagship WhatsMiner M30S early last month. After bitcoin’s March 12 crash – the worst sell-off in seven years – the price is now cut by 20 percent to $2,000 per unit.      The WhatsMiner M20S, a less advanced but popular model that boosted MicroBT’s market share against major rival Bitmain in 2019, is also seeing a 20 percent price cut from $1,679 to now $1,340, DJ Miner’s website shows. Pangolinminers, another distributor for MicroBT shows similar pricing rollbacks on its website.      Similarly, while Bitmain is advertising $1,567 for its AntMiner S17+ with a computing power of 67 terahashes per second, various resellers are posting quotes on WeChat seen by CoinDesk at around $1,300 per unit.      The Beijing-based mining giant has previously announced the pricing for its latest flagship AntMiner S19 Pro at about $2,900 per unit but the shipment won’t take place until May and so far is only available for investors inside China.      See also:How Bitcoin’s Price Slump Is Changing the Geography of Mining    Efficient market    It is important to note that most specialized bitcoin computers, known as ASICs, had already been dropping in price since the fourth quarter of last year, as the manufacturers adjusted their strategies in line with bitcoin’s price swing.      These machines are priced assuming it would take the buyer on average 15 months to make back their equipment investment. Holding the payback period relatively constant, manufacturers would adjust the prices of their equipment according to bitcoin’s market price and the level of competition on the network – the two factors that determine how much revenue a miner can generate in a day.      Miner pricing data compiled by research startup TokenInsight shows that, for example, the Whatsminer M20S and the AntMiner S17 Pro were priced at around $2,400 and $3,000, respectively, in mid-October 2019. The price for both had dropped to around $1,500 as of March 10.      See also:A New York Power Plant Is Mining $50K Worth of Bitcoin a Day      “ASIC miners have experienced a relatively large market devaluation since Q4 2019. However, the miner market has found some level of price floor during Q1 2020 despite the recent crypto market downturn,” said TokenInsight analyst Johnson Xu. “Some experienced miners are currently looking to purchase some secondhand ASICs at a significant discount … based on their carefully structured model.”      Blockware Solutions, a reseller of bitcoin ASIC miners in North America that also operates mining facilities, said in a recent research report that the market crash in March, together with the coming halving, has led to a significant decrease of bitcoin’s mining computing power – which in the long run, could be an encouraging sign for the market’s efficiency.      “If bitcoin remains at lower price levels for two to four months, post-halving, many miners operating at a loss will be forced to shut off,” Blockware said. “After all the miners that are operating at a loss shut off, the miners that survive experience significant margin relief. We will witness a network in short-term chaos, but difficulty adjustments will reinstate stability once the inefficient miners shut off.”      See also: Binance Crypto Exchange Is Launching Its First Bitcoin Mining Pool       The firm believes after the Bitcoin network experiences sustained favorable competition adjustments, the “likelihood of a bottom in bitcoin’s price is enhanced.""      “This is because newly mined bitcoin is now being distributed to and accumulated by the most efficient miners with healthy balance sheets,” the firm said. “The amount of bitcoin ... that the surviving miners receive are directly proportional with the amount of bitcoin that was being distributed to the miners that have shut off. These rare, lucrative opportunities allow surviving miners to accumulate copious amounts of bitcoin.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/03/manufacturers-mark-down-bitcoin-miners-as-price-drop-halving-change-calculus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd5181b9dc7c4b4c9405606ab4dffc6631b99492-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
