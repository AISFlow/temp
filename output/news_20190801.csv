42430819,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxRh,1564694103,R3 Doubles London Office Space for Blockchain Hiring Spree,"Enterprise blockchain firm R3 is adding a second floor to its London office to accommodate a hiring spree.  It's a move that comes amidst a momentous period in the U.K., when the country appears on the verge of completing its long-in-the-making exit from the European Union. R3's efforts to add 50 staff members to its 80-strong London office, which serves as its main engineering hub, is a demonstration of its commitment to the U.K. months ahead of its potentially messy EU departure.  In addition, R3 is opening a second engineering hub, which will be located in either the San Francisco Bay Area – staking a claim in Silicon Valley – or in another large European city. The firm said likely alternatives to San Francisco include Dublin, Berlin and Amsterdam.  The new hub will comprise a team of some 10 to 15 engineers, which is expected to be in place sometime in January 2020, according to R3.  Re-affirming R3’s commitment to London, David Rutter, CEO of R3 said there was an “enormous opportunity for London” after the October 31st Brexit date that the newly-minted Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pursuing.  “While there clearly remain some uncertainties, we believe the city is well placed and established to thrive in the coming years,"" said Rutter in a statement. “That’s why we are confident in making this substantial long-term commitment now,”  R3 is taking the new floor directly under the one it currently occupies in its London office. The extra space will see the company’s global headcount from its current level of 215 to nearly 300 by the end of the year, according to Charley Cooper, managing director, R3.  Cooper told CoinDesk:  “We are doubling our office space in London with a second floor that opened several weeks ago, to accommodate the significant amount of hiring we need to grow the engineering team.”  Growing engineering footprint  Regarding the opening of the second hub, Cooper pointed out this was definitely not a secondary engineering center in terms of being low cost or compromising on quality in any way; the hiring standards outside of London would be the same as in London, he said.  “Outside of San Francisco, the European city we haven't nailed yet,” added Cooper, “I can just tell you that some of the cities that are being seriously considered are Dublin, Berlin, and Amsterdam. There are others like Cologne and Manchester we are looking at.”  There were rumors back in the early part of 2018 that R3 was running out of money. Those fears have clearly been allayed. Also shrouded in secrecy (thanks to some strenuously enforced NDAs) was the firm’s settlement with Ripple over a sizable trove of XRP cryptocurrency, which may have come R3’s way.  Cooper told CoinDesk the company’s policy is not to discuss its finances but added:  “I can tell you even with these aggressive expansion plans, we have no need or plans to go to the market for additional fundraising.”  R3 office image courtesy of the company",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | XRP,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/01/r3-doubles-london-office-space-for-blockchain-hiring-spree,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54a781d51b8e56c67b19e0f7a871715f248bd06e-1512x1210.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Alternative internet browser Brave has officially launched tipping following a beta phase, according to a company blog post. Tweeters can tip content using Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT).  Created by the co-founder of both Mozilla and Firefox, Brendan Eich, Brave began as a dedicated ad-blocking browser. In May 2017, the company conducted an initial coin offering of 1 billion BAT with a further 500 million BAT held by the firm, according to Messari Crypto.  The firm’s intention was to create a more equitable profit distribution model between users, content creators and advertisers. With the addition, Brave steps further into the realm of micro-tipping, a service envisioned in its white paper.  To inaugurate the launch, Brave is sending 100,000 BAT grants to every Brave desktop user who cannot receive Brave Ads. Brave claims Reddit, Vimeo and GitHub are next on the list. Brave also currently supports tips for YouTube and Twitch. A Brave tips icon will be placed next to the familiar ""retweet"" and ""favorite"" feature on Twitter.  Brave has also automated the tips, meaning tips can be set for your favorite content creators in timed installments. Users must use the Brave browser and have Brave Rewards turned on to use the feature.  Micro-tipping continues to grow within crypto communities, particularly with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. Independent project and plugin Tippin.me launched a similar bitcoin-based service last winter, receiving praise from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. In April, the Internet Archive self-reported $2,500 in donations from BAT tips.

42430817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxNh,1564691229,Square's Q2 Bitcoin Revenue Nearly Doubles From Previous Record,"Payments company Square reported its second-quarter earnings Thursday, revealing $125 million in bitcoin sales through its Cash App, nearly doubling a record first quarter.  ""During the quarter, bitcoin revenue benefited from increased volume as a result of the increase in the price of bitcoin, and generated $2 million of gross profit,"" the earnings report explains.  Founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, Square reported that bitcoin represented very nearly half of the total revenue on its Cash App, at $260 million, for the second quarter of 2019. Bitcoin costs, however, are listed at $122.9 million in the unaudited quarterly report, yielding the aforementioned $2 million in profit.  On an investor call Thursday afternoon announcing the numbers, Dorsey said:  ""We love you, bitcoin.""  The first quarter of 2019 was Square's best quarter for bitcoin at the time, with $65.5 million in revenue and $832,000 in profit. Clocking $125 million in sales in the second quarter, however, represents significant growth and a new record for the company. For comparison, the company reported $166 million in bitcoin sales in all of 2018.  With a net loss for the quarter of $6.7 million on $1.17 billion in total revenue, bitcoin remains a long way away from the center of Square's overall strategy. Transaction-based revenue in Q2 topped $775 million, according to the report.  The company sells bitcoin to users through its Cash App, a service that expanded to all 50 U.S. states in August 2018.  Earlier this week, the company clarified the role of Square Crypto, a project within the company created to make open-source contributions to the bitcoin protocol and ecosystem.  A senior research director at market intelligence firm CB Insights told CoinDesk he believes adding bitcoin is helping Square drive more usage from its customers.  ""They don't really make a lot of money on it, but it is driving engagement,"" Chris Brendler said.

42430808,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxBh,1564690206,NYAG Pushes Back on Bitfinex's Claim That State's Investigation Is Burdensome,"Quit whining, Bitfinex.  That's the message of the latest court filing by the New York Attorney General's office (NYAG) in its ongoing case against the cryptocurrency exchange and affiliated stablecoin issuer Tether.  Earlier this week, Bitfinex and Tether's lawyers complained to New York State Supreme Court Judge Joel M. Cohen that the companies had spent $500,000 and tasked 60 lawyers simply with finding documents that the NYAG's office has asked for. Part of the expense comes from the fact that the respondents use 10 different communications systems, they wrote.  But in a letter to the judge Thursday, the NYAG's attorneys scoffed at the suggestion that its demands were somehow onerous.  ""Whatever difficulty Respondents may claim in collecting and reviewing the communications called for in the 354 Order, the Court should take note that the 354 Order also calls for information that any responsible trading platform or venue of exchange should have at its fingertips,"" wrote the lawyers, John Castiglione, Johanna Skrzypczyk and Brian Whitehurst.  The information the NYAG's office is looking for includes tether issuance and redemptions, its current corporate, trading and client accounts, tax filings, and information about any customers who wanted to withdraw cash from Bitfinex.  The letter added:  ""The 354 Order also directs production of documentation of the so-called 'line of credit' transaction, all of which was ostensibly generated while Respondents were under subpoena by the OAG, and therefore should be preserved and in reasonable order. There is nothing difficult, or costly, about producing that information.""  Let's get on with it  Given the expected ease of producing the documents, Thursday's filing asked Judge Cohen to dismiss a stay of proceedings requested by Bitfinex and Tether. The NYAG lawyers argued that the companies would have to turn over documents even if an order filed under section 354 of the Martin Acthttps://www.clm.com/docs/2-28-03mctamaney.lb.pdf was permanently stayed by the court.  The NYAG is investigating a concern that Bitfinex covered up the loss of $850 million held by a payments processor by borrowing funds from Tether's stablecoin reserves. The latter company extended a $900 million line of credit to Bitfinex, which borrowed $700 million before an injunction froze further transfers.  The New York investigators are looking for more information about the deal, and are awaiting a ruling by Judge Cohen after a hearing on Monday.  A ruling in Bitfinex and Tether's favor would not help the companies, as they would still be required to turn over documents, they wrote.  ""Because the stay they seek would not necessarily forestall the harm Respondents claim, their claim that they need an injunction to prevent that harm falls short,"" the attorneys wrote.  Jurisdictional questions  The attorneys also addressed the key question from Monday's hearing: whether the NYAG's office has jurisdiction to conduct its investigation.  Cohen has the authority to decide personal jurisdiction, according to the letter.  ""Those questions are well within the competence of this Court, and the First Department,"" they wrote. The attorneys also noted that New York residents might have ""a public interest"" in the matter, writing:  ""To the extent there is a public interest to be vindicated at this stage, it is that the people of the State of New York have an interest in the timely disclosure of materials sought in lawfully-issued subpoenas.""

42430809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxx9h,1564679423,What Happened: Why the First Physical Bitcoin Futures Haven't Launched,"UPDATE (August 1, 2019, 19:30 UTC): LedgerX press representative Ryan Gorman told CoinDesk he will no longer be representing the company as of Thursday over 'concerns' about the events of the last 24 hours.  UPDATE (August 1, 2019, 16:10 UTC): In a series of tweets Thursday afternoon, LedgerX CEO Paul Chou said the CFTC asked the company to censor its tweets. He threatened to sue the regulatory agency for ""anti competitive behavior, breach of duty, [and] going against the [regulations],"" noting the 180-day requirement described below.      LedgerX admitted Thursday it has not launched bitcoin futures, as the firm had previously claimed, after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said it had not approved the exchange to do so.  The company previously told CoinDesk it was planning to launch the product on Wednesday. LedgerX would have been the first venue in the U.S. to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures, which are contracts that pay out in the underlying cryptocurrency rather than in cash.  ""Not only are they delivered physically in the sense that our customers can get bitcoin after the futures expires, but also they can deposit bitcoin to trade in the first place,"" LedgerX CEO Paul Chou told CoinDesk on Monday.  But on Thursday morning, the day after CoinDesk's initial story ran, CFTC chief communications officer Michael Short said in an emailed statement: ""LedgerX has not yet been approved by the Commission.""  Indeed, a look at LedgerX's data page shows only options and swaps trades that took place on Wednesday, but no futures.  When contacted subsequently by CoinDesk, LedgerX chief operating and risk officer Juthica Chou acknowledged that the company was not trading futures contracts.  She insisted that the prior conversation with her and Paul Chou about a Wednesday launch pertained only to LedgerX's retail platform, Omni, which she said is actively serving swaps and options products to traders at present.  ""We're still operating, we're putting the product in front of retail,"" she said.  Approval still needed  The CFTC last month approved LedgerX as a designated contract market (DCM), which was one of two approvals the company needed to proceed with the futures launch. The other is an amendment to its derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license.  It is currently authorized to clear swaps, but not yet futures.  In the CFTC's own press release dated June 25 announcing the DCM approval, the regulator noted:  ""LedgerX has requested that the CFTC amend its order of registration as a DCO, which limits LedgerX to clearing swaps, to allow it to clear futures listed on its DCM.""  According to CFTC regulations (Title 17 part 39.3), the agency has 180 days to approve or deny a DCO application.  ""[The CFTC] said to clear swaps and they said later that [we] should actually clear futures too and ... we were waiting essentially for this amendment,"" Paul Chou told CoinDesk Thursday.  Juthica Chou appeared to suggest that because this period had passed without an objection from CFTC, the company was under the impression that it was clear to proceed.  ""We submitted the amendment on Nov. 8, 2018, it's been more than 180 days, we don't know why that's the case [that it has not been approved],"" Chou said, later adding:  ""We filed on Nov. 8 and we have email correspondences confirming there were no additional items that they needed for the amendment.""  However, LedgerX needs explicit approval, according to a senior CFTC official.  ""Every new or amended DCO application needs to be affirmatively approved by the Commission,"" said this official, who did not want to be identified. ""The absence of a decision does not constitute approval, and entity self-certification is not an option.""  Final stages?  The regulation does state that ""the Commission may stay the running of the 180-day review period if an application is materially incomplete, in accordance with section 6(a) of the Act,"" but there is no indication whether the CFTC took this action.  That said, LedgerX's DCO application ""appears to be in the very final stages of the approval process,"" the senior official said.  Paul Chou told CoinDesk that there is little difference between swaps and futures products.  ""Basically, it's just a total technicality that a swap and a future are different things and ... it's like, it's actually a little different,"" he said. ""The difference between futures and swaps is ridiculous, it's the same product.""  Marc Hochstein contributed reporting.

42430828,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxdh,1564671642,"Crypto Exchange Launches 'Shitcoin Futures Index,' Offering New Way to Short Alts","Crypto derivatives platform FTX has perhaps the most speculative and oddly-named futures index fund on the market: SHIT-PERP, or the Shitcoin Index Perpetual Futures.  An index of 58 low market cap coins, SHIT-PERP includes projects like Waves, Grin, and Nano. It is flanked by two other low-cap indexes on the site, MID-PERP and ALT-PERP.  Image via FTX.com  Following an incubation program under Alameda Research, the derivatives platform opened this past spring. FTX runs an over-the-counter desk, futures, indexes, and now spot trading. Based out of the Antigua and Barbuda, the platform is slowly adding spot and margin trading.  FTX's connection to Alameda Research gives it deep liquidity, per FTX statements. Founded in October 2017, Alameda manages over $100 million in digital assets, trading between $600 million and $1.5 billion per day. The quantitative trading firm operates the second-best performing account on BitMEX and helped onboard staff from Jane Street, Optiver, Susquehanna, Facebook, and Google to FTX, according to FTX.  Regardless of the index's name, FTX stands by its product which it launched in June. Speaking to CoinDesk, FTX Chief Marking Officer Darren Wong said the index allows traders and investors to interact with coins in an innovative way. Wong listed three examples:  If you want exposure to a particular initial coin offering, but not the general industry, you can short SHIT-PERP. By shorting the greater alt market, you hedge your bets and limit your downside.  If you want to short low market cap altcoins in general, you can use SHIT-PERP. The indexed future is one of few ways to short low cap alt markets.  If you think bitcoin’s dominance is too high, you can buy all three of FTX’s altcoin futures indexes and sell BTC-PERP, the platforms Bitcoin futures index.  Surprisingly, Wong says the exchange trades a roughly on par with its other futures index, ALT-PERP, at roughly a few million dollars turnover. At the time of writing, the index was down 2.62%.

42430823,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxZh,1564665309,ICE CEO: Bakkt Will Launch Bitcoin Futures In 'Very Near Future',"Bitcoin futures platform Bakkt is gearing up to launch soon, the head of its parent firm said Thursday, although he did not set a firm timeline.  Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) CEO Jeffrey Sprecher, speaking during a quarterly earnings call, said Bakkt is ""working to develop a regulated ecosystem that services the evolving needs of [participants] around the world,"" adding:  ""Subject to final regulatory approvals, we plan to launch our physically settled bitcoin futures in the very near future.""  Sprecher did not provide a specific timeline.  ICE first announced Bakkt in August, unveiling an ambitious plan to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts and additional work with Microsoft, Starbucks and BCG Consulting.  While the company initially planned to launch the platform in December 2018, Bakkt was delayed a number of times, and does not currently have a firm launch date.  Bakkt initially intended to have the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees derivative products in the U.S., approve its futures contracts, but ultimately self-certified.  The company is now waiting on a trust charter from the New York Department of Financial Services. Once NYDFS approves Bakkt's warehouse, the company will be able to launch its new product.  The company is facing competition, however: TD Ameritrade-backed ErisX is also planning to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts, and LedgerX announced Wednesday that it had already gone live with a product.  Bakkt aside, ICE generated $1.3 billion in revenue across the second quarter, according to a release.  ICE chief financial officer Scott Hill said ICE intends to launch its ETF Hub, a single portal for traders to take part in the exchange-traded fund market, in the coming months. The company believes the ETF market might double in the next few years.

42430829,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxhh,1564664560,Zooko Wilcox Pushes for New Developer Fund to Support Zcash,"Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Electric Coin Company (ECC) – the firm behind the privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash – has made an appeal for the creation of a new ""Dev Fund"" to support the future operations of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency.  The move comes after much debate over the continuation of the project's controversial ""founders' reward,"" which took centerstage at Zcon1 and even drove a portion of the zcash community to fork off into a new network, Ycash.  In a lengthy open letter on Medium Wednesday, Wilcox said:  ""I hope that the community will decide to renew the 'Dev Fund' structure, allocating coins from future block rewards for core support functions such as software development, user support, business development, regulatory and government outreach, security auditing and monitoring, educational and marketing initiatives, new protocol development, and so forth.""  He further aired the hope that the zcash community would seek to ""hire"" the ECC to carry out those tasks.  Having never taken the ICO path of fundraising (selling tokens to raise ""a bunch of money from the public on the promise of delivering future results,"" as Wilcox put it), zcash was originally bootstrapped by a group of investors to the tune of $3 million.  The project was also set up so that over the first four years, 10 percent of the total 21 million token supply of zcash (ZEC) would go to the founders (the founders' reward) and the remainder to the miners on the network. The investors were also assigned a ""small slice"" of ECC's equity, Wilcox said.  The original Dev Fund, according to the post, arose when Wilcox and ECC co-founder and CTO Nathan Wilcox got ECC to buy back some of the founders rewards to be used for funding ongoing operations. Wilcox and other founders also set aside some of their rewards to set up the Zcash Foundation.  ""We decided to do this because we thought that having an independent entity from the Electric Coin Company would be an important part of the Zcash community’s decentralization and stability in the long run,"" Wilcox wrote.  Now, with zcash set (programmed, in fact) to end the founders' reward in October 2020, a new means of funding development is required, according to the ECC CEO.  Wilcox said: ""I opted for the initial Dev Fund to sunset itself, so that in the future, if Zcash were a success and a community were to grow up to support it, that community would have to collectively decide what to do next.""  The options ahead, he said, include allocating all new ZEC issued to the network's miners, creating a new Dev Fund with a percentage of new coins issued, or ""other alternatives.""  Wilcox is pushing hard for a Dev Fund to funded from a slice of the issuance, however:  ""This decision isn’t about the Electric Coin Company. If all of the employees of the Electric Coin Company were to board the same airplane tomorrow to go to an off-site meeting, and that plane were to crash with no survivors, the Zcash community would still be facing the exact same choice: shall we use some of the tens of millions of dollars that we’re spending on issuance every month to fund core support functions like protocol development, software support, security auditing, government outreach, educational initiatives, and business development, or shall we instead send 100% of that money to miners?""  Finally, Wilcox called for community members to make their voices heard, either on public forums or by emailing zcash.  The Zcash Foundation is expected to publish a procedure for making a community decision ""soon,"" according to Wilcox, while ECC will publish a blog post setting out how it will assess proposals in the next few days.

So far, BlueWallet users have completed more than 100,000 lightning transactions.  “The things we are working on now are to prepare the wallet for the next bull run,” Coelho said. “To allow users to have more control over the fees when the market will be with higher fees.”  After a year of operations, Bluewallet is currently raising its first round of venture capital. It is hardly alone. Competition across the marketplace is ramping up with a crop of new wallets seeking funding to support lightning development, sources told CoinDesk.  In June, the Lightning Labs wallet launched and attracted 2,000 downloads within the first 24 hours. That same month, the bitcoin wallet provider Samourai Wallet announced a partnership with the French lightning node-maker Nodl to make the mobile wallet lightning-compatible.  At the same time, Zap wallet creator Jack Mallers told CoinDesk that 500 Android users downloaded Zap since early June. This summer could be described as a lightning boom for product development.  Plus, Mallers added, Zap now has more than 25,000 desktop downloads and 1,000 active TestFlight users on iOS.  “Not only are they downloading it, but the applications are actually checking assets because they’re using it and the wallets are open,” Mallers said. “On average, we get thousands of asset downloads a day. That means we have thousands of active users.”  According to Google’s analytics, Mallers said, only 33 percent of those users are located in the United States. While Bluewallet has far more American users, Coelho said his company’s wallet also appears to be gaining traction in Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan, based on App Store data and the times that users interact with the product.  Across the board, all of these apps share a common trait: They lack a clear business model.  However, for some, that process might be seen as a feature, not a bug.  Slow growth  “It’s not our main priority to focus on a business model at the moment,” Coelho said. “It’s our priority to … put product out there and talk to users.”  Like Coelho, Mallers said he is not in a rush to profit from this wallet because playing the long game means focusing on users for now. Lightning Labs developers told CoinDesk the startup will offer premium services for wallet users in the future, but collecting fees from users isn’t a priority for their team either.  “It wasn’t very clear how a lightning wallet would make money. A lightning wallet’s point is to help with scaling,” Mallers said.  Most mainstream wallets like Jaxx and Bread earn revenue by taking a percentage of transaction fees. They also rely on other revenue models like fundraising tokens (Bread) or integration partnerships (Jaxx). Meanwhile, open-source wallets like Bluewallet and Zap de-prioritize the business model as they seek to stabilize the product with the help of volunteer contributors.  “You cannot accelerate the development of bitcoin,” Coelho said. “We see this as a long-term project, from 5–10 years.”  So far, most of these wallet apps rely on an autopilot setting rather than making users manage channels and independent nodes. Coelho said those options for experts will come with time, considering that the LND beta version many such wallets are experimenting with is just one year old.  As such, Coelho concluded:  “Our goal was just to show this is what lightning could be in the future.”  Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | WALLET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/08/01/bitcoin-lightning-wallets-are-gaining-traction-in-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5aff2be9c796f2a3a76e1b1bba56e49c5c97a133-1916x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxv3h,1564658601,Bitcoin Price on the Rise After First Fed Rate Cut Since 2008,"View  Bitcoin could rise to $10,500 in the next 24 hours or so, as the 4-hour chart is looking more bullish.  A break above $11,120 is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook, though.  Some expert believe the just-announced U.S. Fed interest rate cut could bode well for BTC in the long-run.      Bitcoin (BTC) has eked out moderate gains amid the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement of its first rate cut in over a decade.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,950 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) on Wednesday said it will lower interest rates by 0.25 percent to cushion the economy from a global slowdown and trade tensions. That was the first U.S. interest rate cut since the great financial crisis of 2008, and indeed since the creation of bitcoin in 2009.  BTC rose by over $200 to $10,000 in the three hours leading up to the Fed’s announcement at 18:00 UTC. More importantly, the cryptocurrency remained bid in the following hours and hit a high of $10,172, according to Bitstamp data.  The price action seems to have convinced investors that BTC picked up a bid due to Fed’s rate cut.  Boon for bitcoin?  Some observers believe rate cuts by the Fed bode well for BTC.  This is because an interest rate cut reduces the yield on a currency. Further, the liquidity added to the economy via rate cuts often leads to inflation and loss of purchasing power of the currency.  Put simply, falling interest rates mean fewer reasons to hold U.S. dollars, as pointed out by Alan Silbert, executive managing director at INX Trading Platform.  Silbert believes the Fed will deliver more rate cuts in the near future. The central bank, however, refrained from signaled further easing yesterday.  The Fed has cut rates less than 12 months away from bitcoin’s mining reward halving – a process aimed at curbing inflation by reducing reward for mining on the blockchain by 50 percent every four years.  Essentially, BTC’s monetary policy is on a preset path – its supply is halved every four years.  The monetary policy divergence would widen further if the Fed embarks on a full-blown easing cycle, as anticipated by Silbert. That would further strengthen bitcoin’s appeal as store of value and may bolster the bull market.  As for the next 24 hours, bitcoin looks set to test key average located at $10,500.  4-hour chart  BTC rose above $10,000 yesterday, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by the long-tailed doji created on the 4-hour chart on July 28.  That bullish doji reversal indicates that the sell-off from recent highs above $13,000 has ended and the path of least resistance is to the higher side. The descending triangle breakout confirmed yesterday also indicates a bull reversal.  Notably, buying volumes picked up following the price breakout. The green volume bar created in the four hours to 16:00 UTC yesterday was the highest since July 19.  Hence, the cryptocurrency may rise toward $10,500 (50-day moving average) over the next day or two. However, the outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish only if and when BTC invalidates the bearish lower-highs pattern with a move above $11,120.  The case for a rise to the 50-day MA in the next 24 hours would weaken if prices find acceptance below yesterday’s low of $9,574, although that looks unlikely.

According to a piece from Forbes, following on from a proof-of-concept that kicked off in 2018 in partnership with IBM, Seagate is moving a blockchain-based product tracking trial to the pilot stage to asses how scalable a possible live platform could be.  Manuel Offenberg, Seagate's research group managing technologist of data security, told Forbes that, while the pilot is not yet launched, the firm has already given approval.  The hard-drive tracking blockchain project monitors products sent via several steps to the customer, which for the trial is also IBM as a major consumer of Seagate products. Any product returns are also tracked back to Seagate. In a real-world offering, this would help ensure that counterfeit drives are not sent back in place of the genuine article.  Another potential use case for the platform, especially in Europe under the 2016 General Data Protection Regulation, would be to verify that any drives returned for defects or other reasons have undergone a possible ""certified erase"" process to remove any user data.  ""When a drive ... comes back as part of its returns process, if we can prove that the drive was cryptographically erased, and therefore, the information is no longer on the device, then, from a risk perspective, this reverse supply chain can treat that device differently,"" said Offenberg.  Monty Forehand, Seagate product security officer, said in the report that, while the firm's products already have a QR code-based brand protection tag, it doesn't utilize blockchain.

Dedicated to helping adult content providers maintain a reliable payments provider in the face of a largely reluctant traditional finance industry, the new SpankPay service allows users to pay with cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC), as well as the ""privacy coins"" zcash (ZEC) and monero (XMR).  “With SpankPay, we are bringing immediate value to adult merchants by helping them accept crypto, avoid chargebacks, and reach a global audience,” said Ameen Soleimani, CEO of SpankChain.  The service is said to offer ""instant"" transactions made with a single click. SpankPay charges a fee of 0.5 percent per transaction, which compares favorably with the charges for credit card use of up to 3 percent in the non-porn world. Soleimani said that card companies will charge adult sites up to 10 percent, however.  In recent years, many adult services have had problems receiving payments via credit cards, banks and payment services, with accounts being denied or closed.  SpankPay launches with two partners that have already integrated the solution: Skype-based webcam service SkyPrivate and fan-focused adult platform JustFor.Fans.  Dominic Ford, creator of JustFor.Fans, said:  “We are excited to offer cryptocurrency payment options to our subscribers. Using SpankChain, we don’t have to worry about being shut down due to the fact we are an adult company. We’d much rather support our fellow adult solution providers than use outside solutions that are potentially not adult-friendly.”  SpankChain already offers a webcam site, Spank.live, that aims to better serve the models that provide the content, and provides credit card payments via Segpay. SpankPay is planned for integration with Spank.live soon, according to the announcement.

42430790,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxulh,1564646447,'Building' Bitcoin's Software Just Got a Bit More Trustless,"Like it or not, there's a bit of trust involved in the process of setting up, or ""compiling,"" the software at the heart of bitcoin – but a recent code change could help.  Featuring container software Guix, code was recently merged into the most popular bitcoin implementation, Bitcoin Core, meaning it's now ready for real users to try out. The change could help to limit trust in code downloaded from operating system Ubuntu during the building process.  ""It's been quite a journey, but #Guix support for deterministic, bootstrappable Bitcoin Core builds has landed in master,"" the main developer behind the project, Carl Dong, tweeted last month.  For this building process, there are already some protections built in. When downloading Bitcoin Core from Bitcoin.org, many developers use a process called Gitian to make so-called ""reproducible"" builds, which allows developers to double check that the binaries being distributed to them are the correct version that they want to be downloading – not a replica with a secret backdoor built into the software, say, to steal bitcoins.  But Dong claims that's not enough in terms of security of the building process, as he detailed in a presentation on the topic at the conference Breaking Bitcoin in Amsterdam.  Through this Gitian process, the code is turned into something a computer would understand. Through that, users might not notice they are downloading code from the operating system Ubuntu, and effectively trusting them.  Dong told CoinDesk:  ""Currently, Ubuntu (or whoever gains access to Ubuntu's signing keys) influences both the availability and security of Bitcoin Core's release binaries. In the long term, placing trust in un-auditable, opaque binary downloads from third parties like Ubuntu seems like a recipe for disaster.""  Disillusioned no more  Because of this, when going through the whole ""reproducible builds"" shebang a few years ago, Dong told CoinDesk he became ""disillusioned"" with bitcoin's build process.  He found that he wasn't the only one, and once he joined Chaincode Labs, a hub for bitcoin protocol development in New York City, the project took flight, getting help from Bitcoin Core contributors Russ Yanofsky and Cory Fields, among other active contributors to the Bitcoin Core software.  He decided ultimately that the solution was to minimize the trust in these binaries as much as possible. And to make it easier to track where exactly these binaries are coming from.  ""When we use Guix to build our toolchain we can audit how each tool in our toolchain was built and easily bootstrap them from a minimal set of trusted binaries,"" Dong said in his Breaking Bitcoin talk.  That's not to say it eradicates trust completely, Dong said, ""unfortunately it is a somewhat infeasible task to remove trusted third parties from the build process completely,"" but, he argued, it sure helps.  ""What we do achieve is much better auditability of our third-party provided toolchain. This project's use of Guix allows us to have unprecedented visibility into what our set of trusted binaries is, and how we derive Bitcoin Core's build environment from it,"" he went on.  What's next  For now, this change is available to users of the Linux operating system. Dong and others are in the process of making the change work for Windows and Mac users as well.  ""This was a big first step, and should be a good alternative to Gitian building. Lots of Guix related improvements already in the pipeline. I’m optimistic it’ll play a role in the 0.19.0 release,"" tweeted Bitcoin Core contributor Michael Ford who was recently named a maintainer of the software.  Not to mention, Dong has plans to make these builds reproducible across time.  ""If this works, it means that future Bitcoin Core developers will be able to build previous Bitcoin Core versions and produce binaries that are bit-for-bit identical to when they were released. This reproducibility-across-time allows us to recreate the exact behavior of previous versions, which is valuable for testing and debugging purposes,"" he said.  And, although it's a rather technical change that might sound arcane, developers are praising Dong for his work in making bitcoin more secure.  ""Innovation like this is often invisible to the consumer and investment communities, but is unquestionably the reason why bitcoin is so far ahead,"" tweeted Sia co-founder and lead developer David Vorick.

42430810,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxv9h,1564625136,Investors Can Now Trade Ether and British Pounds on the Same Blockchain,"A team of former Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) engineers is bringing trading and settlement of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, to a private blockchain network originally developed for enterprise.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, London-based LAB577, led by ex-RBS innovation lead Richard Crook, is rolling out its first platform offering, the Digital Asset Shared Ledger (DASL, pronounced “dazzle”). DASL is built on top of the Corda Network, the open-source blockchain system created by R3, a bank consortium that once personified the “blockchain, not bitcoin” ethos of 2015-2016.  As such, it’s a sign of how much the industry has evolved that DASL will be used to facilitate the trading of bitcoin, ether, and the like.  Crook told CoinDesk:  “Crypto is clearly converging with blockchain. We spent quite a lot of time in 2015 separating the two, to make sure we could have a conversation about blockchain, and now here we are converging the two back.”  LAB577 is working with prime brokerage BCB, which will park its clients’ assets, both fiat and crypto, with custodians; mirrored representations of these assets will trade on Corda, in a process known in blockchain parlance as layer 2 settlement.  (A similar arrangement is in the works to bring ethereum tokens onto the architecture R3 is building for Swiss stock exchange SIX.)  In this way, investors will be able to conduct both legs of a trade, whether fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-crypto, on the same system, and have them settle instantly and simultaneously, instead of waiting days for a bank transfer, or minutes (sometimes hours) for a public blockchain confirmation.  Institution-friendly  BCB says it has a pipeline of clients to bring to Corda via DASL including a couple of big banks.  Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, BCB’s founder and CEO, said his firm is already live with a couple of beta clients, settling ethereum and British pounds bilaterally in a kind of closed environment.  “It is live in the sense that it's using the live Corda network and live Corda nodes, but not yet a released product out in the wild,” he told CoinDesk. (Crook said BCB will be migrating from its old tech stack over the coming months.)  Apart from speed, Crook said plugging a crypto prime brokerage into the Corda Network (the free, open-source version of R3’s tech) makes sense because you have to be a known legal entity to operate on that network.  In other words, banks and financial institutions can rest assured they are meeting things like anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance.  “DASL wants to assist those regulated financial institutions to be able to deal with digital assets,” said Crook. “It could be something they want to issue themselves like debt or equity. It could be cash. And some of them do want to handle crypto.”  Prime time  For prime brokerages, a core challenge of crypto is negotiating a host of network structures, wallets, proprietary blockchain protocols and so on. Similarly, on the fiat side, a unified settlement layer is lacking, said Landsberg-Sadie. The U.K. has a leg up with its Faster Payments system, he added, but firms still have to deal with a mishmash of payments systems in different jurisdictions.  Landsberg-Sadie pointed to certain operational challenges around storing and moving crypto safely, and also accounting for it in a unified way, adding:  “What we have always been on the lookout for is something which is a credible institutional bridge and a kind of settlements layer for cash and for crypto.”  To be fair, similar sorts of off-chain settlement arrangements have been created recently. These include tie-ups between custodians and trading firms (BitGo with Genesis Trading; Kingdom Trust and OTCXN) and networks built by crypto-friendly financial institutions for their clients to trade with each other (Silvergate Bank; Signature Bank; and Prime Trust).  In the DASL solution, BCB parks crypto in cold, or offline, storage with Volt, a crypto custodian which works with insurance broker Aon. The equivalent in the fiat world is physical bank accounts, which in the case of British pounds will be BCB’s banking partner, ClearBank, said Landsberg-Sadie.  Using Corda as a settlement layer also addresses the scaling problem which has dogged the cryptocurrency industry for years, added Landsberg-Sadie. Two counterparties exchanging a bunch of litecoin, for example, would be unaffected by the transaction time of the public blockchain to settle.  “You don't need to move the physical litecoin out of its cold storage, you can just represent these as ledger entries on Corda,” Landsberg-Sadie said.  Two-way street  Stepping back, settling the fiat side of trades on a blockchain instantly with cash on the ledger is an alluring proposition well beyond the crypto markets.  A lot of work is being done to bring digital fiat to distributed ledgers, with projects like Utility Settlement Coin drawing a lot of attention.  Crook, whose team started the work of building bridges between public and private blockchains while at RBS with projects like Cordite, said the likes of BCB and also SDX coming on Corda creates a rising tide which will also lift pure enterprise plays being built on the network.  “In the case of trade finance, you want to have stores of value on-chain which the Marco Polos and the TradeIXs of the world can use,” he said, referring to a Corda-based trade finance consortium. “So you can get the goods and services to flow one way across the ledger and the payment for those goods and services to flow the other way on the same ledger.”  Ether image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/01/investors-can-now-trade-ether-and-british-pounds-on-the-same-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51fb7b302194b51997c6fbd3599cfafc01f43697-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
