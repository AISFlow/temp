Meenavalli, on charges of fraud.      According to an SEC press release Friday, Meenavalli has agreed to pay $400,000 in both disgorgement and penalties related to a 2017 Regulation A+ offering the SEC deemed fraudulent. Longfin delisted from the Nasdaq in May 2018 and shut down the following November.

The SEC complaint against Longfin, which was later upheld by the Southern District Court of New York in an October 2019 indictment, centered around Longfin’s claim to be “managed and operated” in the United States and “sham” commodities transactions representing some 90 percent of the firm’s 2017 reported revenue.      “As alleged in our complaint, Meenavalli abused the Reg. A+ process to conduct a fraudulent offering, list Longfin on Nasdaq, and entice investors with falsified revenue,” SEC officer Anita B. Bandy said in Friday's release.      If approved by the overseeing court, Meenavalli will disgorge $159,000 – equivalent to his executive salary at Longfin – plus a civil penalty of $232,000 with interest, according to the release.

42383157,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uELF,1578087005,"Compared to Gaming and Gambling Dapps, DeFi Is Still Behind","Despite the ongoing hype surrounding the growth and popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications last year, gaming and gambling remain the most popular use cases for blockchain apps.      According to blockchain analytics site Dapp.com, there are approximately four times as many users for both gaming and gambling decentralized applications (dapps) than DeFi across seven different smart contract platforms as of Dec. 31.      The growth of DeFi applications was primarily concentrated this year on the ethereum blockchain.      According to Dapp.com, over 75 percent of DeFi applications are active on ethereum, while the second most popular smart contract platform for DeFi is EOS, with 11 percent of active DeFi apps.      Looking just at ethereum, the growth of DeFi over the year is more apparent. At several points throughout the year, DeFi apps beat out gaming and gambling apps in terms of number of users.      Beyond these three dapp categories, the number of users in the entire dapp ecosystem across 10 different smart contract platforms, including ethereum, has declined.      Data from blockchain analytics site DappRadar shows that the number of dapp users has shrunk 62 percent from a high of 110,000 in May to 41,000 at the beginning of December. Even the number of active dapps across these 10 blockchain platforms has decreased from 529 to 370.      In spite of the growth in popularity and discussion surrounding DeFi this year, the data suggests the dapp ecosystem is still struggling to gain traction.      According to DappRadar communications director Jon Jordan, the little activity that was generated this year by dapps was concentrated in a handful of projects.      “18 percent of the active dapps on ethereum accounted for 99 percent of [total dapp ecosystem] value. … A very small number of dapps accounts for the vast majority of dapp value on ethereum. In that context, the number of dapps running on a blockchain is irrelevant,” Jordan said in an email to CoinDesk.    Strong optimism    Taking a step back, it would seem the year’s downward trend follows a longer decline in new dapp adoption seen since late 2018, according to blockchain analytics site State of the Dapps.      Even so, many in the crypto industry still believe in the potential for blockchain technology to serve as the infrastructure for a new internet.      Muneeb Ali, CEO of blockchain startup Blockstack, is confident that the “Web 3” use case for blockchain will one day attract hundreds of millions of new users.      “We started focusing last year on getting real applications on our platform. The next challenge? Getting, say, a million users on these applications. No one has that yet in crypto,” Ali said in an interview with CoinDesk in November.      It’s an optimistic and ambitious goal shared by the CEO of Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), Charles Hoskinson, who is also building a general-purpose blockchain platform called Cardano specifically for new DeFi applications.      According to Hoskinson, the industry simply needs more time to develop the appropriate technology for dapp development and execution.      “I look at the five to ten-year horizon,"" Hoskinson said during an interview with CoinDesk in September."" No one has reached adoption or scale yet. It’s still very early days.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ADA | ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/03/compared-to-gaming-and-gambling-dapps-defi-is-still-behind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5abdf5f7a236ddc5efde3b04fef8b4b5d51c5dd-1736x1008.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Joanna De Alba of Tijuana, Mexico, has been arraigned in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, for the illegal sale and disbursement of narcotics, according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) press release Thursday.      “As alleged, De Alba dispensed heroin and methamphetamine from the shadowy corners of the internet, believing that it provided anonymity to her and her customers,” said DOJ Attorney Richard P. Donoghue. “A bright light has been shined on her activities, and she will now be held to account for her charged criminal acts.”      Under the pseudonym “RaptureReloaded,” De Alba allegedly sold narcotics on the dark web marketplace Wall Street Market from June 2018 to May 2019. Customers used encrypted email and bitcoin to purchase drugs from De Alba, who marketed various levels of anonymity for packages sent to the U.S. – such as “Basic Stealth,” “Better Stealth” and “Super Stealth 360,” according to the DOJ.      In a January 2019, an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent successfully purchased some 40 grams of narcotics from De Alba, receiving a package in Queens, New York, for around $2,000 in bitcoin.      The DEA also intercepted five international packages from the Netherlands and Canada containing narcotics addressed to De Alba’s deceased husband in Southern California. The DOJ alleges De Alba had employed her partner’s identify and credit cards to process transactions since his death in March 2018.      “Anonymity is what drug dealers rely on in the dark web, but this case proves it’s a false security,” said DEA Special Agent-in-Charge Ray Donovan. “Law enforcement is committed to tracking down drug traffickers’ distribution networks everywhere.”      If convicted of all counts, De Alba faces between five and 100 years in prison.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/03/us-citizen-accepting-bitcoin-for-narcotics-indicted-by-doj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dacb9cfdf47a4211951c4bd9d90b4534606e1f1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uE8f,1578079800,"Even If Blockchain Can't Secure Land Rights, It Got Us Talking About Them","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Anand Aanchal is a land specialist and blockchain expert at the World Bank.      Last spring, Anand Aanchal of the World Bank spoke to the teething problems of blockchain.      “Tech can look big and flashy, and like it can solve all our problems ... but the Big Mac burger never matches up to the one in the ad,” she said at a World Bank conference in Washington, D.C.      As a specialist with the Global Land and Geospatial Unit, Anand has direct experience with the issues of deploying tech to bolster citizens’ basic rights.      While the crypto industry is captivated by “banking the unbanked,” there are several ways to ameliorate the financial and social conditions of the world’s most vulnerable populations. For one, clarifying private or shared ownership of property. Properly established and enforced codes of land rights affects everything from a nation’s GDP to the types of crops farmers are willing to grow, Anand said.      Though blockchain is touted as a natural fit for bureaucratic registries, Anand has found that low-tech solutions – like a GPS-enabled smartphone – often provide results with more efficiency. Ultimately, any technological solution that's effective will need to be accompanied by legal and social reforms, she argues.      CoinDesk caught up with Anand to see how her thinking has developed regarding blockchain's potential for improving property rights.      What are land rights and why do they matter?      Land rights are rights to land and property. The reason why the security of these rights matter is they drive several things in the economy, from socioeconomic issues like conflict or post-conflict negotiations to the types of investments people are willing to make. Land administration is the clarification of land rights, meaning what is the physical parcel, property or the plot, what are its geographical coordinates, and who has legal ownership or other rights to that plot/building/house, what have you.      What are the pressing issues in land rights now?      In some countries, by some estimates close to 70 percent of land rights are not registered, due to legal or institutional barriers, specific social issues like women or minority property rights, and often also the reliability or affordability of land administration services. Further, in many countries, women and minorities have legal access to land rights, but socially the system doesn’t always allow them to exercise those rights. So you see discrimination.    Where registration rates are low, blockchain may be a solution, but it won’t be the solution you need most.    You’ve said in the past that blockchain is overhyped as a solution for land rights issues, how come?      There are certain enabling environmental conditions that are required for blockchain to make strategic, financial and commercial sense. Blockchain is suited for countries that already have digitized data that is up to date, with a functioning records system. If you go into a country where the culture of an informal economy is high, and registration rates are low, blockchain may be a solution, but it won’t be the solution you need most.      There are so many basic investments needed before it could have value for citizens. It’s quite important to think of tech in terms of what problems it’s solving. Often you find when you look at land administration problems, you find low tech (like smartphones with GPS or drones) being more capable of solving problems in a faster and cheaper way, which may pave the way for higher tech like blockchain.      Are there economic costs that may prevent the efficient use of blockchain tech?      A lot of low- and middle-income countries have already spent, or are spending a lot of money, modernizing their IT systems, specifically for land information systems. You cannot disregard these investments just because of the changes in tech. Now that there’s buzz about quantum computing, will everyone throw away blockchain and go quantum? It’s not advisable to throw away systems and simply take the newest toy on the market, so to speak.      It’s quite important to look at why one is interested in blockchain, what additional value it adds, and then consider if an entirely new system is needed. Sometimes specific features of blockchain can be used without a complete upgrade. For example, the City of Dubai has applied a blockchain transaction layer to take care of incoming transactions and start building an archive. That is a much softer, smarter and cost-effective way of testing a new tech, seeing if it helps and then scaling it up.      How does the World Bank advise blockchain implementation for land registration?      It’s an emerging technology and we rely on proofs-of-value to test viability. Together with the Technology & Innovation Lab of the World Bank Group, our team looked at three generic use cases – including first parcel registration, transfers of ownership and authentications – that we expect most countries will need at some point if they consider blockchain. But it’s only an isolated, lab condition proof of concept. At this stage, we stress the off-chain legal and regulatory issues to see if the tech is truly the best fit. Technology without strategy won’t solve the problem. We have also done proof of values in other areas, including climate, finance, health, and education.      What are the lingering issues with current land registry systems?      Cybersecurity is an issue that comes up that will only grow as countries digitize more and more. In some countries, there are reports of record tampering, so I think blockchain can be an attractive solution in that case. Though context truly matters in land administration. Blockchain cannot prevent rent-seeking in the system, which is why the broader political economy is important to consider.      If a country doesn’t recognize an individual’s right to own land, will having a legal document that proves ownership change the overarching culture?      That raises a good point. I always caution to say that technology will be a solution rather than one tool or part of a solution. Technology has to be at the service of public policy, not the other way around. Blockchain is one example of that. Simply having a piece of paper that says they have rights to a piece of land doesn’t necessarily make it secure or guarantee their rights. Which is why I believe tech has its place in making these rights more transparent, but at the end, it’s not a tech problem. It’s a wider issue, and tech should not be mistaken to fix solution.    Blockchain was the ice-cream flavor that got people excited to eat their broccoli.    How is blockchain like ice-cream?      There was a point years back when a lot of countries wanted to be blockchain ready by 2020. I thought it was an ambitious goal, perhaps unrealistic considering the social climates and data readiness. But at the same time, I thought blockchain was acting as a powerful way of getting people to start looking at the systemic issues and data issues that weren’t previously given priority. The joke was that blockchain was the ice-cream flavor that got people excited to eat their broccoli.      When they asked how to get blockchain ready by 2020, we sat down and said 'let’s talk about your systems, let’s talk about accuracy, let’s talk digitization levels and needs.' I think that, for all the fact that it’s not a silver bullet, blockchain opened a conversation, however briefly, about hard infrastructure problems and important enabling environmental conditions, and broadened the conversation about a bigger strategic vision.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/03/even-if-blockchain-cant-secure-land-rights-it-got-us-talking-about-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34bf384d3b21b72f0656c759ed0e4f1c249ab078-1218x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1txh,1578078350,SEC Asks for Telegram ICO Financials Ahead of CEO's Deposition,"Telegram has been ordered by a judge to explain why it should not have to turn over financials concerning its $1.7 billion initial coin offering (ICO).      District Judge P. Kevin Castel of the New York Southern District Court ordered Telegram to respond by the end of day Friday following a request Thursday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      The SEC said the investment information is necessary ahead of next week’s deposement of three Telegram employees, including founder and CEO Pavel Durov.      “Defendants’ refusal to fully disclose and answer questions about their disposition of the $1.7 billion they raised from investors is deeply troubling,” the SEC’s letter states.      The SEC is scrutinizing how ICO investor money was spent, according to a case filing to the District Court on Thursday. Telegram has refused to hand over ICO allocation records relevant to the “efforts of others,” part of the Howey Test used by the SEC to determine if a financial product is a security.      ""The SEC is asking the court for an order compelling production of this information immediately, in advance of an upcoming deposition,"" Compound Finance general counsel Jake Chervinsky told CoinDesk.      ""[The] judge may already plan to grant the motion and just wants to give Telegram its chance to be heard before doing so. I wouldn't be surprised if Telegram responds in a few hours and the Judge issues an order granting the motion a few hours after that (or tomorrow morning),"" he said.      The SEC has asked for the relevant financial records ahead of the deposition, but Telegram has only released credits, and not debits, of its ICO investments to date citing issues with its banking partners.      “The requested bank records are highly relevant to the issues in dispute in this case, including how much money Telegram has spent, and in what manner, in developing the TON Blockchain,” the SEC letter said.      “This evidence is relevant to the efforts Telegram has made to ensure the viability and profitability of the Grams it sold,” the SEC added.      Telegram was court-ordered to halt the issuance of its gram token in October 2019 following an emergency action and restraining order by the SEC. The regulator said Telegram’s ICO constituted an unregistered securities offering.      The New York court ordered Durov to be deposed at a mutually agreed upon location. The deposition is scheduled for Jan. 7–8 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.      Update (Jan. 3, 19:45 UTC): A previous version of this story said the motion to compel had been granted by the district judge while the court order only asks Telegram to respond to the SEC's request before a motion is granted.

42431352,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1uRh,1578075079,"When DeFi Meets Neo Banking, This Thing Gets Interesting","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Varun is co-founder and CEO of Juno, a neo bank that provides users a high yield account for savings. Prior to Juno, he co-founded Nuo, a decentralised debt protocol and BeeWise, a credit analytics platform.      2019 was clearly the year of decentralised finance (DeFi) and “earning interest” was its killer app. It’s time to take this mainstream and 2020 promises to be a defining year. Even more exciting, DeFi coincides with a broader trend in banking – the rise of fintech and so-called neo banks.      For the uninitiated, neo banks are challenger banks focused on creating a better banking interface using open banking APIs or by building a core banking system from the ground up. Startups like Chime, Monzo, N26, Revolut have acquired millions of users this year and have collectively raised over USD 5 Billion from marquee investors. At the same time, fintech upstarts including Wealthfront, Robinhood, Betterment, SoFi have attracted attention by introducing new age financial products across wealth management, investments and loans.    Interest is the new battleground    In the last 10 years, fintech has been slowly chipping away at the profits of banks by cutting out middlemen and serving customers directly. We have seen brokerage wars with the introduction of zero commission brokerage by Robinhood forcing incumbent firms to drop their fees and explore new avenues to monetize. Post-brokerage, interest has become the new battleground. It is also the most lucrative battle of them all. Banks are still heavily dependent on net interest margins for their revenues and profits.       Since the financial crisis, net interest margins are at a peak which means banks are able to pay more to their customers on deposits – they are clearly choosing not to. The interest rate banks pay has effectively been the same for the past 10 years, a timeline that begins when banks lowered interest rates to zero as a result of the financial crisis and learned they did not lose customers.      In the last few years, neo banks like N26, Monzo, Marcus and fintech startups like Wealthfront, Betterment, and Robinhood have used this opportunity to attract customers by providing a high yield “cash account” that pays between 1.5-2.5% APY on deposits through strategic bank partnerships. This interest rate advantage has helped Wealthfront successfully attract $8BN in customer deposits, while Marcus by Goldman Sachs is gaining $1BN deposits per month.    DeFi is fintech 2.0    DeFi takes this trend in banking to its culmination by cutting out the middlemen completely, by using open and decentralized peer to peer networks. The objective with DeFi is to build a multi-faceted financial system, native to crypto, that recreates, and improves upon, the legacy financial system. DeFi now represents a new fintech wave and DeFi neo banks will play a pivotal role to successfully bridge the gap between fintech and DeFi to attract new customers.      In the last few months, many projects including Juno, Dharma, Linen, Outlet have announced their intention to launch DeFi neo banks built using Compound and Nuo protocol. Their stated goal is to provide users a high-yield account for savings which competes with cash accounts of fintech startups like Wealthfront and neo banks like Monzo. This would be enabled by providing a simple alternate banking interface that blends crypto and traditional finance seamlessly.    Banks lowered interest rates to zero as a result of the financial crisis and learned they did not lose customers.    Not that rolling out these products will be easy. As these projects launch next year, there are quite a few challenges standing in the way, but they also present a huge opportunity for the crypto community as well.    Opportunities/Challenges    As these neo banks attempt to bring new customers, one of the biggest challenges is to provide a competitive high yield at scale. This is directly correlated to the loan demand on interest-generating platforms like Compound, dydx and Nuo, which are currently limited due to lack of liquidity. Bringing bitcoin onto ethereum in a trustless way can scale this massively and many projects including Ren and Keep are working towards this goal. Also, since bank customers are used to the idea of a fixed interest rate on their savings, interest rate swaps will play a critical role as the ecosystem matures.      To bridge this adoption gap further, DeFi needs world-class fiat on-ramps and off-ramps with low fees and higher limits along with smart contract and volatility insurance to provide security in case of catastrophic events.      Lastly, these DeFi neo banks will also need a built in monetization strategy in order to acquire customers and funnel deposits to interest generating protocols. This will be enabled through fee sharing or native DeFi token distribution for interest generating platforms to incentivize projects to bring deposits and govern interest rates. With these challenges and opportunities in mind, 2020 promises to be an exciting year for DeFi.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Varun Deshpande,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/03/when-defi-meets-neo-banking-this-thing-gets-interesting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67b84467ddc34d4d013d4946255d545f55ebe043-2000x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431339,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1tvh,1578074702,"Bitcoin Jumps 5%, Gaining With Gold, After US Kills Top Iranian Official","Bitcoin jumped the most in two weeks after a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian military commander, fueling speculation that heightened geopolitical turmoil might spur demand for the cryptocurrency in 2020.      The digital asset’s price jumped 5 percent Friday to $7,300 as of 16:07 universal coordinated time (11:07 a.m. in New York). The surge, which appeared to follow gains in oil and gold prices, pushed bitcoin into positive territory for the year-to-date, now up 2.2 percent.      Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency-focused research firm Quantum Economics, noted in an email that the U.S. attack drove up prices for gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset whose value is expected to hold in times of geopolitical or economic instability. Many investors speculate that bitcoin bears similarities to gold, in terms of its perceived resistance to inflation.      Higher oil prices could make investors nervous about future economic growth while also potentially pushing up consumers’ costs at the gas pump, stoking faster inflation.      Another consideration is whether the escalating tension might spur demand for bitcoin among Iranians, who have shown an appetite for cryptocurrencies in recent years as the Middle Eastern economy faced a host of sanctions ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.      In late December, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech in Malaysia that Muslims might need their own cryptocurrency to “save themselves from the domination of the U.S. dollar and the American financial regime.”      Iran has “long been seen as one of the hotbeds for bitcoin adoption” due to U.S. sanctions on money transfers stemming from the country, not to mention a “very unstable economy,” according to Greenspan.      But the news likely precipitated purchase orders from some investors who were already planning to buy bitcoin, Greenspan wrote.      “The Iranian market in and of itself is likely too small and slow to have caused this move single-handedly,” according to Greenspan. “More likely, one or several players have been waiting on the side for a good buying opportunity below $7,000 per coin, and it seems one has presented itself.”      Bitcoin prices surged 94 percent in 2019, making it one of the world’s best-performing assets, with roughly triple the total return charted by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/03/bitcoin-jumps-5-gaining-with-gold-after-us-kills-top-iranian-official,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/780c566e64bf67f38dca14cc304a1ade4aad0866-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431353,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1uPh,1578071720,BusKill Is a DIY Tool to Lock Down Your Laptop,"Operational security, or opsec, is key if you're doing anything on crypto exchanges and this new trick – essentially a DIY hack – can make you a bit safer in a crowded cafe.      Created by software engineer Michael Altfield, the tool, called BusKill, uses a simple USB key and a few lines of code to activate your laptop's lockdown process, or, in an emergency, a full disk wipe.      He outlines the DIY hack on his website.      ""Let's consider a scenario: You're at a public location (let's say a cafe) while necessarily authenticated into some super important service (let's say online banking). But what if – after you've carefully authenticated – someone snatch-and-runs with your laptop?"" wrote Atfield. ""Maybe you can call your bank to freeze your accounts before they've done significant financial harm. Maybe you can't.""      Replace ""bank"" with ""decentralized exchange"" in this scenario and you get a general idea of this tool's value.      The system works by watching your USB ports for a certain brand of USB key. Atfield uses a magnetic breakaway cable that would disconnect if someone pulled the laptop away from him and then wrote some simple code that works on Linux or Mac OS to trigger an action when the USB key suddenly disappears. In other words, when the cable is yanked away, the computer will lock itself down.      There are a few situations on which this sort of opsec could come in handy: Remember, the Silk Road's Ross Ulbricht's laptop was yanked away from him as he was arrested, allowing agents access the device. Further, we can imagine far less controlled situations in which someone drags your laptop off a cafe table and runs off into a crowd.

Burroughs said, ""Sometimes paranoia's just having all the facts.""",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/03/buskill-is-a-diy-tool-to-lock-down-your-laptop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8173d1c7d846cd0d42688e529d5fa99001499c4a-1500x890.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Levine, editor of podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      Adam: With geopolitical bombshells dropping in the overnight, Brad’s got the story...      Brad Keoun: Bitcoin prices are jumping today after the U.S. government confirmed that President Donald Trump authorized a drone strike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian military commander.      Since midnight London time bitcoin is up 5.5 percent, erasing a price slide we saw during the first two days of 2020, and leaving prices just slightly positive during the year so far.      It’s tough to state with precision exactly how the strike could affect bitcoin prices in the long term, but in the short term the U.S. military action appears to have pushed up global oil prices, given Iran’s status as one of the world’s biggest oil producers, and the potential for an escalation of the conflict between the two countries.      Higher oil prices could potentially contribute to inflation and, according to Ian Shepherdson at the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, a sustained oil-price increase could make traders nervous about future economic growth.      This plays into one bitcoin price narrative, since many investors view the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation, a so-called “store of value” like gold.      Adam: Turning to the news, BlockFi, a cryptocurrency lending firm backed by investors including Galaxy Digital and the Winklevoss twins, says in a blog post that it plans to offer a new BTC rewards card that will pay out rewards in bitcoin when users make purchases, as an alternative to airline miles or cash back.      According to the company, the new credit card could provide a ""novel way to introduce crypto to non-owners in an easy, familiar way."" And CoinTelegraph reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a court order on Thursday seeking to compel the messaging platform Telegram into releasing details on how it spent some $1.7 billion from an initial offering of its gram tokens.      It’s the latest volley in the SEC’s case against Telegram over an allegedly improper unregistered securities sale.      Telegram has pushed back against the charges, and legal analysts say the outcome of the case could set an important precedent for future capital-raising in the crypto industry.      Brad: Bitmain, the giant Chinese maker of computers used to mine bitcoin, reportedly plans to cut about 50 percent of its staff in the next several months.      The news comes via Cointelegraph, which in turn cited Chinese news media.      Bitmain, which saw both a slew of management changes in late 2019 as well as some aggressive sales initiatives like limited price guarantees for big wholesale customers and even rental options, describes the latest move as a ""personnel optimization plan.""      According to Cointelegraph, the layoffs are expected to be completed prior to bitcoin’s upcoming “halving” expected in May, when the rewards for mining data on the bitcoin blockchain will be reduced by 50 percent, in accordance with the network’s 11-year-old design.      And in a twist of gallows humor, Dovey Wan, co-founder of Primitive Ventures and a prominent observer of China’s crypto industry, joked on Twitter that the Bitmain layoffs appeared to be the first halving of 2020.      Adam: And for today's featured story, it’s Jan. 3, known in the community as Proof of Keys Day. The movement behind this community holiday celebrates January 3rd each year as the date on which all cryptocurrency users should take custody of any coins kept on an exchange, check your long-term token storage, or anywhere else outside your direct control. The argument here is that blockchain tokens, unlike a bar of gold or a physical stock certificate, can be easily retrieved and verified, even if just temporarily. And if there’s one thing we’ve seen in the markets over the last half dozen years, it’s that keeping your tokens in a custodied exchange isn’t a sure, or even necessarily safe, bet.      While the tradition is currently followed by a relatively small percentage of cryptocurrency holders, its purpose is both unique and pretty smart given the space. Done en masse, this is effectively a regularly scheduled “run on the bank” except the bank is the entire cryptocurrency exchange system. As the saying goes, when the tide goes out you get to see who's swimming naked, or in this case is an exchange who looks insolvent. In traditional finance, bank runs are often seen as apocalyptic as the interdependent financial system can potentially lead to one seemingly insignificant failure dragging down much larger and even more deeply connected counterparties. But in crypto, things don’t have to be that way. So this movement takes the perspective that the only way you can ensure that your exchange can survive a mass wave of withdrawals akin to a bank run is if in real life they can survive an annual exercise where that actually happens. Think of it as the equivalent of the annual stress tests that the Federal Reserve makes the biggest banks undergo.      Now, for many traders, the idea of holding tokens anywhere besides an exchange can make them anxious, and it’s not without reason. One of the clarion calls of bitcoin and many early cryptocurrencies has been the opportunity to “Be your own bank,” which is about as powerful as you’d imagine but which comes bundled with a level of responsibility and related fear that you’ve got it wrong, which makes this something of a mixed blessing in practice.      For those who have looked at their tokens primarily as an investment which they hold on an exchange like everything else, Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins presents a reminder today, or really on any day of the year, that while blockchains give you the ability to completely control all of your coins and really put your exchange to the test, you can also just take the opportunity to learn the basics, set up a simple wallet on your phone and take possession of a single token. It can be nerve-wracking to truly be responsible for your investments, we’re just not used to it, and why would we be? Before tokens it really wasn’t possible. Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins is a low-impact, low-stress way to get a firsthand look at the personal control and related responsibility which, underlying everything, this industry is really about.

Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at 2020 predictions published in recent days by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance.      Brad: As we move into 2020, there are a lot of predictions flying around on what the new year promises for the crypto industry, from a potential price rally linked to bitcoin’s so-called halving, to the potential flowering of new lending and trading platforms in what is known as decentralized finance, where the functions of financial firms are essentially replicated on platforms that are distributed across many users and computers.      Today we’re going to highlight a couple of predictions made in recent days from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its colorful CEO, known to his fans as CZ.      He’s a charismatic and sometimes polarizing figure in the crypto world, epitomized by the fact that some of the company’s top executives have gotten Binance tattoos to match his own.      CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen in late December described the almost cult-like following as a “bromance.”      Well, in a blog post on Thursday addressed to Binancians, CZ wrote that one of Binance’s key goals for 2020 is to ""bring crypto to the masses.""      He predicted that by 2030, cryptocurrencies will be used to pay for self-driving rides on Uber, in addition to funding biotech research.      And in a separate post early Friday, Binance said it plans to allow customers to trade bitcoin, ether, ripple and a few other tokens against the euro for the first time.      This move by Binance comes as some investors and economists are speculating whether the dollar might lose some of its mojo in the 2020s as the dominant global reserve currency, especially in the face of challenges from rapidly advancing digital-asset technologies.      In his blog post, CZ wrote that he sees Binance’s core mission as spreading the freedom of money.      And while the company’s most high-profile success has come from its centralized cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.com, he said that the company’s leaders QUOTE strongly believe in decentralization END-QUOTE, embodied in recent efforts to create a decentralized exchange      Tying back to the crypto industry’s potential to replace cash, CZ wrote that he believes fiat will co-exist with crypto for a long time      According to the post, ""more than 99.9 percent of the money supply is still in fiat, and we need to build bridges, gateways, teleport portals, or whatever you call it, to bring them into crypto.""      Who knows what the future will bring, and Nostradamus he’s not, but given CZ’s cult-like following, a lot of people in the crypto world may pay attention.

42431354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1uNh,1578069345,Stanford Prof Darrell Duffie on Our Big Stablecoin Future,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Darrell Duffie is a professor of finance at Stanford Universityhttps://www.darrellduffie.com/.    Darrell Duffie is on the faculty of Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, where he teaches and researches financial market design.      Fulfilling the academic adage ""publish or perish,"" Duffie writes a lot. His work spans from modeling financial ecosystems to questioning the credibility of LIBOR (a sometimes-manipulated benchmark for setting interest rates on loans). He also writes about the disruptive inevitabilities of cryptocurrency, specifically fiat-backed stablecoins.      In October, at a distinguished Group of Thirty event, Duffie gave a presentation alongside Libra co-creator David Marcus and Bank for International Settlements general manager Agustin Carstens on the impact of stablecoins on banking systems. Crypto will transform the economy by reducing inefficiencies at the interpersonal, interbank and international level, he said.      I emailed Professor Duffie a lot of questions about stablecoins over a period of several weeks. Below is a compiled and condensed transcription of our emailed correspondence concerning the very basics of stablecoins, what a central bank digital currency is, and, of course, Libra.      What is a stablecoin?      A stablecoin is a digital asset whose price is constant or nearly constant in terms of the native fiat currency, that is held and transferred cryptographically.      What initially spurred your interest in stablecoins?      The weak quality and high cost of current payment systems, especially in the U.S.      What do you think were the biggest events in stablecoins this past year?      Speaking from the viewpoint of my interest in payment fintech: The biggest events of the past year are the unmasking of serious problems in Tether, the initial proposal of Libra, and the decision of the Fed to go ahead with FedNow, which is another approach to meeting the need for an improvement in the payment system.      Did you work on Libra, or are you an observer of the project?      Yes. I have met with some Libra people on a couple of occasions. I don't work with any firm in the payment space. I am just observing and learning.      What do you think of the regulatory backlash against Libra from EU officials, the US congress, and policy makers in China?      The reactions are natural and appropriate: ""No, you are not going to offer this service until we are confident that it complies with our rules, which are designed to protect users.""      Does Libra have the potential to improve payment systems?      If Libra complies with the rules, then yes, it could improve payment efficiency and lower payment costs. This would be a positive development. Payments would be faster and cheaper.      But complying will not be easy, and they have already dug themselves into a hole, in terms of perception among regulators.      How will this “unmasking” you mentioned earlier affect Tether going forward?      New York prosecutors alleged that Tether had a conflict of interest in making a loan from the trust holding assets backing Tether to affiliated parties. So, one might assume that the ""stable coin"" is not in fact stable. This casts doubt on its trustworthiness, with respect to having a stable value.      What is Tether's role in the crypto ecosystem?      Stability of price promotes use as a medium of exchange. I think Tether is somewhat popular because it is somewhat stable in price, for the time being.      What of other crypto-incumbent stablecoins like Circle's USDC or the Binance Token, will they play a larger role outside of their ecosystem?      I expect that Tether has raised the ante for others for demonstrating strong independent controls on the quality of their backing. So far, the incumbent stablecoins have not made a strong case for their technologies. Yes, different stablecoins are in effective competition with each other, given the severe network externalities: Anyone will generally prefer to use the payment medium that others are using.      What do you make of crypto-pegged stablecoins like DAI?      I am open minded, but I expect that crypto-pegged stablecoins will have a tough time establishing a critical mass of users for payments applications.      What has crypto's effect been on the banking and finance sectors?      So far, the main effect on banking and finance are the heightened awareness of perceived gaps and opportunities in the payment system, and some R&D work, such as JPM Coin.      Do you think private stablecoins will disrupt traditional banking services?      Actually, I do not expect that private stablecoins will prevail. However, the threat of entry by stablecoins to incumbent payment service providers will cause disruption, including likely improvements in payment services. For instance, it's not clear that JPM Coin will be for general use in broad payments. Second, it would seem unlikely for JPMorgan to be an early disruptor of its legacy franchises in the payments arena.      What would JPMorgan's stablecoin likely achieve for inter and intra-bank processes?      JPM Coin and USC (utility settlement coin) would be useful for settlement of wholesale securities transactions and other large interbank transactions.    It's a serious idea, and could in principle work well. I'm not confident that the Fed will co-operate. Some banks could react against it.    Would it be inherently more trustworthy?      JPM Coin would be as safe as deposits in JP Morgan Chase, so highly trusted. Given the necessary agreements from central banks, USC would be backed by central banks, so obviously trustworthy.      What do you think of the USD-backed stablecoin proposed by former CFTC executives Gorfine and Giancarlo?      It's a serious idea, and could in principle work well. I'm not confident that the Fed will co-operate. Some banks could react against it. An effective CBDC (central bank digital currency) would significantly change the nature of the private-sector payment industry. Credit card interchange fees, for example, would come under pressure.      Further, achieving the network scale effects will not be easy. (Libra automatically overcomes that concern, given Facebook's enormous user base.)      Could you elaborate on the problem of scale effects for introducing a central bank stablecoin?      Scale effects apply to any form of money, including central bank stablecoins, in much the same way. A given potential medium of exchange can be an effective form of money only if there is a presumption by most agents in the economy that most other agents are ready and willing to use it as a medium of exchange. This is a network externality: the greater the set of people that use it, the larger is the set of people that want to use it. Pretty simple economics.      A central bank has a huge head start in creating the needed scale effects because it already supplies money that everyone uses. It could simply begin to substitute legacy forms of central bank money (such as paper money) with its own stablecoin. The central bank could also allow banks and potentially other intermediaries to supply its stablecoin to anyone who wants it.      Do you think the Fed will implement the idea?      I doubt the Fed, or the U.S. more generally, will introduce a state-backed stablecoin. That's difficult technically and politically risky. If it doesn't work well, even just occasionally, government officials will suffer severe criticism.      Where in the world will this technology be deployed first?      Among large countries, it looks like China is likely to be the first to deploy a CBDC.      Although you write that the Fed will not likely roll out a stablecoin, do you think a central bank digital coin may be developed independent of a blockchain?      What qualifies as a ""blockchain"" in CBDCs becomes definitional, and is not necessarily so important to the functional properties of a CBDC. I do expect that the People's Bank of China will offer a CBDC soon, maybe even in the next year.      Could a state-backed digital currency help maintain control over monetary policy?      If denominated in the native fiat currency, an effective state backed digital currency would enhance monetary control and in particular improve monetary policy transmission. This is so because it would reduce market segmentation and promote competition in payment and deposit-related services. If a foreign or global stablecoin became widely used in a small open economy, the control of local-currency monetary policy would become more difficult.      Are there any particular R&D projects you've been following?      All of the above, and fast payment systems, which are coming along well in other countries. FedNow, if executed well, could be a game changer in the U.S. Token X has amazingly powerful new technology for upgrading the bank-based payment rails -- it's the coolest idea I have seen.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | USDT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/03/stanford-prof-darrell-duffie-on-our-big-stablecoin-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c3e79166f07f4f756af7db191a2836e604136d2-1124x750.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431346,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1uBh,1578042000,Pantera Partner Paul Veradittakit's Crypto Predictions for 2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Paul Veradittakit is a partner at Pantera Capital, focusing on venture capital and hedge fund investments. Pantera Capital is one of the earliest and largest institutional investors in digital currencies and blockchain technologies, managing over $500 million.      2019 has been an incredible year for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space – we’ve been through immense market fluctuations, regulatory battles and financial scandals, Senate hearings, and the launches of several key abstractions that enable some really interesting applications.      We’ve got some high hopes for 2020 – the innovations we’ve seen in the last year enable a diversity of awesome use cases for crypto, highlight some critical areas for improvement, and represent a huge advancement in the technicality and complexity of the industry.    On last year’s predictions    A year ago, I made similar predictions for the direction of blockchain in 2019. Here’s a look back at how those performed throughout the year. I’ve rated the strength of my predictions on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least predictive and 5 being the most predictive of how the year actually went.    Consolidation    2019 saw some significant acquisitions, many of which propelled the year’s most significant projects. Some ones to note are ConsenSys’s acquisition of Infura (an ETH node hosting service), Coinbase’s acquisition of Neutrino (crypto analytics), and Facebook’s acquisition of Chainspace (of which, presumably much of the talent contributed to Libra/Calibra).      Accuracy: 4    Security-Token Offerings (STOs)    Institutionally, I saw a lot of crucial STO growth, including Blockstack, a $33.8 million Bond-i by the World Bank, a $20 million bond on ethereum by Santander, and a partnership with Asia’s largest real estate investment trust to launch Link REIT. Still, purchases were slow due to (1) persistent regulatory concerns and (2) little value-add beyond higher relative liquidity, which wasn’t enough to convert most investors to purchase STOs. The space is growing, but slowly.      Accuracy: 3    Death of ICOs    This turned out very true – ICO closures in 2019 were incredibly sparse compared to 2018 (August and October both had none, while January 2018 had 160 projects). That said, 2019 projects raised more funding on average ($6.8 million) compared to 2018 ($132,000). Still, ICOs are losing popularity because of (1) concerns with funded projects (2) regulatory hurdles with selling the tokens and (3) the crypto bear market.      Accuracy: 5    Institutional Capital    With higher education on cryptocurrency, 2019 did see more institutional interest and investment than prior years. There were projects like JPM Coin (by JPMorgan), the launch of Fidelity Digital Assets, and whispers of interest and proposed projects from other major institutions like Goldman Sachs and the World Bank. Still, we didn’t see a ton of tangible projects in this space, but as crypto matures, the traditional giants of the finance industry are becoming more and more interested.      Accuracy: 2    Scalability    Scalability (primarily sharding and payment channels) was a huge thesis for 2019. The Lightning Network’s growth was one of the most critical vehicles for the wave of development of decentralized apps in 2019; developers are becoming less wary of blockchain’s high fees and low speed and are capitalizing on its other features, with similar convenience to traditional development platforms. In a similar vein, I also saw significant work in abstractions for developers, like the Alchemy API.      Accuracy: 5    Seven key areas to look out for in 2020    For 2020, I’ve identified some key concepts and projects that I think will advance significantly. I’ve discussed my thoughts on each below.    Libra/Calibra    In 2019, Facebook announced its Libra project, a cryptocurrency that will be integrated with the Facebook suite of products (Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp) through a new platform called Calibra. Facebook expects the Calibra wallet to launch in 2020 for its messaging applications – this will likely be the largest mainstream launch and use case for cryptocurrency that the world has ever seen. Facebook’s user base is massive, to say the least, at 2.45 billion individuals, and Calibra will likely present an easy-to-use, convenient platform for these users to pay each other and pay online services through single-sign-on with their Facebook credentials.      A launch at this scale would introduce millions of users (many of whom have little to no background with crypto) to the idea of managing assets and payments via a cryptocurrency – and will test the resolve of the space against the masses. It’s also likely that Libra and Calibra will open critical conversations on regulatory issues and data privacy; David Marcus, the head of the project, has already testified against the doubts of the US Senate and ongoing criticism of Facebook’s data scandals will highlight the power – and necessary improvements – of a platform like Libra/Calibra.    Halving    The latter half of 2019 has not been kind to bitcoin – we hit a price maximum of roughly above $13,000 around the middle of the year but have since dropped back down to hovering around the $8,000 mark. Nonetheless, the price has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year. More importantly, in May 2020, bitcoin will undergo its next halving event; to put it succinctly, halving is a protocol built into bitcoin that “halves” the reward that miners receive for mining a block every few years, forcing the total amount of BTC to ever be in existence to cap at 21 million. The reward for mining a block will halve to 6.25 BTC (nearly $40,000 given the current price of BTC).      Halving will likely create a significant bull run in the bitcoin market, for two main reasons. First, it perceptually represents a shrinking supply of “remaining BTC” for investors, which makes investors see each new unit of BTC with more and more value (since less remain). Secondly, since the mining reward is less, fewer miners will be incentivized to mine transactions – this relative scarcity of miners (compared to the status quo) will also drive up the value of the cryptocurrency. Halving will likely keep the price of BTC relatively high for the entirety of 2020 and may bring some more confidence to the space.    Gaming    Game developers and enthusiasts are increasingly exploring what blockchain can do for their gaming systems and how they can incorporate cryptographic assets into (1) the way they provision technological resources and (2) gameplay, in terms of in-game purchases, assets for different players, credits, etc. We’ve seen a fair amount of this already – Splinterland on Steem and the collaboration between Enjin and Microsoft Azure Heroes, but still, there’s a lot of work that remains.      Blockchain gaming will likely boom in 2020 because of important developments in high-performance tools that allow games to run on previously-rate-limiting blockchain technologies, better architected smart contracts, second-layer solutions, and abstracted infrastructure/digital asset storage that makes it easy for game developers to build digital assets into the gameplay and character experience. Hopefully, we’ll see something mainstream on a platform like Steam or Twitch that really puts the power of blockchain in the context of the average gamer.    DeFi Growth    Decentralized finance (DeFi) has undoubtedly been one of the largest areas for growth of cryptocurrency in 2019 – and I expect that this trend will follow through with 2020. Services like Maker, Compound, InstaDapp, etc. will likely see more monthly active users and locked-in value as more and more mainstream consumers and crypto enthusiasts alike catch onto the real-world potential of DeFi – for lending, taking out a mortgage, retail payments, arbitrage, etc.      DAI is also increasingly becoming the “stablecoin standard” and a strong performance in 2019 sets high hopes for its potential growth in 2020 across mainstream users. With the move from single-collateralized DAI to multi-collateralized DAI earlier this year, we’re also likely going to see an onboarding of more users onto the platform and a diversification of the collateral behind DAI, both of which provide critical strength to DAI as a stablecoin and its signaling about the blockchain space. We’ve also seen growing institutional interest in blockchain from the likes of consumer finance products and major banks – we’re keen to see more of this growth in 2020.    Centralized Banking Currencies    This is unlikely to happen within the United States, but China earlier this year launched a digitized version of their yuan currency for mainstream use in a diversity of applications – loans, retail, taxes, etc. This digital currency isn’t strictly a “cryptocurrency” per se, because it’s delivered through a centralized agency, but it does represent growing global interest into shifting the financial ecosystem online. This digital yuan will be a promising signal as to how digital assets perform in mainstream use cases, particularly in online venues like Alibaba and Baidu.      Strong outcomes may signal higher confidence in digitizing the financial space, which ultimately brings more confidence to cryptocurrency and DeFi.    Infrastructure & Web 3.0    The past year has also been huge for infrastructural solutions for blockchain – some key ones include the growth of the Lightning Network, which provides critical speed and scalability improvements for decentralized apps, and Alchemy, which offers a suite of APIs and infrastructural tools that greatly simplify the decentralized development process. These advancements will likely spur a wave of new decentralized applications and web 3.0 technologies, enabled by abstractions and enhanced simplicity of development.      We’re hoping to see more decentralized compute platforms (in the likes of Orchid, a VPN provisioning solution that capitalizes on a decentralized digital token system), that may also capitalize on increasing growth in cloud and SaaS technologies next year. This will likely broaden to other, more consumer-oriented use cases too, like privacy-centric browsers, gaming, social networks, information retrieval, and more.    Regulatory Hurdles    With the diversity of crypto projects that have launched in 2019 and those to come in 2020, it would be naïve to not anticipate the regulatory hurdles that come with these nascent technologies. Some key ones to watch out for include (1) regulation of technologies that employ zero-knowledge proofs (Zcash, for example) that might present powerful, unregulatable tools for criminal financial use, (2) data privacy concerns with the mainstreaming of blockchain and electronic digital finance (concerns surrounding the Libra launch, for example), and (3) the ongoing fight about recognizing certain tokens and currencies and securities versus commodities.      As crypto projects become increasingly nuanced and different in highly-specified ways, we’re also hoping to see greater education about these projects amongst regulatory agencies to understand the nuances and how they might affect their regulation and characterization.    Final thoughts    Ultimately, with a space as nascent as cryptocurrency, it’s hard to identify exactly what might be big in the coming year – projects go through extremes of success and failures, currencies go through peaks and plateaus, and the industry goes through intense controversy and spells of confidence.      That said, I’m confident that 2020 will be a significant year for the industry and we’ll see some incredible innovations.
