42379046,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr0F,1481317267,US Commerce Department Weighs Blockchain at Washington Event,"Could blockchain reshape the world of digital copyright?  This was one of the central questions explored during an event today co-organized by the US Department of Commerce in conjunction with several other government agencies.  Held in Washington, DC, the event drew a mix of regulators, business representatives and members of the startup world, who discussed the scope of next-generation systems for copyright management. There, blockchain appeared to be both a subject of curiosity and a potential solution to the panelists engaged.  One of the more forceful advocates for the tech was Berklee College of Music's George Howard, who works as an associate professor of management and is a member of the Open Music Initiative, which has been weighing blockchain applications of its own in conjunction with companies like Intel.  Appearing on the first panel, Howard spoke positively about the tech, later arguing that blockchain would come to form the basis of a wide range of tools to create a backup layer for information given the state of current events.  He went on to tell attendees:  ""We are arguably in a Pizzagate, post-truth world where it's going to take some secondary source to say, 'Who are you?'""  Among the panelists during a follow-up session was Nathan Lands, co-founder and CEO of Blockai, a startup that uses the bitcoin blockchain to create copyright claims over images.  ""The idea of what we're building is, as soon as the creator creates something, with whatever creator tool they’re using, automatically we kind of notarize on the bitcoin blockchain a record,"" he said during the panel.  The event is the latest that has seen a US government agency discuss how blockchain tech could potentially impact its constituents or be covered by its mandate.  Last month  , the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held a panel on the technology, and so far this year, the IRS and CFTC have also been involved in industry dialogue.

42379040,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mqwT,1481304618,"A16z, USV Invest $10 Million in Blockchain Token Trading Firm","A startup that specializes in the trading of blockchain-based assets has raised a $10m fund backed by Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), Boost VC and Union Square Ventures (USV), among other undisclosed investors.  Led by Coinbase veteran Olaf Carlson-Wee, Polychain Capital intends to invest in so-called ""protocol tokens"" or alternative assets that like bitcoin, have both an underlying protocol and a tradeable asset that manages access to a digital ledger or application.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Carlson-Wee described the fund as one that would seek to offer investors exposure to an actively managed portfolio of blockchain-based assets.  Notably, Carlson-Wee credited the success of alternative blockchains like ethereum as driving interest in the fund. While there has been dramatic growth in the price of its native asset, little of this value has been accessible to traditional VCs, he said.  Carlson-Wee said:  ""I think these tokens are very important, they directly monetize the open-source founders and founding teams at a protocol level. We've already seen many founders of blockchain networks get rich based on their creation.""  Carlson-Wee indicated that Polychain will not disclose its investments, but that it won't be using its potentially outsized position to influece day-to-day market movements.  ""I'm trying to take a position very early on in projects that I believe could truly become the infrastructure of the future internet, or app tokens that could disrupt major centralized web services,"" he said.  The bet is the latest that finds A16z and USV teaming up for an investment that marks a turning point for blockchain technology business models.  In the past, both firms have backed startups including OpenBazaar, a decentralized e-commerce marketplace, and Mediachain, a metadata protocol for content sharing.  In 2016, nearly $200m has been raised in initial coin offerings (ICOs) or public token sales, according to CoinDesk data, with the majoriy (nearly $150m) dedicated to the failed DAO project.

42379047,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr2l,1481294217,Why Smart Contracts Will Need 'Smart Term Sheets' to Match,"Ted Mlynar and Ira Schaefer are partners in the Intellectual Property practice at Hogan Lovells in New York City. They advise on patent and other intellectual property issues relating to blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.  In this opinion piece, the authors argue that, in the era of smart contracts, lawyers will still have plenty of work ensuring the devs get the code right.  In a new world of smart contracts, many expect that formal written contracts, and the lawyers that draft them, will be obsolete.  It is presumed that the agreed-upon term sheet will be simply given to a software developer to convert into smart contract computer code.That code will be the final agreement.  But what does a software developer know about drafting code to implement a traditional term sheet? The negotiating parties know their deal, and the lawyers know the applicable law and the customary terms, but the software developer does not. A traditional term sheet is not enough.  A “smart term sheet” is needed to bridge the information gap between the agreed-upon business terms and the smart contract coding process. It can: specify the practical details necessary for implementing the agreed-upon terms, identify and address the terms that cannot be implemented in a smart contract, and add the “boilerplate” legal terms.  In short, the practical and legal hurdles to implementing a term sheet can be overcome.  A not-so-hypothetical example  As an example of the utility of a smart term sheet, let’s consider a hypothetical earthquake insurance policy for New York City (NYC).  In a typical ethereum blockchain implementation, each smart contract insurance policy will be associated with a particular blockchain address. Inputs to, and outputs from, the smart contract insurance policy take the form of messages sent to and from that blockchain address.  Computer nodes of the blockchain network will execute the smart contract computer code based on the messages received at the smart contract blockchain address.  Because the smart contract code stored on the blockchain is generally immutable and the blockchain runs on a distributed computing network, the contracting parties can be more confident that the agreed-upon terms will be timely performed even if NYC is significantly damaged by an earthquake.  A traditional simplified term sheet for NYC earthquake insurance might look like this:  Parties: Earthquake Insurance Co (the “Insurer”) and Unshakable Corp (the “Insured”)  Covered Zone: New York City  Coverage: Insured receives $50m if an earthquake occurs within Covered Zone.  Premium: $500k for 12 months of coverage  Renewal Option: Policy is renewable for 12 months upon payment of Premium within three days of expiration date  Minimum Solvency: Insurer will maintain liquid assets equal to at least 30% of Insurer’s Covered Zone exposure  Additional: Customary terms and conditions  If this traditional term sheet were simply given to a software developer to code, it is left to the software developer to determine which terms will be included in the smart contract, which oracles will be consulted, and which customary legal terms will be implemented.  Unfortunately, the software developer cannot know what to do if the term sheet isn’t “smart” too.  Translating concepts into code  Lawyers familiar with coding can convert a traditional term sheet into a smart version that includes the practical and legal details required to implement a smart contract. Those important issues shouldn't be left to the software developer’s discretion, or worse, ignored altogether.  A smart term sheet can identify which contract terms will be implemented as a smart contract and which, if any, will not.  It can expressly identify the oracles and other smart contract inputs the contract will rely upon so the developer can link to those inputs directly. Key algorithms for performing the parties' intentions can be specified. Legal issues can be identified and addressed.  Drawing upon the necessary resources, the sample earthquake insurance term sheet can readily be converted into a “smart term sheet” ready for coding:    1. Parties: Earthquake Insurance Co. (the “Insurer”) and Unshakable Corp. (the “Insured”)      2. Covered Zone: Five boroughs of New York City (Oracle 1)      3. Coverage: Insured receives US$5m in bitcoin (BTC) if the United States Geological Service issues a public announcement that the epicenter of an earthquake was detected within Covered Zone      3.1 Trigger on magnitude 5.0 or greater earthquake according to USGS Earthquake Notification Service (or Atom Syndication data) (Oracle 2)      3.2 Currency exchange rate determined by live CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at time Premium paid (Oracle 3)      3.3 Determine location of earthquake epicenter relative to Covered Zone with Google Maps Geocoding API (Oracle 4)      3.4 Payout to Insured’s wallet at [wallet address]      4. Premium: US$50k in bitcoin (BTC) for 12 months of coverage      4.1. Currency exchange rate determined by live CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at time Premium paid (Oracle 3)      4.2. Payment to Insurer’s wallet at [wallet address]      5. Renewal Option: Insured can renew policy for a second 12-month period upon payment of second Premium no later than 72 hours after expiration of first 12-month period      6. Minimum Solvency: Insurer will maintain liquid assets equal to at least 30% of Insurer’s maximum exposure in the Covered Zone during preceding 30 day period      6.1. Insurer’s liquid asset balance available at [wallet address]      6.2. Insurer’s daily exposure in Covered Zone available at [wallet address]      6.3. Insurer refunds Premium if liquid asset balance falls below 30% of maximum daily exposure during prior 30 days      7. Additional: Customary terms and conditions      7.1. 168-Hour Occurrence: Earthquakes and shocks occurring within any 168-hour (1 week) period shall be considered a single earthquake      7.2. Payout Capped: A maximum of two (2) payouts will be made per policy      7.3. Assignment: The Insurer cannot assign this contract, the Insured can      7.4. Choice of Law: NY law applies      7.5. Arbitration: All disputes relating to subject matter of contract will be submitted to binding arbitration in NYC    Be smart, be prepared  The smart term sheet provides a much needed interface between the contracting parties and the software developer. It specifies a whole host of details not included in the traditional term sheet that are, nonetheless, essential for a practical, enforceable contract.  By creating a smart term sheet, the parties can integrate needed practical and legal considerations and the advice of counsel into the instructions given to the software developer. With less left to the discretion of the software developer, there is much less room for error.  Although some predict a seismic shift toward smart contracts, the real-life practicalities and legal implications of complex contracts do not simply disappear on the blockchain.  We expect the smart term sheet will be a useful tool for contracting parties, lawyers, and software developers to use to comprehensively address those issues.

42379048,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr41,1481290486,"'Sovereign' Blockchains Will Change Monetary Policy, Bank Paper Argues","A new research paper published by South Africa’s FirstRand Bank explores the world of central banks and blockchains, suggesting that the technology could usher in a ""new epoch"" of monetary oversight.  Titled “The Advent of Crypto Banking”, the report examines the question of central bank-issued digital currencies, a topic that recently came to the fore when the European Central Bank announced this week that it was jointly exploring the concept in partnership with Japan’s central bank, the Bank of Japan. Those two institutions are expected to publish research of their own next year.  Other central banks, notably the UK's Bank of England, have been actively exploring the technology for use as a basis for a new kind of digital currency. And, in June, Canada's central bank unveiled a digital money prototype it has designed, dubbed ""CAD-Coin"".  The FirstRand Bank paper is, in part, a deeper dive into what a central bank digital currency might look like, invoking the term “sovereign blockchain” as it weighs what officials could use the system for if it was fully realized.  The authors note:  “Once such a sovereign blockchain is created with a [central bank cryptocurrency], other financial instruments such as bonds, equities, derivatives and even land and car registries could migrate to the same sovereign blockchain. This would allow the central bank to conceivably see the creation of all commercial bank assets in an economy.”  Another benefit of a sovereign blockchain, according to the paper, would be the ability to use that complete visibility to promote tax compliance. Further, smart contracts could become a mechanism for collecting tax revenue in real-time.  “Tax collection could be revolutionised through the use of smart contracts on a blockchain,” the authors write. “Tax could be collected at the point of transaction in real time, changing the entire system of tax collection from 'after-the-fact collection' to 'in-the-moment payment'.”  Though speculative in nature, the paper does argue strongly that blockchain technology could, if fully applied to the way central banks function, could have a deep and significant impact.  “There is no doubt that the way these services are performed will change,” the authors conclude. “We stand at the threshold of a new epoch in financial services.""

42379045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr1V,1481284815,"Smart Contract Issues Set Off 'Alarm Bells', Says US Regulator","Two members of prominent US regulatory bodies took to the stage earlier this week to talk about the difficulties of overseeing the exploding industry of smart contracts.  The representatives of the federally controlled Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the self-enforcing Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) took turns explaining why they were watching the industry so closely.  Speaking during a panel at the Smart Contracts Symposium hosted by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the regulators agreed that while action should be taken, it shouldn't be rushed.  Addressing a group of about 250 people at Microsoft’s New York headquarters, CFTC chief economist Sayee Srinivasan said that, while exploration of the blockchain space had been relatively slow for the past years, the rising cost of capital has begun to make investment worth while and the pace is accelerating.  Indeed, Spanish bank Santander predicts that blockchain could save the financial industry $20bn a year.  Srinivasan acknowledged that while regulators will ""always lag the market practices"" of the rapidly growing financial technology industry, smart contracts themselves could eventually help with the work.  If implemented on a national scale, a so-called ""regulatory node"" on a distributed ledger could give Srinivasan and his colleagues unprecedented auditing powers.  Srinivasan took issue with those in the industry who argued that agreements built using self-executing code will someday render regulators redundant.  ""If there’s money to be made, there’s people being incentivized to game the rules,"" said Srinivasan, who extended an open invitation to firms interested in discussing how a regulatory node might function. ""There will be a role for the regulators, though there’s this belief that code is law.""  In what ended up being a dominant theme of the discussion, Srinivasan described the fight against financial fraud as primarily an “operational issue” about what to do when things go wrong. Namely, he listed the ability to rollback and reverse fraudulent transactions.  Earlier this year, CFTC commissioner Christopher Giancarlo said blockchain could be ""the biggest technological innovation in the financial services industry and financial market regulation in a generation or more"".  But, in the lead up to the regulatory transition of power to President-elect Donald Trump, the agency’s pace has been called into question. Last month, the Agriculture Committee of the US House of Representatives sent a letter to the CFTC asking it for clarity on its digital currency stance.  Srinivasan said:  ""It’s an imperfect process, an evolutionary process.""  Finra applications  The CFTC is not alone in its plan to move slowly when it comes to regulating blockchain.  FINRA director of emerging regulatory issues Kavita Jain echoed Srinivasan’s stance that while blockchain is certainly worth following closely, controlling it should occur slowly.  While Srinivasan has extended an open invitation to those interested in further exploring a blockchain-based regulatory node, Jain says her agency – which writes and enforces rules governing the activities of almost 3,900 securities firms – has been studying smart contract regulation from its own clients.  Speaking on her own behalf and not the regulator's, Jain said:  ""At FINRA, we have received a handful of applications that have given us the opportunity to engage with clients.""  Based on her research so far, Jain said she and other regulators are worried about “regulated entities operating in a trustless environment.”  Not just because those entities might break laws in new ways, but because of concerns over the source of data being used and what happens if the data is corrupted.  She said:  ""The alarm bells ring off in my head.""  The DAO’s dangerous precedent  Also on the panel were two members of the industry who might someday be subject to the decisions these regulators make.  Each of these entities expressed concerns over the precedent set forth by The DAO, the first large scale implementation of smart contracts, that collapsed when the self-executing code running on the ethereum blockchain was tricked into sending its funds to an attacker’s account.  Executive director of digitization for the CME Group Sandra Ro said that, as a regulated entity, her company was “very aware” of its need to be compliant in an environment that crosses 150 different countries.  Ro recounted multiple instances when problems with the financial infrastructure had to be corrected, and wondered out loud what would have happened if the network had been run via self-executing smart contract.  ""How do we code when situations go berserk?"" she asked.  Then, partner Dax Hansen of Perkins Coie – a law firm specializing in blockchain – said that the key differentiator between The DAO and future smart contract implementations needs to be the ability to undo an action.  Smart contracts left to run uninterpreted by regulators would leave mainstream finance open for attack.  He concluded:  ""If it does fail, it’s catastrophic.""
