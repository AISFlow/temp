42381119,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93vOd,1534589125,Can Security Tokens Save Crypto From the Bear Market Blues?,"""Security tokens will save crypto.""  That's what Trevor Koverko, CEO of the crypto project Polymath, told CoinDesk at a blockchain technology festival in Toronto this week. There, tokenized dividends were the week's hot topic, even despite the bear market in August in which bitcoin and ether prices dipped to below $6,000 and $300, respectively.  But Koverko was far from alone in his views. Alan Wunsche, CEO of the crypto startup TokenFunder and co-founder of the industry consortium Blockchain Canada, told CoinDesk he believes tokenized assets are the future of capital markets.  From Fintech Canada to the Blockchain Futurist Conference, hundreds of people were buzzing about how Canadian regulators are allowing a few heavily regulated startups to sell tokenized securities to retail investors and institutional investors alike, as long as issuers conduct thorough know-your-customer checks and disclose numerous risks.  On Thursday, Polymath even announced several startups will launch security tokens through its blockchain marketplace. Further, its partner CORL, an investment startup among the announcement cohort, plans to distribute earnings to investor ethereum wallets directly via smart contracts. TokenFunder took the same approach with its regulator-approved token sale in April.  Koverko said tokens are decoupling from ""risky"" transactional assets like bitcoin, which he believes are currently backed by speculative value and not ""anything real"" regulators can measure. However, he is hardly the first to suggest token startups and bitcoin projects are diverging, both culturally and legally.  Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo tweeted his belief in May that while the cryptocurrency movement is about advancing self-sovereignty, token projects focus on tokenizing equity and physical goods.  ""It's not about the techy cypherpunk movement at all. It's about yielding to the man. We have to obey the rules,"" Koverko said, adding the sheer scale of new investment offerings is exciting in its own distinct way. ""We doubled the market for security tokens overnight.""  In an interview, Canadian parliament member Dan Albas said lawmakers are reviewing regulatory standards related to anti-money laundering checks, keeping cryptocurrency in mind. He expects more know-your-customer requirements are in the pipeline for Canadian bitcoin projects as well.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You cannot just have a scanned copy of someone's driver's license and a picture of them and claim you know your client. We need to bring the norms and standards of the Canadian financial industry to facilitate more choice in the market.""  Yet not everyone is on board with efforts to institutionalize Toronto's blockchain scene.  Crypto veteran Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of the financial services platform Paycase and chairman of the trusted data network Shyft that Polymath is also partnering with for token offerings, told CoinDesk overzealous regulation could ""kill the whole ecosystem.""  Lessons from ethereum  Lawmakers might be prudent to recall lessons from Toronto's crypto history.  Toronto was the birthplace of ethereum, but Albas speculated the Ethereum Foundation was founded in Switzerland because that jurisdiction has more lenient tax and regulatory obligations. As such, many believe the regulation craze now sweeping Canada could make or break Toronto's future as an open source community hub.  ""I think many of the [ethereum] founders and employees actually live in Toronto,"" Albas said. ""That signals to me there is something in the Canadian system that didn't facilitate their growth dreams.""  Albas said he hopes fellow lawmakers will ask whether there is evidence Ontario's different approach to such policies actually benefits the public. Although, as a conservative member of the House Finance Committee he favors minimal oversight, Albas will face an uphill battle.  Weinberg, who works with local regulators in addition to advising regulatory bodies abroad, described the working draft of a new proposal by Canada's Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre as ""insanity"" that could have ""royally screwed"" the local blockchain industry.  The draft guidelines would have required crypto startups involved with any transactions worth more than $10,000 to adhere to even stricter standards, handing over indiscriminate customer data to regulators on a routine basis. Backlash from the crypto community forced lawmakers to reconsider these measures.  In the meantime, Weinberg remains cautiously optimistic about the prospect for both cypherpunk and institutional blockchain innovation in Toronto. Comparing the local scene to Silicon Valley or New York City, Weinberg said Canadian competitors are more likely to collaborate. He told CoinDesk:  ""The most interesting thing about Toronto, and Canada more broadly, is despite this regulatory pushback, or in a way it's actually representative of it, is that because Canada is so small we have a very good ability to work together.""

42381121,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93vR9,1534586430,Non-Believable Tokens: The 7 Strangest Crypto Collectibles Explained,"As they say, what's weird in tech today just might be tomorrow's next big thing.  If that's the case, the world of digital, cryptographic collectibles may be high on the list of potential disruptive innovations. After all, where else can you ""breed"" digital items and come out with an ugly cat all of your own?  It's user experiences like this, which began with Axiom Zen's collectible CryptoKitties, that have technology enthusiasts talking excitedly about the future that could be enabled by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or unique digital items tradable on a blockchain.  The first project to use ethereum's ERC-721 standard, CryptoKitties has since been rolled out into a standalone company with backing from some of the industry's top investors, while NFTs themselves have become one of tech's hottest buzzwords. (Coinbase Ventures' very first investment was in a sort of eBay for NFTs, after all.)  In other words, CryptoKitties has been seen as a harbinger of things to come for blockchain believers, one that opens up new possibilities in the world of video games, real estate and precious metals, among other things.  For those keeping score at home, though, these things are still just super weird. Comparing the state of play to social media, we might very well be in the Six Degrees and Makeout Club days (i.e. way before people got it and Facebook became one of the biggest companies in the world).  With that in mind, we decided to go out looking for some of the stranger, most creative NFTs.  Here's seven that looked like they could be ones for the history books, if not always for the right reasons:  CryptoCrystal  CryptoCrystal  , for instance, breeds ""sentient metals"" into new cartoon characters that evoke geological imagery. With CryptoCrystals, ""breeding"" is called ""melting"" – as in the crystals are melted together.  The way to get fresh crystals is to go ""mining,"" but it's not mining like on bitcoin or ethereum (where your computer does work to secure the network). Instead, users just buy a sort of token called a ""pickaxe"" from the company and use it. This generates a variable amount of crystals. (It's like opening a pack of cards.)  The company behind the game makes its money from selling the pickaxes (sharing a portion with the Ethereum Foundation, voluntarily, to support the network's growth). The rest of the operations in the game cost no more than their gas price.  There are 100 kinds of crystals out there and a finite supply. Further, pickaxes will produce half as much crystals with each passing year.  CryptoVoxels        This one is for folks that grew up on ""Sim City.""  Indie game developer Ben Nolan was trying to create virtual worlds people could own and explore, when he realized that the blockchain made it possible to improve the user experience of that very task. From that inspiration came CryptoVoxels, a three-dimensional space visible with virtual reality goggles.  ""We have about 100 parcels sold (average price 0.16 ETH) in the origin city, about 100,000 square feet of development,"" Nolan told CoinDesk in an email.  The business model is selling these original pieces of land, as well as some other digital objects that add character to the users experience, such as special hats for their avatars.  Users can also build on their land, adding buildings and structures. Someday, there could also be color. (Right now, everything is black and white.)  Nolan says the community has showed good activity in its Discord channel, and that they are starting to see person-to-person sales of parcels on the secondary market.  Like many of these projects, its working with one of the Ebays-for-NFTs, OpenSea.  HyperDragons        Lots of the early NFT projects are on some level or another imitations of Pokemon (cute creatures that can also battle each other to get tougher and cooler).  HyperDragons  takes advantage of decentralization, though, by interacting with another team's project. In this way, HyperDragons can ""eat"" CryptoKitties, absorbing the attributes of cats that share a wallet with the dragon and boosting the dragons powers.  Gameplay takes three forms so far: collecting, breeding and consuming, battling warrior dragons one on one (like the original Pokemon) and castle defense, where you protect your resources from invading players.  The projects white paper acknowledges, like most projects in this space do, that real gaming interactions on ethereum are a problem, and it notes particular concern about the protocol's ability to handle the castle game.  However, it hints that workarounds are under consideration, like we have seen in other projects.  Its emphasizes the team's background in digital gaming, but it also addresses the business model presented by collectible NFTs. The white paper says, ""We believe that there is a sustainable revenue-based model instead of an ICO, and we appreciate the innovation that digital collectibles portray.""  'Bird in the Shell'  So, this one is really just one, specific NFT, by a nameless artist playing around with the form.  SuperRare is an app that lets artists create new digital works and offer them for sale on ethereum, something that could become more important in the art world given enough time.  In fact, one of last year's super ICOs, Status, sees a lot of promise in SuperRare, too. It announced Thursday that it was inducting its parent company, Pixura, into Status Incubate, its accelerator for promising crypto startups.  That said, this one work of art on the SuperRare platform – it just hit a little too close to home. By ""@hackatao,"" it's an animated gif in its native habitat. For anyone on Crypto Twitter, check this one out. It will feel way too real.  CryptoJingles        A digital object doesn't have to be an image. It can also be sound (and probably other things people haven't thought of yet).  Created as a side project by two staff members at Serbian blockchain company Decenter, CryptoJingles was started at the end of 2017.  ""Coming out after the CryptoKitty boom, I noticed they are all variations of you owning some sort of an avatar (an image). I was looking what else could we tokenized,"" Nenad Palinkasevic, one of the co-founders, told CoinDesk via email.  CryptoJingles  are snippets of music that can be mixed together to make new pieces of music. There are 100 snippets of music that people can use to make jingles. Once a new combination has been made and recorded on the blockchain, it's unique and no one else can make that combination. The creator owns it and can sell it on to others, as an NFT.  The project is not in active development but there have been a few super fans making lots of jingles. ""There were 45 jingles created in total on our platform,"" Palinkasevic said, without any marketing or promotion.  Panda Earth        For this project, it's important to start with zoological facts first: Pandas are the best mammal.  On the surface, Panda Earth might just look like CryptoKitties-but-pandas, except for one important difference: Some of the crypto pandas represent real world pandas tracked by the China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Pandas.  A spokesperson says it is a project that is ""authorized"" by the center, but the company didn't respond to questions from CoinDesk about whether purchasing any of the pandas benefits their conservation at all.  Like CryptoKitties, these digital pandas breed. They breed more and more slowly over time, but that will reset every four years.  CryptoTitties  This post started when we discovered the CryptoTitties NFT (not to be confused with SpankChain's side hustle of the same name, which is a way to directly pay women for posting their topless photos).  CryptoTitties  , on the other hand, are cartoon boobs made by a development firm called 7th Wave.  ""It was a spoof of CryptoKitties for fun,"" Hami Gilbert, one of its founders, told CoinDesk in a Discord chat. Later, Gilbert's mother got breast cancer and they decided to find a way to supply cannabis products to women with the disease.  Like CryptoKitties, these are cartoon avatars, but of breasts rather than cats. Fear not: there are both female-identifying and male-identifying boobs available. In fact, while the real-world variety tend to come in pairs, CryptoTitties are available in singleton to sextuplet sets.  Also, they come in as many colors as there are in a bag of Haribo gummy bears.  CryptoTitties has not caught the world on fire, though. Selling each one for as little as 0.05 ETH, the full set of available items totals 144. Only 32 have sold thus far, according to Gilbert.  Previously, 7th Wave tried to launch an ICO project called Wardz, but it didn't succeed. CryptoTitties has gotten more traction, with a small community built around it. To spread the word about the project, they tried to run a ""Motorboat Contest"" where people would win an actual boat.  The idea is that CryptoTitty holders would pay 0.003 ETH to vote for their faves. The set that got the most votes would win a boat, but 70 percent of the proceeds would go to the charity (though they never established a specific partnership).  Sales were too low to justify the boat purchase, however, and it didn't happen.  ""I thought people would share to their friends to vote and that it would snowball,"" Gilbert said. ""But I think people are a bit more prude than that.""
