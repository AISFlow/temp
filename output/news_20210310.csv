42406018,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerczK,1615415473,"JPMorgan's New Crypto Bond 'Not for the Faint of Heart,' Former Star Analyst Hintz Says","Like a lot of Wall Street’s alchemical “structured products,” JPMorgan Chase’s new cryptocurrency-focused bond is full of arcane risks, many of them detailed in the fine print in the largest U.S. bank’s 18-page regulatory filing on the newfangled financial offering.      Daunted by the prospect of dissecting the instrument on our own, CoinDesk turned to the smartest person we could think of to undertake the effort: Brad Hintz, an adjunct finance professor at New York University and former top-ranked brokerage-firm analyst for Sanford Bernstein, itself among the best-of-the-best when it comes to investment research. Before that, Hintz served as corporate treasurer for Morgan Stanley and CFO for Lehman Brothers (in the good times).      In other words: He understands what to make of complicated financial instruments like these and how to think about them. Here’s what he wrote back, via a message on LinkedIn:      ***      Looks like a remarkably entertaining pricing supplement of a medium-term note program.      Needless to say, the note is wager on a basket of stocks that may or may not track the cryptocurrency market, with a 150 [basis point] cushion for the issuer built in. Note the payout on a $1,000 note is equal to ($1,000 × (1 + Basket Return – Basket Deduction), and defines the Basket Deductions as 1.50%).      As the prospectus says, the basket of reference stocks will be set at an Initial Basket Value of 100.00 at pricing. If there is no movement in the reference stocks over the life of the issue, the buyer of the notes will incur a 1.5% loss on the investment.      If you look at the graph in the prospectus pricing supplement, the payout looks like that of a long futures contract. If the price of the commodity goes up, you win. And if it goes down or stays the same, you lose. In this case the wager is on a group of stocks that are expected (but not guaranteed) to track the cryptocurrency market.      Let’s look at the risks:    If this is a bet on the cryptocurrency market, then the basket may not perform as expected. A quick ""ocular"" regression doesn’t imply a tight fit between either MicroStrategy’s stock price or Riot Blockchain stock and the price of bitcoin!  If the overall market declines or goes flat, an investor in this note is toast. If you follow the link at the bottom of the page of the pricing supplement you can see that the pricing supplement is just one of a series of notes issued by JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC and guaranteed by JPM. The guarantee is important, since it ensures that the note has the same ratings as JPM and that implies that the buyer wanted a security (not an OTC derivative) with relatively high ratings to add to a portfolio in order to add some exposure to crypto currencies.    Structured products like this are typically engineered for specific investors who don’t want an [over-the-counter] derivative contract that could easily deliver the same return characteristics as the note.      Why might some investor want to own a ""highly engineered"" bond and not an OTC derivative? A couple of ideas come to mind:    Investment guidelines – Perhaps the buyer is prohibited from holding OTC derivatives, like some insurance companies or pension plans.  Creditworthiness – Perhaps the buyer is not acceptable as a derivative counterparty. In other words, the buyer’s name is unacceptable as a counterparty to JPM’s credit staff. Like a leveraged hedge fund.  Investor Risk Appetite – In a frothy market with lots of enthusiastic investors ignoring risk, there are bond investors tired of zero interest rates who might want some crypto risk to juice up potential returns.    In any case, this investment is not for the faint of heart. Instead of buying this issue, wouldn’t it be easier and more fun to just write a check to (JPMorgan CEO) Jamie Dimon and then hop on a plane for a weekend in Las Vegas?",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/10/jpmorgans-new-crypto-bond-not-for-the-faint-of-heart-former-star-analyst-hintz-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ebe1cdb0b5deee67108251918ff938861be377ec-1000x956.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRXX1,1615411749,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High As US House Passes $1.9T COVID-19 Relief,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $56,248.28 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 3.54% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,101.24-$57,336.75 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin gained for a sixth straight day, extending its longest winning streak of the year and approaching the record high price reached last month.      The largest cryptocurrency was changing hands above $56,000, up about 3% on the day, and within range of a quick run to the all-time high of $58,332.      “We continue to see strong upward momentum from technicals,” Gary Pike, director of sales and trading at institutional cryptocurrency trading platform B2C2 USA, told CoinDesk. “One should not be surprised for bitcoin to test the old highs and potentially break through.”      The day’s gains came amid fresh evidence of two big bullish market drivers over the past year: Bitcoin’s increasing use as a hedge against inflation in the face of trillions of dollars of economic stimulus, and its increasing adoption by big institutional buyers.

Crypto analysts noted that the average “funding rates” on the bitcoin perpetuals – a fee traders pay for leverage within derivatives contracts – has started to tick back up in an indication that markets are turning more bullish, the Norwegian firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a weekly report.      But that is still far from the unsustainable level the market saw in late February, which led to a correction due to liquidations of over-leveraged traders.      Trading volume on the spot market, meanwhile, was flat on Wednesday, showing the market has yet to return to the euphoric frenzy witnessed earlier in the year.      “If we think about the volume as energy, and if the buyers only display low energy, then how can they keep advancing the price?” Chris Thomas, head of digital asset at Swissquote Bank, said. “We really need another few [large buy orders] to move us all forward with more energy.”      Read More: Norway-Listed Aker to Put 100% Bitcoin in Treasury Reserves of New Investment Unit    Ether futures open interest jumps    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down on Wednesday, trading around $1,803.34 and sliding 1.56% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether’s futures open interest is near $6 billion on Wednesday, a 30% jump from last Friday, according to Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OkCoin. The number is approaching its all-time high at about $7 billion, reached on Feb. 19.      At the same time, the amount of ether staked on Ethereum 2.0 has crossed the 3% threshold of total circulating coin supply, as CoinDesk reported earlier today, meaning 3% of all ether in existence will not be available for use other than staking on Eth 2.0 until sometime in the future.

Corporate Buying Might Become a Global Trend,"Bitcoin and ether purchases by companies in Scandinavia and Hong Kong are fueling speculation a wave of non-U.S. corporate treasurers might follow MicroStrategy, Tesla and Square into buying cryptocurrencies, according to a new report by the Norwegian analysis firm Arcane Research.      Hong Kong-listed Meitu, a maker of photo-retouching software, said it bought 15,000 ETH and 379 BTC in open-market transactions last week. Arcane figures the company paid an average $47,230, well below the current market level of around $57,000.      In addition, on Monday Aker, a Norwegian energy engineering company, added 1,170 BTC to its balance sheet, paying approximately $58 million, at an average price of around $49,600.      According to Arcane, the new corporate buyers appear intent on keeping the cryptocurrencies for the long term ""and see further upside potential in bitcoin."" MicroStrategy, led by CEO Michael Saylor and based in Virginia, holds about 91,064 BTC purchased over the past three months, now worth about $5 billion. Meanwhile the U.S. electric-vehicle maker Tesla, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, bought about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in February..      “The first wave, initiated by MicroStrategy, started in the U.S., but now the trend shows signs of turning global,” Arcane wrote.

The bill, already passed by the Senate, has been the subject of heated debate among policymakers and economists who are concerned about inflation when the coronavirus pandemic-wrecked economy recovers.      The financial relief is expected to contribute to temporarily high inflation that may occur when most Americans are vaccinated and able to begin traveling and spending the way they did prior to when COVID-19 restrictions were put in place.      Bitcoiners have touted the stimulus as an opportunity for the limited-supply digital asset to shine as a hedge against inflation.

42386136,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRXAN,1615399396,The Node: Coinbase's Subjective Valuation,"Bitcoin passes the $1 trillion milestone. Coinbase is valued at $100 billion. A cartoon cat NFT sells for 300 ETH ($590,000).      Do any of these numbers look absolutely crazy to you?    This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly known as Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    To many, almost everything seems crazy about crypto these days. Prices are out of whack from fundamentals. Memes and social media sentiment rule the day.      With all the cheap fiat sloshing around the financial system, valuations have become divorced from reality. Investors are putting cash into anything buzzy in an undifferentiated free-for-all.      How else do you explain the rise of Dogecoin? This project was created as a joke with no real-world utility, and yet it’s now worth $7.2 billion.      See also: Lex Sokolin - How Coinbase Is Worth $100B  But Coinbase’s number may be the wackiest of the three. Let me explain.      Bitcoin’s price rise from less than $8000 a year ago has led economists to rethink how we value assets.      As Jim Harper, of the American Enterprise Institute, writes in an excellent blog post this week, value is in the eye of the beholder as never before. It is subjective.      “The subjective theory of value holds that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of it – nor the amount of labor necessary to produce it – but by the importance an individual places on it for the achievement of his or her ends,” he says. “There is no fundamental or inherent value to anything.”      This idea echoes the writing of CoinDesk’s Michael Casey, who argues that crypto derives value from its community of believers.      In this way, dogecoin is valuable because DOGE fans say so. Bitcoin is worth $1 trillion-plus because its followers passionately back the project. Money becomes money because people believe in it.      Sure, bitcoin has use cases (e.g., as a store of value against inflation) and many big time newcomers have entered the market recently. But its price is a function of its appeal as much as its innovation. In fact, one of bitcoin’s main selling points is precisely that it doesn’t change and doesn’t pivot.      See also: Thomas Meyer - Sorry Coinbase, You’re Not Worth $100B      And Coinbase?  Well, it exists in the real world. Its S-1 listing document is public and we can see inside for the first time. Its $100 billion valuation, as Lex Sokolin argued on CoinDesk, is an extrapolation of current market volumes and the hefty fees it charges (which make up 96% of its revenue).      To be sure, Coinbase is a legit success story, a bellwether and a vanguard startup for the industry. But it faces tremendous competition both from centralized exchanges and, most seriously, from decentralized finance (DeFi).      As Thomas Meyer of Cove Markets wrote for CoinDesk yesterday, it’s a brave investor who bets that Coinbase will dominate the exchange business going forward.      “Coinbase is currently the biggest name in U.S. crypto trading and has certainly earned a premium for that as the market has climbed. However, crypto is an all-out arms race with innovation occurring at breakneck pace,” he said.      More to the point, Coinbase’s valuation is arguably at odds with the notion of crypto itself, which is designed to take out intermediaries in the financial system. $100 billion, in this sense, is the product of friction in that system, not the more seamless transfer of value from one entity to another.      Coinbase may continue to tell a good story and investors may want to hear that story. But, going forward, it will have to justify its premium amid a welter of similar offerings.

Impermanent loss    In certain conditions, DeFi coins placed in automated market maker (AMM) pools to earn yield can actually return negative values when compared with merely holding the underlying tokens separately. This is because, more or less, AMMs rebalance portfolios whenever a token is withdrawn from a pool during a trade.      For example, take the ETH/USDC pool on Uniswap. If you buy ETH from the pool with USDC, the pool becomes momentarily imbalanced until someone else swaps ETH for USDC. In certain smaller pools with less liquidity, assets lose yield over time instead of gaining it for providing liquidity.      Sommelier tackles that problem with automation. Protocol users allow the tech to yank funds out of pools suffering impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is detected by a grouping of oracle networks while custody is provided by Cosmos’ validator set where funds are ported over too. A batching function between LP positions and the Cosmos should enable cheap transfers as well, Manian said.      “Liquidity Providers (LPs) will be able to use Sommelier to author and execute complex, automated financial transactions, such as portfolio rebalancing, limit orders, as well as a host of other features that token holders have come to expect from centralized finance (CeFi), but that are not currently available in DeFi,” Sommelier said in a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/10/zaki-manians-sommelier-finance-raises-35m-to-help-defi-investors-avoid-impermanent-loss,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43d17d2fe762f4f59788c0c6b603fc139fc17f98-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 12-month rate represents an acceleration from January's 1.4% clip, a pickup partly driven by higher gasoline prices, which rose 6.9% in February, accounting for over half of the seasonally adjusted increase in the all-items index, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.    Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.1% in February, the report showed. That level was just below economists' average estimate of 0.2%, according to FactSet.  Sub-indexes for shelter, recreation, medical care and motor vehicle insurance all increased in February.  The energy index rose 3.9%.  The index for airline fares continued to decline in February, falling 5.1% as consumers traveled less during the pandemic.    Pantheon's chief U.S. economist, Ian Shepherdson, wrote in a note to clients:    ""We are surprised by the softness of the core. Some of the components where we expected solid increases did deliver; owners’ equivalent rent, for example, rose 0.27%, the biggest increase since January last year and a further clear sign that the downward pressure on rents – 40% of the core – is fading. Physicians’ services prices jumped 2.0% month-to-month, completing the adjustment implied by the 3.75% increase in Medicare reimbursement rates, effective January 1. But airline fares plunged 5.1%, despite soaring jet fuel prices, and hotel room rates dropped 2.3%, in contrast to the increase in room rates reported by STR, Inc., which tracks key hotel performance metrics. These declines can’t last. Finally, used auto prices fell by 0.9%, the fourth-straight big decline, widening the gap between the CPI measure and auction prices still further. Again, this does not seem sustainable.""Ian Sheperdson, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon    Rising inflation is closely watched by bitcoin (BTC) traders because a growing number of investors see the largest cryptocurrency as a hedge against higher prices.

In an announcement Wednesday, DCG – which is also the parent company of CoinDesk – said it will be buying GBTC shares on the open market.

In addition, the shares, which had long traded at a premium to to the price of bitcoin held in the trust, recently started trading at a discount.  Repurchasing is a common tool among companies who are trying to increase the price of those shares by simultaneously creating demand while decreasing the number of shares outstanding.  In recent trading, GBTC shares were up 4.34% to $51.25.  DCG said plans to use cash on hand to fund any purchases, which it said will be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  “The actual timing, amount, and value of share purchases will depend entirely upon a number of factors, including the levels of cash available, price, and prevailing market conditions,” said the company.

Launching today, the cryptocurrency is backed one-to-one by the New Zealand dollar and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain by Blockchain Labs. $NZDs' code utilizes a framework developed by Coinbase and Circle-founded Centre group.      ""$NZDs combines the stability and value of the New Zealand Dollar with the intrinsic utility of cryptocurrency to allow arbitrage, remittance, and digital payments, while positioning the New Zealand Dollar as a prominent participant in the global digital asset economy,"" the company said.

The token sale netted over $6 million, according to Shyft co-founder Juan Aja Aguinaco.      Bringing the brave new world of crypto in line with the rest of the financial system, particularly regarding anti-money laundering (AML) rules, is a complex problem that Shyft is set on solving – in a decentralized fashion.      The Shyft Network, which goes live later this month, is a public blockchain based on Ethereum, which also has its version of “gas” in the form of the shyft native token, which participants must purchase to use the network.      As such, Shyft’s latest token sale is not so much an “investment” in the speculative sense, said Shyft co-founder Joseph Weinberg, but rather a sale for strategic purchasers.      “After building this thing for three years, this is the pre-launch strategic token sale,” Weinberg said in an interview. “Shyft is a utility token that's used on the shared decentralized database in order for VASPs [virtual asset service providers] to discover each other, and to meet the costs of security and operations for the Shyft core protocol.”      June of this year will see the global AML watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), review progress made by the crypto industry to meet obligatory data-sharing requirements accompanying transactions. The regulation is colloquially known as the “travel rule.”      ""We have been working really hard to get everything out, and have been really fortunate to work with a lot of the big global exchanges,” Weinberg said, mentioning Bitfinex, Huobi and Binance. “They are saying they need to start implementing and get this moving across all of these smaller exchanges.”      Oleg Golubov, a partner at CoinFund, said Shyft’s decentralized approach to the travel rule problem was a natural fit for the crypto industry.      “Shyft’s early traction powerfully showcases the advantages of this approach for identity data management and transfer solutions,” Golubov said in a statement.    Read more: FATF Compliance Effort Adds Huobi, Bitfinex and Tether to Governance Task Force    Above and beyond applying the FATF’s recommendations to digital asset firms, Shyft is also working on ways to make the growing world of decentralized finance (DeFi) a better fit for institutional players.      “The Shyft platform can bring some of the fastest-growing and creative segments of crypto to institutional audiences,” GSR Markets co-founder Cristian Gil said in a statement, adding:    “We are looking forward to providing strategic backing, and building compliant infrastructure for the DeFi ecosystem.

ETH put in a relative bottom versus BTC around the end of 2019. The near 700% increase in ETH versus BTC's 500% rise over the past year could reflect investor enthusiasm for decentralized finance (DeFi), which seeks to transform traditional financial products in a decentralized manner and largely sits atop the Ethereum blockchain.    ETH has underperformed BTC over the past month, after the launch of CME ETH futures in early February of this year.  A similar situation occurred in BTC, which underperformed ETH after its CME futures launch in late 2017.

ETH put in a relative bottom versus BTC around the end of 2019 as investors took notice of the booming DeFi space.

In an announcement Wednesday, open-source cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions provider Komodo said its ""DogeDEX"" went live on March 1, and has already seen over 3,000 downloads. The service is powered by the AtomicDEX engine and is available through both desktop and mobile apps.      Atomic swaps are a way for users to directly exchange cryptocurrencies without need for a third party such as a centralized exchange.      The DEX also acts as a non-custodial wallet allowing users to store their holdings on the platform. Komodo said its engineers are also in the process of building a fiat on-ramp in the next month, so cryptocurrency purchases can be made directly on DogeDEX.      “Crypto, like the internet, is so much about community and dogecoin is the currency of the internet. Decentralized exchanges and non-custodial wallets are a few of our specialties and we want to enable [dogecoin's] considerable fanbase to trade crypto with the very latest technology – Atomic Swaps,” said Komodo CTO Kadan Stadelmann.

42433893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP62Hh,1615379400,Valid Points: Why Ether Doesn’t Need a Supply Cap to Hedge Against Inflation,"A common misperception about crypto assets is that all coins without a hard supply limit are inflationary currencies, meaning they are assets that decline in market value over time.      Bitcoin, with its 21 million BTC supply cap, is often touted as the ultimate “hedge against inflation.” This is because increasing demand for the crypto asset will never cause its total supply to expand beyond 21 million coins. No matter the BTC market price over time, issuance of new bitcoins is programmed to decrease every four years through events called “halvings.”      This is a comforting characteristic of bitcoin for individuals and businesses who distrust the management of fiat currencies at the hand of state actors. Countries with a history of rampant inflation are case studies in how the purchasing power of an asset can wither away through sudden and exorbitant increases to money supply.      While setting a finite supply is one way to protect against inflationary market forces, it’s not the only way. There are other crypto assets such as ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum, with monetary policies aimed at curbing inflation over time without relying on a hard supply cap.    How a fixed issuance schedule affects ether supply    Like bitcoin, ether has a fixed issuance schedule. For every block produced on the network, Ethereum issues two new coins into circulation. No matter the number of active users, number of transactions or the market price of ether, the total supply is programmed to increase gradually.      So long as demand for ether outpaces its steady supply growth, it will not be an inflationary currency whose value depreciates over time.      A caveat to this statement is that, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s monetary policy is in flux. Ethereum does have an issuance schedule of 2 ETH/block today. However, this wasn’t always the case.      Two years ago, the fixed issuance schedule of ether was 3 ETH/block. Two years before that the schedule was 5 ETH/block.      While the block reward issuance schedule is subject to change, an important takeaway from these updates is that Ethereum developers have never increased the ether supply issuance. They’ve consistently aimed to reduce it and, in fact, plan to do so even further through Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 and Ethereum 2.0.    Ether's supply, EIP 1559 and Ethereum 2.0    While ether does not have a fixed supply cap, it may potentially have a fee-burning mechanism that takes a portion of coin supply out of circulation.      EIP 1559 was originally proposed to make transaction fees on Ethereum more predictable for users. The proposal introduces a base fee for all transactions that is automatically calculated based on network activity and once paid, immediately burned.      Depending on the activity of the network, EIP 1559 could burn more ether through base fees than the amount of new ether issued into circulation through miner block rewards. While this is not a guaranteed outcome, it is a highly likely one, judging by the rise of transaction activity on Ethereum.      What’s more, Ethereum is transitioning to a more cost-effective and energy-efficient model for blockchain security known as proof-of-stake (PoS). This transition to PoS, dubbed Ethereum 2.0, is expected to reduce the issuance rate of ether from roughly 5% to less than 1% per annum.      With a near-zero percent increase in the total supply of ether under PoS, there is even greater potential for asset demand to outstrip its growth in supply. In this case, the value of ether would increase over time.      These disinflationary forces on the supply schedule of ether – a fixed issuance schedule, EIP 1559 and Ethereum 2.0 – both current and projected, suggest that, like bitcoin, there could be a case made for its potential as a store-of-value asset.    Pulse check: Eth 2.0 milestones    If you’re new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about terminology used throughout this newsletter.      Multiple milestones were reached this past week on Ethereum 2.0.      For the first time since launch, the queue of pending validators reached zero. As of Tuesday, March 9, this metric still trends below 900 which means that any new validators that join the network will be activated within 24 hours.      In addition, the amount of ETH staked on Eth 2.0 has crossed the 3% threshold of total circulating coin supply. This means that 3% of all ether in existence will not be available for use on decentralized applications, for trading or any other purpose other than staking on Eth 2.0 until a future point in time.      Last but not least, Zelda proposed her first Ethereum 2.0 block on Monday, March 8. Block proposals are becoming increasingly rare occurrences for validators on the network because the probability of being assigned this responsibility declines as the number of active validators increases.      As one out of 107,277 validators, Zelda had a miniscule probability of proposing a block but after over 4,500 block attestations, Zelda made her first proposal at Epoch 21,846 Slot 699,082.      Zelda is now ranked in the top 15% of Eth 2.0 validators by rewards earned and averages a daily income of roughly 0.0075 ETH, or $13.76.    Validated takes  A DeFi divorce?

In a series of tweets Tuesday, Garlinghouse said the companies have now opted to ""work together"" with YouTube to ""prevent, detect and take down these scams.""      In April, Ripple sued the video streaming giant for failing to effectively police against scams involving the cryptocurrency XRP, resulting in monetary damage to users and reputational harm to Ripple. The lawsuit focused on the “XRP Giveaway” frauds, which aim to trick victims into believing that if they send some amount of XRP they will receive a greater amount in return.      In his tweets, Garlinghouse went on to add, “Social platforms are starting to acknowledge their role in allowing crypto scams to persist and recognize the need to be part of the solution.”      Read more: Ripple, MoneyGram to ‘Wind Down’ Partnership      Details of the agreement between Ripple and YouTube were not disclosed.

42433887,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP62Bh,1615376940,Bitcoin Hits Two-Week High Above $55K Ahead of US Inflation Data,"Bitcoin continues to trade higher Wednesday, shrugging off impending U.S. inflation data that could amplify fears of an early unwinding of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.      The top cryptocurrency by market value reached a two-week high of $55,822 earlier today after a five-day winning streak that saw prices claw their way back from below $47,000.      Scheduled for release at 08:30 a.m. ET today, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to show the cost of living in the world's largest economy rose 0.4% in February from 0.3% in January. In annualized terms, the CPI is forecast to have risen to 1.7% from 1.4% in January.      The data could influence bitcoin's price, given the cryptocurrency is considered a hedge against inflation and monetary and fiscal policy imprudence. While a bigger-than-expected jump in inflation would strengthen bitcoin's long-term bullish case, the cryptocurrency's immediate reaction could be bearish.      That's because an above-forecast CPI would validate the narrative that the cocktail of monetary and fiscal stimulus, alongside an economic rebound, is stoking inflation. That could lead to an early tightening of stimulus by the Fed and another leg higher in Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar.      Treasury yields spiked in the last week of February, lifting the dollar and pushing bitcoin and stocks lower, as investors priced in the likelihood of the Fed's first interest rate hike occurring at the end of 2022 rather than 2024 in the wake of rising inflation expectations and signs of economic recovery.      In other words, the markets were expecting some pickup in inflation two weeks ago. As such, bitcoin and other assets may not see much price action if the growth in the CPI matches estimates.      From a technical analysis standpoint, the cryptocurrency is looking bullish, having cleared a key price hurdle.      Bitcoin has flipped resistance at $52,666 (March 3 high) into support.      The MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has risen back above zero, indicating a bull revival. The 5- and 10-day price averages are again trending north, indicating a bullish setup.      The immediate resistance is seen at $58,332 (record high), followed by the psychological level of $60,000.      Also read: JPMorgan to Launch ‘Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket’ of Bitcoin Proxy Stocks      Support at $50,000 may come into play if the CPI beats estimates by a big margin, unsettling traditional markets.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $54,790, representing a 1.6% gain on a 24-hour basis. The 10-year yield is seen at 1.56%, having risen by more than 50 basis points to above 1.6% in the past five weeks.

With continued institutional buying, however, Bitcoin was able to reclaim $53,600. While current price levels are still off all-time highs, it has mostly recovered losses from late February. ...",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reclaims-1-trillion-market-cap-whats-in-store/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-reclaims-1-trillion-market-cap-whats-in-store,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png

42389648,6HUmrVESdCCDHrrhgaSWIB,1615337597,"Grayscale, Firm Behind Leading Bitcoin Trust, Is Hiring ETF Specialists","Digital asset management firm Grayscale might be on the cusp of trying to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to new job postings.  The nine postings strongly suggest the New York-based firm is planning an ETF business. The listings are undated but the firm tweeted a link to its jobs board Tuesday evening. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.  A bitcoin ETF is a retail-accessible trading vehicle that can give both individuals and institutions exposure to the bitcoin market without having to hold bitcoin itself. The industry has long clamored for an ETF, with various firms filing applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as far back as 2013. Grayscale has previously not applied for an ETF.  The job postings all refer to Grayscale’s “ETF business,” though the firm does not currently offer any exchange-traded products. It does offer a number of cryptocurrency trusts, bitcoin being chief among them, that trade at a premium to the spot price.  Notably, it would appear that these potential ETFs would not be limited to bitcoin vehicles.  New business line?  One of the postings is for an ETF Creation & Redemption Specialist, who would be responsible for managing pricing sources and understanding “how to create a ‘basket’ of digital assets for inclusion in an ETF.”  Another posting calls for an ETF Market Maker Relationship Manager, who would be tasked with developing new relationships with market makers while maintaining existing ones for the ETF business.  Candidates for this position would need to have, “Experience in interacting with FINRA, SEC, NYSE, NYSE ARCA, CBOE, and/or other securities exchanges, either directly or in collaboration with Compliance and Legal staff,” the job posting said.  Grayscale’s existing trusts do not trade on the NYSE/CBOE platforms but are traded by retail investors in over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  New reality  The job openings come weeks after the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Ethereum Trust both began trading at discounts to the spot price of bitcoin, reversing years of trading at a premium.  Canada is poised to deliver its third bitcoin ETF this week, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve one.  Industry experts believe that a bitcoin ETF, which the SEC has repeatedly rejected, might finally see the light of day in the U.S. this year, noting both the Canadian approvals as well as new leadership at the securities regulator.
