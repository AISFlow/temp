42404802,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkhRv,1593204302,Vanguard to Go Live on Symbiont's Blockchain Platform for Foreign Exchange in Q3 2020,"Mutual fund giant Vanguard has completed another blockchain pilot that aims to change the risk profile of foreign exchange (FX) transactions.      The Valley Forge, Pa.-based investment firm ran the pilot on Symbiont’s Assembly blockchain with participation from State Street, BNY Mellon and investment firm Franklin Templeton. Vanguard and Franklin Templeton acted as dealer banks and State Street and BNY Mellon acted as counterparty banks as well as custodians, said Symbiont’s foreign exchange lead, Joe Ziccarelli.      Symbiont believes the foreign exchange platform will go into production in the third quarter of 2020, Ziccarelli said.      “The pilot has helped to prove out some of the capabilities that address areas of uncompensated risk in collateral-linked instruments like FX forward contracts,” Melissa Kennedy, a Vanguard spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement. “Over the next twelve months, we will continue to build out capabilities on the platform with our partners.”      The FX announcement follows a digital asset-backed securities pilot Vanguard announced the completion of earlier this month. The FX pilot’s completion also shows that the Assembly blockchain could quickly become a viable option for many large enterprises engaged in FX, Ziccarelli said.      Read more: Mutual Fund Giant Vanguard Wraps Phase 1 of Digital Asset-Backed Securities Pilot      According to Ziccarelli, the pilot proves a use case for Assembly that applies to all foreign exchange contracts including swaps and outrights, which is a FX transaction where two parties agree to buy or sell a certain amount of currency at a predetermined rate in the future.      Buy-side and sell-side firms use foreign exchange for hedging and speculative purposes. The market is governed by contracts that serve as credit agreements which specify how the over-the-counter (OTC) market should exchange the collateral used for these transactions.      The calculations and collateral movement often take two or three days to process.      “[Currently] you are two or three days removed from being protected against the sort of underlying credit risk that’s associated with those transactions,” Ziccarelli said. “Now you can be protected in as soon as the last calculation period.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/26/vanguard-to-go-live-on-symbionts-blockchain-platform-for-foreign-exchange-in-q3-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53ab2b78db73b2d77c752b8b80e52eb1eb9e435b-1500x1147.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404808,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkhWq,1593203918,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Still Stuck in a Rut, Trading Below $10K","After the largest options expiry in history, bitcoin ended its fifth week of bouncing around the $9,000s price range.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,180 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping almost 1% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Friday (8:00 p.m. Thursday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,300 on spot exchanges such as Bitstamp. After putting in the Friday high of $9,291, bitcoin failed to rally from Thursday’s sell-off to $8,990 from $9,650 and continued to trade hands between $9,000 and $9,200.      Trading volume on Thursday was only slightly lower than Wednesday, the two largest trading days for Coinbase spot bitcoin volume at $126 million and $124 million respectively. For Friday, volume on Coinbase is at $84 million, according to Skew.      Friday’s slight drop in volume is unsurprising given its price action since early Thursday. In addition to the large bitcoin options expiry, Thursday is statistically the most volatile weekday with the largest trading volume, according to research by cryptocurrency data firm Market Science. Friday volume and volatility generally tapers off, leading into a quiet weekend for the crypto market.      See also: A Key Thesis for Bitcoin’s Long-Term Bull Market Just Got a Knock      Bitcoin continues to outperform the S&P 500, and is 21 percentage points higher for the year to date over the leading equities index. But the tight correlation between bitcoin and traditional markets is unlikely to break anytime soon. “Bitcoin will likely remain highly correlated with stocks until a more stable environment is established,” said Joseph Todaro, managing partner at Blocktown Capital.      To some analysts, the bellwether cryptocurrency’s inability to break above $10,000 signals a potential loss of bullish momentum. After multiple attempts, Bitcoin not breaking $10,000 “shows how weak it is at the moment,” said João Leite, lead analyst at cryptocurrency research firm Blockfyre, speaking of buying interest in bitcoin.      Meanwhile, major stock indices are mostly down on Friday.      The Nikkei 225 of publicly traded companies in Japan opened 0.6% higher than Thursday’s close and gained almost 0.4% during Friday’s trading hours. The index’s gains come despite U.S. markets’ fears over an ongoing spike in coronavirus cases.      The FTSE 100 index in Europe dropped roughly more than 1% from its daily open at the time of publishing. Since Monday, the index dropped roughly 2 percent.      The U.S. S&P 500 index fell more than 2% on Friday at the time of publication. A recent surge in coronavirus cases in many states is likely the cause for the market giving back gains from Thursday, when the index climbed 1.3 percent.      See also: Summer 2020 Is Funding Season for Open-Source Bitcoin Development      Ether, (ETH) the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up down 1.5% Friday, trading around $229 and after dropping 10% in 24 hours on Wednesday and staying below $235 on Thursday, according to trading on BitMEX.      The ether sell=off and relatively flat price action in the second half of the week could be the beginning of a correction amidst the on-going speculative fervor over “yield farming” in the decentralized finance ecosystem of cryptocurrency applications.      According to Darren Lau, market research analyst at CoinGecko, it seems like “everyone is making money right now, and it has been easy.” But to him, it’s getting “too easy” and a correction could be imminent.  It could be more than a price drop, however, Lau added. If the “yield farming” trend fades as the price of ether drops, “how many farms are going to collapse too,” he asked. Answering his own question, Lau said he expects “a bigger chain reaction than Black Thursday” due to the close interlocked nature of every decentralized finance application.    Other markets    Digital assets relevant to decentralized finance investors were mostly higher on Friday. Augur (REP) climbed 3%, synthetix (SNX) climbed 3.3%, nexo (NEXO) climbed nearly 5% and 0x (ZRX) climbed more than 6 percent, according to market data from Messari.

42404800,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkhNz,1593201795,DeFi Platform Opyn Launches Put Options on Compound Token,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound saw its governance token, COMP, skyrocket in price when it launched last week. Now, decentralized options marketplace Opyn has launched put options on COMP that will provide a safety net of sorts by helping holders mitigate some of the risk should COMP’s fortunes take a turn for the worse in the next few days.      ""We’re excited to launch @compoundfinance COMP put options! You can protect yourself if COMP falls to $150 or lower before July 3rd,"" Opyn's official handle tweeted early Friday. Several hours later, Universal Market Access (UMA) announced it is creating the ability to synthetically short COMP on its decentralized platform. Opyn closed on over $2 million in funding this past week.      A put option is a derivative contract that gives purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, call options represent a right to buy, With options, traders can make bearish or bullish bets at various price levels called strikes that expire in different months.      Opyn is offering a put option on COMP at the strike price of $150, which will expire on July 3.    How it works    A put option with a $150 strike can be bought by paying a U.S. dollar-denominated premium, currently $3.76. In return, the purchaser will receive oTokens, which represent the right to sell COMP on or before expiry at $150. oTokens can be bought and sold on an exchange like Uniswap at any time before expiry.      Meanwhile, the option seller offering insurance will deposit 150 USDC, a dollar-backed stablecoin, as collateral to ensure there is no liquidation risk.      Read more: Coinbase Lists Compound’s COMP Token for Retail Crypto Traders      The put option on COMP is an American-styled option, meaning the buyer can exercise their right to sell COMP at $150 anytime before July 3. European options can be exercised only on expiry.      While exercising the put option, the purchaser will send oTokens back to Opyn along with COMP (because oToken is the ""right to sell COMP at 150"") and will receive 150 USDC in return.      As such, one could say the put option essentially represents the right to sell COMP and buy USDC.      In such an instance, the max loss for the buyer is the premium paid, which is the maximum money the seller can make. “Keep the entirety of your premium as well as your collateral as long as the asset stays above the strike price until expiry,” Opyn tweeted.      Even if COMP’s price drops to single digits or even zero, the holder of the put option would still be able to sell COMP at $150.    Speculation    “Opyn’s put option can be used by traders who do not hold COMP but want to speculate on the DeFi token,” Anton Cheng, developer at Opyn.      A trader with a bearish view on COMP can just buy put options at the available strike price of $150. If COMP drops, the oTokens will appreciate in value and traders can sell them on Uniswap.      Read more: Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive      At press time, COMP is trading at $250, according to Opyn.co. The governance token went live for trading on June 18 and traded near $80 on the first day. In the following three days, its price surged by 500% to $380, triggering a frenzy in the DeFi space.      Such strong rallies are often followed by sudden price pullbacks.

42404792,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkhH6,1593195307,Mapping the Future of the SEC (There's a Nonzero Chance Hester Peirce Takes Over),"The future of the U.S. federal securities regulator, and perhaps the direction of cryptocurrency policy, is up in the air.      Last week, President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton to the post of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, asking Congress to approve the one-time corporate lawyer to become one of the nation’s most powerful financial crimes prosecutors.      If – and that is a big if – he is confirmed to become the new U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the president will likely appoint one of the remaining SEC commissioners as acting chair until Clayton’s successor is confirmed.      Traditionally, the acting chair is the senior-most commissioner who belongs to the same party as the president, said Jerry Brito, Executive Director of industry advocacy group Coin Center.      In this case, that would be Commissioner Hester Peirce, known to many as “Crypto Mom” for her open-minded stance on the technology.      In other words, there is a possible timeline ahead where three of the top U.S. financial regulators – the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – would be headed by industry-friendly faces. Already, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert has taken steps to bring some regulatory clarity to crypto, approving ether futures and defining certain regulatory questions. Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks, who began the year at Coinbase, proposed a federal payments charter for crypto exchanges just weeks into his then-deputy role.      Calm down, though. “Possible” does not mean “probable.” It does not mean “likely.” And it sure doesn’t mean “guaranteed.”      For one thing, Clayton’s nomination is contentious, and he might well not be confirmed to the new role, for reasons explained below.      Further, the succession pattern Brito described is “not automatic,” he said. “There’s no rule that makes it automatic. That’s just custom.”      It is also possible Commissioner Elad Roisman could get the nod. Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, a Democrat, is unlikely to become acting chair, owing to her party affiliation.      At stake is the potential future for crypto regulation. Clayton has at various points in time expressed concerns about market manipulation and maturity, security and consumer protection. Peirce, in contrast, has advocated for a more relaxed approach, and has come out in favor of exchange-traded funds (of which Clayton’s SEC most definitely is not) and a safe harbor for crypto token projects to build before having to consider securities laws.    D.C. Drama    U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced June 19 that Clayton would take over for the now-former U.S. Attorney, Geoffrey Berman, who Barr said was stepping down. Berman immediately announced he was not stepping down, to which Barr responded that President Trump had fired him, to which the president said he hadn’t.      Ultimately Berman resigned on June 20.      A spokesperson for Clayton did not respond to a request for comment. However, Clayton said during previously scheduled congressional testimony he did not believe the nomination process would distract him from running the SEC.      He said he put his name forward for the U.S. Attorney role around June 12, a week before Barr announced the nomination, but that he would remain “fully committed” to the SEC until the Senate moved on his nomination.      “It was entirely my idea. It's something I've been thinking about for several months as a continuation of my public service,” he said. ""It's a position that's very attractive to me.""      Seth Bloom, a longtime general counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, told CoinDesk that Democratic senators are unlikely to approve moving Clayton’s nomination to the Senate floor.      It’s “very unlikely” Clayton is confirmed, he said. The sentiment was echoed by two other Washington, D.C., insiders, one of whom pointed out there are few legislative days left before this year’s presidential election.      “We’re not talking a lot of days before the election,” said one lobbyist, who works with lawmakers and asked for their identity to be withheld. “Congress isn’t going to be in town very much. It’s July and some of September.”      If Trump wins the election, then “we can have a real conversation around that.”    Blue slip    Clayton’s nomination might also be held up by the Senate’s “blue slip” practice.      Traditionally, when a candidate is nominated to a position requiring U.S. Senate confirmation, the senators representing the position’s home state turn in blue slips expressing an opinion of the candidate to the committee overseeing the initial process, in this case the Senate Judiciary Committee.      “The senators aren’t likely to turn it in, they already said they wouldn’t,” Bloom said, referring to New York's Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats. “The nomination is stymied right now unless they can convince Schumer and Gillibrand to turn in those slips.”      Another D.C. insidersaid Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) could ignore the blue slip tradition, but he has already said he wouldn’t and doing so “would be highly controversial.”      Clayton hasn’t even been formally nominated. While Barr said the president intends to nominate the SEC chair, the White House still needs to prepare the paperwork.      Typically the White House conducts a background check in preparation for formally nominating a candidate, though this might be easier given Clayton was vetted for his SEC role, the insider said.      Other objections could include the fact that Clayton has never been a prosecutor, though he told Congress he oversees more than 1,000 enforcement agents at the SEC.      Chester Spatt, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon and former chief economist at the SEC, told CoinDesk that Clayton does have experience managing complex financial issues and large teams dealing with these issues, both traits he could apply to running the U.S. Attorney’s office.    What if?    Back to the SEC: In the (by no means guaranteed) scenario where Clayton vacates the chairmanship, a full-time successor would need to be confirmed by the Senate, after being nominated by the president.      Only one of the existing commissioners can be named acting chair; the president cannot designate a non-commissioner, such as an SEC staffer, to the post.      “Whether he’ll nominate someone in the near term while [Clayton's] nomination is pending is unclear to me,” Carnegie Mellon’s Spatt said.      He told CoinDesk past and present commissioners and senior officials are likely places to look for a nominee to serve as the new chairperson, though that isn’t a formal requirement.      Clayton himself was not an SEC staffer or commissioner prior to his nomination as chairman, Spatt noted.      “There could be somebody who’s ... running a securities practice in a law firm, or who has a major leadership role in a Wall Street firm or who has experience at the [Federal Reserve],” he said. “These are all places that would be natural places for a president to try and identify a potential chair.”      Brito noted Peirce had recently been renominated for a second term at the Commission, meaning she will have to be confirmed regardless. If she happens to be named Chair after her Commissioner confirmation hearing, she will likely have to sit for a second hearing.      “That doesn’t tell you anything about whether that makes her more or less likely to be appointed by the President to chair so don’t read anything into that but that’s just a fact that she’s going to go through her confirmation again in the next couple weeks,” Brito said.      (Also, it’s actually possible the president doesn’t have the legal authority to name the SEC chair, but it’s just now accepted as tradition, tweeted Coin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh after looking into how that role came about.)",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/26/mapping-the-future-of-the-sec-theres-a-nonzero-chance-hester-peirce-takes-over,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Rowland Marcus Andrade on Thursday, claiming he misled investors while raising funds for a 2017 and 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) for AML Bitcoin, a crypto token that was supposed to be designed to be compliant with anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.      Alongside Andrade, notorious D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff was also indicted, though he has already pled guilty and faces potential jail time, according to Bloomberg.      In a video interview Thursday night, Andrade told CoinDesk the charges were bogus and that he is a “victim of government corruption.”      ""Abramoff was working with the government and tried to get me to sell my company for $100 Million,” Andrade wrote in a direct message from the @AMLBitcoin Twitter handle. “Then they demanded that I pay Abramoff $40M dollars so he could spread the wealth,"" he wrote. ""If I had no technology that is completed right now and trading, then why were they trying to force me to sell it? This is just an attempt by the government to destroy my company since I refused to play ball.""      Read more: DOJ Indicts Founder of Anti-Money Laundering Bitcoin Project for Money Laundering      The project went live earlier this year, he said, pointing to LBank Exchange, which appears to be trading the asset. Andrade further claimed the U.S. government is trying to create its own cryptocurrency based on the AML Bitcoin project, pointing to his legal filings for evidence.      ""The U.S. government is now trying to create there [sic] own compliant digital currency based off my technology and they clearly see me as a threat,"" he said. (While there are private efforts currently underway to create a U.S. central bank digital currency, i.e. a digital dollar, the government itself has yet to publicly advocate for a tokenized version of the greenback.)    $5.6M raised    The SEC claimed Andrade raised $5.6 million from 2,400 investors, falling well short of the $100 million he originally tried to raise.      About $1 million of this came from a single investor, identified by the DOJ as “Victim One.” In a court filing related to a separate but ongoing case, Andrade claims the U.S. government manufactured the victim.      “It was the government who contacted ‘Victim One’ and suggested to him that he had been defrauded,” the filing said.      CoinDesk spoke with Victim One on Thursday. The money manager confirmed he was informed of the allegations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but said he “was a victim of fraud.”      A friend introduced him to the project and his employer was not involved, Victim One told CoinDesk, requesting anonymity due to concerns about professional blowback. He also confirmed he was unaware of the fraud allegations against AML Bitcoin until the FBI called him.      Victim One indicated he might pursue civil charges against Andrade at some future point.    'Victim of corruption'    For his part, Andrade was defiant.      ""The SEC and the DOJ have the evidence already that proves my innocence. That is why in various filings I had no choice but to make the documents public,"" Andrade wrote in one of many DMs, referring to a separate, ongoing case. ""This was aggravating the DOJ because I was ripping there [sic] case apart. I am the victim of government corruption and we will fight this.""      He told CoinDesk he had reached out to the SEC's FinHub division, the regulator’s fintech division that acts as a point of contact for startups, to confirm his token was not a security. He said the regulator did not respond.      ""I did not care [if] they said we were a security because I was willing to make any changes the SEC required,"" he said. ""Instead of helping, they took my documents and came after me.""      Read more: FBI Used Bitcoin Trail to Catch Russian Rapper Accused of Money Laundering      According to the March DOJ filing, U.S. officials had previously filed to seize ""one parcel of real property"" owned at least in part by Andrade and his wife.

The discovery sent Buolamwini on a mission. She founded the Algorithmic Justice League and started doing research that builds awareness about biases in software algorithms. One paper she co-authored with Timnit Gebru, the technical co-lead of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team at Google, found facial-analysis software had an error rate of 34.7% for dark-skinned women versus just 0.8% for light-skinned men.      Facial recognition is the tip of the iceberg. Biases are inherently present in all forms of artificial intelligence algorithms, those digital machines that increasingly run our world.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Over the years, an extreme lack of diversity in computer engineering has left white men with a disproportionately large influence over all software design. Unconscious bias – now, finally, a topic of great discussion across the United States – means they end up creating products to serve the needs of people like them, not necessarily those of others.      This is a vital issue for the algorithm-dependent cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. If this technology is to have a broad impact on the world, it must engage a wide population.      If bitcoin, for example, is to become a global currency, if it is to become a monetary standard accepted by people of vastly different backgrounds, it must be accessible and valuable for a full cross-section of those groups. And if distributed ledger technologies end up providing the data architecture in “smart cities” or enabling our health systems to manage privacy-protected data for fighting pandemics, we better make sure these platforms don’t discriminate against one group or another.    Diversifying the dev teams    The need for diversity in this industry was the central theme in a virtual symposium held last Friday by Cleve Mesidor, founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, which coincided with the Juneteenth emancipation holiday. The panelists’ message, according to CoinDesk reporter Nathan DiCamillo, was that while crypto can help citizens opt out of “a racist financial system,” for that to happen “Black people and people of color must be part of the development of the technology.”      Calls for diversity like these are often met with retorts such as “bitcoin doesn’t care about the color of your skin"" or “blockchains are based on math, not flawed human processes.” It’s a naive perspective. The code for the protocols that dictate each blockchain’s rules, and for the smart contracts and apps built on top of them, are written by people, not by some universal law of nature. And, in the blockchain community even more so than in tech broadly, those people are predominantly white men.      Don’t think, either, that blockchain technology is protected against bias by its preference for open-source development. A codebase can be fully accessible but if there isn’t a sufficiently wide group of skilled people reviewing and contributing to it, biases will persist.      It’s true, this technology has the potential to help people overturn some of society’s ingrained, structural injustices. As investor and active #BlackLivesMatter supporter Mike Novogratz says, “Crypto is about systems change.” But a decentralized system is only as inclusive as the platform on which it is built. There’s nothing intrinsically fair about a blockchain.    Action plans    A key problem is the digital divide. Impoverished communities of color worldwide have significantly reduced access to the information tools needed to participate in blockchain and crypto development.      Addressing these imbalances is vital for crypto adoption. While it’s exciting to see usage rates grow in places like Nigeria and Venezuela during the COVID-19 crisis, we must also recognize the painful circumstances leading these people to bitcoin and stablecoins: economic breakdown, severe dollar shortages and failed public health systems. And in the grand scheme of things, those newly increased numbers are a tiny proportion of the total developing world population. We have a long way to go before we bridge the crypto divide.      A natural starting point is education. While a number of interest groups have sprung up to support the expansion of blockchain knowledge among women and people of color, the industry must do more. Funds should be dedicated to high schools and colleges serving underprivileged students about the technology and the opportunities it poses. Online courses and self-training programs should be designed for and delivered to minorities. And, of course, crypto companies should also be hiring from those communities.      Equally important, media organizations like ours and people like me who work at them must learn to identify, address and fight against our own implicit biases. The stories we write are vital to how information is absorbed about this technology. We need many more of them to be for, about and by people of color and women.      Like all media, crypto newsrooms and their management must confront this diversity imperative head on. CoinDesk is no exception. Only with a broad spectrum of voices across race, gender, geography and economic background can we properly expose the world to the opportunities and challenges posed by the technology we cover.    It’s all about the debt    What a difference two months of COVID-19 makes.      This week, the International Monetary Fund made an interim update to the quarterly World Economic Outlook Report it originally released in April. The headline item: The IMF now expects a massive, unprecedented 4.9% decline in world economic output for 2020, versus the 3% shrinkage it previously predicted. That’s an additional loss of $1.67 trillion from what the World Bank estimated as the size of the global economy in 2019. You have to go back to the Great Depression for economic malaise on this kind of scale.      What’s just as striking, and arguably more worrying, was the accompanied forecasts for government debt as a result of this downturn. The IMF now expects net government borrowing in advanced countries to spike to 10.9% of GDP in 2020 from 3% in 2019 and that it will drop back to 5.4% in 2021.      The problem with governments’ ballooning debt levels is not the amount borrowed per se. It’s the interdependent nature of it and the geopolitical ramifications.      Unlike a person or a company, a country cannot go bankrupt. It’s a permanent entity with exclusive taxation powers and mostly exclusive money-printing power. (The latter is why proponents of Modern Monetary Theory, like new author Stephanie Kelton, argue fiscal deficits should not be viewed as a problem.) Indeed, governments right now have a compelling case – even an obligation – to borrow at low interest rates and fund the social distributions needed to keep their economy’s income levels afloat. Viewed in the isolation of one country and one government, this is one of those no-brainer moments when you focus on the problem at hand and worry about the cost later.      The problem that MMT proponents seem to gloss over is the financial system is globalized – and overly dependent on the U.S. dollar – while politics is domesticized. Governments are accountable to their citizens, not to the foreign entities that own much of their debt and that measure their wealth in a foreign currency.      Governments will naturally choose the former over the latter, helping out domestic borrowers at the cost of foreign savers by debasing their currency. And if they’re the only government with such a problem, the fallout can be limited to those foreign entities. But what happens when every major government is in the same situation? This is why some fear the nightmare of a global currency war and debt spiral, one that could seriously undermine the dollar, the currency upon which this international financial system is based.      Some people see the need for a coordinated, global debt jubilee (or forgiveness). But getting everyone to agree on the terms is almost impossible to imagine. Another outcome: The world gravitates to a new international currency system. The question is whether that happens in a controlled, top-down manner, with governments agreeing to a new framework, a la the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, or through a more unpredictable bottom-up, private-sector-led monetary revolution. The technology is coming into place for that revolution.    The Global Town Hall    ECHOES OF 2008. If there’s a reason to doubt the IMF’s forecast that advanced country debt-to-GDP levels will start normalizing in 2021, it’s that there’s another shoe to drop: private debt. Unlike the financial crisis of 2008, where the culprit was retail sector lending to homeowners, this time the private sector risk lies with mountains of corporate debt accumulated over the past, low-interest rate decade. Now, as The Wall Street Journal detailed Thursday, that debt load is combining with the economic stress of COVID-19 to trigger a “wave of bankruptcies.” The structure of a lot of that debt is defined by something called a CLO, or collateralized loan obligation. Sound familiar? It’s very much like a CDO, a collateralized debt obligation, the financial instrument that sat at the heart of the prior financial crisis. It has many people worried about another systemic collapse. If that happens, there’ll need to be another round of bailouts. And if that happens, governments will need to take on even more debt.      ROME NO LONGER. For the past century, the center of global financial power lay not in Washington but to its north, in New York. Because so much global trade and financial market activity has been denominated in dollars, international payments and capital flows inevitably must pass through correspondent banks located on Wall Street. That gives those banks, and the regulators who oversee them, great power as global gatekeepers. With a say-so over what money goes where, New York state regulators wield this power to impose sanctions on countries deemed by U.S. intelligence to be rogue states and to determine what classes of activity are worthy of vital banking services. It’s why the New York Department of Financial Services is not just your average state regulator. Its influence extends beyond New York’s borders, not only into all other 49 states but overseas as well.      But on the fifth anniversary of the NYDFS’ controversial “BitLicense,” it’s worth reflecting on the agency’s failure to extend its regulatory power over the cryptocurrency industry to a wider landscape. CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson did just that this week, noting how the then-NYDFS superintendent. Benjamin Lawsky. had predicted in 2014 the BitLicense would become a standard that other states’ regulators would follow. This assumption, founded on the hubris of New York’s outsized global status, proved wrong. Nelson reports that “Lawsky’s NYDFS had created what legislatures in other states now consider a case study in how not to regulate an industry whose complex technical details can quickly confound over-broad and ill-defined rules.” Crypto may be the first financial industry to subvert New York’s regulatory grip on global finance. Beginning of the end?      OIL’S CRYPTO-LIKE VOLATILITY. A tweet thread by Patrick Chovanec caught my attention. Boy, have oil prices been volatile over the past 12 years. Not quite crypto-level volatility, but pretty extreme for a commodity that’s a mainstay of the global economy. It’s all about the competing swings in demand and supply since 2008: the mix of financial crises, monetary policy-stoked speculation, the fracking revolution, Saudi Arabian political maneuvers within OPEC, and now a pandemic-fueled global economic shutdown. Who knows where crude prices will go from here? But with so much resting on them – questions of environmental sustainability, for one, but also the stability of the Middle East – crypto watchers should monitor them closely. Here’s why: The dollar’s fate as the world’s dominant currency is not insignificantly tied to the direction of oil markets because crude contracts are priced and settled in greenbacks. If oil-producing countries in sanctioned countries like Iran feel compelled by price movements to boost supply, a crypto solution that bypasses the dollar could help them do so. Alternatively, if locally sourced renewable energy usage starts to expand rapidly, the global trade in both oil and dollars will fall. The future of oil is one of many pieces in the puzzle driving a reimagining of money.      THE POWER OF MANY VOICES. The results are in for CoinDesk’s #NYBWGIVES charity drive for COVID-19. The month-long campaign, conducted with our Blockchain Week partners Gitcoin, Ethereal Summit and the Giving Block, raised $110,000, most of it in crypto-denominated donations, for 12 different charities. As promised at the campaign launch during our Consensus Distributed conference, CoinDesk is matching those donations with distributions totalling $50,000. Half of those funds will be assigned according to Gitcoin’s capital-constrained liberal radicalism (CLR) methodology, which aims to democratize grant and subsidy distribution. It meant that although two big “bitcoin whale” donations turned the International Medical Corps into the runaway winner in terms of total funds raised, the No Kid Hungry charity received more than three times as much in matching funds even though it raised less than a third of International Medical Corps’ tally. That’s because the latter’s intake came from twice as many contributors. This “power to the many” concept stems from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Microsoft Principal Researcher Glen Weyl’s work on “quadratic funding.” Read about it and watch the explainer video in our write-up of the charity drive.

The potential vulnerability in the Bitcoin sidechain's security parameters was discovered by Summa founder James Prestwich.      Liquid – a network developed and overseen by Blockstream and meant to move bitcoins around more quickly than the Bitcoin blockchain – moved 870 bitcoins that had been stuck in a queue since June 11 waiting to be processed.      Occurring Thursday at 17:19 GMT, the holders of the network's emergency two-of-three multisig wallet had potential access to the funds for about one hour, according to Prestwich. The transaction was processed normally, using the network's 11-of-15 multisig method.      “This was not a normal operation. If anyone says it is, they are wrong. It directly contradicts [Liquid’s] docs and public statements,” Prestwich said in a private message.      At current prices, the transaction is valued at roughly $8 million.      “This is a known issue caused by an inconsistency between the timelocks used by Liquid’s functionary [hardware security modules] and the functionaries themselves,” Blockstream Marketing Director Neil Woodfine told CoinDesk in a private message. “Despite the issue, the funds are always safe.”      Woodfine said that “recent growth in the Liquid Network” and coordination plans caused by the coronavirus pandemic have led to difficulty in updating firmware relating to the timelocks. Those updates should be implemented by Q4 2020, he said.      Added Prestwich:    ""To be secure, these systems must operate reliably and on-spec. In this case the Liquid federation did neither. As a result, Blockstream's administrator backdoor activated, and Liquid security became dependent on trusting the company.""  How Liquid works    Liquid operates as a sidechain to the Bitcoin network. It uses a one-to-one pegged token called L-BTC to move funds around more quickly than the regular network, which is overseen by a federation of select nodes.      Those nodes are typically hosted by large over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks or crypto exchanges. Each transaction, moreover, must be signed by 11 of 15 representative bodies. Liquid currently has 44 federation members such as BitMEX, Ledger and Xapo.      When bitcoin moves onto Liquid, it goes through a “peg-in” process where bitcoin is stored in a secure wallet moderated by the federation. LBTC is created and redeemed when bitcoin is deposited. The process reverses when bitcoin is withdrawn.      An emergency caveat does exist when bitcoins have not moved from a wallet for 30 days. In that case, a two-of-three multisig approval is activated in order to preserve the network. This is done to protect Liquid in the case of greater than one-third of the federated parties being severed from the Liquid Network.      According to Liquid’s technical documentation:    “If one-third or more of the network is ever unable to continue operating, the network would stall and the funds held would be locked up forever. To avoid this, all funds held by the Liquid Network are also accessible by a set of three emergency keys when the network has been non-functional for thirty consecutive days.”    Prestwich disclosed the security error publicly because the funds were never at risk of being openly stolen by a hacker, but only by those overseeing the emergency wallet. Those holders remain anonymous.      Whether or not this has happened in the past remains an open and pertinent security question, Prestwich added.

Top shelf    Watchdogs Snarl New York’s financial watchdog has warned crypto companies their BitLicense applications could be thrown out after “three strikes” of failing to address deficiencies highlighted by the regulator. Meanwhile, the European Union is preparing a new cryptocurrency regime that could include stricter requirements for “global stablecoin” projects such as Libra. Finally, the DoJ and SEC have filed charges against the founder of “AML Bitcoin,” a crypto which claimed to include anti-money laundering protections. AML Bitcoin’s founders are known for (erroneously) claiming the National Football League rejected an AML Bitcoin advertisement for being too controversial.      Tidy Endings? The Sovrin Foundation, a U.S.-based umbrella organization that oversees the development of blockchain-based digital identity standards, or self-sovereign identity (SSI), laid off nine full-time and six part-time employees in March, officially becoming a volunteer-run operation. Sovrin works with the likes of IBM, Cisco and T-Mobile, and was unable to complete a fundraising campaign that started before the COVID-19 crisis hit.

Funds will be refunded within 48 hours.      Grants & Partnerships Nearly half a dozen companies have announced new grants for open-source bitcoin contributors and projects since the coronavirus crisis began, from exchanges such as Kraken and OKCoin to the Human Rights Foundation.

Some bitcoin optimists suggest the cryptocurrency would appreciate in a deflationary environment – if its adoption as a medium of exchange rises, as discussed in April. This is because deflation boosts the purchasing power of the monetary unit. For this reason, the U.S. dollar tends to appreciate during deflationary bouts.      Exchange Spreads Trading U.S. dollars for bitcoin can have fairly different order sizes and spreads depending on the exchange, and no two are alike. Average order sizes over the past week were quite varied, CryptoCompare found. Orders on Bitstamp averaged $3,424.11, the highest of major dollar to bitcoin (USD/BTC) pair exchanges. ItBit was second to Bitstamp at $2,874.17, with Kraken at $2787.68. Gemini’s average was in the middle of the pack at $1,438.31, followed by Coinbase at $1,113.15.

42404805,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkhUs,1593185755,Coinbase Lists Compound's COMP Token for Retail Crypto Traders,"The COMP token may have been around for less than two weeks, but it's already been listed on both Coinbase's retail and Pro platforms.      The San Francisco-based exchange said in a blog post Thursday the token had been made available on Coinbase.com and via the firm's Android and iOS apps.      ""Coinbase customers can now buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store COMP. COMP will be available for customers in all Coinbase-supported regions, with the exception of New York state,"" the exchange said.      COMP was listed on Coinbase Pro, the exchange's professional trading platform, on Monday, in what was one of the fastest Coinbase listings to date following the launch of a digital asset.      Predictably, the COMP price, which had been meandering downwards since a sharp drop on Tuesday, got a 20% kick from the news.      Just before the Coinbase announcement, the token was trading at just above $210 – down 40% from where it started the week at something like $350. At the time of writing, COMP was just under the $250 mark.      COMP has been making headlines since its inauspicious launch less than two weeks ago metamorphosed into a triple-figure rally. After an initial listing price of $80 on Monday, June 15, COMP broke the $100 mark Thursday before its price doubled again in the space of 24 hours.      So far, COMP's all-time high has been the $372 it reached last Sunday.      See also: This Startup Is Forking Compound to Make Hiring More Efficient      However, the launch hasn't been without issues. COMP is a governance token, awarded freely to both lenders and borrowers to incentivize people to use the platform as much as possible. It didn't take long for traders to realize they could just borrow against themselves to receive free tokens.      Automated market maker Curv told CoinDesk at the time that users were lending one USD stablecoin against another, repeating the process up to 30 times to maximize their COMP allocation.      Earlier this week, some analysts also highlighted that traders were buying COMP tokens from spot markets together with COMP perpetual swaps – futures without expiry – on derivatives exchange FTX, to accelerate price increases further.      ""The relatively large size of the COMP Perpetual Swap market, it would be profitable to buy the Perp and then buy spot in significant enough size to move the price, amplifying gains in the Perp and squeezing the shorts,"" said Tony Sheng, angel investor and former principal at Multicoin Capital, in a blog post on Wednesday – the same day the COMP price tumbled to $200.      See also: Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive      Of course, 48 hours is a long time in crypto. With the news of the Coinbase listing, COMP has rebounded and its market cap now stands at $680 million, according to CoinGecko.

42404807,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkhVr,1593185254,"How the Crypto Community Helped Us Raise $110,000 for Charity","When asked to dig deep for a good cause, the crypto community obliges – eventually.      On May 11, the first day of this year’s Consensus: Distributed conference and of our month-long #NYBWGives fundraising campaign for COVID-19 relief, it was a bit painful to watch the donations counter. With just a few hundred dollars clocked by 5 p.m. ET, it seemed we were never going to raise enough to match the $25,000 CoinDesk had pledged for the first of two donation-matching pools, let alone reach our $100,000 target.      But then the bitcoin and ether “whales” arrived.      Money started pouring in, sometimes in small amounts, sometimes large. Most donations were in bitcoin and ether, but we also saw a handful of bitcoin cash and litecoin donations, as well as one zcash payment. Very few were in dollars.      By the time the campaign closed, the counter showed $107,169 raised, most of it directed to the six high-profile charities our partner Gitcoin had integrated into its innovative fundraising and grant-matching platform.      (The gods then smiled on us further, as a subsequent rally in crypto prices pushed the total to $109,522 on the date our campaign partner Gitcoin locked down the data to figure out the grant distributions.)      Including CoinDesk’s matching funds, #NYBWGives will pay a total of $134,522 to six charities onboarded into the Gitcoin program: International Medical Corps, No Kid Hungry, Save the Children, SOS Children’s Villages, The Water Project and Team Rubicon.      The matching grants for these charities were decided by a mathematical formula intended to democratize matching grants. Drawing on the principles of capital-constrained liberal radicalism, or CLR, that underpin the quadratic funding concept developed by Microsoft Principal Researcher Glen Weyl and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, the goal is to distribute funds to entities that receive larger numbers of smaller outside contributions.      Using the CLR model, the size of each charity’s CoinDesk grant was determined by calculating the sum of the square roots of each charity’s per-donor contributions after factoring in certain adjustments to reduce the risk of collusion.      The results were striking. The International Medical Corps’ tally of $47,225.92 in external donations, which included two large bitcoin payments of BTC 2.145 ($19,460) and BTC 1.538 ($13,952) – the two biggest single contributions in the entire funding round – was far and away the highest in dollar terms. Yet, its CLR matched funds distribution of $3,315 was considerably less than the $10,809 assigned to No Kid Hungry and the $7,194 that went to Save the Children, even though the latter two’s donation tallies stood at $13,951.34 and $17,718.8, respectively. That’s explained by a wider dispersal of contributions, with No Kid Hungry engaging 37 unique donors and Save the Children attracting 32, whereas International Medical Corps’ giant inflow came from just 18 contributors.      In addition to that mathematically adjusted CLR Round, CoinDesk dedicated a further $25,000 to a traditional 1:1 matching pool for 11 charities, including the six already involved in the CLR round plus five more: Action Against Hunger, Operation Mask, Meals on Wheels, United Way and Doctors Without Borders. For that pool, each fund’s allocation was capped at $2,000 and any remainder was to be distributed at CoinDesk’s discretion.      The five non-CLR charities, which only received fiat donations, collected a modest $477 in total on top of the equivalent in matching funds from CoinDesk. By contrast, only one CLR-participating charity failed to reach the $2,000 cap on grants: SOS Children’s Villages, which took in contributions of $1,278.      That left $13,480 in CoinDesk matching funds at our discretion. We are applying $7,000 of that to purchase a painting by the artist Mr. Star City, who created an interpretive piece for our Consensus Happy Hour music show. Under our agreement with him, he can share half the proceeds with charity, and $3,500 of that will be evenly distributed among the 11 organizations, along with the $6,480 remaining in that pool.      The painting will be auctioned at a later date, with the proceeds also going to the same 11 charities.      We’re grateful for the hard work of our partners in this fundraising drive – Gitcoin, Ethereal and the Giving Block – and thank everyone who generously contributed to these important causes.      At a time when there are millions of people around the world whose lives have been upended by the impact of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, CoinDesk is honored it could make at least a small difference and do so in cooperation with the crypto community we serve.      We were also excited to do this through a bold new experimental model that aligns with that community’s decentralizing ethos and addresses a crying societal need for wider inclusion in the disbursement and development of public resources. The future, not only of philanthropy but also of infrastructure development, lies in creative solutions like these by which governments and other funding entities can allocate resources in ways that amplify the widest array of voices in society.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | ETH | FIAT | LTC | MARKET,Michael J.

42404806,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkhTt,1593175673,A Key Thesis for Bitcoin's Long-Term Bull Market Just Got a Knock,"A popular narrative argues the massive stimulus programs from the Federal Reserve, launched to counter a coronavirus-induced recession, could hyperinflate the economy and fuel a major rally in bitcoin.      However, that bullish theory, which suggests the cryptocurrency would be viewed as a hedge asset in dire economic times, has been dealt a blow by recent data from the U.S. central bank.      The data suggests inflation is likely to remain absent for some time and, in fact, the probability of the U.S. economy slipping into deflation is rising.      There's now a 78.6% chance of deflationary pressure for the U.S – the highest since 2008, according to St. Louis Fed's deflation risk monitor. As tweeted by Ritvik Carvalho, a financial data correspondent at Reuters, the Fed's favored inflation measure (below right) – the core personal consumption expenditure – has also declined to an eight-year low of 1%.      Inflation refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services. Its opposite, deflation is characterized by a general decline in prices for goods and services, and is typically accompanied by a rise in unemployment.      Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in early March the Fed has injected an unprecedented amount of liquidity into the system to help the economy absorb shocks arising from the virus outbreak and ensure financial market stability. Its balance sheet size has expanded by over $3 trillion over the past 3.5 months.      Crypto analysts are convinced that the massive money injections would boost inflation and bode well for bitcoin. That's in part based on the cryptocurrency’s reducing pace of supply, which drops by 50% every four years via a process called the ""halving.""      Also read: Bitcoin’s Halving Is Nothing Like Quantitative Tightening      “As we’ve closely monitored the market in the wake of recent economic policy decisions, we’ve seen that the crypto asset class is not only resilient, but that interest is surging as the monetary stimulus has caused investors to look to $BTC as a potential hedge against inflation,” Grayscale Investments, one of the leading digital asset management companies, recently tweeted. (Grayscale is a unit of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group.)      Legendary fund manager Paul Tudor Jones also recently disclosed a small bitcoin position to help protect against a rise in inflation.      But with the Fed data and market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations also suggesting a low chance of a rise in inflation over the next five years, the odds of bitcoin witnessing an inflation-driven bull market look weak.      So if the U.S. is, in fact, facing deflation, what does it mean for bitcoin?      Some observers suggest the cryptocurrency would appreciate in a deflationary environment – if its adoption as a medium of exchange rises, as discussed in April. This is because deflation boosts the purchasing power of the monetary unit. For this reason, the U.S. dollar tends to appreciate during deflationary bouts.      There's also evidence institutional participation in the bitcoin market is increasing. As a result, some of the increasing money supply may find its way into the bitcoin market. In that case, the cryptocurrency could rise in the long term despite low inflation or deflation.      See also: Why Global Deflation May Not Be Bad News for Bitcoin      In the shorter term, the scenario for bitcoin is looking somewhat uncertain. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands just over $9,200, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Even in major crypto exchanges, trading U.S. dollars for bitcoin can have fairly different order sizes and spreads, according to data compiled by aggregator CryptoCompare.      Average order sizes over the past week were quite varied, CryptoCompare found. Orders on Bitstamp averaged $3,424.11, the highest of major dollar to bitcoin (USD/BTC) pair exchanges. ItBit was second to Bitstamp at $2,874.17, with Kraken at $2787.68. Gemini’s average was in the middle of the pack at $1,438.31, followed by Coinbase at $1,113.15. Bitfinex was lowest, with an average order totaling $342.09. The average order of the six exchanges was $1,996.58.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Average spreads between the highest bid offer and the lowest ask offer on an exchange order book also varied significantly. Data from CryptoCompare shows a few exchanges have a much larger daily price spread than others.      “This is derived from L2 order book data, without fee calculations, on top of this,” said Constantine Tsav, head of research for CryptoCompare. Level 2, or L2, order book data is a term for market information that includes the scope of bid and ask prices for a given asset, in this case USD/BTC.      Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, at $5.21 and New York-domiciled Gemini, at $2.38, have the largest average spreads in intraday trading, in this case CryptoCompare used a two-hour interval. Market spread is the gap between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the order book. Thus the gap is the difference between the price traders are willing to sell an asset and others are willing to buy an asset, and vice versa.      Chris Thomas, head of institutional trading for Swissquote Bank, doesn’t believe the spread discrepancy between some exchanges is bad – it just depends on the type of trader on the exchange. Traders looking to fill larger bitcoin orders on spot exchanges might choose Bitstamp, based on this data, since it has bigger average orders. Traditionally, traders look for tighter spreads.      ""Whereas Bitstamp and Gemini have a relatively wide spread, the four other ones will use this to boast that they have the most liquidity and are ‘the best’ exchanges,” he said. “But they may only be prepared to support these very tight prices in very small sizes – for example, 0.25 or 1 bitcoin on both bid and offers.”      “One bitcoin on each side of the bid/ask is okay for retail, but it’s not ideal for institutional.”      Of course, traders aren’t just motivated to go to an exchange based solely on average order sizes and spreads.      A very fragmented marketplace exists for crypto exchanges in 2020, said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for cryptocurrency broker Bequant. “The tech stack across exchanges is not uniform,” Vinokourov told CoinDesk.“Some exchanges offer high frequency trading connectivity while others don't, some are more retail focused than others; with segmented geographical focus, numerous legal jurisdictions and various approaches to fiat on-ramps.”      Maxime Boonen, CEO of liquidity provider B2C2, says a trader at that size really just needs to decide which exchange has the best fee structure. “Frankly, all exchanges are more or less equal, the liquidity of the major cash exchanges is broadly the same for most intents and purposes.”      “The fees do vary; that's important, depending on how much you intend to trade,” he added.      The increased use of derivatives in the crypto market is also seeing more professional traders move away from spot trading, Boonen said. “Derivative exchanges are more liquid than cash exchanges,” he said.      One of the reasons why order averages might seem so low is many traders on these exchanges are just buying from time to time to hold (or “HODL”) bitcoin, Boonen told CoinDesk. “You can't get physical bitcoin from derivatives exchanges, it’s not appropriate for HODLing.”    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,199 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,333 | 24-Hr Low: $9,087      Trend: Bitcoin is flashing red at press time and may be heading for bigger losses in the short term.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading around $9,200, representing a 0.5% decline on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      On the daily chart, the cryptocurrency looks to have found acceptance under the 50-candle moving average (MA), a bearish development. Meanwhile, on the three-day chart, the five- and 10-candle moving averages have produced a bearish crossover, while the relative strength index has dived out of a 60-day-long descending channel, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change.      Some indicators, like the daily chart's golden crossover and a bull cross of the 50- and 100-candle MAs on the three-day chart, do indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side. These indicators, however, are based on backward-looking averages and often trap traders on the wrong side of the market.      Besides, technical traders have refused to step in over the past four weeks despite confirmation of the golden crossover. Such reticence is reflective of a weakening of bullish sentiment.      All in all, the odds appear stacked in favor of a decline to support levels located at $8,630 (May 25 low) and possibly $8,300 (200-candle MA). On the higher side, $10,000 remains the level to beat for the bulls.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Daniel Cawrey, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/26/first-mover-in-the-cryptocurrency-markets-no-two-exchanges-are-alike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa6c08e7d0e29e043a8d3fb1a90a1f2c8a010300-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek told CoinDesk the company is refunding 100% of customer funds after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) suspended the activities of Wirecard Card Solutions, a subsidiary of the Wirecard Group, which filed for insolvency on Thursday after admitting last week to be missing $2.1 billion.      ""We will rapidly proceed to credit the funds back to our users' crypto wallets,"" Marszalek said.      All funds will be refunded in the next 48 hours.      The FCA ordered Wirecard Card Solutions to cease all regulated activities on Friday. The financial watchdog said it had stepped in to protect customer funds and would prevent the company from accepting or disposing of any more revenue.      While Wirecard Group is headquartered in Munich and is outside the FCA's jurisdiction, Wirecard Card Solutions has its offices in Newcastle, in the north of England. Friday's announcement affects all cards issued by Wirecard Card Solutions, including those belonging to Crypto.com and TenX users. Although it still isn't clear what could happen, one possibility is that all Wirecard cards stop working.      Users will not be able to top up or transact with Crypto.com cards as of later today.

But Friday's news has now forced their hands.

In an updatehttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses/gn/notice_vc_busact_lic_app_procedure Wednesday, New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) said a new three-strikes rule would authorize it to deny any applications that didn't address or consider any deficiencies highlighted by the regulator.    The warning reads, ""[I]f all deficiencies involving a particular application requirement or set of requirements have not been fully and effectively addressed by the end of the response period for the third deficiency letter ... the DFS may, without further notice, deny the application.""      The new rule coincides with the fifth anniversary of the BitLicense, which saw the regulator update its framework for businesses, like exchanges and wallets providers, to operate legally in New York State. To date, only 25 companies have been approved, with 19 receiving actual licenses and six receiving limited purpose trust charters.      The most recent successful applicant was derivatives clearinghouse ErisX, which received its BitLicense at the start of May.      See also: BitLicense at 5: For Startups Regulated Overseas, New York Isn’t So Tough      Indeed, part of the motivation behind this week's rule change is to help streamline the application procedure. The regulator argues the three-strike rule will encourage applicants to make sure they have fully addressed all the concerns laid out in the deficiency letters before resubmitting.      ""DFS believes this policy will benefit the majority of applicants that diligently advance their applications once they are under substantive review, by allowing for a more effective use of DFS resources,"" the note reads.      Another aspect of this week's rule change is a new checklist feature companies can use to ensure they have completed all steps required, such as providing all the right documentation before they send off their application to the regulator.

The bloc's lead economics minister, Valdis Dombrovskis – or to give him his full title, the European Union's Executive Vice President of the European Commission for An Economy that Works for People – said Europe had to seize the opportunity to become one of the main rule-makers for digital finance.      ""This is a good chance for Europe to strengthen its international standing and to become a global standard-setter, with European companies leading new technologies for digital finance,"" he said during a speech at the Digital Finance Outreach 2020 earlier this week.      And the first test case, Dombrovskis said, would be cryptocurrencies.      See also: CBDC Issuance Is ‘Not a Reaction’ to Libra, Says Central Bank Body      Although some cryptos, such as security tokens, are pretty well covered by European law, whole bundles of them, most notably stablecoins, remain entirely unregulated.      ""Lack of legal certainty is often cited as the main barrier to developing a sound crypto-asset market in the EU,"" Dombrovskis said.      Some EU members have taken matters into their own hands, which damages market integration and makes it difficult for companies to operate across the whole trading bloc.      A new regulatory regime for cryptocurrency will not only cover unregulated digital assets, but it will also consolidate and homogenize existing standards across the continent, Dombrovskis said.      See also: Italian Banks Are Ready to Trial a Digital Euro      Set to be unveiled later this year, Dombrovskis, who was formerly the prime minister of Latvia, didn't give much away on what the future regime might look like, although he emphasized that it would support and stimulate innovation.      A pilot scheme would allow regulators to provide a space for new experimental solutions to be monitored and observed, he said.      While Dombrovskis' speech contained few specifics, he did say that the EU was particularly keen to bring stricter rules on any project deemed to be a ""global stablecoin.""      What exactly Dombrovskis means by ""global stablecoin"" isn't immediately clear. However, it appears one of the key components is that it's used instead of traditional fiat currencies and can facilitate a greater number of transactions that cross national borders.      See also: Fed Economists Call Fears of Original Libra Stablecoin ‘Overstated’      That might be an inference to initiatives such as Facebooks' Libra. Stablecoins, possibly like Libra, that operate on a global scale can ""raise additional challenges,"" Dombrovskis said – they can disrupt financial and monetary stability.      ""Overall, our approach will be proportionate and relate to the level of risk. That means lighter rules for less risky projects,"" Dombrovskis concluded. In the case of global stablecoins, such as Libra, ""their potentially systemic role [means] our rules will be stronger.""",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/26/eu-creating-a-regulatory-regime-for-cryptocurrencies-says-economic-chief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ff2d062f57ac8653e6dea394f4d2384d2213ca8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hdac's blockchain platform attempts to combine secure authentication, seamless mapping and machine-to-machine transactions in a blockchain network with IoT devices. CertiK’s team of blockchain engineers worked closely with Hdac to audit the design and implementation of its codebase, which is expected to be released in the near future, the companies told CoinDesk on Friday.      Hdac had previously tapped CertiK to audit its codebase, where the security firm learned of Hdac's plans to build blockchain solutions, a CertiK spokesperson said. This led the company to seek out a formal partnership. A codebase is a collection of source code used to build software systems and acts as a general repository.      ""Because of their [Hdac's] future plans, we decided it would make sense to formally partner with one another as a public promise of Hdac's focus on security and a symbol of CertiK's ability to support larger enterprise-level solutions such as Hdac's,"" CertiK's marketing manager, Connie Ngo, said in an email.      See also: Ford Test Driving Blockchain for Energy-Efficient Vehicles      In addition to their formalized partnership, CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu will also be joining Hdac's advisory board.      Hdac Technology AG is headquartered in the crypto-friendly region of Zug, Switzerland and was founded by CEO of Hyundai BS&C, Dae-sun Chung. Hyundai BS&C is an independent IT and construction company that bears no legal connection with the car company Hyundai Motors.      The security firm is best known for receiving ""multiple millions"" of dollars from Binance's blockchain and crypto incubator wing Binance Labs in October 2018.

6859,http://blokt.com/?p=35127,1593134278,Top 16 Best Ethereum Wallets [2020] – ETH & ERC20 Crypto Wallets,"Ethereum is the blockchain protocol with the most active developers and the most projects built on top of its platform. That’s why we have put together this comprehensive guide to help you choose the best Ethereum wallet for you. In this extensive guide, we look at 16 of the best Ethereum wallets Its native cryptocurrency, Ether, has the second-highest market valuation behind the original cryptocurrency Bitcoin, so it is no surprise that loads of people have become interested in investing and trading Ether and Ethereum tokens. There has also been a surge in decentralized finance (Defi) Dapps built on on Ethereum which has opened it up to far more users. ETH heads can now use stablecoins such as Dai which are pegged to the US Dollar but use ETH as collateral. However, before we can start trading and investing, we need to understand the basic principles of how an Ethereum or general crypto wallets work. Private Keys and Addresses Blockchain-based assets and currencies are normally called cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, or simply cryptos because they all depend on cryptography. On a very simplistic level, cryptography is the use of mathematics to send, receive, conceal, or reveal information. Private keys are essentially the secret code that controls your information, which in this case, would be your crypto assets. Knowing an account’s private key means users have complete control of that account’s assets without having to go through any intermediaries. 3a1076bf45ab87712ad64ccb3b10217737f7faacbf2872e88fdd9a537d8fe266 (Ethereum private key example) Using cryptography and with access to the private key, we are able to generate — through many complicated steps — an address, which represents your account. It can be thought of like a mailbox or an email address that people can send things to, but you can only send things from it if you have the private key. The address is the public face of your account and can be shared with anyone but no one can figure out your private key from only knowing your address thanks to the genius of cryptography. An Ethereum address always begins with 0x. 0xc2d7cf95645d33006175b78989035c7c9061d3f9 (Ethereum address example) What is a Wallet? The term “ wallet ” is kind of a misnomer in that crypto wallets don’t actually hold any assets. Wallets can only contain access to private keys, which in turn control crypto assets. Functionally, wallets allow users to create new accounts and send assets, although different wallets have different features and functionality. It would be more accurate to call a wallet, a keyring or keychain because it controls and has access to different types of keys but we’ll go with ‘wallet’ seeing as everyone else does. The differences between different types of wallets revolve around how each wallet deals with private keys. Paper Wallets The most basic type of wallet is known as a “ paper wallet ,” which is a piece of paper with your private keys written or printed on it. The information on this piece of paper is all that is needed to control all the assets on an Ethereum account. A paper wallet is secure in that it is possible to keep it from every other person or system on the planet and only you can know about its existence, its location, or how to access it. Paper wallets are insecure though because if you lose it or it gets damaged beyond recognition, there is no possible way to recover your funds. You have lost those assets forever. To counteract this vulnerability, some people make multiple copies of their paper wallet and put them in different locations or keep the paper wallet in a secure spot such as a safety deposit box at a bank. Paper Wallet generated using MyCrypto Hot vs Cold Wallets Paper wallets fall under the category of ‘cold wallets,’ which means that they are completely disconnected from the internet. This makes cold wallets more secure and less vulnerable to software-based attacks. Hot wallets, on the other hand, are connected to the internet, so they are more accessible and useful for frequent transactions but are also more vulnerable to hackers. In general, cold wallets are better for securing large amounts of funds and hot wallets are better for everyday transactions and usage. Software Wallets Exchanges Ethereum-Specific Ethereum Interfaces Coinbase Binance MyEtherWallet MyCrypto Mist MetaMask Private Keys Platform Controlled Platform Controlled User-Controlled User-Controlled User-Controlled User-Controlled Backup/ Recovery Options Yes Yes No No No No Cold or Hot Wallet Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Interact with Dapps No No No No Yes Yes The table above will help you choose a software wallet to store your Ether. Cryptocurrency Exchanges The most common way for people to buy their first crypto asset is through an exchange which allows people to trade between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Exchanges also act as wallets because the platform controls the private keys on behalf of the user. The benefit of having a platform control your private keys is that your funds or assets are recoverable if you lose your password. Coinbase Coinbase is one of the oldest and most trusted exchanges. It was founded in 2012 and has over 20+ million users as well as backing from some of the most respected investors in the world. Coinbase is also one of the most legally compliant cryptocurrency exchanges globally. It is connected to the traditional banking system in Europe and the United States, so it is fairly easy to convert fiat currencies such as the US Dollar and the Euro to Ether. Coinbase platform and app Go to Coinbase Binance Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. While Coinbase is mainly available in the U.S. and Europe, Binance is accessible across continents and has even made progress expanding to Africa . Furthermore, Binance has many more crypto assets available for trading when compared to Coinbase, which has a much stricter process for listing new crypto assets. Both Binance and Coinbase control private keys on behalf of their users, so funds are controlled by the username and password used to access the platform. About Binance platform and app Go to Binance Ethereum-Specific Wallets MyEtherWallet and MyCrypto are wallets that are used specifically for Ether and Ethereum tokens so they do not interact with cryptocurrencies from other blockchains such as Bitcoin or XRP . Ethereum tokens are assets or currencies, which have been created on top of the Ethereum platform. Tokens can have a wide variety of purposes and are different from Ether itself, which is the fuel that runs the Ethereum network. The most popular type of Ethereum token is called an ERC20, which is a token created using a common standard that allows any ERC20 token to be easily traded with another ERC20 token. The second most common token is called an ERC721 or a non-fungible token, which is unique and cannot be broken up into smaller parts. For simplicity’s sake, I will refer to both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens as just Ethereum tokens. MyEtherWallet (MEW) One of the oldest and most popular web-based, Ethereum-specific wallets is MyEtherWallet (MEW) . MEW does not control private keys on behalf of the user and instead allows users to create new accounts and access existing accounts to send transactions. Myetherwallet MEW also has a smartphone app called MEWconnect that allows users to access the functions of MEW from their mobile devices. MEWconnect MyCrypto Taylor Monahan , the co-founder of MyEtherWallet, started MyCrypto in February 2018 as a fork of the MyEtherWallet codebase. A fork means that both products have the same software or code up to the point in which they split. Once separate, two distinct products are born from the different coding decisions made by the teams. MyCrypto claims to have started in 2015 , but it is difficult to say which product or team is the original. It has very similar core features, such as the ability to create new accounts and send transactions on existing accounts. MyCrypto platform MyCrypto has also developed a desktop application, which is more secure because it doesn’t have to be connected to the internet to function and is capable of doing things like accessing an account via a private key, which the web version does not allow any more. MyCrypto platform and app Ethereum Interfaces The primary purpose of Ethereum is to be a platform that runs smart contracts or decentralized applications (dapps), which means that Ethereum is meant to be more than simply a way to send and receive assets or currency. Its true potential is in enabling the creation of computer programs that can control value that executes automatically when certain pre-defined conditions are met. In order to access these dapps, an interface is required that can send data to the dapp, and a wallet with Ether is required in order to pay for transactions on the dapp. Mist The original Ethereum wallet was Mist , which functions as both a simple wallet and as an Ethereum browser. Like traditional web browsers such as Chrome or Safari that allow users to interact with regular websites, Mist enables users to interact with dapps on Ethereum. Mist is a desktop application in which the user controls private keys. It also allows the user to run a node , which is a critical component of Ethereum’s infrastructure and keeps a record of all the transactions that have happened on the network. When Ethereum was first released, and Mist was the only wallet available, users had to wait for their nodes to sync before being able to make any transactions, which sometimes took hours or even days! Though popular when Ethereum was first released, Mist has declined in popularity in recent years due to the explosion of competing Ethereum interfaces, wallet programs, and applications. Mist node syncing in 2016 MetaMask MetaMask is the most popular Ethereum interface with over 1 million downloads. It works as a browser extension instead of a standalone desktop program and allows users to interact with dapps. The user controls the private keys, and it functions as a wallet because it also allows users to manage their funds and crypto-assets. MetaMask has become the preferred option for interacting with Ethereum dapps. MetaMask have recently been working on the launch of version 8.0 of their Chromium wallet extension, and have launched the Metamask Mobile beta version which is due for full release very soon, with over 100,000 downloads already. MetaMask Extension Log In Screen Hardware Wallets Hardware Wallets Mobile Phones Ledger Trezor KeepKey Sirin Finney HTC Exodus Samsung Galaxy S10 Private Keys User-Controlled User-Controlled User-Controlled User-Controlled User-Controlled User-Controlled Backup/ Recovery Options Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Cold or Hot Wallet Both Both Both Both Both Both Interact with Dapps No No No Yes Yes Yes Hardware wallets are self-contained devices with specially designed hardware that is optimized for security. Unlike software wallets, hardware wallets can function as either cold or hot wallets. There are a few leading hardware wallets which support Ethereum Hardware wallets allow users access to their private keys without having to be connected to the internet. However, they also have the option of connecting to the internet when assets transfer or crypto-related functions need to happen. Hardware wallets are essentially a portable hard drive that stores your private keys and helps manage or secure crypto assets. There is commonly a digital display and some kind of interface on the device. Hardware wallets usually come with the ability to have a passcode, which adds a second layer of security, before being allowed to access it. These companies also offer the option of holding a backup copy of a user’s private keys, which allows you to recover your private keys in case the device is lost or stolen. As opposed to all the wallets mentioned above, hardware wallets cost money. Ledger Wallets The Ledger line of hardware wallets is one of the oldest and most popular hardware wallets on the market with over 1 million products sold. They support over 1000 different crypto assets, including Ethereum and Ethereum tokens. They have even created a software application that is compatible with all their hardware devices called Ledger Live . Ledger’s three main products are the: Ledger Nano S Cheapest and most popular product A USB device with a simple display and two buttons Funds are protected via a secret PIN Ledger Nano S Get a Ledger Nano S Ledger Nano X All the features and simplicity of the Ledger Nano S Can be connected securely via Bluetooth Compatible with their Ledger Live mobile app Ledger Nano X Get a Ledger Nano X Ledger Blue Ledger’s most advanced wallet, which includes a large touchscreen interface Compatible with the Ledger Live app Capable of installing additional apps on the device Ledger Nano Blue Get a Ledger Blue Trezor Trezor, like Ledger, is also a well-established and trusted hardware wallet company having supported Bitcoin before Ethereum and other blockchains became popular. Now, it also supports Ethereum, Ethereum tokens, and hundreds of other crypto assets. They offer simple interfaces, security-focused technology and extra layers of protection using passwords and PIN numbers, as well as backup and recovery options. The Trezor team have worked hard to match the simplicity of Ledger’s devices, recently bringing out the ‘ Trezor Wallet ’, which functions a lot like Ledger Live and makes it easier for users to manage and control the assets stored on their Trezor device. Trezor Wallet is plug-and-play, so users can start using their Trezor device straight out of the box without any complex setup process. The Trezor wallets have a unique and distinctive design. Their wallets include the: Trezor One A USB device with a simple display and two buttons Emphasizes quick and easy use Integrates with MyEtherWallet Get a Trezor One Trezor Model T Similar to the Trezor One with an interactive touchscreen display and interface Get a Trezor Model T KeepKey KeepKey was developed by online crypto exchange, ShapeShift , and is fully integrated with ShapeShift so that users can exchange different crypto assets from the device. There is only one KeepKey product on the market so far, but like Trezor and Ledger, it offers an isolated and secure device with a simple display and button interface that is capable of functioning as a cold wallet. KeepKey also features PIN or password protection as well as backup and recovery options. SelfKey recently acquired web 3.0 interface application Portis, which functions similarly to MetaMask and lets users securely interact with dapps. It’s likely that in the future, KeepKey users will be able to easily access dapps through Portis without revealing their private keys. KeepKey Wallet Get a KeepKey Mobile Apps Many wallets are also available as applications on mobile devices such as Coinbase, Binance , MyEtherWallet, and Ledger. Lumi Wallet Lumi Wallet is available as an app for IOS and Android, as well as on the web. All the configurations are client-side, meaning that private keys are stored only on the users’ devices. Lumi Wallet has a nice. simple interface Initially developed as a Bitcoin wallet, Lumi shortly integrated BCH, Ethereum, and more than 1200 Ethereum tokens. Lumi Technologies, the company behind the wallet, recently announced adding an in-app browser to Lumi to interact with Ethereum dapps. At the moment, it is introducing full EOS support, which will grant users the opportunity to create new EOS accounts for free. Lumi wallet is a soon-to-be-open source. Lumi is recognized for its eye-catching and straightforward interface. Users can buy and sell a wide range of available digital assets via an in-wallet exchange. It is entirely anonymous and doesn’t require users to provide any personal information. Lumi Technologies has additionally released the Lumi Collect app for ERC721. This wallet is equipped with a browser for Ethereum dapp interaction and sidechain support. Guarda Wallet Guarda supports various platforms, including Android and Apple mobile devices. It supports over 40 blockchains and thousands of tokens, including BTC, ETH XRP, BCH, BSV, XMR and many more. Supported cryptos can be purchased directly from within the wallet, and coins can also be exchanged using the built-in exchange service. The Guarda Wallet is custody-free, so private keys are not stored by the company, meaning users are responsible for keeping their keys safe. Others As we mentioned above, MetaMask is currently developing its own mobile app. The app is currently in beta release, available on Android and iOS. The @metamask_io mobile app was just announced at #Devcon4 ! Everyone's favorite #Ethereum browser extension is coming to your phone. The team is focusing on not being 'just a wallet', but a portal to the world of all things #blockchain . https://t.co/3bvQXuF8gV pic.twitter.com/vcaIkkzcVS — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) October 31, 2018 The functionality of these apps are generally the same as the web versions, and there are hundreds of other mobile apps available that function as crypto-asset exchanges, Ethereum wallets, and Ethereum interfaces so we won’t go over all that in too much detail right now. Blockchain Native Phones The next and most exciting phase of Ethereum wallets will be wallets that are native to smartphones or smartphones built with blockchain functionality specifically in mind. These phones will combine the security features of a hardware wallet, with the familiar interface of a mobile app on a device that we are all so dependant on already. The difference between these phones and other smartphones is not only specialized hardware but also that they have blockchain applications such as wallets already built-in so users will not have to download any extra applications in order to send or receive crypto assets. Sirin Finney The Finney by Sirin Labs is the most blockchain-focused smartphone on the market. The Sirin Labs team initially created the Solarin, which they branded as the “ world’s most secure mobile phone ” costing over $14,000, so the team is no stranger to security. It has created everything on the Finney from the ground up including its own operating system and cryptocurrency called the Sirin Token . It was even launched through a crowdsale or Initial Coin Offering, which raised $157 million, making it a genuinely blockchain-native phone. The Finney can interact with decentralized applications and has cold wallet capabilities. The wallet, which pops up at the top of the phone is its most distinctive feature in both looks and functionality. For security, the wallet has its own hardware, which is separate from the general hardware of the phone. Tech Radar Hands-On Review of the Finney Reviews have been somewhat mixed, with the general consensus being that this is a niche phone for the crypto enthusiasts with decent features. A ZDNet review states: “No-one, least of all Sirin Labs, is claiming that the Finney will occupy anything other than a niche in the smartphone firmament — although the company is forecasting sales in the hundreds of thousands. If you’re not a cryptocurrency enthusiast, you can certainly get a better phone for $899. Not that there’s anything wrong with the Finney, which is a well-built handset.” Sirin Labs have recently indicated that they may abandon production of their ultra-luxury blockchain phones, and instead focus on selling the encrypted software to other smartphone companies – so be aware these handsets may not receive updates in the future. Digital Trends Sirin Finney Review HTC Exodus The HTC Exodus is the first blockchain native phone built by a major well-established corporation, HTC. Like the Finney, it emphasizes security to protect your crypto assets and allows users to easily interact with decentralized applications as well as exchange different crypto assets. The HTC Exodus uses a specially designed secure hardware or “ vault ” called Zion , which protects the private keys of users. Its marketing is centered not only on protecting the user’s crypto assets, but also the user’s private data. The HTC Exodus includes an exciting concept for backup and recovery called “ social key recover ” in which you split your recovery keys among 3 to 5 of your most trusted contacts. Wired HTC Exodus 1 Review Samsung Galaxy S10 The newest smartphone with native blockchain support will be the Samsung Galaxy S10 . This will be the most mainstream or popular product line to have a pre-installed crypto wallet and blockchain-specific features. Furthermore, the Galaxy S10 will support both Ether and Ethereum tokens, but not Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency. The release of the Galaxy S10 is a massive leap in terms of mainstream adoption of Ethereum. The most explicit blockchain feature of the Galaxy S10 is their “ Blockchain Keystore ” app, which allows for features such as crypto payments and transfers, secure crypto storage, and digital signatures. This Blockchain Keystore is where the phone securely stores the user’s private keys and generates new private keys and addresses. Samsung also keeps a backup of users private keys in case they lose the phone or accidentally delete their password. Samsung recently announced the arrival of their S20 smartphone, coinciding with the start of the new decade, which will support Bitcoin, Ethereum, and TRON (TRX) in its native wallet from factory settings. “Security: Galaxy S10 is built with defense-grade Samsung Knox, as well as a secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services.” https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-s10-more-screen-cameras-unpacked-2019/ Which Is the Best Ethereum Wallet? There are a wide variety of Ethereum wallets with more being developed every day. Moreover, the ones that are used have overlapping functionality and features, which are constantly changing. This has been an attempt to cover a wide variety of Ethereum wallets in limited depth. The best wallet really depends on what you value and how you plan to manage your crypto assets. Paper wallets have maximum security from hackers but are also one of the most vulnerable to human error or physical damage. Centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance offer customer service and allow users to recover their funds in case of lost passwords, but you have to trust that they are and will continue to be reliable. Ethereum-specific wallets and interfaces such as MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, and MetaMask offer more functionality and keep private keys in your control, but will be unable to help if you ever lose those private keys. Hardware wallets and blockchain native phones seem to offer the best of both worlds, allowing user control of private keys along with backup and recovery options, but they cost money. I hope this guide helps, but as always, do your own research and choose wisely.

42432151,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARJh,1593134128,Trio of Bitcoin Tokens Lures DeFi Yield Farmers to New Pastures,"The number three decentralized finance (DeFi) application, Synthetix, is also enjoying the current boom times in bankless banking.      (Warning: This post is going to go a lot of places, so buckle in.)      Synthetix is a platform for minting and exchanging synthetic tokens that mirror the price of other assets. On June 19, Synthetix joined the Ren Project and BitGo in creating a pool of bitcoin-backed tokens, for smooth liquidity between three crypto products that should be all but interchangeable. Plus, each of the DeFi platforms is promising token rewards in order to get more participation in the pool.      This pool of sBTC, renBTC and WBTC lives on Curve, an automated market maker that has extremely low price slippage thanks in part to its specialization in stablecoins.      Note: The three versions of BTC are distinct. WBTC is minted by BitGo, which serves as a centralized custodian; renBTC is minted with a trustless smart contract; and sBTC never touches BTC – it is synthetic, backed by an 800% collateralization of Synthetix Network Token (SNX).      The promotion will run till Sept. 28. And though it started on June 19, the hockey stick growth on Synthetix only got going on June 22.      In short, Synthetix appears to have successfully attracted the itinerant and growing horde of yield farmers, each doing their best to outrun the coming DeFi dust bowl.      Read more: Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive      There are many incentives to joining the pool on Curve. Participants will split up a weekly award of 10,000 SNX and 25,000 REN, plus BAL from a liquidity pool of REN and SNX that the two teams made. Users also get promises for CRV, the forthcoming governance token from Curve.      The new interest in Synthetix has strengthened its position relative to Compound and MakerDAO, the top two DeFi protocols. Synthetix has never previously had more than $200 million in assets on the application. As of this writing, it has an all-time high of $263 million, according to DeFi Pulse.      That said, it's unclear how much of that is due to this specific promotion. SNX is the asset one stakes to use Synthetix, and its price is at $1.88 as of this writing, up from $1.15 before the promotion began.      ""I think there is a general surge in DeFi awareness and this new incentive taps into a number of aspects of it. BTC on ETH, yield farming and AMMs,"" Kain Warwick, founder of Synthetix, told CoinDesk via email. ""So I think they are probably somewhat related but it is always hard to pinpoint a specific reason for a sudden spike in project awareness.""      Read more: RenBTC Quietly Goes Live in Latest Bid to Bring Bitcoin to Ethereum      The promotion has also benefited Ren, whose renBTC token went live on May 22.      ""We’ve seen a large growth in volume on Ren this week,"" Ren CEO Taiyang Zhang told CoinDesk in an email. ""Since launch a few weeks ago we’ve had $19 million volume flow through RenVM and over $8 million locked up now. $15 million in volume is from the last week, with users mostly tokenizing BTC.""      The promotion is not the whole story for Ren, however; DeFi is experiencing a rising tide moment.      ""Seems like COMP mining created a large demand for WBTC and renBTC is the easiest on-ramp into it via the Curve pool,"" Zhang added.      Users just need to deposit any of the three Ethereum-based versions of BTC onto Curve's BTC pool, and then account for their contribution on Synthetix. The new pool currently shows a daily USD volume of $774,577 or 83.18 BTC.      ""This pool does a great deal of stabilizing sBTC price which is very valuable for Synthetix, as well as makes it possible to enter the Synthetix ecosystem right from Bitcoin – very valuable for both REN and Synthetix,"" Michael Egorov of Swiss Stake, the company behind Curve, explained to CoinDesk in an email.",POSITIVE,BTC | COMP | REN | SNX,BTC | COMP | REN | SNX | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/26/trio-of-bitcoin-tokens-lures-defi-yield-farmers-to-new-pastures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae288485471076fe0f08061ed71ba6bae3659ff5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
