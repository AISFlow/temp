42376605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bP4b,1380636018,Free State Project members now able to pay rent in bitcoins,"A property management company in New Hampshire is now enabling members of the Free State Project (FSP) to pay their rent in bitcoins.  Matthew Ping, of Porcupine Management, said he tries to accommodate any form of payment option, but bitcoin has become something of a favourite due to the privacy it provides and its ease of use.  Bitcoin has somewhat become the currency of choice for those involved in the FSP, which is a political migration, founded in 2001. The aim is to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to New Hampshire to create a stronghold for libertarian ideas.  Willing participants sign a statement of intent declaring they will move to New Hampshire within five years of the project reaching 20,000 members. As of 18th September, some 14,820 had signed the statement of intent and more than 1,180 'early movers' had already relocated to the state.  Renting  Ping said he first heard about bitcoin in late 2011 when the price was around $5 and he ""thought it was a great idea"", but didn’t start using it until February this year at the Liberty Forum event hosted by the FSP.  He went on to say he thinks alternative currencies are a perfect fit for the FSP as both are decentralised and represent independence.  Ping collects the majority of rent money from tenants in person, so he uses a smartphone app to receive payments from those who want to pay in bitcoin.  He said not all of the residents he deals with know what bitcoin is, so he is trying to spread the word about the possibilities it offers. However, Ping is not necessarily convinced bitcoin will be the digital currency that will prevail in the long run:  ""Bitcoin seems to be doing well and may lead the alternative currency race, but as the community evolves and the market changes, a better option may come about.""  Ryan Coon, co-founder of Rentalutions, which collects rent for landlords, said the company has received a lot of requests form tenants who want to pay their rent in bitcoin since it launched the option in August. It has also received a few requests from those wishing to pay in litecoin.  ""However, because of the processing fees involved (3% if the landlord is a Rentalutions member, 5% if not), we have only processed a few bitcoin rent payments for a couple tenants. I believe that once we lower the fees, we will see more adoption,"" he added.  Coon said he's not received any enquiries from people based in New Hampshire, with the majority of bitcoin queries coming from states with ""thriving technology industries"" such as San Francisco, New York and Seattle.  A perfect partnership  Vanessa Vine, co-organiser of PorcFest (the Porcupine Freedom Festival), said bitcoin is ""huge"" within FSP and is a focus of any FSP-related event.  ""When we first opened registration for PorcFest X [this year's festival], it was through Eventbrite and payment was credit card-only. Within minutes we had a request for a bitcoin payment, and had that set up within a day. All told, probably a quarter of our registrations and sponsorships came in through BitPay,"" she said.  Vine went on to say she and her fellow organisers made arrangements so those who turned up on the day without tickets could buy theirs in bitcoins, plus the majority of vendors at the festival accepted digital currency.  She added:  ""Some people don't even know what bitcoin is when they arrive at an FSP event, but by the time they leave, most are well-informed and many have even gotten help opening and funding wallets.""  A bitcoin-themed tent called the BitTent hosted a number of music performances, talks and panel discussions at the festival this year. Economist and libertarian theorist David Friedman gave a talk in the BitTent and, by the end of the festival was spotted buying bitcoins using Lamassu's Bitcoin ATM.  Among the sponsors of the festival were SatoshiDice and Coinapult, but this is perhaps no surprise as these companies were founded by FSP member Erik Voorhees.  He explained in a blog post earlier in the year that he first learned about bitcoin when he moved to New Hampshire to join the FSP in 2011. He now lives in Panama City, but still coordinates the Free State Bitcoin Consortium group and attended PorcFest X, moderating a panel discussion titled Bitcoin: How to Subvert Your Government.  Vine said bitcoin is already a success within the FSP community, so once the 20,000 members goal is reached and they all move to New Hampshire, we could witness the rise of the world's first neighbourhoods that use bitcoins as their primary currency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/01/free-state-project-members-now-able-to-pay-rent-in-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ed1dba45da77d6442cc690e98cab68b87f807e9-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397258,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4QZ,1380628817,Hive OSX bitcoin wallet promises app integration,"A team of developers is hoping to spread bitcoin to the non-technical Mac community with a new wallet, called Hive. The software, still in alpha, is designed specifically for new bitcoin users.      The system has been written with ease of use in mind, according to the developers, who introduced it on the Bitcoin Talk forum earlier this week. It includes an address book, so that people can send bitcoins to people in their contacts list.      It also features an integrated application platform that lists other online services and bitcoin-related sites, such as Bitstamp and SatoshiDice. The idea is for services to develop Hive-enabled apps that drop straight into the OSX application, enabling tight integration.      For example, being able to buy and sell bitcoins from an exchange without leaving the wallet would make it easier to promote bitcoin to new users.      An example integrated BitStamp app shows a customer balance, along with a bitcoin price, and provides the option to deposit, withdraw, and trade bitcoins from within the wallet interface.      The application is being developed under an open source GPL license on GitHub. It uses BitcoinKit, a software framework developed by the team behind Hive, designed for creating bitcoin wallet apps using the OSX Cocoa framework.      It also uses bitcoinj, which is a Java implementation of the bitcoin client, and includes support for the Tor anonymous browsing network, using the TorKit protocol, developed by the same team.      There is also a serious possibility that the software could be enhanced with support for litecoin, said a representative for the development team.      ""Charles said that 'bitcoinj' for litecoin is presently in development. So, once that is released, it will be fairly trivial for us to add support.""      Significantly, the system also includes a Simplified Verification Protocol (SPV) back end, meaning that users won’t have to download the block chain to get started with the wallet.      The OSX wallet project is an important one, given the relatively large share of OSX users online.      According to research firm Net Market Share, Macintosh users make up 7.28% of those online. There are other wallets available for OSX, in particular MultiBit and Electrum, and of course Bitcoin QT, but each of these is operating system-agnostic, being available for Linux and Windows in addition to the Mac.      The team that developed the software has said that it is focused on Mac, primarily, meaning that the interface can be tailored to the operating system, creating a more intuitive and appealing experience for OSX users.      This interface, in addition to the integrated application platform, has elicited largely positive comments from Bitcoin.org members so far.      That said, the development team has emphasized that as an early beta product, the OSX wallet is still not ready for prime time, and should be used mainly for testing purposes.

42397257,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4RY,1380623594,KnCMiner begins shipping of Jupiter bitcoin mining rigs,"KnCMiner has finished production of its Jupiter bitcoin mining rigs and has started shipping to customers.  The Sweden-based company revealed in a YouTube video that the Jupiter will mine at over 550 GH/s with a theoretical limit of around 576 GH/s, which is considerably higher than the 400 GH/s promised back in July.  In the video, KnCMiner co-founders Sam Cole and Marcus Erlandsson show off the Jupiter rig in action and demonstrate its hashing power.  ""It has been a long summer and to have predicted our own deadline from five months out and hit it with 45 minutes to spare just proves how hard we have worked over the last few months,"" Cole told CoinDesk.  He went on to say the KnCMiner team has enjoyed proving to the community that it is possible to produce rigs in a short timeframe and encouraged them to push all existing and new hardware companies to deliver on their promises.  Cole said the company is now focusing on producing as many boxes through its production facility as possible. He added:    ""We have 22 stations manned by assembly experts to make sure we can keep on top of the orders and have the boxes ship as soon as possible.      Our engineers have also been working through the night to tune the power consumption and the latest test indicates that we will have a much better result than 1.4 watts at the wall.""    Cole explained that if the team can make the firmware stable it will pass on all savings to its customers.  Back in August, KnCMiner ran a competition to find a slogan for its controller board, and the winning phrase has now been revealed as ""The whole world, only one block apart"", which was suggested by BitcoinTalk.org forum member D.Wolk.  Cole said he would like to thank D.Wolk and everyone who has offered encouragement to KnCMiner: ""We would like to thank all of our customers who believed in us since the start all those months ago. It has been a wild ride and we really appreciate all the support we have been given.""  He concluded that he is looking forward to unveiling the plans for the company's Gen 1.5 and Gen 2 devices in the coming months.  Are you waiting for a Jupiter to be delivered? Let us know what you think of it when it arrives.
