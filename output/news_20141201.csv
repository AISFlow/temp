42377854,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oK5,1417474205,Gems Crowdsale Raises Over $111k for Crypto Social Messaging Service,"Gems, the recently announced bitcoin-powered, decentralized social network, ended the invite-only portion of its public crowdsale today, raising roughly $111,000 over the two-week period.  The Gems presale is the first crowdsale to be held on Koinify, the decentralized application development platform that raised $1m from investors including IDG Capital Partners, Brock Pierce's AngelList syndicate and zPark Ventures in September. As such, the crowdsale, which has now opened to the public, is being billed as one of the best supported effort by the bitcoin community to launch a viable crowdfunding platform.  In total, roughly 5 million Gems tokens (XGEM) were sold during the invite-only period at a rate of 17,250 XGEM per 1 BTC (about $0.02 cents per token at current market rates). The first presale period, which started on 21st November, was open to any buyer that signed up to receive notice via the Gems or Koinify website.  Gems tokens will be used to incentivize users to join the platform, enabling them to potentially profit from the increased use of the network as a whole.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Gems lead developer Daniel Peled and Koinify head of media Dario Mutabdzija sought to frame the launch as evidence of consumer satisfaction with the Koinify platform and interest in the Gems project.  Peled said:  ""Over 10% of the tokens have already been sold and 700 new Koinify wallets have been opened, we are super excited.""  At press time, Gems had sold nearly 7 million XGEMs over the course of its entire presale, an amount worth roughly $152,000.  The strong early buyer support for the Gems platform is notable given the recent waning interest in initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the altcoin space, an event the cryptoequity community has tried to position as different from a token sale.  For example, the poker all-star backed gambling platform Breakout Gaming raised just $136,000 during the first month of its public sale of its unique altcoin, a factor it attributed to the current weak cryptocurrency investing climate.  Buyers on the fence  Despite the strong initial showing, Peled indicated that he expects buyer interest in the crowdsale to increase as it nears the end of the current ""Early Bird"" period that allows all buyers to receive invite-only prices on Gems tokens.  Peled cited buyer behavior observed during the crowdsale for crypto 2.0 platform Ethereum as evidence for this belief.  ""If you look at Ethereum, 90% of the buys were at the last minute of the best price before it rose,"" he said. ""People want the best price possible, so a lot of people are getting their wallets ready and watching.""  Mutabdzija continued, adding:  ""With crowdsales, there's a bit of this psychological effect. One of the decisive factors for buyers is to see how many other people purchase and join.""  Koinify claims that an analysis of its transaction history revealed that 300 unique participants had so far taken part in the sale. Unique participants were defined as those who provided unique addresses when purchasing.  The Early Bird period of crowdsale is set to end at 8:00 BST on 3rd December. At this point, the price of Gems tokens will increase to 15,000 XGEM per 1 BTC.  Until then, both Koinify and Gems indicated their resolved to ensure the token sale is ""smooth and transparent"".  Analyzing feedback  Gems and Koinify noted that they have been working hard to manage both the technical and commercial sides of crowdsale process, with the Gems team even flying to San Francisco for the event.  Mutabdzija described the crowdsale as a ""24-hour enterprise"" that finds both teams putting in extra hours to ensure the buying process remains smooth. The Koinify website experienced some downtime during the first hours of the general sale, however, the team said these have since been corrected.  ""We're pretty satisfied with the performance so far. It is our first crowdsale, so we're tweaking, fixing things, the usual procedures,"" Mutabdzija said.  Notably, Peled indicated that Gems had so far received only one request about its lengthy terms and conditions, which require users to attest that they are authorized to purchase Gems tokens in their jurisdiction and that they are experts in cryptocurrency.  At least one prominent community member, dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer, took to Twitter to encourage buyers away from the sale.  Peled, in turn, defended the project and the steps it has taken to promote greater transparency.  ""At Gems we have been very transparent with every stage of the project: being public with our identities, having an unmoderated Bitcoin Talk thread, an AMA on Reddit, podcast interviews, a Google hangout and more,"" Peled said. ""We want to build a community around Gems and the only way to do that is to be as open and honest with our users.""  A Google Hangout discussing the crowdsale will take place at 4:00 am BST today.

42377845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oCX,1417456154,Bitcoin Fund Manager Faces HSBC Account Closure,"Global Advisors, a firm based in Jersey that manages the first regulated bitcoin fund, has been served notice by its bank, HSBC.  The firm said it received a notice from HSBC indicating that the company's bank account would be closed in 60 days. A meeting with HSBC personnel at the firm's office in Jersey revealed that the bank feared Global Advisors' account was at risk of potential money laundering.  ""We heard that our risk profile is not really happening for them,"" said Jean-Marie Mognetti, a partner with the firm.  Invested funds unaffected  Mognetti stressed that the HSBC account being closed does not affect client funds invested in the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment (GABI) Fund. The affected account is used for Global Advisors' operations.  Additionally, he said, the Bitcoin Investment Fund's account is not controlled by Global Advisors, but by an independent administrator, a firm called Moore Management Ltd.  Mognetti declined to say what bank the Bitcoin Investment Fund worked with, citing client privacy. He did however indicate that it was not a bank in Jersey, saying his firm had approached HSBC and other banks on the island when the fund was being set up, only to be turned down by all of them.  ""GABI the fund has never banked with HSBC. Nothing within the HSBC story impacts GABI,"" Mognetti said.  HSBC would not confirm or deny that Global Advisors held an account with it, saying it does not confirm whether a business is a customer or has been in the past.  The bank told CoinDesk:  ""In reviewing our portfolio, we have identified a number of relationships that don't meet our strategic criteria. We don't take the commercial decision to end a customer relationship lightly, and when we do so it follows careful consideration of that relationship in light of our strategic focus or global risk management standards.""  Mognetti said Global Advisor had banked with HSBC for 15 years. The firm launched its bitcoin fund four months ago, after it gained approval from Jersey's financial services regulator.  Banks averse to bitcoin  Firms in the digital currency business globally are facing fierce headwinds in their attempts to obtain banking relationships.  In September, a merchant services firm called CTS that served bitcoin businesses in the Isle of Man, an British Crown dependency like Jersey, was pressured by the banks it worked with to cut ties to its digital currency clients.  Startups dealing in bitcoin in the United States are also struggling to get banking relationships, CoinDesk found in September.  Mognetti declined to speculate on whether HSBC served his firm notice because of its newly launched bitcoin fund.  He did say, however:  ""It will come as no surprise to anybody in Jersey involved in bitcoin activity that HSBC is not really pro-bitcoin.""  Targeting bitcoin business  Jersey has moved to establish itself as a bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction. The local regulator's approval of GABI was seen a harbinger of a new growth engine for the island's flagging financial services sector. Furthermore, its government has funded a group called Digital Jersey to promote digital currency businesses.  Jersey's main competition comes from other offshore jurisdictions like the Isle of Man, which has been aggressive in courting digital currency companies, and is even looking into accepting bitcoin payments for taxes and government services.

42377858,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oP7,1417450013,Bitcoin Startup CoinJar Cites Tax as Influence on UK Relocation,"Australian bitcoin exchange and payment processor CoinJar has announced it is relocating its headquarters to the UK as of today.  The company's move has been rumored for some time, especially after the Australian Tax Office (ATO) announced in August that bitcoin trades involving Australia-based exchanges would be subject to the 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST).  In a statement posted online, CoinJar described the move as ""part of a global expansion that will will provide customers more freedom to buy, sell and use bitcoin as a global digital currency, adding:  ""Aside from catalysing CoinJar’s growth, the UK relocation will mean CoinJar customers will no longer be subject to 10 per cent GST (Goods and Services Tax) when they buy bitcoin using our services.""  The new entity is officially incorporated as a UK company called CoinJar UK Limited, and is based in London's financial district.  Notably, though, CoinJar promised to maintain a ""strong presence"" in Australia through its Melbourne office, and said it would continue to play a role in the local community through meetup groups and support for local businesses.  Service redesign  At the same time as its relocation announcement, CoinJar also revealed a redesigned and simplified user interface for its web-based services.  Customers can now see and spend balances in bitcoin, dollars and on the company's own 'Swipe' debit cards on a single page. Funds can be easily transferred between each balance, making the process of buying bitcoin as simple as moving funds from the dollar balance into the bitcoin one.  See the company's explanatory video below:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoxziWA9BXc  Bitcoin and sales tax  While businesses appreciated the ATO's attention and its legitimization of bitcoin business for tax purposes, the notion of paying GST first to acquire bitcoin and then again when using it to make purchases has been unpopular among bitcoin advocates in Australia.  Singapore's Inland Revenue Authority (IRAS) made a similar ruling in January, with bitcoin businesses there also raising objections.  The UK's tax department, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), announced in February it would exclude digital currency trading from its own sales tax, the Value Added Tax (VAT). This ruling has made the UK an enticing location for bitcoin businesses and potentially makes London a hub for bitcoin startup activity.  CoinJar said it couldn't comment on what tax liabilities its Australian customers might still face, and advised them to seek advice from an accountant or tax professional on how its relocation would affect their businesses.

42377852,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oIp,1417441744,Spondoolies-Tech CEO Talks New ASICs and a 'Blockchain Lottery' Device,"Over the weekend, CoinDesk caught up with Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem to discuss development of the firm's third- and fourth-generation ASIC bitcoin mining chips.  Last month the Israel-based bitcoin ASIC designer announced two upcoming chip designs and the raising of $5m as part of its ongoing Series B funding round.  Corem honed his skills working as a software and firmware engineer at Intel. Notably, the Spondoolies-Tech headquarters is located just a couple of minutes away from Intel's 22nm foundry in Kiryat Gat.  The CEO was keen to talk about the company's ASIC roadmap for 2015 and elaborate on his company's plans for the imminent transition to FinFET transistors.  Spondoolies-Tech  is currently working on two separate designs: a 28nm ASIC set to launch in early 2015, followed by fourth-generation chips manufactured using an unspecified FinFET node.  Most cryptocurrency ASIC companies do not disclose their manufacturing partners and Spondoolies is no exception. Instead of describing the new chip as a 14nm or 16nm design, which would more or less identify the foundry, Corem prefers to use ""advanced process"" FinFET terminology.  Skipping the 20nm node  Corem indicated that Spondoolies has made a conscious decision to skip the 20nm node altogether.  The 20nm process, currently offered by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung, is seen as an intermediate process on the way to 14nm/16nm FinFET nodes.  The 20nm node offers much higher gate density relative to 28nm nodes and, unlike FinFET processes, is already available for high volume production. The 20nm LP node is currently used on Apple A8 chips, the latest Samsung Exynos series System-on-Chip designs and Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 810 processor, which will power most flagship phones next year.  However, while the 20nm process offers significant leakage reduction relative to 28nm nodes, theoretical speed is compromised by the use of very small planar transistors.  As a result, many companies are skipping the 20nm node for high-performance chips, such as flagship GPUs; leaving the 20nm node for use in power-efficient mobile application processors and modems, not high performance 'big core' chips.  Spondoolies-Tech has decided to stick with the mature 28nm node for its third-generation ASIC, despite the fact that the company's first FinFET chip will ship a couple of months after rivals will have launched their 16nm FinFET ASICs.  ""We have our own third-generation design, still 28nm, which will be comparable to their 16nm designs,"" said Corem.  He added that the third generation is set to launch in late Q1, or at the beginning of Q2, next year. This points to a March/April timeframe.  The use of a mature node offers a number of advantages, Corem explained. Sixteen-nanometre wafers are twice as expensive as 28nm versions, production is much slower due to limited capacity and mature processes offer better yields in general.  While FinFET nodes offer significant performance improvements, mature nodes still make sense from a financial perspective.  Corem said:  ""The two most important factors in this industry are: GH/s/mm2 – it's a $/GH/s measurement – die density in terms of GH/s, which is a measure of the Capex needed, and of course J/GH (W/GH/s), which is a measure of the Opex needed. A third, often overlooked parameter is the wafer percentage of the total miner BOM (bill of material).""  Cost-cutting measures  Corem pointed out that Spondoolies-Tech is also looking into different ways of keeping deployment and operating costs low.  He outlined two concepts that should be implemented next year:  ""Our next miner form factor allows replaceable hashing boards. On top of that, we are experimenting with innovative low-cost development methods.""  The modular approach will allow customers to re-use the entire platform apart from the hashing boards, thus reducing upgrade costs.  Spondoolies-Tech's next-generation platform will not be suitable for home mining, however, as it will feature 10 hashing boards, each with its own PSU.  At the same time, Spondoolies-Tech hopes to support network decentralisation by adding so-called 'smart property' ASICs to its portfolio. These products should appear in the second half of 2015, but information is limited.  'Blockchain lottery' device  The company is also involved in the development of another unconventional product, described as a 'blockchain lottery' device.  The Technobit Dice is a small 150 GH/s desktop USB miner based on Spondoolies' old RockerBox ASIC. While not a competitive chip at the current difficulty level, the €78 device is designed to help decentralise the network and put some hashing power back in the hands of individuals rather than industrial-scale miners.  The Dice can be used as an entry-level miner, but that's not what it's all about. Installing custom software allows the Dice to act as a blockchain lottery device, giving the user a 150/300,000,000 chance to win 25 BTC every 10 minutes.  It uses a standard ATX PSU or 10A brick PSU, provided by the user, and offers a power efficiency at 150 GH/s of 0.7W per GH/s. While the Dice does not offer breathtaking performance, it offers an incentive for enthusiasts to get back into the mining game without having to invest thousands of dollars in cutting-edge hardware.  For more on the available 14nm and 16nm FinFET manufacturing options, see CoinDesk's coverage of KnCMiner's Solar announcement.

42377862,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73oRd,1417435631,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin Stable Amid Global Oil and Metals Crash,"All was quiet in the bitcoin markets this week, with price and trading volume both remaining relatively flat.  The bitcoin price opened the week at $375.24 and climbed just under $2 to close the week at $377.09, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Bitcoins traded across all exchanges tracked by Bitcoinity fell slightly by 2.4%. The number of coins that changed hands for the week ending 30th November stood at 3.59 million, while the previous week saw 3.68 million bitcoins traded.  Despite that total figure, however, the drop on most major exchanges was more pronounced. Bitstamp and BTC-e, for example, recorded 20% and 17% drops in volume, respectively. Bucking the trend were ANXBTC and Huobi, which both reported increases in traded volume of 12%.  Commodity markets crash  While Citi's chief economist, Willem Buiter, might think bitcoin is a special kind of commodity that is closest to gold, the wider commodity markets weren't having as tranquil a week as the cryptocurrency.  Gold itself slid to a five-year low after voters in the Swiss referendum Buiter was commenting on rejected a bid to boost the central bank's reserves of the precious metal.  Market watchers had been expecting a spike in gold prices if the Swiss national bank was forced to take on gold hoarding measures. Instead, the gold price fell by a further 2% on the news of the scuppered referendum.  Another shiny metal, copper, saw its futures contracts plunge to a four-year low before the weekend began, taking with it lead and nickel.  Metal prices are simply obeying the market's law of gravity, of course, because the price of oil – the world's key commodity – has plummeted. Last Thursday the world's major oil producing nations made the surprise decision to maintain production levels, which has pushed the price of Brent crude further downward to $68.  The slide in oil prices has been so steep that analysts are predicting a world where oil costs $40 a barrel – a fall of nearly 40% so far this year.  Declining ruble boosting bitcoin?  The steep declines in the wider commodity markets may be contributing to upward pressure on the bitcoin price.  The peer-to-peer marketplace known as LocalBitcoins, popular among traders who wish to preserve their privacy, has enjoyed an increase in reported trading volume of late.  One LocalBitcoins currency pair has caught the eye of Jon Matonis, former head of the Bitcoin Foundation, who pointed out that trading volume in BTC-Rubles on the site has been on a steady upward trend.    Volume on @LocalBitcoins rises dramatically as the the Ruble continues downward slide http://t.co/5BbJrU8wyk #bitcoin #Russia      — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) November 28, 2014    BTC-Rubles traded on LocalBitcoins has risen steadily on the one-year chart, with a sharper rise from around July onwards. A quick glance at the ruble's major currency pairs shows why: the ruble has lost some 30% of its value against the euro and the dollar over the past year. The oil shock will likely hasten the currency's slide.  According to Bloomberg, oil and gas make up 68% of Russia's exports and half its federal budget, so the drop in the price of oil will put further pressure on the nation's economy and currency. So far, $90bn of Russia's currency reserves have already been used to prop up the price of the ruble this year.  Other news  A major LocalBitcoins trader has observed another trend on the peer-to-peer marketplace. According to the trader, who goes by 'OscarjamesBTC', the British pound used to be the most traded currency in on the market. Not anymore. Now US dollar trading has claimed the top spot on the site, he said.  A look at the one-year charts for both currencies shows that US-dollar trading began to climb above trading in pounds sometime in March. The last two quarters have seen US-dollar trading on LocalBitcoins climb steadily, with a pronounced rise in September that has continued to sustain itself.  OscarjamesBTC said that trading volumes in the pound market have been flat, as major buyers and miners stay away, awaiting the next bull run. Volume from small buyers has remained consistent, he said. It's worth noting that the UK has 7,511 traders while the US has 29,329 traders, according to LocalBitcoins statisticshttps://localbitcoins.com/statistics.

According to Eli Dourado of the Mercatus Centre, who maintains the Bitcoin Volatility Index, the digital currency is shedding its volatility over time. His measure shows that bitcoin volatility has been on a steadily declining trend since 2010.
