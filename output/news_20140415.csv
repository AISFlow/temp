42377140,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBZ7,1397603192,Potential Mt. Gox Buyer: Exchange Has Important Role in Bitcoin's Future,"The latest attempt to bring bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox back to life appears to be a serious one.  William Quigley, managing director of Santa Monica-based venture capital firm Clearstone Venture Partners, is part of a group of investors aiming to resuscitate the collapsed exchange. He recently appeared on CNBC to talk about the bid.  Quigley's fellow investors include John Betts, a former Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs executive, and venture capitalist Brock Pierce. The proposal, which offered to purchase Mt. Gox for just 1 BTC, first surfaced on 10th April.  Said Quigley:  ""You have to understand, of course, that Mt. Gox is much more that just [its] assets [...] The company still has a very important role in the continuation of bitcoin.""  As part of the plan put forth by Quigley and his fellow investors, Betts would serve as the new Mt. Gox CEO.  Mt. Gox's precarious state  In the interview, Quigley acknowledged that Mt. Gox had losses that amounted ""to the tune of several hundred million dollars"". However, he said he believes that the reason why the exchange was plagued by so many problems can be attributed to its own lax practices.  He explained:  ""The company didn’t start as a bitcoin exchange. The measures that we would all put in place when bitcoin is worth $1,000, those weren’t thought important when bitcoin was trading at a penny or 10 cents.""  Quigley said that the 1 BTC payment for the failed exchange is simply a token, stating:  ""I want to put the one bitcoin term in context. That is a symbolic amount. It’s akin to what we do in the US when we buy a business that has a negative net worth.""  Investments in bitcoin  The amount of VC investment in bitcoin has made Quigley take an interest in reviving Mt. Gox.  In the past month alone, bitcoin companies such as Circle and Kraken have received millions of dollars to ramp up their respective operations. “Silicon Valley is investing a lot of money in a lot of bitcoin businesses,” Quigley said.  He added:  ""I would say there really is a great future for bitcoin. My belief is that we have a tremendous opportunity, at least certainly in the next year.""  Quigley went on to compare the amount of investment in the bitcoin industry to the early days of the Internet, a popular comparison that has been widely invoked by bitcoin supporters.  Further, Quigley believes the current legal proceedings in Japan will allow his group of investors to bring the exchange back to life. ""I want to point out that Mt. Gox is not in a traditional bankruptcy liquidation process: it’s in a civil rehabilitation process,"" he said.  His course of action to reboot Mt. Gox was simple:  ""Our plan, of course, is to take the exchange, fix the security issues and rehabilitate it.""  To learn more about Quigley's bid for Mt. Gox, watch the full CNBC interview below.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/15/potential-mt-gox-buyer-exchange-has-important-role-in-bitcoins-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0aaf38ea3a862e90cd0d798cc3e40106a4b07008-1310x794.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377133,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBP3,1397599820,Price of Bitcoin Tops $500 as China Fears Subside,"The price of bitcoin continued its upward trend on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) today, rising roughly 9% to top $500.  As of press time, the price had increased roughly $43 over the course of the day, climbing from a low of $452.17 to a high of $514.72.  The recent recovery, sparked by comments from People's Bank of China (PBOC) governor Zhou Xiaochuan, continued as the 15th April deadline allegedly imposed by the central bank came and went without any additional account closures or adverse actions taken against the major exchanges.  In recent weeks, a number of Chinese exchanges reported that their banking providers had received notice that the PBOC would tightly enforce guidance meant to better separate the country's state-backed financial system from the nascent bitcoin industry.  In response to this perceived threat, account closures were reported at BTCTrade, BTC100 and Huobi, among other exchanges.  The price hit a low of $380 on 11th April, however it has been trending upward following Xiaochuan's confirmation that the PBOC did not intend to ban bitcoin.  China market sees similar recovery  The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk CNY BPI was also up roughly 9% for the day, rising ¥277.61 at press time to reach ¥3,158.38.  This figure was up from the opening price of ¥2,880.77, but down slightly from a high of ¥3,173.48 observed earlier in the day.  The CoinDesk CNY BPI incorporates prices at major China-based exchanges BTC China and OKCoin.  Confidence rises in China  Since much of the bitcoin's price decline was spurred by fears related to regulation in China, the lack of action by the PBOC is likely to be the primary motivator for the recent increase.  The potential change in policy was first reported by Chinese financial news site Caixin in March, however, to date, no documents have surfaced to confirm that the PBOC was looking to take such action.  Major Chinese exchanges such as Huobi and OKCoin, however, were exploring any and all possibilities should the PBOC take action against their services, even openly suggesting that they were making preparations to move operations overseas if necessary.  However, it should be noted that the PBOC has yet to confirm or deny any additional actions against exchanges, meaning it is unknown exactly what the future may hold for the country's bitcoin businesses.

42377146,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBgf,1397596518,"US Exchange CoinMKT Launches API, Adds USD/Dogecoin Trading","Los Angeles-based digital currency exchange CoinMKT has launched an API to provide advanced access to its platform.  The company offers trading between 10 different digital currencies and USD – and that now also includes dogecoin.  Travis Skweres, the CEO of CoinMKT, told CoinDesk that the API is a step towards getting professional traders and hedge funds using the exchange.  Explained Skweres:  ""There’s a huge need for institutional trading. Our long-term strategy is companies and institutional traders.""  API  Skweres said that up to this point CoinMKT had been mostly a retail operation focused on individual customers. Now, the exchange's API brings new functions to the platform such as programming trade engines.  Being a US-based exchange means that the company’s API offers a first-mover opportunity.  Skweres said:  “I don’t mind if CoinMKT is the invisible exchange house. That doesn’t matter to me. I’ll be invisible and exchange everything.”  A number of companies exist in the more institutional space that CoinMKT is attempting to break into with its API. New York-based Coinsetter is a trading platform with access to Bitstamp for professional investors that want to move in and out of the bitcoin market.  Palo Alto-based Vaurum is another example of a company that wants to fill a need that exists for investors and traders. Vaurum plans to offer an exchange that can plug into more established trading platforms.  Dogecoin  CoinMKT also recently added dogecoin to its exchange, which brings its total trading pairs to USD up to 10. In addition to bitcoin, altcoins of note on the exchange include litecoin, feathercoin and namecoin.  While dogecoin is generally used for tipping purposes, there aren’t many avenues for digital currency investors to obtain doge with USD like they can on CoinMKT.  Skweres said: “Most of the altcoin trading is still to bitcoin, it’s not to the dollar. There is not a massive market for doge to dollars.”  Even so, he said that he believes dogecoin offers something new and innovative. He thinks the decision to allow doge to continue to generate new coins to reward miners will propel the altcoin to future success:  ""Doge wasn’t really innovative until they added the inflationary aspect, which is awesome. So, now I think actually doge is a serious alternative.""  Dogecoin's use as an online tipping mechanism is also a strong suit, said Skweres: ""It has such a strong community it might accidentally become the amazing currency of the internet.""  Commissions  CoinMKT has decided to decrease its fees in order to entice users to trade, lowering commission to 0.3%. The company said that market makers will now receive a 0.05% rebate.  Exchanges such as itBit and BTC China have also lowered fees recently – Skweres cited Mt. Gox as a contributing factor.  ""We're finally seeing how bad Mt. Gox really hurt everybody. The other exchanges, including us, we benefitted in the short term from getting an influx of signups.""  Despite the increase in registrations, it was only a brief rush, according to Skweres, who's concerned about bitcoin’s ability to break through to the masses given the number of negative headlines that have been linked to decentralized money:  “It really hurt perception. Mainstream adoption has slowed down a little bit.”  Even so, CoinMKT's strategy of developing an exchange for many different digital currencies will not change. ""I’m still bullish on altcoins because I think we’re so early in the game,"" said Skweres.  Detailed information about CoinMKT’s API is available on the company’s website.

Bitcoin 2014, a European conference held in association with the Bitcoin Foundation, has released a schedule of planned events via its website.  The conference  will be held from 15-17th May at Passenger Terminal Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock and the largest retailer to currently accept bitcoin, was previously announced as a keynote speaker.  Additional speakers will include CircleCEO Jeremy Allaire, BTC China CEO Bobby Lee and Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist and former lead developer Gavin Andresen.  Based on the schedule, discussions at the event will center on building the digital economy, bitcoin opportunities and international implications.  The conference will begin with a welcome reception on 15th May at 6pm local time.  Highlights  The schedule for Bitcoin 2014 is divided into four distinct categories: ""The Digital Economy"", ""Bitcoin Technology: Present and Future"", ""Rules of the Game: The Legal Landscape"" and ""Enterprising in the Digital Age: Merchant and Consumer Services"".  Andresen will present his Annual State of Bitcoin Address on the first day of the event.  Other day-one sessions of note include a panel on bitcoin wallets featuring CoinDesk's Kadhim Shubber, Blockchain.info's Nicolas Cary, Kipochi founder Pelle Braendgaard, Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson and Xapo CEO Wences Casares.  The second day of Bitcoin 2014 will kick off with Bobby Lee hosting a session on bitcoin in Asia.

42377149,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBjB,1397590512,Bitcoin-Funded Dating App Develops After December Price Surge,"Gregor Amon, whose company Simply Travel accepts bitcoin, used the proceeds from the currency's ascent into the $1,000 range to fund Sumtu, a new iOS app with ambitions to transform the way we date.  Last year, Amon looked at bitcoin as an option for his travel business. “Bitcoin was already interesting to me in those days,” he said.  He reached out to Austin and Beccy Craig, the Utah couple that not only lived on bitcoin for 90 days, but also traveled using nothing but the currency – no easy feat.  Upon hearing about the couple's plans, Amon offered to provide a travel agency service that would accept bitcoin to facilitate flights and hotels to be paid in the cryptocurrency.  “When we got them, they were about $100 each,” said Amon late last September, when the price was not increasing by much. “I thought, at least they are not decreasing.”  The price of bitcoin skyrocketed in 2013 to a high of $1,147.25 in early December.  Funding the app  Amon had the foresight to seize the rising price of bitcoin as an opportunity. He said it seemed like a perfect convergence of events at the time:  ""Bitcoin was up to $1,000. I thought it was a good time to finance the dating app ... We just used our bitcoin because of the raise in value and just had enough money to get Sumtu up and running.”  He paid a lawyer in bitcoins to develop written privacy policies for the app, but had trouble finding developers he could pay in bitcoin – that might have been fortunate considering its current price.  Amon said he sold a good number of coins in the $900-$1,000 range. However, the price has dropped considerably since then.  What is Sumtu?  Sumtu uses Apple's iBeacon to apply Bluetooth Low Energy to proximity by broadcasting out a unique identifier.  People mostly meet significant others among friends, coworkers and business partners, Amon noted. The Sumtu app helps people find potential mates in social settings. The idea sprung from the notion that most dating apps are designed to match strangers people would probably never meet otherwise. Amon said:  ""That’s where the idea evolved: you take away the fear of public rejection by this double blind matching tool. But you are matching somebody you already know.""  Bitcoin-funded ideas  Cryptocurrencies are used more and more to fund startups. The Boost Bitcoin Fund, which was used to accelerate seven bitcoin startups last summer in Silicon Valley, held 25% of its value in bitcoin and the rest in cash.  Hive  , a user-friendly bitcoin wallet was also bitcoin-funded. The company took investment from Seedcoin as well as Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor.  As with other entrepreneurs that have capitalized on the success of a cryptocurrency, bitcoin helped Anon realise what was once just an idea. Now comes the hard part: increasing user adoption.  Sumtu is now available in the Apple App Store. The Android version is set to follow at the end of this month.

42377135,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBSp,1397587820,'Emergency Hearing' Could Lead to New Discoveries in Mt. Gox Case,"Mark Karpeles, CEO of bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, has filed an emergency motion stating that he needs more time before choosing whether to appear for formal questioning in the US.  The development finds Karpeles attempting to push back this decision until 5th May so that his legal team can ""get up to speed"" on a recent subpoena issued by the US Treasury department.  While a seemingly small filing, the Mt. Gox case could change dramatically depending on whether Karpeles agrees to be deposed in the US. That's because US Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Jernigan ordered Karpeles to submit to questioning on 2nd April, and threatened to remove key bankruptcy protections granted to Mt. Gox KK, the company's Japanese entity, should he not do so.  According to Steve Woodrow, a partner at Edelson law firm, the agency overseeing the US class action against Mt. Gox his team would be able to step up its fact-finding efforts, if that protection was eliminated.  Said Woodrow:  ""In the event that the stay will be lifted, we will proceed to the Northern District of Illinois and we'll ask that the expedited discovery and asset freeze that has been implemented for non-debtors be extended to Mt. Gox KK as well.""  Whether this comes to pass may be determined tomorrow, following what Woodrow called ""an emergency hearing"" related to Karpeles' recent filing to be held at 14:30 GMT in Dallas, Texas.  Increased discovery efforts  As of now, Woodrow indicates that his legal team has only been able to conduct research related to Mt. Gox Inc., the company's US entity, Tibanne KK and Mark Karpeles personally, which has somewhat limited their ability to build a case against the insolvent exchange.  Should restrictions be lifted, this could open up efforts to learn more about Mt. Gox's discovery of an old-format bitcoin wallet on 21st March containing 200,000 BTC, for example, among other things.  At the time, Woodrow's partner Chris Dore suggested that the finding was one that was not only ""highly suspect"", but that ""made it harder"" for information to be obtained about the funds.  Possible action in US  In the filing, Karpeles insinuated that he may not be able to make the trip due to obligations stemming from a subpoena issued by the US Treasury Department. This message, sent on 11th April, allegedly did not specify the topics of discussion.  On popular theory about the nature of the subpoena is that US authorities intend to charge Karpeles with criminal wrongdoing and to take him into custody at this time, providing Karpeles with a powerful incentive not visit the US.  However, Woodrow indicated that is unlikely that Judge Jernigan would allow the protection to continue should Karpeles not appear for deposition before the court.  When asked about this possibility, Woodrow remarked:  ""We certainly hope not, that's having your cake and eating it, too. [...] If he violates the order, my hope is that they would withdraw any sort of provisional relief.""  He added: ""But we'll see what happens tomorrow.""

The hardware manufacturer shipped the 1,000th unit in late February. At the time, CoinTerra said its kit powered 6% of the bitcoin network.  However, with 4,000 additional TerraMiner units in the wild, the company's hardware now accounts for more than 15% of the entire network, or roughly 8 petahash of power.  The company shipped its first TerraMiner in late January – claiming that further batches of TerraMiner IV rigs were on schedule.  March orders were fulfilled and the company now says it has shipped the April batch of orders to customers ahead of schedule. CoinTerra is now selling its new miners from stock.  Discounted miners straight from stock  Ravi Iyengar, CEO of CoinTerra, said:  “Deploying eight petahash to the bitcoin network in just ten weeks is an unprecedented achievement. As well as thanking the CoinTerra team, now that we are shipping from stock I wanted to give a big thank you to the entire bitcoin community by offering the TerraMiner IV on sale for a limited time at a very special price.”  So what sort of discount does Iyengar have in mind? The company is marking the occasion by slashing the price of TerraMiner IV units to $4,799, a discount of 20%, or $1,200.  In turn, the miners are already in stock, so they’ll ship in a day or two once an order is placed. To redeem the 20% discount users simply need to use the coupon code 'TMIV5K' at the CoinTerra web shop.  CoinTerra boasts price-per-gigahash lead  CoinTerra maintains that it still enjoys the value-for-money lead in the mining space. It claims to offer an “unbeatable price-per-gigahash” and the 20% discount helps, too.  There is another freebie coming to a lucky miner who decides to take advantage of the sale. CoinTerra's CTO Dr Timo Hanke says he will select a lucky customer from the sale who will receive an additional TerraMiner free of charge.

The British ASIC maker said it has completed the schematics for the ATX power distribution board and of the AC power metering board. Those of the actual ASIC board are not complete yet, but Alpha said it is “almost” done. In addition, the company has finalised the design of the enclosure and WebGUI user interface.  ASIC tape-out initiated  Alpha said it is currently in the process of initiating tape-out at GlobalFoundries. The chip design has been finalised and sent to the foundry for fabrication. According to the latest update, the team managed to reduce power consumption to just 9W per chip.  Alpha Technology CEO Mohammed Akram recently told CoinDesk that the biggest challenge faced by the engineering team is power efficiency, and that the latest updates appear to be focused on power supply and distribution. Alpha optimised the ASIC design with the aid of GlobalFoundries aid in an effort to reduce power consumption – a process that reduced the ASIC clock but increased performance.  The tape-out was originally scheduled for late March.  Real world performance and efficiency  Alpha Technology revised its spec and bumped up the hash rate for its scrypt miners last month. The company was supposed to launch two units: a 5MH/s miner and a 25MH/s miner, but now, it said, the miners will deliver 16MH/s and 90MH/s respectively.  KnCMiner is also entering the scrypt space with the Titan, a 250MH/s miner priced at $9,995. Alpha plans to sell its 25MH/s miner for $2,200, while the 90MH/s unit should cost $9,000.  The Titan will operate with an 800W-1000W power supply unit, KnCMiner said. Alpha originally expected to deliver 10W per 1MH/s, but it believes it can do better, so its 90MH/s miner should consume about 750W.  In any case, the advent of powerful and immensely efficient scrypt ASICs is not good news for GPU miners, as the ASICs will render GPU-based miners uncompetitive in the scrypt arena. GPUs will still be capable of mining certain types of altcoins based on alternative ASIC-proof algorithms, but the market for these altcoins remains limited.

Though Johnson put up respectable numbers during his early career, he became more well known for his off-the-field antics in the late 2000s, notably changing his legal name to Chad Ochocinco in 2008 and then back to Johnson in 2012.  Johnson is expected to work out for the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes next week. He has been out of professional football since he was released by the Miami Dolphins in 2012.  Community reaction  At press time, the tweet had garnered a respectable response on Twitter, earning 31 retweets and 32 favorites.  However, Johnson did receive some misinformation as well, with one user suggesting that bitcoin is not yet taxable.  Other comments directed Johnson to popular tutorial videos and resources, while one user even went so far as to send the NFL star a small amount of bitcoin through the QR code he provided.    @ochocinco just sent you a few fractions of a penny's worth lol but you should get the idea      — Rhymes With Brice (@BeeNyce) April 14, 2014    At press time, Johnson had only garnered around 0.001 BTC, or roughly 50 cents, in contributions.

Sherman and the Seahawks would later win Super Bowl XLVIII, handily defeating Payton Manning and the Denver Broncos 43 to 8.  ""I hear it's the currency of the future,"" Sherman wrote in a Facebook post that quickly drew the attention of bitcoin users and American football fanatics.  That news followed the announcement that the Sacramento Kings NBA franchise would accept the digital currency, becoming the first professional sports team to do so.

Chinese exchange BTC China claims it has no intention of changing the way it does business.  The story has contributed to turbulence in the bitcoin markets since it first began circulating as a rumor last month. Bitcoin saw its value fall beneath $400 briefly for the first time since November 2013. This is despite the People's Bank of China (PBOC) itself insisting it had no intention to ban digital currencies.  Some exchanges have received formal and verbal notices from their banking partners, and there have been reports Chinese companies are looking to move some of their operations offshore.  No notice  Bobby Lee  , CEO of BTC China, says his exchange has not heard of any changes, either from the central bank or any of the many banks with which it does business.  Business at BTC China will proceed as usual after this week, with customers replenishing their accounts via bank deposits or the 'voucher' system the exchange introduced in response to the first banking scare in December last year.  BTC China's banking partners have reported seeing rumors of a new policy in the media, he said, but that was all.  ""Our situation hasn't changed. We've been talking to banks, the ones we have personal relationships with, and so far we've not received any notice to close our business with them.""  Lee said that all customer funds remained on hand and, even if one of BTC China's banks decided to end its relationship with the company, it would simply move the funds to another account.  Rumors vs reality  There are three important points to remember in this series of events: firstly, despite some stating otherwise, China has not 'banned bitcoin'.  Secondly, any leaked opinions so far referred to funding bitcoin exchange accounts through bank deposits. Bank accounts were never in danger of being frozen, and the ability to withdraw funds from exchanges to bank accounts was not in question. Chinese exchanges also work with multiple banks at a time, with the ability to transfer funds between them.  Thirdly, and most significantly, all reports from China concerning banks and bitcoin exchanges so far are unofficial. To date there has been no ruling or policy statement by the People's Bank of China on the matter, and any actions taken by Chinese banks were precautionary only.  ""We're still fully holding all customer assets, I want to emphasize that,"" Lee continued.  ""There's nothing missing, there's no misappropriation or frozen funds. All our funds are liquid and fully accessible. We don't invest any of our funds in special 'wealth management products', or anything like that. Everything is liquid funds.""  Unspoken rules  The current Chinese attitude might be called a 'tacit policy', in which the government makes no official statements but makes its intentions known via subtle leaks to the media and asides to contacts in the banking industry. Authorities may well disapprove of bitcoin and discuss it with their associates, without the need for any proclamation.  Bitcoin operates in similar environments in other large economies, including the US, where regulatory authorities seem at times permissive towards digital currency innovation and at others less tolerant, depending on the department in question.  Under the status quo, bitcoin service businesses must register as 'money transmitters' in 48 states while the IRS rules bitcoin is property, not money, for taxation purposes.  Voucher funding  BTC China's voucher system, which it pioneered and other Chinese exchanges have used as well, is similar to buying a gift card or prepaid card for iTunes, Google Play or Amazon.  The main difference is the cards can also be used to withdraw funds, and then re-sold for cash to other users to fund accounts. BTC China sells the vouchers directly to resellers, who also sell them online.

42377147,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBe9,1397560860,New Bitcoin POS 'Coin of Sale' Garners Global Attention,"A new bitcoin POS system, Coin of Sale, is trying to make it easier for merchants to accept bitcoin payments for their goods and services.  Created by Singapore-based expat Thomas Forgac, Coin of Sale works with both Android and iOS devices. When users sign up for an account, they are automatically set up with an Electrum wallet.  The merchant must simply enter the amount of money that needs to be charged and the app will automatically generate a QR code for it. The customer then scans this QR code to complete the payment.  This video by the company explains the process in more detail:  [youtube id=""U7qELuyzzOc"" width=""620"" height=""360""]  .  Forgac has been working on this POS system as a passion project since July 2013. However, after being encouraged by the local and the international response it has received, Forgac made it his full-time job at the start of the year.  In the second half of February, he launched a premium version that provides advanced reports and allows management of different outlets.  While the basic service is free of any commission charges, users need to pay 0.59% for the premium account. This service will soon also allow automatic fiat conversion, a feature that is Forgac’s top priority right now.  He added:  “Our current priority is to get the fiat versus Sing [SGD] in place which will allow merchants to withdraw 100% or smaller portions of their digital currency payments. This should help adoption with merchants who are more risk averse.”  The early adopters  The part-gallery part-café, Artistry, was the first place in Singapore to roll out Coin of Sale. CAD Café in the trendy Haji Lane was the next to follow suit. Now, more than 12 merchants in Singapore are using Coin of Sale – including a microbrewery, a printer shop and several restaurants and bars.  Despite the Singapore government’s regulatory crackdown, Forgac says the city-state is a good place to test out his product because of bitcoin’s general popularity here.  “I definitely feel more confident running it here than I would in some other parts of the world. Singapore is much more economically free than most of the world and any new regulation here is introduced gradually without bullying the existing businesses which it falls upon.”  Coin of Sale has also started to make the leap outside the Little Red Dot. A nail salon in Chicago, an independent movie theatre in Amsterdam and a couple of Subway outlets in the Czech Republic are also now using the service. Some of these merchants found out about Coin of Sale and started using the product even before Forgac made it his full-time job.

42377137,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBRZ,1397554216,Neo & Bee CEO Breaks Silence on Alleged Bitcoin Fraud,"Danny Brewster, CEO of Cyprus-based bitcoin company Neo & Bee, has broken his silence, taking to reddit to address some of the rumours that have been circulating about him of late.  Posting on the forum  as 'cryptocyprus', the British-born entrepreneur said the suggestion he has committed fraud is his ""greatest concern"" at the moment.  Earlier this month, Cyprus Mail reported that two customers paid Brewster €15,000 and €20,000 for bitcoins, which they never received.  Further allegations then started flying, claiming Brewster had left Cyprus and defrauded investors. Brewster took to the Bitcoin Talk forum to defend himself and admitted he was out of the country, but stressed that he was away on business.  In his reddit post, He goes on to explain that he sold bitcoins to a number of people prior to Neo & Bee opening to the public, with four of these people requesting that he hold their bitcoins until they provide him a wallet address to send them to.  ""Sorry to disappoint those that believe the tales that I simply took them.... The keys are still stored on paper. The total sales to these 4 people amounts to 75.29270138 BTC which were purchased for a combined total of €35,213.57 so I have no idea where the values reported in the media have been derived from,"" Brewster's reddit post continues.  It goes on to say:    ""I have not received one single request from the individuals who bought the bitcoins from me to send the coins to an address they provided. With one exception a request was made but that was received from the individual that introduced one of the buyers to me, they requested for me to transfer the coins to his Bitstamp account.      I didn't send the coins to his address as he was not the person that I had the agreement with. One of these people went directly to the police following rumors that I had fled the country.""    Brewster claims he has been trying to contact the Criminal Investigation Department of the Cypriot Police for days via both phone and email, but they have not responded.  He goes on to explain why he did not return to Cyprus immediately following the issuance of an arrest warrant:    1. I have a family funeral to attend.      2. The whole situation can be resolved without me doing so.    3. The manner in which the investigations are being carried out are concerning, the police haven't made an attempt to contact me despite numerous personal requests for them to do so.    Brewster suggests that the four customers provide their wallet addresses to the police, who can then forward this information to him. He has instructed a lawyer in Cyprus to facilitate this process.  Personal circumstances  Brewster's reddit post, titled 'The full picture from Danny Brewster', continues by explaining a few facts about his personal circumstances.  It claims he had enough bitcoins in Mt. Gox to pay back all of Neo & Bee's creditors in full, but now that the exchange has closed down, he does not have access to any of these funds.  He also confirms he bought a Bentley in December, which is still in Cyprus. He says he had planned to sell the car this summer, reinvesting the profit into Neo & Bee. Now he will sell the car and put the money towards satisfying the company's creditors.  ""I am concentrating first and foremost on resolving the issues with Cypriot police including my planned return to Cyprus. Only then I will concentrate all of my time on resolving everything surrounding Neo and Bee,"" his post concludes.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/15/neo-bee-ceo-breaks-silence-on-alleged-bitcoin-fraud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40a447e3b101e1eb391615adae65ff6fed060fb5-998x684.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shoppers south of the border can already use bitcoins on the company's US site.  The tech retailer started accepting the currency back in January, just two months later TigerDirect announced that the total volume of its bitcoin sales had surpassed $1m.  Canada could soon join the fun  TigerDirect’s bitcoin rollout appears to have been a success in the US and now it appears that it is about to expand to Canada.  There is still no official announcement, but newsBTC came across a curious entry on www.tigerdirect.ca/bitcoin:  A word of caution – TigerDirect.ca is not explicitly stating that it plans to accept bitcoin, although the “stay tuned” does imply the company is at least considering it.  Keep in mind that TigerDirect’s original announcement came out of nowhere, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see an announcement from TigerDirect Canada soon.

42377148,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zBhv,1397529056,BTC China Launches First 'Soft Bitcoin ATM' Interface for International Markets,"A new web-based app from BTC China called 'Picasso ATM’ allows anyone with a smartphone to become a 'walking bitcoin ATM', without the need to invest thousands of dollars in hardware. Sellers can use the app to upload and sell bitcoins nearly anywhere in the world, in a range of major currencies.  It could be the first of many moves by Chinese bitcoin exchanges to appeal to international customers. BTC China is the most prominent of China's bitcoin exchanges overseas already thanks to its English language interface and its CEO Bobby Lee's appearances at major conferences like CoinSummit.  Until now, however, it has been near impossible for non-Chinese residents to deposit fiat currencies into a BTC China account.  Lee launched the Picasso 'software ATM' at a media event that also saw the launch of China's first physical bitcoin ATM, at the IC Coffee Shop in Shanghai's Pudong Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park.  Sign up and upload  After signing up for an account with BTC China, users can upload bitcoins to their Picasso Wallet, then use the interface to trade like a human teller machine.  If the receiver is not a BTC China customer, the bitcoins can be sent instead to any mobile number worldwide, whereupon the receiver will be invited to sign up for BTC China wallet to receive and store them.  Lee proclaimed the Picasso ATM interface as ""truly innovative"" and ""essentially a world first"", saying it lowered the barrier to entry for anyone thinking of investing in physical bitcoin ATM hardware. He added:  ""Now store owners, coffee shop owners, or even convenience store owners, instead of investing in a bitcoin ATM, they can just sell bitcoins at the cash register with the Picasso ATM.""  Since transactions take place within BTC China's system there are no QR codes to scan, transfers are instant and there's no waiting around for six confirmations to make sure everything was legitimate.  ""Bitcoin has entered into a new era, where exchanges are no longer the only way to buy and sell bitcoins. With the advent of Picasso ATM, along with other physical bitcoin ATMs everywhere, people all over the world can now easily buy and sell bitcoins,"" Lee continued.  ""As a pioneer in the field – BTC China is now the world's longest running bitcoin exchange – we plan to continue innovating, and lead the world into this new era.""  At first glance the process is similar to a face-to-face trade with LocalBitcoins. With Picasso ATM, BTC China says it is looking for a more spontaneous kind of transaction, the kind that takes place at a Satoshi Square event or group meetup.  Long distance reach  The company also wants Picasso ATM to work long-distance between trusted parties who may be in different countries, transferring fiat funds by bank wire or some other intermediary.  UI settings allow a seller to select the currency in which they'd like to be paid, and the percentage profit margin (if any) they'd like to add to the trade price. Available languages are English and Chinese, though there are plans to offer many more.  The Picasso ATM is a mobile web app, so does not require any downloads and is not subject to third party censorship or regulation. It features double-layered security; for bitcoin ATM transactions to complete, the app requires security confirmations from both the buyer and the seller.  BTC China's Picasso online wallet service has been available for a few months already. It promises customers' bitcoins are held in cold storage, with only a small percentage online at a time for daily transactions. Bitcoins can be transferred quickly in and out of Picasso wallets for use on BTC China's main trading platform.
