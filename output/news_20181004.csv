42429735,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1AFh,1538694021,A Multi-Million Dollar Bet Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake Isn't Coming Soon,"What if ethereum never switches its core consensus algorithm?  It's an idea that may sound blasphemous to developers building the world's second-largest blockchain, where plans have long been laid for a transition away from bitcoin's proof-of-work model to a more egalitarian alternative. Yet, entrepreneurs appear to be betting that between now and that bright future, a small fortune might be waiting.  Already, several mining companies have invested millions in building specialized mining chips for ethereum, machinery that will only function as long as the network pays out new cryptocurrency to those who dedicate computing hardware to the effort.  One such investor is Chen Min, CEO and founder of Linzhi, a Shenzhen-based, startup that has spent $4 million in pursuit of designing the fastest specialized mining chip, or ASIC, for ethereum. An industry veteran, Chen was previously the lead ASIC designer at Canaan Creative, one of three (largely bitcoin-focused) mining firms that have dominated the production of crypto hardware over the last decade.  However, she's since departed to try her hand in making machinery for ethereum, already investing amply in the goal.  ""The cost to get to first silicon and sample machines is roughly $4 million. Additionally we have our ongoing cost of operations, salaries, office, which are all modest, lean and efficient,"" Chen said.  Announced in September, Linzhi's ASIC promises to overtake previous ethereum ASIC designs, featuring high improvements to energy efficiency and computing power. Still, the mining chip will only function on ethereum if the blockchain keeps its current code-base.  But Chen isn't too concerned.  ""I don't know if [ethereum] will or will not switch to proof-of-stake,"" she told CoinDesk. ""Proof-of-stake has a lot of problems.""  Evidence exists that Linzhi isn't alone in this position. As detailed in CoinDesk, mining giant Bitmain released its ethereum miner, the Antminer E3, back in March, while Innosocilion announced three ethereum miners in July.  While Chen recognizes the inherent risk of introducing an ASIC in such an unpredictable environment, she told CoinDesk:  ""The information is open, we are not hiding that risk. Our customer can decide to buy or not.""  High-risk climate  Also backing Chen's conviction is the idea that proof-of-work is simply a better system for managing the distribution of cryptocurrency rewards. In this way, Chen described a possible proof-of-stake switch as ""not a smart thing.""  ""There are so many people, so many users, developers and hardware invested in that coin. If they ignore the work that has been done and switch to proof-of-stake, maybe later they can also ignore your stake and switch to proof-of-some other idea,"" Chen said.  But there's other risks facing ASIC mining on ethereum as well.  At a core developer call last week, the engineers behind ProgPoW – a proposal that would change the code to only allow GPU miners as an alternative to ASICs were in attendance. Though still in the proposal stage, if executed, ProgPoW would effectively disable ASICs from mining on ethereum – and momentum is building toward the implementation.  Chen, however, argued that such ideas are little more than knee-jerk reactions, ones that don't actually provide solutions to some of the concerns about how ether rewards are distributed in the community at large.  ""ProgPoW is being pushed by large farms that have not disclosed their real intentions,"" Chen said, adding:  ""The fear of Bitmain is driving the [ethereum] community into the arms of some very powerful well-funded farms that they don't even know about.""  Kristy-Leigh Minehan, a leading developer behind the ProgPoW switch, pushed back against this claim, arguing that ""large-scale GPU farms don't really exist."" In a sense, Minehan is making the case that GPUs can promote a larger number of participants in securing ethereum, something she argues ASICs, due to their cost and operational requirements, cannot.  Benefits to hardware  More broadly, the push for ProgPoW is typical of what has been termed crypto's ""war on miners,"" in which several cryptocurrencies have moved to remove ASIC hardware manufacturers from their respective networks.  Yet according to Chen, much of the conversation about removing ASICs from ethereum lacks an awareness of the kind of advantages specialized hardware can bring to a cryptocurrency project.  ""Our chip is optimized, specialized for ethereum, not only for mining, but also for verification and node operation, so I'm very curious about why people think it is wrong,"" Chen told CoinDesk.  Chen added that specialized hardware is often condemned on moral, not rational, scientific grounds.  Pointing to scaling challenges faced by ethereum, Chen theorized that advancements in mining hardware could even help ethereum overcome its current concerns about scaling to more people and more transactions.  ""[Ethereum] is still so far away from the traditional banking system. I think hardware can contribute,"" she said.  In her mind, because ASICs will be able to mine ethereum faster and more efficiently, they will be able to process more transactions at a faster pace. ""If we have a fast enough physical layer,"" the community won't have to rely on complex software scaling solutions, such as sharding, she argued.  Chen depicted Linzhi as deeply interested in participating in and assisting with the improvement of the ethereum protocol.  Indeed, pointing to a recent proposal by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin that offers a scaling method based on hardware running zk-snarks, Chen said that Linzhi would be capable of producing such hardware in the future, although it's not on their roadmap.  Last resort  All in all, it's the latest sign that a larger argument is being had about how ethereum will secure its $22 billion blockchain. However, that argument may not break from the original roadmap anytime soon.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Hudson Jameson, a communications officers for the Ethereum Foundation, said he was unaware of any ASIC advocates in the ethereum developer community who might protest the plan to switch to proof-of-stake.  Much of the movement stems from the idea that the presence of ASICs optimized to only run one particular algorithm could interfere with a smooth transition to proof-of-stake, now dubbed ""Shasper"" due to its fusion with scaling method, sharding.  ""That's the entire reason ProgPoW was created: to ensure [ethereum] could transition safely over to [proof-of-stake] without larger parties like Bitmain manipulating the coin and the price,"" Minehan told CoinDesk.  Still, Chen didn't express too much concern in this regard, emphasizing that such efforts are still very much within ""the proposal state.""  Irrespective, Chen urged that in the event of ProgPoW or proof-of-stake, Linzhi will switch to mining ethereum classic, a rival ethereum platform that split away from the blockchain in 2016, and that traditionally been more friendly to ASIC hardware.  She told CoinDesk:  ""We would like to reduce the power consumed to secure [ethereum], but if they want to stick with wasteful GPUs run by two companies and powerful secret farming concerns, then we will just press on with [ethereum classic].""

42429748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Abh,1538673320,Testing for Ethereum's Upcoming Hard Fork Is Being Delayed,"Ethereum core developers announced a delay in plans to launch Constantinople, Ethereum's upcoming system-wide upgrade, on the test network Ropsten on Thursday.  As explained in a tweet by Peter Szilagyi, team lead at the Ethereum Foundation, the main reason for the delay is to offer more time for clients – the individuals and businesses running ""nodes"" or computer servers supporting the ethereum network – to address a vulnerability found in one of the five Constantinople upgrades.  In addition to this, the delay would also give space for Ropsten users testing other ethereum projects – such as the off-chain scaling solution Raiden – to prepare for the possible network split that could occur as a result of implementing Constantinople.  Requiring what is known as a ""hard fork,"" the upgrades comprising Constantinople include changes to block reward issuance, code execution, data storage and more. The active nodes of the Ropsten testnet would need to implement such changes simultaneously or risk splitting into two separate blockchains.  As a result, Lefteris Karapetsas, a developer for the Raiden network, told ethereum developers in a public forum that causing a potential network split for even a temporary period on Ropsten would ""effectively make testing almost impossible"" for their project, which is ""rather close to mainnet release,"" in response to an open call for input on the postponement date.  To avoid intentionally causing complications on the ethereum testnet, one idea proposed by ethereum core developer Alexey Akhunov as an alternative was to launch a separate temporary testnet to Ropsten and resolve obvious problems in code there before implementation for further testing by existing users of the Ropsten network.  The new release date for Constantinople on Ropsten is now set for October 14th, estimated to be block 4.23 million, as agreed to by core developers and testnet users together.  And as warned by Szilagyi, any further delay would push into an even busier season for ethereum core developers heading into their fourth annual developer conference, dubbed Devcon, scheduled for October 30 in Prague.

42429741,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1ARh,1538667012,'Nothing Is Decentralized': Crypto Springs Confronts Tech's Shortcomings,"When Crypto Springs conference co-organizer Meltem Demirors took the stage on Wednesday, watermelon margarita in hand, her ""nothing is decentralized"" rallying cry drew thunderous applause.  That may seem counterintuitive for a poolside gathering of cryptocurrency industry veterans in Palm Springs, California. But the tone distinguishing this event from the plethora of blockchain conferences was an acute focus on shortcomings and open-ended questions.  ""Decentralization is not a myth,"" Demirors, founder of Athena Capital and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares, told the audience. ""It just hasn't been implemented properly yet.""  She was hardly the only one to espouse this view. In his presentation, Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer even went so far as to lambaste the Bitcoin Core team for the ""centralized way"" in which they fixed the recently discovered bug in bitcoin's code, which involved coordinating with bitcoin miners behind closed doors.  Palmer also said there is a ""complete lack of transparency"" about who manages the Bitcoin Core code base, and that he believes the whole bitcoin ecosystem suffers from a lack of diversity regarding both programming languages and implementations.  ""A lot of people in the space are afraid to reflect on bitcoin,"" Palmer told CoinDesk, questioning why retail adoption is still a rarity. ""If bitcoin was a startup, it would be dead. It hasn't reached product-market fit.""  Addressing one of these criticisms, Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo told CoinDesk that diversifying bitcoin might require a great deal of extra work to maintain consistency across the complex network, at best, and lead to network forks that reduce bitcoin's usability at worst.  ""If you have multiple implementations that people run, then [nodes] have to run both,"" Corallo said. ""With multiple languages, you're going to have different behaviors...you don't want to rewrite too many things because that's how you end up with lots of bugs.""  Peer review  One point of broad consensus at the event, though, was that the godfather of cryptocurrencies requires more peer review.  ""There needs to be more talent working on [bitcoin] full-time,"" Palmer told CoinDesk.  Corallo agreed, adding the shortage of code reviewers isn't caused by a lack of funding opportunities. In Corallo's mind, the problem is a lack of skilled engineers willing to devote their time to this space.  Referring to the power to merge changes into the bitcoin code, he said:  ""People who can press the big red button are much less interesting because they push the big red button when there has been sufficient review.""  And regarding the recent bug, Corallo said Bitcoin Core's mentality is to place more responsibility on reviewers than solely on the shoulders of the few full-time contributors. When the community lacks an abundance of skilled reviewers, the open source process is inherently hindered.  So Satoshi Labs co-founder Alena Vranova, who recently left the helm of the crypto wallet maker Trezor to found the nonprofit B Foundation, told CoinDesk her next goal is to create online courses and grants to increase the number of engineers contributing to bitcoin.  ""More implementations doesn't necessarily fix the issue of bugs. If you have forks, they can just inherit the bugs,"" Vranova said. ""You can either create specific bug bounties for different implementations or you can make sure there are plenty of developers who understand the code enough to do peer review.""  Hope and fear  Throughout the conference's first day, people expressed differing opinions on how cryptocurrency could change the world.  Corallo's presentation on Thursday will focus on decentralization and mining, especially bitcoin's underlying principle of censorship resistance, which the developer told CoinDesk he is still unsure could scale to a trillion-dollar market.  Crypto Springs co-organizer Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, a startup that focuses on the scaling solution called the Lightning Network, said corporate incumbents are the biggest threat to the crypto ecosystem.  But Lightning developer Jack Mallers, maker of the crypto wallet Zap, took a more enterprise-friendly approach.  ""This market is really volatile. It's really immature,"" Mallers told CoinDesk, going on to say Lightning-enabled institutional trading could improve price discovery and overall liquidity.  Financial products like a bitcoin exchange-traded fund are much more achievable in the next year than mainstream retail adoption, he added.  Further, Mallers suggested that the nascent market for futures contracts could help the crypto industry transfer financial risks to professional speculators (much like farmers do with commodity traders), helping smaller players survive. ""I think that bitcoin futures are going to help decentralize mining,"" he said.  Reflecting on the critical mass bitcoin is on the verge of reaching almost 10 years after the original white paper was first published, Mallers concluded:  ""Either bitcoin will work, and become a trillion-dollar asset, or it won't and it will go to zero. We're reaching that point where it will be very binary.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2018/10/04/nothing-is-decentralized-crypto-springs-confronts-techs-shortcomings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2dfe90e4c32951c6880cd67e82fb25b1c6accced-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The government alleges that Aleksei Sergeyevich Morenets, Evgenii Mikhaylovich Serebriakov, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, Artem Andreveyich Malyshev, Dmitriy Sergeyevich Badin, Oleg Mikhaylovich Sotnikov and Alexey Valerevich Minin are members of the Russian intelligence agency and hacked into computer networks used by anti-doping and sporting officials, as well as groups investigating Russia's alleged use of chemical weapons.  To hide their financial tracks, they reportedly used cryptocurrencies, though, in the indictment, bitcoin is the only one named directly.  The document states:  ""In those instances where conspirators purchased hacking infrastructure, payments were made using a complex web of transactions involving operational accounts in fictitious names and typically utilized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, to further mask their identities and conduct.""  Further, while the conspirators used a variety of currencies, including U.S. dollars, bitcoin was the primary form of payment for purchases including buying servers and registering domains, according to U.S. officials.  Many of these payments went to U.S.-based companies, and ""the use of bitcoin allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.""  The conspirators also mined their own bitcoin as part of an effort to generate funds, according to the indictment. It adds:  ""To facilitate the purchase of infrastructure used in their hacking activity—targeting anti-doping and other sports-related organizations and releasing the stolen documents—defendants ... together with conspirators known and unknown, conspired to launder money through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.""  ""The use of bitcoin allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds,"" it said.  That being said, the indictment indicates investigators were able to track the machines used to initiate bitcoin transactions, noting that the defendants sent bitcoin payments from the same computers used to conduct some ""hacking activity.""  While not directly related to the ongoing investigation into suspected Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ's national security division, said during a press conference Thursday that three of the named defendants were previously charged in connection with that probe.

42429751,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Afh,1538661628,Ether's Two-Week Price Uptrend Looks Set to Continue,"Ether (ETH), the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has staved off an attempt by the bears to break a two-week uptrend.  The cryptocurrency defended the trendline connecting the Sept. 17 low and Sept. 25 low yesterday, boosting the odds of a bullish break above the recent lower price high of $240.  ETH also briefly dropped to third place in the rankings on CoinMarketCap after a mini-rally by XRP saw it take second place at the start of the month. However, it appears ether is beginning to stage a comeback having quickly regained the second place mantle.  A retest of the upper trendline – which has consistently plagued the wider crypto markets since the bear breakdown began at the start of 2018 – now looks likely  As of writing, ETH is changing hands at $224 on Bitfinex, after bouncing from the bullish hammer seen on Oct. 3.  Daily chart  Symmetrical triangles are continuation patterns that provide an indication of a bullish or bearish break and are dependent upon the direction in trend for the correct signal.  The previous symmetrical triangle, seen Aug. 10–Sept. 5, shows a rapid decline in price after it broke bearish. From there prices recovered after the bulls managed to stem the bleeding, as evidenced by the long bull wick (marked by an arrow)  A drop in total volume over the period, as prices began to consolidate and contract, can also be seen.  The case this time around benefits the bullish view of a breakout due to a small change in the direction of the trend.  For over two weeks now, the bears have been unsuccessful in their attempts to drive prices lower and have briefly lost momentum required to cross the upward trendline, signaling another major move may be imminent.  4-hour chart  Looking at the 4-hour chart, we can see how ether recently achieved a 22-day high in total growing volume, levels not seen since prices began to break down toward the end of last month.  A bull cross on the moving average divergence convergence (MACD) is beginning to intersect and confirm a small trend change on the intraday timeframes, likely courtesy of bitcoin's bullish charge above $6,600 seen earlier today.  While crossing below 0.00 on the MACD does not instill the greatest sense of confidence for the bulls, the signal is nothing to sniff at and should be treated as bullish should the lines cross and close above.  A pullback from the recent pump is most likely as price action cools and traders look to bank a profit but expect a continuation should volume rise significantly post retracement.  View  Total growing volume on the 4-hour chart has hit a 22-day high, signaling a possible end to the two-week narrowing range.  The daily symmetrical triangle is following an inside bullish trend, hinting at a possible break to upper resistances.  A pullback period is likely to follow the pump with a further loss in volume before finally breaking bullish.  A UTC close below $214 would invalidate the higher low formation and signal a resumption of the 10-month long bearish outlook.  Disclosure: The author holds USDT at the time of writing.

42429743,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1ATh,1538657980,Melonport Co-Founder Joins the Decentralized Crypto Exchange Race,"A co-founder of one of the most talked-about blockchain projects of recent years has launched a decentralized exchange (DEX), aspiring to make such platforms easier to use.  Announced today, Reto Trinkler has opened the new DEX, dubbed Agora Trade, in Malta – a nation that has become increasingly crypto-friendly with the passing of several pieces of legislation around the tech.  Trinkler is best known in the industry for his work at Melonport, the crypto asset management platform he started in 2016 with Goldman Sachs veteran Mona El Isa. The project earned the then 28-year-old Trinkler a spot on Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" list of up-and-comers in European finance.  The new venture joins an increasingly crowded field of DEXs, which employ a variety of models but generally seek to address a longstanding problem with traditional, centralized crypto exchanges by allowing traders to control the custody of their assets.  Trinkler told CoinDesk that Agora will differentiate itself from the DEX pack in several ways. For example, Agora will offer trading of cryptocurrencies across different blockchains. While that's not quite unique (Plasma DEX, for instance, does this too), it will set Agora apart from the many DEXs that run on top of ethereum and can only trade ether or other tokens created for that blockchain.  To start, users can trade NIM (the native cryptocurrency of the Nimiq blockchain) or ether, and Agora plans to add bitcoin, ethereum classic, EOS, NEO, and tezos next.  Further, orders to buy or sell on Agora Trade will be made off-chain and stored and matched on a central server. As a result, orders can be placed free of charge and trades can be completed faster, Trinkler said. ""This allows us to have efficient order matching, while users don't compromise [on] security.""  Trinkler hopes these features, combined with the security and autonomy of self-custody, will attract more critical mass than the trickle of trades most DEXs have seen to date. He told CoinDesk:  ""Our goal is to be the cross-chain, non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange with the most unique visitors per day and the highest daily volume.""  Between the chains  Even for a DEX like Agora, a partly centralized solution in which orders are matched on one server is still the best option right now, Trinkler argued.  ""Synchronicity is difficult to achieve in decentralized databases,"" he explained. ""For a user, it could happen that they think they matched a trade while in reality, someone else matched the trade and their database was just not synched fully.""  Still, Agora does not take custody of users' funds. Instead, these are staked in a multi-signature, time-locked contract until the trade is settled, Trinkler said.  ""This is essentially a smart contract (or blockchain script) that temporarily holds custody of users' funds,"" he said. ""This allows us to accept off-chain orders free of charge, which then can still be settled on-chain.""  Also showing Trinkler's decentralist bent, Agora is deployed on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer distributed file system, which he said is a more secure way to handle crypto keys than normal web applications.  To make cross-chain trades faster and easier, Agora plans to integrate with Polkadot, the blockchain interoperability protocol, to which Trinkler contributed in his role as a council member and advisor to the Web3 Foundation. In particular, Agora will use Polkadot's inter-chain communication feature to streamline the settlement of cross-chain trades.  But until that becomes possible, the exchange will use a mechanism called hashed time-locked contracts, better known as atomic swaps. While these work, to Trinkler's mind they are overly complicated to execute.  ""If you take a trade of mine you can set up the first side of an atomic swap, but then the counterparty, e.g. me, needs to set up the second side of an atomic swap — this requires too much work from users,"" he said, adding:  ""With inter-chain communication, this additional step of counterparties having to return and set up the second side of the swap goes away and the trading experience becomes very similar to the one of a centralized exchange.""  Chain island  Interestingly, Trinkler's reason for registering Agora in Malta is not just the crypto-friendly political climate, but the community it has attracted: major crypto exchanges such as Kraken, Binance and ZB recently opened offices on the island.  This is important to Agora because one of its priorities is creating a dark pool, or space where trades can be made without making them public.  ""Having proximity to some of the largest crypto exchanges helps with pooling liquidity for the dark pool,"" Trinkler told CoinDesk.  One more way Agora is trying to set itself apart among DEXs is with an integrated wallet that stores keys for holdings on multiple blockchains in an image file. Called ""imagewallet,"" it's basically a picture of a QR code with a warning not to share it.  In the future, developers might employ steganography — a method of concealing an image within another image — as an alternative way to create a graphic wallet, Trinkler noted. As he explained it, somewhat poetically:  ""The image is just a user-friendly way of storing a bit of entropy.""  As for his previous claim to fame, Trinkler would not say why he left Melonport in June of this year but said that project is in good hands.  ""The main problems Melonport set out to solve have been solved and the team is well able to take on the remaining challenges,"" he said.

42429732,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1A9h,1538657940,Overstock's Medici Ventures Invests in Wine-Tracking Blockchain Startup,"Medici Ventures, the blockchain accelerator and subsidiary of Overstock.com, has made a seven-figure investment in blockchain startup VinX.  Israel-based VinX is developing a supply chain platform for trading wine futures, which allow connoisseurs and collectors to purchase a vintage while it's still in the barrel, a year or two before it's bottled and released on the market.  By registering these futures as tokens on a blockchain, the startup believes it will be possible to follow the wine to its origin and cut out the fakes that plague the industry.  While the exact sum of the investment is not being made public, Medici Ventures president Jonathan Johnson told CoinDesk that his firm acquired 20 percent of VinX.  Johnson said that Medici was attracted to the startup's blockchain use case, explaining:  ""There are a lot of middlemen in the wine industry that can be eliminated with blockchain, there is a lot of problems with counterfeits. We also think this technology is democratizing the purchase of wine.""  Indeed, with a $302 billion global wine market and up to $3 billion paid by customers for counterfeited products, VinX is aiming for big game.  It's not the only firm making a move to put wine on a blockchain, however. Chainvine, a Swedish startup with a similar vision, raised $3 million this summer, and Everledger, known for tracking the provenance of diamonds, claimed two years ago to have registered the first-ever bottle of wine on a shared ledger.  Direct-to-consumer  VinX was founded by Jacob Ner-David, a co-founder and chairman of Jezreel Valley Winery in Israel. He also has experience working at tech startups.  In a statement, Ner-David framed his company's mission as aligned with that of Overstock, the e-commerce giant founded in 1999 by Patrick Byrne, who later became a prominent evangelist for bitcoin and blockchain technology in general.  By ""bringing consumers in direct contact with producers early in the wine-making cycle,"" Ner-David said, ""we are riding the wave of direct-to-consumer, which Overstock has been a leader of for almost 20 years.""

42429745,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1AZh,1538654425,Numerai Opens Crypto-Powered Stock Betting Market to the Public,"Hedge fund Numerai has just officially launched Erasure – its crypto-based data gathering and stock price prediction marketplace.  Allowing experts earn or lose funds by staking them on stock market price predictions, the Erasure protocol has been active since June 2017, when Numerai distributed its ""numeraire"" tokens to data scientists, said founder Richard Craib.  Now, the company is now looking to attract hedge funds worldwide by allowing anyone to buy a prediction.  Built on the ethereum blockchain, Erasure works by allowing members to essentially bet on their predictions. A user can stake a number of the company's tokens on a specific outcome. If the prediction comes true, the user wins the staked tokens. However, if they are proven false, they lose them.  ""We can look at the performance and metrics and other measures and show that the models that get staked perform far better than the models that don't get staked because people who stake have some skin in the game,"" Craib explained.  Now, by allowing public access, data scientists can sell their predictions to other hedge funds by providing proof that their predictions are accurate using historical data on the Erasure marketplace.  At present, a data scientist can build a model based on Numerai's data, which Numerai may then pay for.  Now that the platform is live, financial institutions and hedge funds worldwide can look at such models and purchase bets.  This helps data scientists build their reputations. While, previously, a hedge fund might have to take a scientist's word on trust alone, users can now point to immutable data to indicate that they have been correct in their predictions a given percent of the time.  As Craib pointed out, if a data scientist does sell a prediction which winds up being incorrect, the hedge fund can destroy the user's stake, limiting the fund's risk and amplifying the user's.  That being said, the protocol does takes steps to protect users' predictions. While historical data is publicly accessible, new predictions are hidden from the public – the only way to see it is to purchase the prediction. This ensures that those who make prediction are compensated for doing so.  Craib told CoinDesk that there are currently 44,500 verified accounts on Numerai (up from 19,000 at launch), and the company averages around 1,000 stakes per week. Since its launch, more than $1 million has been staked on the platform, according to the firm.  The firm's founder claimed:  ""If bitcoin's changing the banking world, Numerai's changing the hedge fund world.""  Editor's note: This article has been updated.

42429750,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Adh,1538651011,"Bitcoin Price Must Clear $6,800 for Range Breakout","With bitcoin (BTC) stuck in a narrow trading range for the 13th day in a row, the bulls need to force a move above $6,800 to confirm a breakout, according to the technical charts.  BTC has been restricted to a narrow range of $6,800 to $6,500 since Sept. 22 and this lack of clear directional bias has pushed the volatility reading to a 21-month low.  The daily volatility as represented by the Bollinger bandwidth – a technical analysis tool derived by dividing the gap between the Bollinger bands by price's moving average – has dropped to 0.078, its lowest level since December 2016.  A prolonged period of low volatility often paves way for a big move in either direction. So, it seems safe to say that BTC could soon witness a bullish or bearish breakout (though we have been saying this for a while now, and the big move is still to come).  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,600, representing a 1.65 percent gain on the day.  Daily chart  The Bollinger bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on the 20-day moving average) are moving in a sideways manner, indicating there is no clear trend in the bitcoin market.  For a bull breakout, BTC's price needs to find acceptance above the upper Bollinger band of $6,800. On the other hand, a move below the lower band at $6,290 would see the bears take charge.  Right now, the prospects of a downside break appear highest, as the cryptocurrency is again struggling to clear the 50-day exponential moving average (MA), currently located at $6,640.  View  The immediate outlook remains neutral as long as BTC is trapped between the Bollinger bands.  A UTC close above the upper Bollinger band of $6,800 would confirm a bullish breakout and would open up upside towards the September high of $7,429.  A break below the lower Bollinger band of $6,290 would shift risk in favor of a re-test of the June low of $5,755.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The startup says in a press statement that it raised $8.86 million in a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale led by Multicoin Capital, on top of $785,000 raised earlier this year.  Galaxy Digital, Aspect Ventures, Blockchange Ventures, Boost.VC, Canaan Venture Partners, Floodgate Fund, Hack.VC, Neo Global Capital and Signia Venture Partners also participated in the sale.  The company intends to launch an open-source permissionless blockchain targeted toward providing ethereum-based decentralized application (dapp) developers a new base platform to build upon.  In particular, Skale intends to launch the first implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine on a Plasma chain – a move it says would help dapp developers by giving them a layer-2 platform on which to execute smart contracts.  Using Skale's network will enable dapps to conduct ""millions of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of what's possible today,"" the release claims.  Jack O'Holleran, co-founder and CEO of Skale Labs, said in a statement that ""helping Ethereum dapp developers scale applications is the center of what we do.""  He added:  ""We are sharply focused on making Layer 2 easy, fast, secure and cost-effective for anyone who wants to run smart contracts on Ethereum ... We are looking forward to bringing this network to market in a fully open-source, [peer-to-peer] manner.""  The startup plans to set its testnet live by the end of 2018 and activate its mainnet in the upcoming year. A foundation will also be launched to support the network, similar to the Ethereum Foundation and its work supporting the Ethereum mainnet, the firm says.  ""Skale is uniquely positioned to dominate Layer 2 on Ethereum,"" said Multicoin Capital managing partner Kyle Samani, adding that the project is ""Ethereum's best shot at fending off competition from other smart contract platforms.""

Announced by Ripple in a tweet Thursday, the remittance app is the product of SBI Ripple Asia and several participating banks.  A new website for the product has also been launched indicating that the app is able to make bank-to-bank money transfers in ""real time"" using Ripple's xCurrent payments product.  Available for both iOS and Android devices, the product allows users to send funds to others using just their telephone numbers or a QR code, and utilizes devices biometric log-in features, such as fingerprint scanning, for security.  Currently, the service is only able to remit between accounts held at the three participating Japanese banks – SBI Sumishin Net Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank. Payments are being offered at no charge and can be sent in Japanese yen or foreign currencies, says the website.  SBI Ripple Asia announced in late September that it had completed registration with Japan's Ministry of Finance as a licensed agent for handling electronic payments – the final hurdle before launching the app.  In the Asian nation, any entity wanting to handle electronic payments using banking APIs must now be registered with local finance bureaus – a rule that came into effect from June 1.  Ripple's xCurrent network is built on distributed ledger technology and has recently seen increasing adoption by banks seeking to stay competitive as rival payments offerings proliferate. Banking giant Santander also launched a payments app using xCurrent back in April.  While based on blockchain, xCurrent does not by default utilize the Ripple-linked crypto token XRP.  However, at the U.S. firm's Swell event over the last few days, it was revealed that several payments firms are now commercially using Ripple's third payments solution, xRapid, which does use the open-source token.

Matthew Allen, an assistant director of domestic operations with the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division of ICE, discussed the role of cryptocurrencies in drug trafficking during an October 3 hearing before the U.S. Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control.  ""On dark net marketplaces and other 'unindexed' websites, purchases are often paid for with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and monero, among many others,"" he said in a prepared statement.  Perhaps most notably, he noted that HSI is having some level of success in tracking criminals who use cryptocurrencies to launder proceeds from drug sales.  While cryptocurrencies make transferring value relatively easy, he contended, criminals still need to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat – and vice versa – during the process. ""Whenever monetary exchanges are made, a vulnerability is created,"" he went on to say.  ""This is the time when criminals are most susceptible to identification by law enforcement means and methods,"" Allen stated, explaining:  ""Utilizing traditional investigative methods such as surveillance, undercover operations, and confidential informants, coupled with financial and block-chain analysis, ICE-HSI is able to disrupt the criminals and dismantle the [transnational criminal organizations], as well as the cryptocurrency exchangers who typically launder proceeds for criminal networks engaged in or supporting dark net marketplaces.""  Allen went on to discuss multiple types of cryptocurrency exchanges and how they may be used to facilitate money laundering. Peer-to-peer exchanges in particular, referring to startups which refuse to register as a money services business and do not follow compliance laws, are often used to ensure users remain anonymous.  Despite that, however, national and international agencies are training investigators in how to best track cryptocurrencies, he said.  ""We train investigators ... in an effort to deter organizations from laundering proceeds or using cryptocurrencies to fund the purchase of fentanyl/opioids or other narcotics,"" he said.

42429747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1AVh,1538629253,Bitcoin Startup Acinq Raises $1.7 Million to Double Down on Lightning,"Lightning isn't just a big hit with developers, the promising bitcoin technology is now attracting a little attention from investors.  Acinq  , one of the leading startups working on the lightning network, a top-level layer aiming to boost the number of transactions bitcoin can support, has closed a $1.7 million funding round led by Serena Capital, with participation from Talend co-founder Bertrand Diard, Sebastien Lucas, Alistair Milne and Snapcar founder Yves Weisselberger.  As a result of the funding, Lightning Labs is no longer the only startup solely dedicated to lightning that's been able to rake in money for its efforts.  Since it launched a few years back, the Paris-based company has become one of the most pivotal in a broader push to build and design lightning. It has built Eclair, one of three lightning software implementations alongside those by Lightning Labs and Blockstream, as well as Eclair Wallet, the most popular lightning wallet to date.  Yet for all the startup has accomplished, it's all been done a small team of three. ""Everything that we did was done with very little,"" Acinq co-founder and CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou said.  He told CoinDesk:  ""With this raise, we're very excited to be able to do a lot more with more resources. We'll be able to make even more cool services for lightning. This is not only good for us but for lightning in general and for pushing adoption forward.""  Doubling efforts  With the funds, Acinq also plans to hire three to four ""highly technical"" developers over the coming weeks and months. Acinq is sure to need it, as far as pushing lightning adoption forward, there's still a lot to do.  Lightning may have entered beta earlier this year as users started using it to send real money. (But, this isn't exactly advised. The technology is still unfinished, so users can lose money.) Now, at least $700,000 worth of bitcoin is now tied up in the lightning network.  That's still a far cry, though, from what developers want lightning to be – safe and easy to use. They want it to grow the capacity of the network, so maybe one day people with no interest in cryptocurrency will be able to use it,  To do its part in the effort, Acinq plans to take its operations to a larger scale. This means working with other developers on standards for lightning. (Padiou noted that the second Lightning Network protocol summit, where developers will decide what technology standards to focus on next, is slated for November in Australia.)  Acinq further plans to continue building out mobile and desktop lightning wallets, as well as their recently released ""Strike"" API, which mirrors that of the popular payment technology Stripe.  Focus on UX  Still, it remains to be seen if this effort can boost the profile of Acinq, considered by some as a more supporting player in the quest to build out lightning, an effort largely associated with startups Lightning Labs and Blockstream, the later of which is famous for selling special stickers for lightning.  So, what sets Acinq apart, besides residing on a different continent? Padiou believes that of all of these startups, Acinq is the most focused on making lightning technology easy to use.  ""We have a huge focus on the users. We were the first to put out a mobile application because we think it's vital to have normal users use lightning, to see what they would be able to do in the real world,"" he said.  There are now plenty of other wallets out there, but Padiou argues Eclair Wallet is the ""most advanced"" and that's why it's the most-used across the network.  ""If we had to choose between new features and UX, we would always put the priority on UX,"" he added.  All in all, though, Padiou thinks that the fact that lightning is attracting enough attention to spur investment is a good sign for the lightning network and cryptocurrency as a whole. And he's excited to see what happens next.  ""We're very excited because we think it's a good time for lightning,"" Padiou said.  He concluded:  ""Seeing that groundwork come to fruition in real life by users and businesses is really rewarding. This is a great moment.""

42429730,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1A5h,1538622071,Vote Buying Scandal Stokes Fears of EOS Governance Failure,"EOS investors can't say they weren't warned.  What was foretold in a March blog post by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin may have come to pass on the world's fifth largest blockchain, with a bout of vote buying drama rocking the $5 billion protocol over the weekend.  That's when a Twitter account named ""Maple Leaf Capital"" produced screenshots from a leaked Excel spreadsheet that supposedly show the China-based exchange Huobi, one of the world's oldest and largest, accepting money for its support of certain entities in the charge of ensuring the network's distributed decision-making.  The allegation is notable as EOS has only 21 ""block producers,"" trusted entities periodically elected to maintain the history of the blockchain and that receive rewards in the form of cryptocurrency for doing so.  No one can verify any of the claims made in this thread, nor the provenance of the spreadsheet's data. Huobi promptly denied all the accusations.  However, that doesn't mean damage control isn't being done. Block.One, the creators of the EOSIO software, for which they raised $4 billion in a nearly year-long initial coin offering (ICO), issued its own statement on Tuesday.  It reads:  ""We are aware of some unverified claims regarding irregular block producer voting, and the subsequent denials of those claims. We believe it is important to ensure a free and democratic election process within EOS and may, as we deem appropriate, vote with other holders to reinforce the integrity of this process.""  Accusations of wrong-doing aside, the controversy illuminates deeper issues, adding fuel to the fire for those who allege the EOS protocol may have an incomplete approach to governance.  At the simplest level, the debate is over whether block producers should be allowed to pay other people to vote for them. The EOS interim constitutions, documents designed to put forth rules for participants on the network, clearly ban vote buying, but that constitution has never been ratified by EOS users.  Yet, at the same time, EOS seems designed for block producers to support other block producers.  Block producers earn tokens and have an interest in the long-term health of the protocol, so some argue it seems natural that they would (and must) use those tokens to support other block producers they have collaborated with and believe to be good stewards of the network.  Kevin Rose, community manage of EOS New York, a block producer since launch, acknowledged the point but told CoinDesk: ""Profit sharing and vote trading which compromise an organization's ability to remain independent is the issue.""  Huobi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Block One declined to provide additional comment.  Unfinished governance  Despite the lack of conclusions, however, the incident has heightened claims that the state of the EOS software was perhaps too primitive at launch, so it's worth revisiting these claims which have now renewed.  First, EOS has on-chain governance, albeit a system in which only one decision can be made by the EOS token holders. That is, they can decide which companies have those 21 block producer seats that control EOS's ledger.  Every other decision is up to those 21 block producers. They can even (as we've previously reported) lock up accounts they believe to be operating maliciously.  Second, EOS has a constitution that forbids buying votes, but it's never been ratified. (It isn't even clear what ratification means in that the software was released without a way to agree on rules.)  This point is relevant to a recent Medium post by ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir, in which he discusses the need for a governance scheme to attain legitimacy by having the consent of the governed.  In the case of EOS, whether that goal is satisfied remains unclear.  The interim constitution was put together by a committee of block producer hopefuls leading up to the EOS launch. Its last article acknowledges that it is an interim constitution until a new one can be ratified, but not only has ratification not proceeded: there isn't even a a legitimized way to ratify it.  Since launch, new block producer hopefuls have entered the space who don't know about or don't care about the process that yielded the interim constitution, and some of them have managed to win one of those top spots.  Third, EOS governance as written does not work well with exchanges, which have custody over a vast amount of user cryptocurrency.  EOS governance is done through the wallet. If users turn custody of their tokens over to exchanges, there's really no way for them to vote their tokens. Perhaps more importantly, there's no way to prevent exchanges from voting the tokens of their users who don't care to vote.  Voting works at the wallet level, so a person can only really vote if they have custody. Anyone who wants to express their opinion about who should be a block producer has to stake their tokens on EOS, which locks them up for at least three days.  Each wallet can vote for one to 30 block producers. However many they choose, each gets a vote for every token the user staked. So if a user has 10 staked tokens and they vote for 10 block producers, each one gets 10 votes. If they vote for 30, then all 30 get 10 votes. There's no additional nuance.  Voting is also continuous. EOSIO software rechecks the vote counts every few minutes and if a new candidate has pulled into the top 21, one gets kicked out and that new one goes in.  Since users put their tokens into an exchange's wallet (or wallets) to use them there, an exchange would have to go to great lengths to give their EOS holders a way to vote (such as creating a separate wallet for each permutation of votes). Bitfinex has written open source software to enfranchise its users, but it has limitations. We do not know of any other exchanges that have implemented it or anything similar.  The active EOS community has urged users since before the launch to take their tokens off exchanges, a point made by one user in a group video conference call of Chinese block producer candidates hosted by EOS Alliance, organized around the current controversy.  Lastly, EOS wallets are anonymous by default. This makes it impossible to know who is giving what to whom. It's not as if the various block producers accused of paying Huobi would have to pay a portion of their block rewards to known Huobi wallet, after all.  So, even if Huobi hasn't accepted any such payments, the present conversation reflects widely shared fears that something like this could happen.  Vitalik's prediction  Still, some allege that those backing the EOS protocol have known about the issue, but been slow to satisfy concerns. Buterin, as an example, articulated the vulnerability to vote buying before EOS launched.  He wrote: ""The average voter has only a very small chance of impacting which delegates get selected ... their incentive is to vote for whoever offers the highest and most reliable bribe.""  At the time, he also observed that the tension around deciding who gets to be block producer ""has essentially become yet another frontier of US-China geopolitical economic warfare.""  This remains true. Scanning various EOS-affiliated Telegram channels, we saw EOS holders announcing that they'd no longer vote for any China-based block producers at all. Though it might be more accurate to say the faultline is a tension between block producers who participated in the public launch and those who didn't.  But it does reflect a deeper problem spurred by a failure to define rules at the outset.  Some users have been treating the interim constitution like so much (digital) paper. Besides the interim constitution, there's also a block producer's agreement, in which block producer candidates commit to have websites and disclose anyone who owns more than 10 percent of their company.  Some have not done so, and there's little the community can do besides fork the protocol.  As Zamfir wrote on his blog:  ""If a coordination mechanism is legitimate, people will (justifiably) act like it's a fact that people will use it. … If it's illegitimate then they will act like it's a fact that people won't use it.""  Some people with clout on the network aren't acting like the the interim constitution and block producer agreement are legitimate. We already know that, because they don't all do the things that agreement requires them to do.  So, even if Huobi isn't buying votes now, eventually someone almost certainly will unless rules are put in place that the whole community views as legitimate.  In other words, it's a problem that may just take time to sort out.  That was the take of a block producer calling itself Aurora EOS, which wrote on its blog:  ""As EOS grows and supports more use cases, those invested in the long-term success of the network will combat the forces, like vote manipulation, that degrade the long-term security of the network.""  That is, if a decentralized community like EOS has already become fragmented, the built-in incentive for the network to succeed should promote solutions.  As Zamfir's post points out: it won't be enough for it to vote something through. It has to be viewed by enough participants as legitimate such that the lion's share of participants feel inclined to follow the rules.  In the short term, if any block producers are using their clout avariciously, Block.One can crush them out of the top 21 with its giant pool of still on the sidelines tokens.  But one whale shoving aside others may not hold up as legitimate governance strategy over time either.
