42379323,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SQR,1489933986,Charts: How Bitcoin's Market Dominance is Being Challenged,"Given its status as the original blockchain protocol, it should be no surprise that bitcoin has long dominated the digital currency markets.  In terms of market capitalization, it dwarfs other cryptocurrencies. Its first-mover status and widespread adoption has (so far) given bitcoin the dual advantage of network effect and steep barriers to entry, keeping alternatives at bay.  But there's evidence that this longstanding narrative could be changing.  Recent infighting in bitcoin's development community has provided a rare chance for alternatives to stress their value propositions and even assert new ones (like being a hedge in times where bitcoin's future seems uncertain).  This has led to an interesting, observable trend. While the total pie of the cryptocurrency market keeps growing larger, bitcoin's slice is becoming smaller.  1. Bitcoin's dominance decline  The clearest illustration of bitcoin's network effect is the ratio of bitcoin's market compared to the market cap of all other digital currencies.  The most authoritative source for this data is CoinMarketCap.com, which publishes its 'Bitcoin Dominance Index'. Its current value of 72% illustrates that bitcoin has its lowest percentage of market share since it started publishing statistics in April 2013.  This analysis is by no means concrete, as bitcoin's share has dipped in times of stress before. The question now, however, is what make of the downtrend.  As the chart above shows, bitcoin has seen a number of sharp periods of decline followed by reversions to the mean. But the data illustrates that the market may be trending against 'bitcoin maximalism', or the idea bitcoin will be the only dominant blockchain in the future.  2. 'Seeking Alpha'  Yet, it may not be fair to suggest that bitcoin's declining market share represents competition against its value proposition.  The digital currency space is inherently risky, but bitcoin it is still the most liquid and well-known player in the space. As the chart above shows, however, alternative cryptocurrency markets are now providing better returns for investors (at least in the short term)  For an investor, bitcoin's ROI is being overshadowed by upstart cryptos who valuations are increasing at rocket pace. The question for traders might now be, 'Why risk capital in the bitcoin market, when other assets are much more rewarding to hold?'  3. Value propositions  Yet, a major difference between previous declines and now is the relative strength of other alternative protocols.  None may be more notable than ethereum, and its blockchain asset, ether, which has been setting new all-time highs in recent trading sessions. This surge followed the news in late February of a 30-firm partnership called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and nearly two years of open-source development.  Unlike many other protocols, ethereum has a clearer value proposition in that it is designed not to be a digital currency, but a platform for decentralized applications based on blockchain.  With a market cap nearing $4bn, the ethereum is gaining a more liquid market that is better better suited for trading, and institutional firms are starting to notice.  Also notable is the rise of dash. Though analysts have cautioned that they are skeptical about the asset's increase in value, it has nonetheless gained 200% in less than a month, cementing itself as a solid number three in the list of digital currencies by market value.  It is unclear whether this recent bull run is a speculative price bubble or a revaluation based on strong fundamentals, but it could signal the market’s favorable view of a strong governance protocol and a payment protocol which features anonymous transactions.  4. Up to the right  Though the possibility exists of a future not dominated by bitcoin, this shouldn’t be taken as a negative connotation.  Due to the fact that new bitcoins are produced daily, the total value of all bitcoin's has never been higher. While certainly some coins have been lost, burned or otherwise removed from the market, this means that more money has never been invested in bitcoin.  But if one thing is for certain, the uncertainty in the market is having an effect, and creating opportunities for change.

42379319,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SMf,1489924816,Scaling Consensus? This Turing Winner Thinks He's Found a Way,"If a public blockchain is to be successful — whether its use is for currencies, smart contracts or something else entirely — it needs a consensus algorithm that can scale.  While the race is on to develop a system that can do just that, a recent design by an eminent scholar could mark an advancement in this long-held quest. That design is called algorand, and its creator is MIT professor Silvio Micali.  A cryptographer and computer theorist, Micali is known for his work in pseudo-random numbers and zero-knowledge proofs (the basis for the zk-SNARKS that power the anonymous blockchain project zcash). He is also the co-winner of the Turing Award (aka the ""Nobel Prize"" of computing).  But while Micali has impressive credentials, his technology also holds big promise. Algorand is a variation of proof-of-stake that uses cryptography to randomly select the players involved in adding the next block (or set of transactions) to the blockchain.  If algorand is successful, Micali believes his system could easily handle millions of nodes – presenting a solution to one of biggest problems in blockchain today.  Self-selecting lottery  In bitcoin, miners race to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The winner proposes the next block and earns a block reward.  But bitcoin’s proof-of-work results in the expenditure of an exorbitant amount of energy. Some say that it's also led to a centralization of bitcoin's processing, meaning only a few, large entities are able to claim new bitcoins.  In an attempt to democratize this distribution, algorand uses what Micali calls ""cryptographic sortition"" to select players to create and verify blocks.  While most proof-of-stake systems rely on some type of randomness, algorand is different in that you self-select by running the lottery on your own computer. The lottery is based on information in the previous block, while the selection is automatic (involving no message exchange) and completely random.  Micali borrowed the idea from the ancient Athens, where political officials were chosen at random in a process known as ""sortition"". (It was essentially a way of putting everyone's name into a big hat and pulling out a few names.)  By employing cryptographic sortition, the theory is that algorand can scale on demand. Other benefits include security and speed. ""The system has to be fast,"" Micali said. ""I don't want any proof-of-work, and I don't want an excessive communication.""  A fair and democratic system  Because algorand’s computational requirements are trivial, anyone can run the system on their laptop in the background. And while bitcoin has classes of users ('consumers' who transact and 'miners' who search for blocks), algorand makes no such distinction.  The vision is that all users would have the same access to the network.  Similar to other proof-of-stake systems, your chance of being selected for a reward is based on the number of coins (algos) you own or otherwise set aside. The more algos you have, the better chance you have of getting picked.  Once you know you are selected as a proposer, you create a block and then propagate it to the network along with a hash proof (a random number easily verified by a digital signature), saying essentially, ""Here is my block, and here is proof that I won the lottery.""  The proposer with the smallest hash proof (again, random) is the one to present the next candidate block.  The next step in the algorand process is to verify that candidate block and — in the event a block proposer has proposed two or more blocks — insure there is no fork in the chain.  And for that, Micali turns to a decades-old protocol.  Goodbye to forks  One byproduct of Nakamoto consensus is the possibility of network forks, a process that occurs anytime two miners solve the network puzzle at nearly the same time.  As a result, users generally wait 30 minutes (three blocks down the road) to be reasonably sure a transaction has gone through.  ""And now you have to deal with a fork, and that creates some anxiety, psychologically and otherwise, because a block is not final, and people need the finality,"" said Micali.  The way algorand deals with that ambiguity is to reach consensus on one block with a negligible probability of forks. The system does this by employing a modified version of the Byzantine consensus algorithm.  Conceived in the 1980s, Byzantine agreement offers a way to reach consensus in a distributed system where none of the nodes can be trusted. In such a design, the system can tolerate up to one-third of the players working against the system.  Byzantine agreement has two properties: If all the players start with the same value, they agree on that value. And, if the players start with different values, all honest players (those who comply with the protocol) will agree on one value. On the blockchain, those values are the candidate blocks and the players are verifiers.  A problem with traditional Byzantine agreement, however, is that it requires many rounds of intense communication between all players, making it difficult to scale the system.  ""I cannot run Byzantine agreement with 1 million users or 10 million users or, if a successful system, 100 millions users. It is too much,"" Micali said.  To remedy that, he developed a modified version with only nine expected steps.  Player replaceability  In algorand, a small subset of players run Byzantine consensus on behalf of the entire system. That allows the protocol to be run at higher speeds, and as more players are replaced in each step, the idea is it makes the system secure in an adversarial environment.  Put simply, Micali’s Byzantine agreement works like this: Coin holders self-select to be verifiers in the first round. Those verifiers send out their messages along with their credentials to the network.  Now that they have revealed themselves, a resourceful adversary could easily corrupt them. But that doesn’t matter, because once the message is out of the bottle, there is no way to put it back.  ""The adversary can no more do this than the government can put back in the bottle a message of Wikileaks. They can arrest him, put him in prison, but that message is now propagated on the network,"" said Micali.  And so, even if an adversary does succeed in corrupting the verifiers, it is too late. A new set of players has already self-selected for the next round of communication, and the process continues for eight more rounds until a common agreement is reached.  Once agreement is reached, and the block is certified by the signatures of a sufficient number of players in the last step of byzantine agreement, that block is then gossiped through the network so all users in the system can add it to the blockchain.  Since the only real latency in the system is based on propagating that block through the network, Micali has set his block size at 1MB. When networks get faster, it is possible to increase the block size without any security risks, he contends.  New world order?  That said, Micali doesn't think algorand will replace bitcoin. He feels different systems can exist concurrently.  Even bartering still exists today, so there is no reason to think bitcoin won't exist in the future, he argues. But he does feel strongly that its energy waste is unnecessary.  ""Somehow people make the analogy that when you are digging for gold you also waste energy. The fact that gold was mined that way with a lot of waste doesn't mean we should destroy the planet because our ancestors did,"" he said.  He also makes the point that algorand is intended to serve as a consensus protocol for all types of blockchain systems, not just cryptocurrencies.  Much like its name, though, algorand exists as a theoretical protocol.  For now, Micali said he is hammering out technical issues in the hopes that, one day soon, they can be put to the test.
