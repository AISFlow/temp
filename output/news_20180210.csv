42428552,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8mJh,1518282009,7 Trends Shaping the Evolving ICO Economy,"Sure, there were white papers, prototypes and theories, but in the land of ICOs, 2017 was largely about one thing – money – and lots of it.  Entering 2018, those closest to the sector, the area of the industry that's actively applying learnings from cryptocurrencies to startup models, see a bit of a different story. White papers, prototypes and conferences, they believe, will persist. But changes, too, are on the way.  Namely, insiders see a wave of testnets, betas and iterations as the signal and noise begin to separate, and projects begin to differentiate.  As the stakes get higher, CoinDesk broke out a list of trends we see coming for 2018 and reached out to entrepreneurs and investors for further findings:  1. Regulatory purgatory will continue  Despite the ongoing discussions globally, most experts surveyed seemed to think global governments will keep the crypto community waiting for what it wants most, regulatory clarity.  Look for the courts to provide most of this year's guidance, including further action against issuers.  ""The real news will be actions against non-issuers,"" former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement attorney Nicolas Morgan, now at Paul Hastings, told CoinDesk, indicating celebrities touting tokens without disclosure and brokers and exchanges that don't properly register could be targeted.  ICOs that want to play by the rules will need to get used to interpreting past rulings from other industries, another SEC alum, Timothy Peterson of Murphy and McGonigle told CoinDesk.  He said, ""ICOs will need to be comfortable dealing with enforcement inquiries.""  As with any complex financial product, it’s ""part of doing business,"" he said. Still, even if the SEC or the CFTC did start circulating draft regulations, most seem to think it is unlikely they would be enforced this year.  2. The funding pipeline will grow  Notably, no one CoinDesk contacted seemed to think that the overall investment in tokens will shrink in 2018. Although, it appears the size of rounds may vary more.  ""Both humongous deals and smaller, faster rounds [are happening now],"" Wendy Schadek, a VC from Northzone pointed out.  She and many investors predict rounds will rather be broken up, into more complex deals, structured more like traditional venture capital.  ""The action will continue to move increasingly to private sales and the tokens reserved for the public will be smaller or, in many cases, disappear entirely,"" MacLane Wilkison, co-founder of NuCypher, predicted.  3. Startups could seek ethereum alternatives  In order to serve the general public, ethereum needs to process vastly more transactions at faster speeds. Kik already gave up on it in December, and we even saw a $39 million ICO launch on Stellar. But generally, founders continue to bet that ethereum will scale successfully.  ""Ethereum is still the clear winner today in terms of the community and developer tools that are available. We're rooting hard for Plasma and the team at OmiseGO as they try and build the first implementation of it,"" Josh Fraser of the Origin Protocol told CoinDesk.  Wilkinson agrees but predicts major ICOs on Stellar in 2018, as well as further development on other protocols. The chief scientist for one of those protocols, Dfinity, said on The Third Web podcast that the only real solution is unbounded transaction volume.  As long as it's got a max, entrepreneurs will hit it and clog the network.  However, multiple entrepreneurs CoinDesk confirm they have back-up plans in case ethereum's backlog issue isn't yet resolved.  4. Decentralized apps will deploy  Boost VC's Brayton Williams has already declared 2018 the year of ""talent and shipping"" on Medium.  ""Boost VC has always been about backing the builders, but now we are altering that slightly and we are looking to back those who ship,"" Williams wrote.  As such, entrepreneurs will feel intense pressure to get products into the hands of the public so people can start using tokens for their intended use.  In fact, a $100 million ICO, Status, invested $5 million in New Vector, the company behind decentralized Slack alternative Riot.im, which could hint that we'll see the company integrating with a protocol already popular in the crypto community.  Alpha and beta releases should come fast and furious in 2018. It will be interesting to see what happens to token prices when users first touch them and find them to be (like most early iterations) buggy and slow.  ""I think it's very likely that the prices have gotten ahead of the actual progress,"" Chris Dixon said on a recent episode of Andreessen Horowitz's podcast.  5. Beliefs about token economics will be tested  The big question for 2018 is this: how do utility tokens behave when they actually have utility? None of them really do yet.  Multicoin's Kyle Samani wrote a post about token velocity at the end of 2017, which argued that tokens need to give users a good reason to hold a certain amount or their value will inevitably go to zero.  A consensus seems to have formed around the idea, but it's yet to be tested in an environment where a new token is actively powering its intended use case.  We'll also get to test another widely held assumption in 2018: does wider initial token distribution foster faster adoption, as many founders believe it will, or are investors and users really two different groups?  Whether it works or not, multiple people told us to look for more airdrops as private sales crowd out public ones.  6. Consumer sophistication will increase  Terminology will grow as more people understand the token economy better.  As industries become more sophisticated, their vocabularies expand. Most discussions around ICOs divide their tokens into two categories (utility and security), informed by concerns about regulators.  ""These seem to be traditional ideas that have been also invented based on collective fictions,"" Schadek told CoinDesk. We've even heard thought leaders float other categories.  Tokensoft  cofounder Mason Borda has talked about ""rewards tokens,"" designed for encouraging users to engage in a desirable behavior (like airliness miles). Also on the Andreesen Horowitz podcast, Nick Tomaino added the idea of ""work tokens"" as distinct from other utility tokens.  These tokens represent stakes that allow users to earn income on a protocol.  Filecoin, Augur and NuCypher all incorporate this feature into their tokens. ""I think the most interesting work token will be when ethereum switches from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,"" Tomaino said in the episode.  As entrepreneurs get better at describing and categorizing their creations, the whole community will understand the industry better.  7. Traditional tech companies will decentralize (or at least sell tokens)  This could either prove to be the most important theme of 2018 or a complete dud. Most people believe that familiar tech companies will come up with reasons to issue tokens and raise money.  Even Mark Zuckerberg says he's studying blockchain this year, and obviously Telegram is already reportedly seeking a billion dollars or more.  ""I would guess most large tech giants have someone full time at the company experimenting or on research to make sure they don't miss an opportunity,"" Williams said, but he also expects they will move at roughly regulatory speed.  We have asked several large concerns if they have an ICO in the works, but the ones that reply all deny it. If tech companies genuinely pursue decentralization, Schadek said it would be ""good because it democratizes value creation"" and ""grows the entire crypto pie.""  However, Wilkinson contended, ""Big tech companies pursuing ICOs won't have a valid need for decentralization.""  Rather, in many cases he thinks tokens will prove antithetical to their existing business models.

42428544,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8m5h,1518275713,Musicians Turned Miners? How a DJ Is Disrupting Spotify With Blockchain,"Strobes pulsed through fog as a tightly packed audience sought to get a shot of the DJ.  Revered for his contributions to electronic dance music, Gareth Emery was in the box at London's Ministry of Sound last weekend, there to show off the synths that have helped him win the prestigious ""A State Of Trance Tune Of The Year"" award three times over.  Fans were quickly sent into delirium, almost as delirious as crypto enthusiasts can sometimes seem – an interesting link since Emery, with his new startup Choon, wants to replace the antiquated digital music industry with ethereum tech.  Like many gigs that Emery has played in the past months, the night is a sell out.  ""I'm one of the lucky ones,"" Emery told CoinDesk backstage. ""I get paid really well because I have a lot of fans that will come and see me do gigs.""  However, many musicians are less privileged as their audiences have turned to recorded music, Emery said. In that market, musicians are paid ridiculously low royalties on notoriously unreliable payment rails with long wait times.  ""It's fucking horrendous,"" Emery said. ""Basically we have this system that was designed in the days of sheet music and jukeboxes 60 years ago and it's never been changed.""  According to Emery, while the music industry is anything but short on cash, it has failed to adapt to technological advancements.  But Choon looks to fix that. A streaming service that ""mines"" via a smart contract, Choon gives 80 percent of profits directly to musicians – a step up from similar services like Spotify – which pay out disturbingly low fees (some musicians have estimated it's as low as $0.004891 per stream).  Emery told CoinDesk:  ""We took a different path and said, 'If you were to design the music industry today, how would you do it?'""  Musician as miner  And according to Emery, using blockchain ""for what it's really good at – money and contracts"" is exactly how to create a more equitable music industry.  He's not alone there, the music industry has been one of blockchain entrepreneurs' favorites to disrupt. For instance, Slovenia-based Viberate is trying to eliminate the fee-taking middleman in the music industry, and several high profile people in the music industry have begun their own blockchain projects in this area as well.  But for Choon, Emery is working alongside the developers of CryptoPunks, a digital collectable precursor to CryptoKitties, with the hope of launching in the next six months.  The technology is based on a customizable ""Smart Record Contract"" that stores copyright credentials on the ethereum blockchain, and splits the funds gained from the track fairly between the creator and producer, in the form of an ERC-20 token called NOTES.  These NOTES will be sold in an initial coin offering (ICO) in the coming months. According to Emery, more than 500 artists are already signed up to use the platform, including several big names in the music industry like Darude, creator of the infamous trance track ""Sandstorm,"" and leading dubstep DJ Datsik.  The tokens are programmed to distribute according to how many times a track has been streamed, directly into an artist's wallet. (A breakdown of the distribution can be witnessed live on Choon's functioning testnet).  Artists can cash out NOTES on participating exchanges, but to keep the price of the token high, artists are urged to keep their money inside the Choon system, with Emery hoping the token becomes widely accepted throughout the music industry.  And it has a chance, since artists that use the platform keep full copyright ownership of their work – a change from labels that buy up full copyright as part of the deal.  In the wrong pockets  The global music industry tops something like $130 billion annually.  In spite of this, funds get lost in the machinery – taking elaborate, unnecessary detours to end up in pockets that aren't the musicians.  ""It's just going to the wrong people – copyrighters, publishers, recording labels, streaming companies,"" Emery said. ""I don't see for the most part that we have a need for record labels and publishers.""  Because of the availability and cheapness of production now, artists don't need to be sponsored for studio rent, Emery explained, and social media allows artists to take control of their own marketing. Plus, the manufacturing and distribution of music has become easier for individuals to do themselves.  Yet, regardless, the monopolies still exist, and musicians are struggling to make ends meet.  And because it's so difficult to make money off recorded music, more musicians are pushed into relying on live gigs.  ""I make 99.5 percent of my income from touring and 0.5 percent max from streaming and recording music,"" Emery said.  And that's upsetting since some great musicians cannot or would prefer not to tour due to health conditions and family, he continued, adding that he wants to bring those people back into the lucrative music industry.  The solution, according to Emery, is to wipe out the third party and replace it with a system where artists and their audience are connected directly.  Emery told CoinDesk:  ""We don't really need them anymore, yet they have more power than they ever had before, and the only reason is they just have this iron grip on the flow of money, on the flow of payment.""
