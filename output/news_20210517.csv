42386756,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBV8kz,1621284087,Market Wrap: Elon Taketh Away – Bitcoin Continues Fall as Options Traders Pile Into Puts,"Most cryptocurrencies are down Monday, prompting a flurry of activity in the options markets as traders reposition themselves amid increased volatility.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $44,211 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 2.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $42,269-$46,462 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $3,376 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,142-$3,587 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin dumps, rest of crypto follows    Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Monday 2.8% as of press time and going as low as $42,269 around 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET). BTC was above the 10-hour moving average and below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.      “Over the last three months bitcoin has been consolidating around $50,000 within a volatile and wide $45,000 to $60,000 range,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital. “We are still in a supportive trend generally but a lot of participants are already long bitcoin, so you need more and more bullish news to break this range and the all-time highs.”      BTC volatility is indeed up, according to CoinDesk Research data. As of Sunday, the most recent day for closing data, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility was over 77%, the highest since March 24.      Greg Magadini, CEO of data aggregator Genesis Volatility, also tracks the gyrations in the crypto market by utilizing data from bellwether derivatives exchange Deribit. Late Sunday, the DVOL almost hit 160, by far the highest level of variability over the past month, according to Genesis’ charting.      “We saw the highest print recorded on Deribit's ‘DVOL’ index,” noted Magadini.      “Elon Musk's Twitter activity and BTC's subsequent drop lower proved the bitcoin options market correct,” added Magadini. “Now BTC option markets are very expensive as traders are panic-buying put options.”      Current-day options flow for BTC, according to Skew, are substantiating Magadini’s case. Over 60% of options action were in puts, which is the right but not the obligation to sell an asset before a specified expiration date.    Selling When Tesla Hasn’t    Puts could possibly prove lucrative for BTC options traders, but analysts continue to be concerned about the whims of Musk, CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla and an increasingly influential cryptocurrency tweeter.      “Tesla's recent decision to stop accepting bitcoin for car purchases, and remarks on its environmental impact, seem to have had an impact on bitcoin's price,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader.      Even CNBC’s Jim Cramer has weighed in on Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s grip on the cryptocurrency market, concerned the entrepreneur’s tweets seem to be a catalyst for dumps as well as bullish runs.      This selling comes despite Musk making it clear via Twitter (of course) Sunday that Tesla has not sold any of its bitcoin holdings, reportedly worth more than $1 billion.      “BTC still remains king in the cryptomarket,” added Andreotti. “And when it goes down, [altcoins] inevitably follow suit. Everything is just following bitcoin, in my opinion.”    Welcome to the new BTC range: the $40Ks    Bitcoin was trading around $38,000 on Feb. 7, when Musk first tweeted about crypto regarding dog-friendly meme asset dogecoin (DOGE). BTC then went as high as $64,829 (a record) on April 15 but is now back to February levels, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      So where does bitcoin’s price go from here?      “Indicators show that most likely BTC will stay in the range between $42,000 to $47,000,” noted investor and technical analyst Constantin Kogan.      “The bitcoin price seems to be driven randomly by the latest anecdotal tweet or rumor,” said Tellurian Capital’s Bonnefous. “On the other hand, ether is still under-invested and has a stronger outlook and resilience in the shorter term.”      Read More: Bitcoin Suffers Biggest Pullback This Year With Drop to 3.5-Month Low    ETH price follows bitcoin; call options still favored    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was trading around $3,376 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), down 1% over the prior 24 hours. ETH went as low as $3,142 around 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET). The asset is above the 10-hour moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.      Analysts have been mostly focused on BTC Monday because of the drop in the signature blockchain asset, and most of the rest of the crypto ecosystem seems to be following that trend. However, Genesis Volatility’s Magadini says the derivatives markets between BTC and ETH are behaving quite differently.      “Something we've written about in our newsletter for the past couple of weeks is regarding the divergence between ETH and BTC option skew,” Magadini said. “BTC had been relatively bearish in skew despite prices climbing slightly higher while ETH had a screaming bullish skew.”      ETH options are still trending bullish: While over 60% of bitcoin options are puts, 55% of ether options are calls, based on Monday’s option market flows. Calls are the right but not the obligation to buy an asset before a specific expiration date – and can be used by traders to bet on upside.      The ETH/BTC trading pair, offered on most spot crypto exchanges, reflects the strength of one asset over the other. When the pair is up, it shows traders are selling BTC for ether. When the pair is down, investors are dumping ETH for bitcoin. While the pair did hit as high as 0.082 BTC on May 15, it's now in a downtrend since that zenith.      “ETH had seen strong performance relative to bitcoin,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “ETH/BTC was up to 0.08 BTC, a level not seen since Jun 2018.”      ETH/BTC is down almost 1% on Coinbase Monday.

42386748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBV8dR,1621282907,DarkSide Hackers' Bitcoin Stash Tracked,"Blockchain sleuthing firm Crystal Blockchain says it has located the bitcoin address that DarkSide hackers used to collect ransom from the Colonial Pipeline and shared it with CoinDesk.      Unlike in traditional finance, with public blockchains every transaction leaves a trace. That provides rare visibility into the money movements of the cybercriminal world.      Last week, Colonial Pipeline halted operations for six days, prompting a gas shortage crisis across the Southeastern U.S., after hackers, believed to be based in Russia, hit it with a cyberattack, encrypting the company’s data. On May 8, Colonial Pipeline agreed to pay 75 BTC (or about $5 million) to the attackers and soon after was able to resume work.      Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said in a blog post last week that it had identified DarkSide’s wallets addresses, but didn’t disclose the addresses themselves. According to Crystal Blockchain, a subsidiary of Bitfury, a security and infrastructure provider for the Bitcoin blockchain, the address that received the ransom is bc1q7eqww9dmm9p48hx5yz5gcvmncu65w43wfytpsf.    Connecting the dots    There were several facts that suggested this address was the one involved in collecting the ransom, Kyrylo Chykhradze, product director at Crystal Blockchain, told CoinDesk. “We found the transactions in the blockchain knowing the day of transaction and the amount sent,” Chykhradze said. “We analyzed each potential cluster (of addresses) and found additional evidence in one of them: a transaction of $4.4 million, or 78 BTC sent by Brenntag,” a chemical distribution company.      Brenntag, another victim of DarkSide, paid a ransom on May 11, Bleeping Computer reported. Elliptic also mentioned that transaction as additional evidence pointing at the bitcoin addresses associated with the hackers. Another piece of evidence pointed out by both Elliptic and Crystal: the cluster of addresses associated with hackers sent its last transaction last Thursday – the day when DarkSide reportedly got its servers seized by unspecified authorities.      Bitcoin wallets are constituted of clusters of addresses, whose keys are managed by specific software. Blockchain analytics firms combine separate addresses on the blockchain into clusters and associate them with certain entities using specific rules of thumb. The most important one is clustering transaction inputs that are spent together.      According to the data from Crystal’s blockchain analytic tool, DarkSide’s cluster included 30 addresses, which together received 321.5 BTC, since the first transaction on March 4. All those funds ultimately left the cluster, with the biggest amount sent to the Binance crypto exchange (over 53.3 BTC, or 16% of all funds).    Going dark    The second-largest receiver of funds is the Hydra darknet marketplace, which received over 14.6 BTC from the DarkSide wallets, or 4.5% of its funds. Hydra is the world’s biggest illegal narcotics marketplace, operating mostly in Russia and Eastern Europe, according to Chainalysis. The website also provides other illegal goods, including fake ID documents, counterfeit banknotes, as well as physical cash in exchange for bitcoin.      Other recipients of the DarkSide funds include little known exchanges named Ren, Zillion Bits, as well as the U.S.-based centralized exchange Poloniex and Estonia-based Garantex. Smaller amounts were also sent to other well-known major exchanges and peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces, including Coinbase, Huobi, OKEx, Paxful and LocalBitcoins.      A relatively small amount, less than half a BTC, ended up in the privacy-oriented Wasabi wallet.      The last transaction sent by the cluster occurred on May 13, when 107 BTC was sent to a single unknown address, which has only been active for one day and received three incoming transactions.

42386759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBV8jj,1621280547,Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn't Need a Savior,"Elon Musk has big plans for dogecoin, everybody!      Unfortunately this is an absurd statement on quite a few levels, as we’ll get into.      It’s also Elon at his most Elon, asserting his expertise in crypto just as eagerly as he claimed he would bring world changing innovation to rescue submarines and respirators and public transit – all of which ended in some degree of disappointment.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist.    Musk isn’t alone in this unfortunate habit. Successful tech entrepreneurs, or even just lucky investors, seem particularly vulnerable to what’s known as “The Peter Principle.” The principle was first laid out in 1969 as a corporate management problem, based on the observation that successful workers were often promoted beyond the level of their own abilities. The concept has over time taken on the broader meaning that successful people will expand into new arenas until they hit the limits of their ability and fail, sometimes spectacularly. Silicon Valley leaders, in particular, seem frequently eager to reach beyond what they know and prove that their unique insights apply more broadly. Like Musk, they’re frequently wrong.      Musk, of course, can be forgiven for dabbling, maybe even more than most tech leaders. He is a legitimate business genius, and personally I believe that his creation of Tesla and SpaceX will have benefits to humanity so big that we won’t fully grasp them for generations. His real, history-making successes help explain why Musk’s particular brand of overreach has so often helped his reputation, as when multiple companies were founded to pursue his dubiously practical Hyperloop concept.    Read more: David Morris: Musk Has Doge on a Leash. Is He a Manipulator?    But this time, he may have tried to technologically revolutionize the wrong hornet’s nest. His doge-scaling tweet seems to have been the breaking point for crypto long-timers already exhausted by his confusing, contradictory glibness, and they responded in a fusillade of withering scorn.      It didn’t help that, shortly after the doge tweet, Musk also made a typically bull-in-a-china-shop intimation that Tesla might sell its bitcoin. (That turned out to not be true, which could wind up being of interest to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It’s also notable that Musk was replying to an account that has itself been widely accused of scamming.)      The absurdity helped trigger a big crypto market sell-off, with bitcoin dropping a bit over 7% in the following 24 hours. Doge dropped much less, which makes perfect sense when you think about it. Most of the people who followed Musk into doge didn’t know any better, and still don’t.      The drop extended a longer losing streak for bitcoin. But that also seems like it might be a healthy turning point in crypto’s attitude toward a man who knows less than he thinks he does.    Doge scaling is a myth    You’ll have to look elsewhere for a nuanced technical rebuttal of Musk’s doge upgrade proposal, but the reaction from blockchain experts like Cornell University’s Emin Gun Sirer was overwhelmingly unified: It’s bullsh*t.      Peter McCormack of the ""What Bitcoin Did"" podcast, while admitting he’s not a technical guru, delivered a more detailed takedown of Musk’s musings:        And this isn’t merely an academic debate about which reasonable people can differ. Elon seems unaware that big blocks have already been thoroughly vetted by the marketplace in the bitcoin Block Size Wars of 2017, with clear results. Bitcoin Cash and later Bitcoin SV both pursued a bigger-blocks vision for Bitcoin starting in 2017, and while BCH has stuck around, it’s worth about 2% of bitcoin’s value.      Elon responded to all this blowback by reminding onlookers that, as one of the creators of PayPal, he might have some insight.      This is pretty thin gruel on technical grounds, given how fundamentally different blockchain currencies are from mere digital banking rails. It also seems to highlight a big political blind spot for Musk, because PayPal is precisely the kind of centralized and censorious payments provider crypto is dedicated to upending.      In other words, Musk defended himself by doubling down on the Peter Principle.    Don’t follow leaders, check your parking meters    To the genuine credit of the crypto community, all of this has been met with withering scorn toward Musk, occasionally the richest man in the world. If he had any designs on taking a leadership position in the crypto community, he has likely destroyed them.      Some, admittedly, are more than happy to let him remain the ""dogefather.""      This response is admirable simply because it shows no willingness to sacrifice the truth to coddle a misinformed but influential billionaire. More broadly, negging Musk seems positive for the industry simply because he lacks the right character to positively contribute. His embrace of arrogance extends to recently taking the title of ""Technoking of Tesla."" That’s of course a bit of a joke, but there’s always truth in a joke – and crypto has no appetite for kings.      You can push back against that sort of empty swagger when your own position is so strong. Even after Musk’s rug-pull, BTC and doge prices are still above where they were just three months ago. Musk’s adventures in crypto have almost certainly been a long-term net positive simply by virtue of raising awareness, and so there’s little mourning as he files out the revolving door marked ""dilettantes.""      By contrast, bitcoin was crucial to Tesla's most recent earnings win. “Elon needs bitcoin more than bitcoin needs Elon” isn’t just a mantra, it’s simple reality.      Compare Elon’s behavior with two other figures who could rightly declare themselves king of something or other: Vitalik Buterin and Jack Dorsey. You might not even immediately connect Dorsey to crypto, but he made a huge splash by adding bitcoin sales to the Cash App in January 2018, and Square has also been funding bitcoin development for years.      That’s arguably more than Elon Musk has ever done for crypto, and yet Dorsey hasn’t shown anything close to Elon’s yen for philosopher-king mountaintop declarations. (And Square, for what it’s worth, is in the process of eating PayPal’s lunch.)      An even more sterling example was provided by Vitalik Buterin, nearly simultaneously with Elon’s peacocking. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder and figurehead of Ethereum, simply destroyed billions of dollars' worth of altcoins he had been ""gifted"" unwillingly in an apparent marketing stunt. He also warned token founders not to pull the same shenanigans again, saying “I don’t *want* to be a locus of power of that kind.”      Vitalik’s gesture, unlike Elon’s declarations, was met with widespread praise. Not only was it a seeming rebuke of the same spammy token-generation that doge itself was intended to spoof, Vitalik’s disavowal of his own influence is fully in line with the leaderless, community-driven ethos at the core of crypto.      It’s an example Musk could stand to learn from.",NEGATIVE,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | ETH | TRADING,David Z.

42423989,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j3zh,1621277661,Buyer of Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet Reportedly Arrested in Iran,"Sina Estavi, the businessman who bought a non-fungible token (NFT) of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet for $2.9 million, has reportedly been arrested in Iran, according to a now-deleted message posted on his verified Twitter account.  Although Iranian officials confirmed arresting members of Estavi’s company, it is unclear if the Malaysia-based businessman was one of those detained. According to multiple local media outlets, Estavi has been detained.  Officials in Iran apparently seized Estavi’s Twitter account early on Monday, posting, “The owner of this media outlet was arrested on charges of disrupting the economic system, by order of the Special Court for Economic Crimes.”  The charges have yet to be specified, but the tweet stated that additional information was available via the website of the Organized Crime Investigation Center, an affiliate of the Cyber Defense Command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The tweet was posted at 08:48 a.m. UTC (4:48 a.m. ET) on Monday.  An accompanying statement posted on the Crime Investigation Center’s website Gerdab.ir said that members of blockchain firm Bridge Oracle, of which Estavi is CEO, were arrested on charges of disrupting the country's economic system as ordered by the Special Economic Crimes Court. According to the statement, the investigation into the Bridge project had started nine months ago.  The statement does not name Estavi himself but local media outlet Mehrnews reported that the statement confirms his arrest.  The tweet announcing Estavi’s arrest was deleted by the account at around 4:40 p.m. UTC (12:40 p.m ET).  Estavi is also the head of Malaysia-based cryptocurrency exchange CryptoLand. In March, Estavi won a bidding war over Tron founder Justin Sun for Dorsey’s tokenized tweet. Estavi compared Dorsey’s “Genesis Tweet” to Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa,” calling it a “piece of human history.”  However, unofficial allegations against Estavi had been mounting for some time. In January, Mate Tokay, co-founder of Bitcoin.com was reportedly planning to sue Estavi for allegedly failing to compensate Tokay for his services as an adviser on the Bridge project, as well as using his name to promote the project and its native token BRG. It is unclear if Tokay followed through with the suit. Tokay did not respond to requests for comment and the original articlehttps://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-com-co-founder-files-legal-action-against-bridge-linktoken-project-over-market-manipulation/ about the plans for a lawsuit are no longer available on Bitcoin.com.  Soon after Estavi bought the tweet, Bridge users began accusing Estavi of committing fraud and misleading investors on Twitter. The allegations escalated after Iranian crypto researcher Kave Moshtaq insinuated Estavi had sent thugs to intimidate him outside an Iranian courthouse in April. Moshtaq had gone to court in relation to a complaint against Estavi.  “After leaving the court, five motorcyclists stopped me in front of the car and hit me. Fists landed on my face,” Moshtaq wrote on Twitter, alongside a photo with blood on his face.  Two days later, the Iranian Blockchain Association put out a call for information, inviting Estavi and those complaining against him to submit documents and information to the association.  The association published the call for information after “receiving many complaints” about Bridge, Estavi and CryptoLand.  At the time of publishing, the CryptoLand website displayed an “access denied” error message. The price of BRG plunged after the tweet was published on Monday.  The statement from the Cyber Organized Crime Investigation Center hinted that the BRG project was “illegal, unreliable and unsupported” and said users in Iran are still caught in the trap of fraudulent activities associated with cryptocurrencies “due to lack of financial literacy and knowledge of investing in cyberspace.""

42415776,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXOBB,1621274670,"As Newbies Panic in Latest Bitcoin Correction, Old Pros Appear to Buy on the Dip","Blockchain data shows that the latest bitcoin market correction, which sent the oldest cryptocurrency down by more than 35% from its peak price above $64,000, may have been driven by panic selling from investors who bought during the recent bull market.  “The bitcoin market is in a historically significant correction,” blockchain data analytics firm Glassnode wrote in a post on Monday. “There are strong signals that short-term holders are leading with panic selling.”  At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands at $42,860.11, down 9.65% in the past 24 hours, based on the CoinDesk 20. The steep price drop came after a series of tweets by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in which he initially failed to deny outright that his electric-car company has sold or could soon sell all of its more than $1 billion holdings of BTC. He later clarified that Tesla had not sold any of the holdings.  On Wednesday, Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as a form of payment because of concerns about its impact on the environment. The price fell by nearly 13% that day, or more than $7,000, on the Coinbase exchange, according to TradingView.  In the post Monday, Glassnode, citing several key blockchain data metrics, said that the market correction has been led by new investors who are selling in a panic.  The ""short-term holder SOPR,"" or STH-SOPR that filters for coins younger than 155 days, dropped well below the key threshold of 1, meaning that newer market entrants appear to have ""panic-sold"" and realized “significant” losses on their invesments, according to Glassnode.  SOPR measures the net profit/loss position of bitcoin outstanding. A reading below 1 implies that any bitcoin moved that day is on average selling at a loss. At the time of writing, while the SOPR for the long-term holders is also trending downward, the value is still above 4.  At the same time, the number of accumulation addresses of bitcoin continues to rise, as the count of non-zero balance addresses dropped by about 2.8% – indicating that long-term holders are buying on the latest price dip, according to the Glassnode post.  With bitcoin still at a much higher price than it was during the last bull market, bigger capital inflows are needed to drive a full price recovery, according to Glassnode’s report  On the other hand, the blockchain data also might imply that the current correction could be “a larger time-frame pullback in a bull cycle.”  “Weak hands capitulate,” Glassnode said. “And stronger hands recommence their accumulation of cheaper coins.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/17/as-newbies-panic-in-latest-bitcoin-correction-old-pros-appear-to-buy-on-the-dip,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b62fd02dff6ddbc87baf75e3508876a7aa1cf01d-1241x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406424,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuApt,1621268865,Bitcoiners' Approach to the Climate Change Fight Isn't Working – This Might,"Tesla giving in on the bitcoin and energy fight doesn't mean Elon Musk actually believes bitcoin is a net harm for the environment. It just means Tesla has realized this is a fight that's not worth waging because it can't be won. Tesla is right.      Bitcoiners are never going to win the fight over energy on their own.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Crypto, more broadly, is losing the fight over climate and energy, because refutations don't work. Facts and reason never persuade anyone.      Whomever sets the terms of a debate in the public mind wins that debate. Arguing this argument is a losing proposition. The only way to win it is to create a new conversation.      The narrative that bitcoin uses too much energy is set. It's a fixed thing in space. The only way to get past it is to create another narrative that is more compelling.      I believe there is another narrative, one with the useful property of also being correct, but to advance it will require bitcoiners to do something many are loath to do: acknowledge the utility of other blockchains.      There's potential for cryptocurrency to help the grid go green. Energy production as we know it wastes a lot of energy, particularly in transmission over great distances and in waste heat. More sources of energy closer to their users, including more small renewable sources, would reduce waste on the grid, but lots of energy sources create a new set of problems: coordination problems.    Read more: The Myths and Realities of ‘Green Bitcoin’    What technology shows promise in coordinating multiple competitive parties? Cryptocurrency and blockchain.      The electricity grid and global banking are similar. They are both highly centralized. They are both industries where incumbents use regulators to keep out competition and control their markets.    Energy waste is wired in, literally    Transmission is a key issue in reducing waste.      Because folks like to throw national equivalents around, the United States wastes something like 5% of its power in transmission, which is roughly the equivalent of what the Netherlands and Colombia combined consume in total each year. And that's just energy wasted in wires here.      The U.S. grid transmits comparatively efficiently. Other countries waste a much greater proportion of their produced energy moving it around.      Beyond transmission waste, cities and towns would also be able to get more sources of alternative energy online if the grid were better able to manage them. Micro-grid is the term of art for power sources that can be islanded from the larger grid as needed, but can oftentimes also contribute excess power to that grid. Sometimes micro-grids are deployed to protect infrastructure that simply can't go down (such as transportation systems or military bases), but they also have real advantages in terms of waste reduction and increasing renewables in the energy mix.    Compelling narratives win controversies; facts and reasoning do not.    A single house can be a micro-grid unto itself if it's able to communicate with the broader grid about when it should shut off as needed.      The trouble with micro-grids for the energy as we know it is the wires can only hold so much juice, so it's important not to overload them. At times of high capacity on the network, some parts of the grid need to be shut off so wires don't melt. It's also crucial when the power is out, so workers can safely make repairs.      The grid needs to figure out on the fly which sources should be connected and which shouldn't. It's a complex and contingent conundrum. In other words, it's a market.      Cryptocurrency looks like it could be very useful in sorting out markets just like that. Markets in general are good at coordination problems, but with energy one is needed that can operate at internet speed and one in which no one actor can dominate to shut others out. A fast blockchain that can handle lots of tiny transactions super fast might be a great help here.      So if the cryptocurrency technology Bitcoin pioneered really does prove to be a key infrastructure component of a green future, that provides a crucial cover for Bitcoin, because Satoshi's invention will have enabled it.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Bitcoin’s Green Imperative    But advancing this story would require bitcoiners to accept that all of crypto is one big industry and the future is not, in fact, one that belongs exclusively to bitcoin.      Arguing that bitcoin mostly uses renewables isn't working and it should be obvious why: that argument accepts the premise.    How discourse works    Bitcoin and energy use are part of a larger dialectic about human impact on climate. Dialectics are large meetings of ideas that move history forward: The world comes to a consensus around one idea, which dominates, until it's confronted with another compelling idea.      ""Bitcoin isn't green"" is a thesis that rests on a larger thesis, a correct thesis, that humans have had an adverse effect on climate.      ""Bitcoin's really not that bad and actually this argument's whole premise isn't fair anyway"" isn't an antithesis to that thesis; it's just quibbling. Bitcoin needs to put forward an antithesis. The crypto industry as a whole needs to advance another narrative that stands on its own.      Centralization of power inherently wastes energy: That is a good antithesis.      Cryptocurrency looks like it might be very good at enabling decentralized, real-time markets. Markets are good at coordination and that's why this industry could be crucial to a less-wasteful economy.      Compelling narratives win controversies; facts and reasoning do not.    Read more: Oil and Gas Miner Teams With Canadian Tech Firm for Green Bitcoin Mining    As someone who has cared about climate change for much, much longer than he's been interested in cryptocurrency, I happen to think I'm right about the role this technology could play in addressing climate issues (but we won't know until someone tries it). Being right is nice, but it's not especially useful in winning society-wide arguments. The very good refutations bitcoiners make are only making headway with bitcoiners.      Being right doesn't move a dialectic, but telling a compelling story does.      The industry's current approach to this controversy is not compelling. How do I know?

42406422,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuAou,1621268218,Coinbase Falls Below $250 Reference Price for First Time Amid Crypto Correction,"Coinbase’s stock tumbled below the cryptocurrency exchange’s direct listing reference price of $250 for the first time early Monday New York time after an Elon Musk tweet caused a sell-off in bitcoin and other cryptos.      The stock closed at $258 per share on Friday after flirting with the reference price several times that day. It plunged early Monday to a record low of $238. The drop was triggered by the Tesla CEO’s tweet Sunday that implied he either had sold or might sell the electric vehicle maker’s more than $1 billion in bitcoin.      The Coinbase stock recovered some ground after Musk confirmed Tesla had not (yet) sold its bitcoin holdings. The stock was back up to $246 as of press time. This is the first time COIN has fallen below the price that Goldman Sachs and the Nasdaq decided it should trade at before the exchange’s direct listing. On that day, the stock opened well above the reference price at $381 and rose as high as $429.54 before closing at $328.      Since then, the price of COIN has trended downward, dropping 21.3% from its closing price of $328 on April 14 to $258 as of Friday.      COIN's drop seemed to follow that of bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, where the price fell 20.5% during the same period. The dual drop seemed to confirm what some equity analysts had pondered at the time of Coinbase’s listing – that COIN might act as a proxy bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Given COIN’s drop in response to bitcoin’s plunge, that correlation seems more definite.      COIN is far from the only company stock brought low by Musk’s tweet. MicroStrategy (MSTR), another stock viewed as a proxy for bitcoin due to the billions in dollars worth held on the balance sheet, is down 6.7% to $486.

The broader adoption of CBDCs will present authorities with trade-offs between risks and benefits, Fitch Ratings said in a research note.  “Widespread adoption of CBDCs may be disruptive for financial systems if associated risks are not managed,” Fitch Ratings analysts Monsur Hussain and Duncan Innes-Ker wrote in the note.  “These [risks] include the potential for funds to move quickly into CBDC accounts from bank deposits, causing financial disintermediation, and for heightened cybersecurity threats as more touchpoints are created between the central bank and the economy,” said the analysts.  The firm said the key benefits of retail CBDCs lie in their potential to enhance authority-backed cashless payments and the opportunity to bring underbanked communities into the financial system.  The downsides of CBDC include the potential that they may offer less privacy than cash or that governments could severely limit the amounts held in electronic wallets. Either scenario could deter the public from using them.  The warning by Fitch comes as banks are racing toward launching CBDCs. In October, the Central Bank of the Bahamas officially introduced its digital currency, the sand dollar, a digital version of the Bahamian dollar, while China is close to launching the digital yuan and is testing the CBDC with commercial institutions and the public.  Recently, the Bank of Israel said it is accelerating its research into CBDCs and making preparations in case it decides to issue a digital shekel.  Elsewhere, Sweden's Riksbank and the European Central Bank are actively researching and developing their own digital currencies in preparation for expected launches in the next four to five years.

42406432,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuAwm,1621266520,From Risky to Promising: Ukraine's Quest to Become a Dream Crypto Jurisdiction,"Ukraine, one of the most active crypto nations in the world, is striving to be a dream jurisdiction for crypto businesses. Legislators and the local crypto community are working together on a package of laws that would write crypto into the country’s legal system, open the banks for crypto startups and offer a simple procedure for tax reporting.      But Ukraine still has an important obstacle to overcome: real-world politics.      Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula in 2014 and has sponsored soldiers who invaded the Eastern part of Ukraine. A civil war ensued that turned into a standoff. The conflict has been draining Ukraine’s economy ever since.      Read also: Why Ukraine Is Ripe For Crypto Adoption      In the middle of April I wrote to Mikhail Chobanyan, the founder of Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna, to ask what’s the latest news in Ukrainian crypto.    We will explore Ukrainian crypto in the Crypto State track at Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27. Register here.    “Not sure about crypto, but everyone’s panicking because of your troops,” he responded, referring to the troops that Russia, where I’m based, had accumulated near the Ukrainian border. The troops, armed with heavy ammunition, were soon called back, but the possibility of a war is something Ukraine has to live with day in and day out.    Political complications    In September, Chainalysis reported that Ukraine leads the world in crypto adoption, in large part thanks to its tech-savvy population. Ukraine is also known for good developers, including some prominent Bitcoin Core contributors including Gleb Naumenko and Hennady Stepanov.      But last year Bermuda-based crypto exchange Bittrex Global stopped serving users from Ukraine and other nations including Belarus, Burundi, Mali, Myanmar, Nicaragua and Panama. In a Sept. 11 blog post, the company cited the “current regulatory environment,” without further details.      Read also: Ukraine Leads Global Crypto Adoption, Chainalysis Says in New Report      Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister of digital transformation of Ukraine, told CoinDesk the Ukrainian government got in touch with Bittrex Global about the issue and was told Ukraine had occupied territories inside its borders.      That most likely meant the Crimea peninsula, Bornyakov said. The U.S. and European Union prohibit doing business with counterparties in Crimea under threat of sanctions. So serving residents of Crimea might get Bittrex sanctioned. It is hard to separate Crimean users from the rest of the country, the exchange said, according to Bornyakov.      The Ministry of Digital Transformation suggested some technological options to facilitate separating Crimea from the rest of the country so Ukrainian citizens with no connection to disputed territories could use the exchange. The ministry is waiting for Bittrex to consider those options and respond, Bornyakov said.      Bittrex Global spokesperson John McLeod declined to comment on this subject.    Risky region    Geopolitics is not the only obstacle to the nation becoming a crypto hub. Ukraine is not considered a safe jurisdiction for global business interactions. Cybercrime flourishes across Eastern Europe, including hacking and active use of crypto for illicit purposes.      According to the recent report by Chainalysis, Eastern Europe receives more ransomware proceeds than other region in the world and is actively sending and receiving money from dark web marketplaces, especially the illegal drug market Hydra.      So, great IT talent aside, Ukraine is struggling to promote its companies on the global stage.      “Companies from the U.S. and Europe openly told us that working with this jurisdiction is a risk for them,” said Alex Momot, CEO at a Ukrainian startup Remme.      It turns out, however, that crypto can be more forgiving than more traditional industries. Remme started out selling cybersecurity products, but quickly learned being from Ukraine made some clients hesitant to do business.      “When we started building our product in 2018, we talked to a water utility company in one of the states [of America], and the person we talked to simply said: ‘Guys, all is great but I can’t tell the management that our critical IT solution comes from Ukraine,” Momot told CoinDesk.      At IT conferences, Momot and his team noticed that people in the West liked Ukrainian coders but didn’t want to buy a finished product from a company based in Ukraine. Remme had some clients, but the revenue was not great, Momot said. The coronavirus pandemic was the final straw.      “In April 2020, we were thinking of closing shop as we were selling our last crypto [holdings]. So we decided to switch entirely to crypto.” Now Remme is selling trading bots for DeFi, and clients don’t care about jurisdictions, only about the company’s track record, Momot said.    Keeping it clean    Corruption is another obstacle Ukraine must overcome to become a global crypto hub. According to the World Bank’s overview of the country, “Ukrainians continue to feel that more needs to be done to improve governance. Lack of trust in public institutions remains a fundamental concern for most people.”      In March, the National Anti-Corruption Committee published instructions mandating how civil servants in Ukraine detail how much crypto they own in their annual property declarations.      When the public officials complied, hundreds of them reported owning whopping amounts of bitcoin. Vyacheslav Mishalov, the most crypto-rich (on paper) of the civil servants and a member of the Dnipro city council, claimed he didn't actually own 18,000 BTC – once the nation’s anti-corruption agency announced it would investigate all these bitcoin holdings.    Regulators at work    Despite these challenges, Ukrainians aren’t giving up on their dream of making the country a destination for crypto businesses.      Ukraine already has laws related to crypto including one that cryptocurrency transactions, like bank wires, are subject to anti-money laundering monitoring.      But some people are thinking much bigger. At the moment, Ukraine has a framework draft bill awaiting passage in the national parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. The Draft Bill on Virtual Assets passed its first hearing on Dec. 2, 2020. Now the lawmakers are working on a set of amendments to get it ready for the next two hearings, after which it can become a law.      The bill defines virtual assets as “a set of data in electronic form,” which “can be an independent object of civil transactions, as well as certify property or non-property rights.” Virtual assets can not be a legal tender in Ukraine.      Artem Afyan, partner at the Juscutum law firm and a participant in the working group that authored the bill, told CoinDesk the measure treats virtual assets as a non-material asset, similar to intellectual property.      Under the new law, crypto service providers will have to register and provide information on their ownership structure and beneficiaries, take measures against money laundering and make sure their users’ personal data is protected.      After the main bill is passed and crypto gains legal status, lawmakers will be able to work on establishing a favorable taxation regime for crypto. According to another draft bill that’s been waiting in the parliament since 2019, crypto will be taxed at a 5% rate for the first five years after the law is in force, and at the personal income rate of 18% after that.      Afyan believes that if Ukraine passes the bill, the country might become very popular among crypto startups, surpassing jurisdictions with better reputations as crypto-friendly destinations, such as Switzerland. Why? Ukraine has lower taxes and it’s much easier to open a bank account due to less-onerous onboarding rules and procedures.      “Ukraine has a real chance to become one of the most attractive jurisdictions for crypto,” Afyan said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/17/from-risky-to-promising-ukraines-quest-to-become-a-dream-crypto-jurisdiction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0462dd41d145f1d79bc08a68c805d5e73c4a9dd0-1500x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406428,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuAvn,1621266072,"Elon Musk: Less Grifter, More Puppet Master","On Friday, May 14, Jackson Palmer, the co-creator of Dogecoin, returned to Twitter and called Elon Musk a ""self-absorbed grifter.""      Is Palmer accurate? Is the Tesla CEO little more than a grifter?    John Mac Ghlionn is a cryptocurrency researcher and writer.    Whether you answered that question definitively or not, one thing is indisputable – Elon Musk is controversial. On Twitter, very much his soapbox of choice, Musk dictates the cultural narrative, with many of his 54 million followers hanging on his every tweet. His influence is immense. Remember, this is a man who has the ability to break the internet with an eggplant emoji.      Anything he touches generates controversy. The actor Kevin Smith, most famous for playing Silent Bob in his film ""Clerks,"" once said the term “controversial” is little more than a “euphemism for interesting and intelligent.”      Musk is most definitely interesting, and he is most definitely intelligent. He has found a way to dominate culture, generate controversy, and commodify friction. In the outrage economy, few others have profited like Musk. Without his ability to commodify controversy, would he be one of the richest men in the world? No.    Read more: John Mac Ghlionn – Too Musk Power for One Man    Many see Musk as an inventor, like Nikola Tesla. But he’s not. He is an entrepreneur. He possesses an unrivaled ability to explore and exploit value-added novelty in economic and social spheres. Everything he touches generates interest, and this interest generates revenue. The man who plans to colonize Mars has already colonized culture, and cryptocurrencies have played a pivotal role in Elon Musk’s rise to prominence.      In February of this year, Tesla announced it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. A short time later, the company confirmed it was willing to accept bitcoin payments in exchange for its products. Environmental activists were not happy. The reasons why are obvious. Bitcoin, in its current form, is terrible for the planet. Nevertheless, shortly after Tesla announced plans to accept crypto payments, bitcoin shot up in value.    Dominate the media and you dominate the world.    The puppet master pulled the strings and the world reacted. However, the decision to accept bitcoin was little more than a PR stunt. First, because bitcoiners are notorious HODLers, they are reluctant to use the cryptocurrency to purchase anything. Over a decade ago, a young man from Florida purchased a couple of pizzas with bitcoin. That was a financially costly mistake for the Floridian but a highly instructive one for the Bitcoin community.    Second, as CoinDesk has highlighted, trying to purchase a Tesla with bitcoin was like trying to teach a cat how to code. In other words, extremely difficult. As noted at the time, “according to the company’s Bitcoin Payment Terms and Conditionshttps://www.tesla.com/assets/pdf/btc_terms_and_conditions_en_US.pdf, bitcoin transactions must be completed within a certain window of time or else the price in BTC expires and the buyer must ask for a new price.”    If you happened to purchase a Tesla with bitcoin, found yourself unhappy with the car, and wanted a refund, you faced a world of trouble, noted CoinDesk columnist JP Koning.    Read more: David Morris: Musk Has Doge on a Leash. Is He a Manipulator?    On March 12, announcing that Tesla would no longer be accepting bitcoin as a payment method, Musk delivered one of the most notable U-turns in recent times. Bitcoin’s destructive impact on the environment, we were told, inspired the dramatic decision. Musk’s tweet resulted in bitcoin nosediving in value.      People like Dave Portnoy did not buy Musk’s newfound concern for the environment. The Barstool Sports founder took to Twitter to call out the billionaire, saying, “Elon Musk just tried to tank bitcoin. The same Elon Musk who had bitcoin on Tesla’s spreadsheet and their balance sheet so Tesla can show profit at the end of the quarter because they aren’t selling cars, now suddenly bitcoin is bad.”      Was Musk simply manipulating the cryptocurrency market? There is reason to think so, as CoinDesk’s David Morris wrote last week.      Shortly after the bitcoin announcement, dogecoin jumped by 22% in value. The “Dogefather,” destroyer of norms, announced that he was working to improve the network’s transaction efficiency.      Crypto, like Twitter, appears to be Musk’s plaything. He is an expert troll, and he clearly gets a kick from shattering reality on a regular basis. Elon Musk is officially the “hold my drink” guy. However, when an uber-influential individual tweets something out, the effects can be extremely profound. Donald Trump, when president, demonstrated this perfectly.      Whether or not Musk was intentionally manipulating the market is debatable. Nevertheless, even if he was, does any of this hurt brand Musk? Of course not.    Read more: Opinion – Bitcoiners Should Go Vegan to Save Bitcoin    The 49-year-old has found a way to monetize controversy, consistently and without shame. He sucks up so much cultural oxygen that influential figures like Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan and the Kardashians barely register on the current “who’s who” radar. The monopolization of cultural oxygen is, of course, strategic. Dominate the media and you dominate the world. Considering Musk spends nothing on advertising, the desire to dominate the narrative is, again, strategic. The anti-ad entrepreneur is a master puppeteer. When he sings (or tweets), the world dances.      Which brings us back to Palmer’s comment. One cannot be as successful as Musk without being self-absorbed. You don’t become one of the richest people in the world without a high degree of egomaniacal focus.      Now, is Musk a grifter? No, he is a grafter, a workaholic with an uncanny ability to control the cultural narrative. He is an astoundingly intelligent troll. Grifters are small-time crooks; they don’t run the world. Musk, on the other hand, appears to be the most important man in the world right now.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET,John Mac Ghlionn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/17/elon-musk-less-grifter-more-puppet-master,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7475ec9f0cf36befaed7f9dd8bdbc5a94dae5647-1920x2492.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round was joined by actor Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures and entrepreneur Mark Cuban.      The crypto startup has soared in transaction volume and monthly active users since its November 2020 seed extension. Now supporting 54 DeFi protocols, it plans to launch an on-platform app store for developers and is working on a Zapper mobile app.      The raise pumps fresh capital into one of DeFi’s popular asset management tools. Zapper said it boasts 150,000 monthly active users and recently crossed the $3 billion in total transacted volume watermark. Its web app plugs into users’ wallets for easy balance viewing; it also lets users swap, stake and yield farm across multiple chains.    Our goal is to have this one portal where you can track all your assets.    CEO Seb Audet said the native app store will help Zapper keep up with the “exploding” ecosystem of DeFi products by letting the community pitch in with new features. Zapper’s in-house engineers have already integrated the platform with 54 protocols for one-stop viewing in a break from DeFi’s “fragmented” nature.      “Everything is fragmented, it's on a bunch of different apps living, different websites and web apps and our goal is really to reduce the friction and just have this one portal where you can track all your assets and manage and swap and farm,” Audet said.      He compared the coming app store to Shopify’s lucrative e-commerce app platform and said Zapper is looking into potential revenue models but hasn’t committed to one yet.    Read more: DeFi Dashboard Zapper Snags New Funding From Delphi and Coinbase Ventures    Audet said Zapper’s team will continue building a product that makes it easy to plug into DeFi without burying the intricacies of crypto.      “A lot of products focused on abstracting crypto completely,” he said. “And we're totally on the opposite side, like we want to actually let Web 3, let crypto shine.”      Previous Zapper seed investors Libertus Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Michael Dunworth, The LAO, CoinFund and Kain Warwick joined newcomers Nascent, ParaFi Capital, Scalar Capital, Distributed Global, Maven 11, Spartan Group, DeFiance Capital, Long Hash, Sino Global, Cooley LLP and Stani Kulechov in the Series A.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/17/defi-dashboard-zapper-raises-15m-to-build-on-platform-app-store,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/499cb4c91d899629770ed4743f99ea149e114598-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuAsq,1621256085,"Bitcoin Suffers Biggest Pullback This Year, Drops to 3.5-Month Low Near $42K","Bitcoin fell to a three-month low on Monday, confirming the biggest price pullback of the current bull run.      The top cryptocurrency printed a low of $42,212 during the Asian hours, a level not seen since Feb. 8, marking a 35% drop from the record high of $64,880 reached on April 14, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The bitcoin (BTC) price has seen four corrections from new price highs so far this year, out of which the latest 35% retreat is the biggest.      Chart analysts had warned of a pullback to $42,000 before a resumption of the broader bull run.      ""When combining fundamentals such as positive net inflows of bitcoin to exchanges, mixed with the previously mentioned technicals of lower high and lower low, we can ignore what large egos and influencers say, and see that a pullback was bound to happen,"" Justin Chu, senior trader at the regulated digital asset investment manager Wave Financial, said in an email.      Centralized exchanges registered a net bitcoin inflow of over 35,000 BTC in the past five days, as noted by IntoTheBlock on Twitter. Investors typically move coins to exchanges when they intend to liquidate their holdings.      The first leg of the latest correction, represented by the drop from $64,000 to $47,000 in the second half of April, shook out excess bullish leverage from the derivatives market, opening the doors for a more sustained move higher.      While the price bounced early this month, the momentum stalled near $60,000, with investors turning their focus to ethereum and other alternative cryptocurrencies.      The second leg lower began on May 12, with prices falling by 12% to sub-$50,000 on the back of dour mood in traditional markets and electric auto company Tesla's decision to suspend payments in bitcoin.      The selling pressure strengthened over the weekend, with some investors speculating Tesla may be selling its bitcoin holdings. The company sold 10% of its stash in the first quarter, having purchased $1.5 billion worth of coins in February.      Tesla CEO Elon Musk attempted to calm market nerves early Monday with a Twitter announcement, saying the company hasn't sold its bitcoin holdings. The declaration appeared to put a floor under the sell-off, and prices briefly traded back up to around around $45,000.      But as of press time, the rebound had lost steam, with bitcoin falling back to $42,544, close to the day's lows.      In traditional markets, a drop of 20% or more from highs is said to confirm a bearish shift in the broader trend. However, the conventional bear market definition does not hold ground in cryptocurrencies, where pullbacks of 30% or more are pretty normal during a bull run.      Analysts remain confident the pullback would recharge engines for a more robust rally.      ""After the weekend FUD fest and s--t fighting, let's get back to the important stuff. BTFD,"" Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of Real Vision Group, tweeted. ""BTC is forming a wedge most likely ... perfectly normal correction and healthy."" A wedge, in this case, is a bullish pattern in price charts.      However, a V-shaped recovery may not happen due to renewed fears the U.S. Federal Reserve will unwind easy monetary policy sooner than expected to control high inflation.      ""On a more material note, we think last week's high inflation print might have seriously knocked the wind out of exuberant markets for a while,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel. “We are very cautious of a gap toward $35K level.

Firms that offer crypto services in the form of trading or custody “will face the prospect of potential third-party liabilities,” said Ed Williams, global head of financial lines at Allianz Global Corporate and Speciality (AGCS).      With the merging of digital currencies and traditional finance, institutions will be exposed to the uncertainties of the crypto sphere, “with questions around potential asset bubbles and regulation” and “concerns for potential money laundering and the risks of theft or loss of access,” according to Williams.      This forms part of the report’s wider conversation around the proliferation of new technologies and the impact they have on any company’s risk profile.      Allianz draws comparisons with artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and biometrics threatening risk to financial firms that harness them for the purpose of credit scoring, for example.

The cryptocurrency approached initial support around $42,000 which could stabilize the sell-off. Price recoveries remain limited, evidenced by several months of slowing momentum, suggesting that sellers remain in control.      Bitcoin is trading around $44,800 at the time of writing.    The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is now oversold similar to April 25, which preceded a near 20% price recovery.  Bitcoin is below the 100-day moving average, which is now resistance at $54,000. However, BTC will likely face immediate resistance at the $50,000 level as the uptrend weakens.  If initial support at $42,000 is broken, the next level of support is seen around $34,286, which is roughly a 50% retracement of the March 2020 low.

42406417,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuAj0,1621250973,No Reason to Fear Central Bank Digital Currencies,"No matter how much you know about central bank digital currencies (CBDC), chances are you’ve heard something about their most serious threats: disintermediating banks and facilitating monetary surveillance and censorship.      From papers to blog posts, a lot has been said on how a CBDC would deprive banks of deposits because funds could be easily moved to CBDC accounts or wallets, especially in times of crisis. Similarly, we’re frequently reminded that a CBDC could be used as an instrument of control because CBDC transactions would be traceable in real time. But will these risks emerge because of CBDCs, or can they materialize regardless of any CBDC ever being issued?    Disintermediation    Take bank disintermediation first. The main fear is that too many depositors will move to the safety of the digital currency provided by the central bank, reducing the amount of funding available to commercial banks. After all, CBDCs will be issued by an institution that cannot fail, and most people will be willing to accept them for their nominal value.    Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a central bank lawyer and researcher.    If central banks never issue CBDC, the risk of bank disintermediation disappears, right? Wrong. We already have alternatives to bank deposits that could greatly reduce banks’ funding if used extensively.      And I’m not thinking here about the risk of people converting deposits into cash, which, although possible, can never be simple or fast. Have you ever tried to withdraw $5,000 without giving advance notice to your bank? I’m talking about the possibility of converting money from your bank account to a safer option of digital money that is currently available: e-money or its unregulated twin, the stablecoin.    Read more: What Is a CBDC?    From the European Union or the United Kingdom to Brazil, e-money issuers, such as TransferWise UK or PayPal Brazil, work like narrow banks: They keep your deposit 100% backed by assets. These companies are legally required to keep the money they receive from their clients safeguarded or insured so that e-money balances are always redeemable at par, with no loss of value. As they are licensed and supervised entities, customers know that, aside from gross regulatory failure, their e-money is safe.      For the countries where e-money issuers can keep users’ funds safeguarded directly with the central bank, like Brazil and, more recently, the United Kingdom, the perception of safety is even stronger. So much so that researchers at the International Monetary Fund named this model “synthetic CBDCs.”      A similar idea is behind the stablecoin model, which promises the virtues of cryptocurrencies built on a blockchain without the price swings. Unlike bitcoin, traditional stablecoins are backed by assets that help maintain their parity to a sovereign currency, usually dollars. Something like money market mutual funds whose shares are easily transferable.    Read more: Dante Disparte - A Central Bank Digital Currency Would Be Bad for the US    The stablecoin model is more popular in the United States, perhaps because no federal statute has been enacted regulating e-money. Facing the lack of a national “fintech charter,” stablecoin issuers are subject to state money transmitter laws and end up regulated by 50 different state authorities.      The crucial question is whether state regulators are doing a good job in supervising stablecoin issuers-turned-money transmitters, especially regarding the segregation of clients’ funds and the integrity of the assets used for backing. In all U.S. states where regulators follow stablecoin issuers closely to ensure some degree of consumer protection, issuers can claim their stablecoin should be considered as safe as any e-money found in other countries.      Safer alternatives to bank deposits already exist in many jurisdictions. So why haven’t we seen a “digital run” from bank accounts to these options? First, most prepaid cards and accounts come with limits on maximum balances that can be held at any given time because of anti-money laundering rules.      Second, even in countries where fully identified prepaid accounts have no balance limits, like Brazil, people and businesses may still see bank accounts as a more convenient option. The combination of deposit insurance and easy access to other financial services incentivizes you to keep money with a bank rather than with a fintech providing payment services.    Read more: Tanvi Ratna: Visa and PayPal Can Be the Cosmos and Polkadot of CBDCs    Because central banks won’t create a CBDC that facilitates money laundering and criminal activity or offer accounts with credit and investment services, the risk of bank disintermediation because of CBDCs tends to be low – or at least not higher than the risk that exists today with e-money and stablecoins.    Surveillance    Let’s take a look now at the risks of surveillance and censorship created by CBDCs. Sure, abusive governments could use the unique features of a CBDC, notably traceability, to discriminate or censor certain activities or individuals. If, moreover, CBDCs were kept deposited directly at the central bank, governments could even threaten their citizens with balance freezing and confiscation.      These threats should never be taken lightly. But as many in Latin America know, government abuse in monetary matters existed well before any idea of CBDC was even possible. On March 16, 1990, the day after Fernando Collor was sworn in as the first democratically elected president following more than 20 years of military rule in Brazil, he announced the infamous plan to “kill inflation”: the Collor Plan.    Read more: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies    Among other measures, the Collor Plan determined that all bank balances above the equivalent of $1,500 would be frozen for 18 months and paid back in installments after that period. Despite the evident arbitrariness of the decision, banks complied with the order and neither the legislature nor the judiciary immediately rose against it.      It was a legal and institutional failure only partially redeemed two years later, with the impeachment of Fernando Collor and his subsequent resignation to avoid the Senate trial that could have led to his removal.      The unfortunate Brazilian tale illustrates that monetary abuse won’t result from the launch of a CBDC. This kind of abuse, like many others against individual rights, is typical of countries with a weak rule of law, incapable institutions and no political accountability.      It may be of little consolation to know that many challenges and risks posed by CBDCs are, in fact, old and can become real even in the absence of a CBDC. But it should be clear that CBDC, by itself, won’t be the root of all evil.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOT | FIAT | REGULATION,Marcelo M.

Furthermore, miners will have to pay for damages caused to the electricity network, a spokesman for the ministry said, as reported Sunday by English-language newspaper the Tehran Times.  The measure comes in response to concerns over the burden cryptocurrency mining is placing on the country’s electricity supply, which has been under strain this year thanks to reduced rainfall limiting the output of hydropower plants.  Iran has attempted to boost its sanction-hit economy with crypto mining. The country contributed some 4% of the total global bitcoin hash power in 2020 according to research by the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance.  However, the country’s government has attempted to keep miners on a short leash to manage the economic benefits within the scope of its electricity supply.

42421773,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpgrd,1621249726,A Central Bank Digital Currency Would Be Bad for the US,"There is a frenzied, if inaccessible, debate taking place among think tanks, policy experts and media outlets signaling that the U.S. Federal Reserve should launch a centrally issued digital twin of the U.S. dollar.      Among the many arguments for why this is necessary is that the U.S. is losing ground to China, whose government has a national blockchain strategy, including a real-world prototype central bank digital currency (CBDC). While these arguments are valid, they miss the larger point, which is that by today’s hyper-competitive digital currency and blockchain standards, the U.S. may not be a laggard at all, but rather is already winning the race for the future of money and payments.    Dante Alighieri Disparte is the Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy at Circle, a digital financial services firm and architect of USDC, a dollar-pegged digital currency. He is also a member of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Advisory Council, Founder and Chairman of Risk Cooperative and serves on the World Economic Forum’s Digital Currency Governance Consortium.    In trying to “out-China China” on these important issues, we miss that the future of money and payments should be about enhancing domestic financial optionality. Upgrading payment and banking systems,, enhancing interoperability and open banking standards, requires a major upgrade in the technology stack that supports value transfer and more open financial services innovation.      That was exemplified by the original version of the COVID-19 relief bill, the Cares Act, which called for the creation of a digital dollar to expedite domestic stimulus payments while trusted, privately-issued digital currencies were already in circulation along with a growing and interoperable blockchain-based payment system.    Read more: JP Koning: In the CBDC Race, It’s Better to Be Last    Legacy financial rails, such as ACH, EFT and other interbank transfer networks, have not had an update in 50 years. Blockchain-based payment systems represent the completion of a lot of unfinished work in the financial services value chain, which has left more than 1.7 billion people around the world as unbanked, rather than a source of disruption or circumvention. China’s fintech and mobile money titans collectively process over $67 trillion a year. That alone does not constitute a threat to the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency. The vibrant crypto asset industry that calls the U.S. home has been advocating for a more open global payment system for years.      A true internet of value would advance important first principles, such as privacy, trust, democratization of assets and prosperity, rather than clinging to dated and largely ineffective financial rules, such as the Bank Secrecy Act.      The bottom rung of economic mobility is access to low-cost payments. In a world where individuals rely on nationally issued identity, billions of people are on the financial sidelines – a source of global risk and destabilization. We need new forms of digital financial services plus internet-native digital identification and authentication, which preserve privacy, but provide assurances that financial crime compliance standards are being adhered to and modernized.    A $2 trillion industry was born largely on public digital commons, rather than on risk-prone and costly technology implied by a government administered CBDC.    The U.S. should lead the way on both charges, promoting open internet-based financial services while enabling new forms of inclusivity. We should aim to be a pioneer in building the internet of value for digital assets, identity and other breakthrough innovations.      The investors, entrepreneurs and diverse teams building this new wave of platforms are increasingly calling the U.S. home, powering U.S. economic competitiveness and the post-COVID-19 recovery. COVID-19 revealed areas of pre-pandemic vulnerability, including our inability to execute financial transactions at population-scale domestically and through poverty-fighting remittance corridors. We should be able to exchange value, monetize and own digital assets, as well as build internet-native financial services firms, with regulatory clarity.      In the maiden decade of blockchain, digital currencies and crypto assets, a $2 trillion industry was born largely on public digital commons, rather than on risk-prone and costly technology implied by a government-administered CBDC, which would shift technology risk to the public sector and, thereby, to taxpayers.    Read more: Opinionated: Do We Really Need CBDCs? Feat. Chris Giancarlo and David Treat (Podcast)    The more the U.S. embraces these financial innovations and industries of the future, the more the prospects of scaling internet-level prosperity and access becomes possible. The meteoric rise of the nine-year-old Coinbase, a crypto-native financial exchange, which is now the United States’ most valuable exchange bar none, is emblematic of the opportunity. Proving regulatory clarity and a national industrial policy that embraces exponential technologies such as blockchain can make all facets of our economy more resilient, future-proof and competitive.      Protecting vulnerable critical infrastructure, which is imperiled by the twin threats of climate change and single point of failure designs, such as the Colonial Gas Pipeline, which was hobbled by a ransomware attack, is a reason for blockchain-based thinking. The same holds true for the void of open banking and financial access across the country. And providing safe e-voting or authentication options that can enhance trust on the internet without divulging personal information can at once improve national competitiveness and international standing for the U.S.      The fastest way to disrupt the very financial system that has made the U.S. the economic and political envy of the world would be to succumb to the pressures of launching a centralized digital currency. While the U.S. banking and financial system can improve how it deals with rampant cyberthreats and an impossible digital transformation agenda that favors the largest banks in the country, CBDCs would disrupt the two-tiered banking system, while providing uncertain outcomes for consumers and markets.      The two-tiered banking system is the structure that enables household-name banks to interface directly with a country’s central bank, enhancing consumer protection and regulations, while at the same time enabling central banks to convey monetary policy. The democratic promise of cryptocurrencies and digital currencies is the ability of powering internet-level prosperity and merchant acceptance – the technological equivalent of digital legal tender, while importing sound monetary policy.    Read more: Gorduladze - CBDCs and Stablecoins: The Regulatory Battle to Come    A free market-based movement is afoot driving fundamental, open and compliant innovations in the movement of money and value on the internet. This digital currency and blockchain economy is building the next generation of digital financial services firms in the U.S. and around the world, creating thousands of jobs and an outsized share of market value. That the majority of asset-referenced stablecoins in circulation today are pegged to the U.S. dollar speaks to how the fundamental trust in the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency of choice is being preserved by digital currencies, not circumvented by them.      There are material risks in the issuance of a digital U.S. Federal Reserve dollar. Most value-added money in circulation today rides on private or consortium-backed rails, a U.S. CBDC would transition substantial technological and operational risk from the private sector, which is powering safe and well-regulated digital currencies and assets on public blockchains, to the public balance sheet – and therefore shouldered by taxpayers. Also privacy and censorship resistance is more likely to be protected by a vigorously competitive rules-based market than with general purpose, government-issued digital currencies.      We need a public-private balance that makes the U.S. dollar the reference asset for all manner of value-added activity. Whether enshrined on paper bills or emblazoned on coins, plastic cards or, in the case of dollar-digital currencies, in code, the key is to offer the full faith and credit of the U.S economy across a range of payment instruments and rails. Ultimately, that will be good for consumers, the economy and global security.      Dollar digital currencies that are backed 1:1 with assets preserved in the two-tier U.S. banking system (like USDC), import all the safety, soundness and values of the U.S. dollar, turbocharging it with the power of the internet.

The trove of more than 410 trillion tokens was sent to a dead blockchain address late on Sunday, taking them out of circulation.      Buterin had been given half of SHIB’s total supply in recent weeks in what appeared to be a marketing stunt.      “I've decided to burn 90% of the remaining shiba tokens in my wallet. The remaining 10% will be sent to a (not yet decided) charity with similar values to cryptorelief (preventing large-scale loss of life) but with a more long-term orientation,” he said in a note attached to another transaction at the same time.      Last week, Buterin gave 50 trillion SHIB tokens (worth around $1.2 billion at the time) to an India COVID-19 relief fund set up by Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal.      Labelling itself a “DOGE killer,” SHIB has seen a price increase of nearly 900% in the last two weeks, culminating in an all-time high of $0.00003791 May 10 and listings on major exchanges such as Binance and Huobi.      The remaining half of SHIB’s supply is locked for liquidity on decentralized finance platform Uniswap.      Buterin also said in his note that he would prefer makers of cryptocurrencies give them to charities and not to him. “I don't *want* to be a locus of power of that kind,” he said.      The news of Buterin’s actions has not had any significant effect on SHIB’s price, despite a small bump to $0.00001880 immediately after, according to CoinGecko. Since then, it has pulled back and is hovering at around $0.000016 at press time.
