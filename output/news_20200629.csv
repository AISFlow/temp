Medvedev, 33, admitted in his June 26 plea before the U.S. District Court for Nevada that he founded and ran the Infraud Organization, an international cybercrime enterprise that facilitated the sale of credit card and equipment theft, malware and stolen account information during its eight-year reign.      He also acknowledged running a ""digital currency"" exchange and escrow service for Infraud’s 10,901 members. A 2018 indictment stated Infraud members used the now-defunct Liberty Reserve and bitcoin, among other “digital currencies,” to launder their funds.      The June plea does not mention the extent to which Medvedev’s exchange service transacted in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It states that Medvedev accrued $1.04 million in Liberty Reserve digital currency through May 2013.      In total, Infraud facilitated the sale of 4 million compromised payment card numbers and caused an actual loss of $568 million dollars to its victims, American Express, Visa, MasterCard and others, Medvedev admitted.      The Department of Justice shut down Infraud in February 2018 and subsequently indicted 36 members of the organization as part of Operation Shadow Web.      At the time of his arrest in Thailand in 2018, Medvedev was estimated to be in possession of more than 100,000 bitcoin, according to the Bangkok Post.

42432178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAb9h,1593465624,Humility Before a Fall: Your Crypto Startup Hasn't Done Anything Yet,"Dave Balter is the CEO of Flipside Crypto. His book, ""The Humility Imperative,"" will be released on June 30.      This is a message to every cryptocurrency entrepreneur, employee, executive or leader: Dig a hole, throw your ego into it and pour concrete on top. Find humility instead.      Hello, my name is Dave Balter, and I'm a CEO who used to be totally ego-driven. (There. I said it.) This ego gave me the confidence to be a great leader, but also nearly destroyed BzzAgent, the word-of-mouth pioneer I created in 2001. Had I not dramatically adjusted my leadership style, in all likelihood my partners and I wouldn't have found our way to a successful exit to Tesco in 2011.      In the decade since I’ve built and exited a number of businesses. My most recent one, Flipside Crypto, delivers insights and analytics to blockchain organizations. This provides us a front row seat to the behaviors and attitudes of leaders and employees across hundreds of blockchain platforms, dapps, exchanges and other ecosystem participants.      See also: Taylor Monahan - As We Hunger for Viability, Let's Stay True to Our Values      Here is something I’ve learned: Many leaders think just being in the blockchain space makes them untouchable. They count an easy ICO raise as validation of success. They’re proud of developing something so technically complex their team barely understands it.      In one meeting a senior executive admonished a teammate in front of us, exclaiming her work as, “useless, irrelevant and without impact.” In another, the leadership of an Asian exchange asked us to distribute a series of splashy press releases, even though we were still working out our working relationship. One crypto executive had the nerve to gloat in front of us, “We literally just print money.”      Last autumn I was in a restaurant (remember those?) in Boston and found myself seated near a group of employees from a crypto organization recently fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its illegal ICO offering. They were celebrating. Waiters were bringing them chop after chop of cut meat. Many drinks were drunk. They cheered and toasted each other in hoodies emblazoned with their company’s logo.    What’s the one simple thing that will bring this industry down? It won’t be scams and frauds, it will be something much more damaging: hubris.    I was outraged. Their CEO deceived investors and broke the law. Should the team rebrand? Nope. Should they quietly melt into the woodwork? Nope. Instead, they should party. They should let everyone know where they work. That they won. They considered it a victory.      These are all danger signs. Indications that leadership is acting with unchecked confidence. With attitudes of self-worth, grandiose thinking and a terrible case of ""we-have-it-all-figured-out.""      What’s the one simple thing that will bring this industry down? It won’t be scams and frauds, it will be something much more damaging: hubris.      See also: Michael Casey - Money Reimagined: Crypto's Diversity Problem      Don’t get me wrong. There are some terrific leaders in the crypto industry. Brian Armstrong of Coinbase is one. So is Jeremy Allaire of Circle.      Two very different leadership styles. Brian began as an engineer. Jeremy is a longtime entrepreneur and a seasoned executive. Their similarity lies in a distinct truth: Each approaches his businesses with maturity, clarity and delivery, all traits of leaders with the humility to build strong organizations.      Case in point: With the onset of COVID-19, Armstrong immediately takes action. He listens to his employees, to his customers, to the market. He makes adept shifts to the organizational infrastructure and institutes a remote first policy , and on May 20 published it publicly so it could serve as a roadmap for others.      Case in point: Allaire’s Circle has gone through a series of dramatic evolutions. Early Bitcoin ATMs made way for a truly massive over-the-counter trading group – and as the market evolved again, he executed a nimble pirouette and developed USDC, a stablecoin business.      Strong leaders recognize the art of humility. Neither Armstrong nor Allaire lack confidence. They have it in spades. But that confidence doesn’t root them so deeply in place that they can’t adapt. They listen to their teams and focus on execution vs. promotion. That’s humility at work.      The humility imperative is simple: If you’re an ego-fueled leader, find humility today before it’s too late. Disregard the fawning fanboys and king-like power you feel right now. Recognize your place in the universe is no more important than anyone else’s. Know you can learn from every single interaction, no matter the person’s credentials. Understand that your competitors are smart , perhaps (gasp!) even smarter than you. Believe that media glory is fleeting. Remember that fundraising is a tactic, not a strategy; your reputation isn’t forever golden because a high profile VC firm backed you.      Here’s what matters more: You treat your employees with kindness. You are willing to be wrong; and – yes, this is hard – you share the spotlight.      Having trouble admitting your ego is out of control? Ask your family, friends or most trusted adviser what they think. Find someone willing to tell you straight. Your cryptocurrency will be much better for it and you’ll truly have the opportunity to create something sustainable. Humility will prepare you for the endurance test to come. It will give you the flexibility to create an organization that can thrive in good times and survive the bad.      Unless it addresses this, the crypto industry will become ""what might have been."" It will become a case study in what not to do. It will end not with a flourish or a bang, but with a whimper.      Have humility, or your hubris will have all of us.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Dave Balter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/29/humility-before-a-fall-your-crypto-startup-hasnt-done-anything-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6b27f3dea26ba920bf51e9af5dfe28a3a21bb94-1300x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432180,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAbHh,1593463493,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Traders Expect Big Move as Volatility Plummets,"Bitcoin opened the week still stuck in a price range just above $9,000 Monday, moving less than 0.2% from Friday’s close as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), according to Bitstamp.      At 00:00 UTC on Monday (8:00 p.m. Sunday ET), bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $9,115 on spot exchanges such as Bitstamp. Despite a brief dip below $9,800 on Saturday afternoon, bitcoin did not trade above $9,200 or below $9,000 on Monday.      Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, climbed less than 1% from its daily open Monday and traded around $226 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).      Exchange inflows from bitcoin miners are pouring in as bitcoin continues to trade in the low $9,000s. A seven-day moving average shows inflows from miners to exchanges have reached their highest levels all year. This might be a bearish signal, according to some analysts.      Miners aren’t really speculators with the bitcoins held on their balance as inventory,” said Austin Storms, founder of mining mobile infrastructure company BearBox They’ll readily sell it for cash to reduce risk or expand operations, he added. But to infer that miners sending coins to exchanges is a bearish market signal, according to Storms, is a “big reach.”      See also: Why Bitcoin Will Take a Long Time to Dethrone the Dollar      Miners make up a small percentage of daily sell pressure, he explained. Using this data to justify a bearish market thesis is “exploratory analysis that wants to be confirmatory,” said Storms. “People are bored with the $9,100-$9,400 range and are looking for any reason we might depart from it soon.”      Bitcoin’s volatility is plummeting as it continues to trade in a tight price range. According to data from Skew, the ether-bitcoin implied volatility dropped to an all-time low over the weekend, and the Bitcoin Volatility Token (BVOL) launched by FTX earlier this year, which tracks market volatility, has fallen for nearly 20 consecutive days.      With volatility at historic lows, CoinGecko research analyst Daryl Lau told CoinDesk he would “definitely not be surprised to see a big move.” Sunday’s brief drop below $9,000 was “bought up on low volumes,” he noted. Cryptocurrency exchange volumes and the continued correlation to the S&P 500, which briefly broke below 3,000 Monday morning, seem to be signalling a “downward move” for bitcoin, Lau said.      As the market tries to decide which way to exit its current price range, some traders are increasingly frustrated. “Consolidations can be frustrating for short-term traders, particularly those who trade on leverage and attempt to catch breaks,” said Matt Ficke, head of Capital Markets at OKCoin. Bitcoin has closed between $9,050-$9,820 price points for the past seven weeks, according to OKCoin weekly charts.      See also: Bitcoin Facing Greater Price Volatility Than Ether in Q3, Options Market Data Suggests      To Ficke, the market is “testing or debating whether or not bitcoin can decouple from equity performance in this macro environment.""    Other markets    Decentralized finance assets were some of the biggest losers on Monday, according to 24-hour price change data from Messari. Compound (COMP), which was “soaring” several days ago, is down 9.5%. Also down are nexo (NEXO) by 3.7%, basic attention token (BAT) 3.26%, and matic network (MATIC) by 2.6 percent. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).      In commodities, gold stayed mostly flat on Monday down less than 0.05% as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). The yellow metal traded around $1,771.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: What Trends in Volatility Could Mean for Bitcoin      Meanwhile, major stock indices are mostly green on Monday.      The FTSE 100 index in Europe gained roughly 1.5% from its daily open at the time of publishing.

42432181,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAbFh,1593456274,"Bitcoin Facing Greater Price Volatility Than Ether in Q3, Options Market Data Suggests","Bitcoin may seem to be more volatile than traditional assets but in crypto markets it is considered relatively stable compared to alternative cryptocurrencies.      Bitcoin (BTC) is the biggest cryptocurrency by market value. Not only is it used as the base currency of choice for trading smaller digital assets, it is also less vulnerable to manipulation or sudden price swings compared to altcoins, most of which are based on Ethereum’s blockchain.      However, that pricing situation may change during the third quarter, according to options market data.      The spread between the three-month at-the-money implied volatility for Ethereum’s ether (ETH) token and bitcoin pair, a measure of expected volatility between the two, fell to a record low of -2.4% on Sunday, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      “The negative spread shows the options market expects bitcoin to be more volatile than ether over the next three months,” said Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh.      The spread clocked a record high of 33% in February and has been on a declining trend ever since.      See also: Bitcoin Closes in the Green Sunday to End Longest Daily Losing Run in 6 Months      Implied volatility, which is computed using the prices of options and underlying assets and other key metrics, represents investors’ expectations of how volatile or risky an asset would be over a specific period. Implied volatility is a way to quantify uncertainty      “The fact that markets are now factoring in higher bitcoin price volatility compared to ether is surprising given the focus on the Ethereum-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector over the past one month,” said Goh.      According to data provider DeFiPulse, the number of ether locked into DeFi applications has increased from 2.539 million on June 16 to 3.087 million on June 29. That's a growth of more than 20% in 13 days. During the same period, the dollar value of various tokens locked has surged from $1 billion to $1.62 billion. Note that out of the 205 DeFi projects listed on DeFiPulse, 192 are built on Ethereum.      The activity picked up the pace after lending protocol Compound’s COMP token went live for trading on June 18. The governance token rose by 500% in the following three days, triggering a frenzy in the DeFi space.      The market is divided on whether the DeFi explosion will lead to a sustained rally in ether or lead to a boom-bust cycle. “DeFi will likely help push ETH to $1 trillion market cap,” Joseph Todaro, managing partner at Blocktown Capital, tweeted on June 16.      Meanwhile, BlockTower’s CIO Ari Paul put out a tweet thread on June 21 explaining the possibility of liquidity mining fueling a bubble in the DeFi space. Liquidity mining refers to giving out governance tokens to put assets into a lending/borrowing protocol.      See also: Ethereum Developers Consider New Fee Model as Gas Costs Climb      As such, one may expect ether to be more volatile than bitcoin, especially with bitcoin-related news having dried up following the cryptocurrency’s third mining reward halving, which took place on May 12.      While the options market suggests otherwise, the possibility of bitcoin witnessing greater volatility cannot be ruled out. The top cryptocurrency has spent nearly two months trading in the narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000. A prolonged period of low-volatility consolidation often ends with a big spike in volatility.      That said, ether and other altcoins are seldom insulated from the pickup in bitcoin market volatility. If bitcoin sees big moves, ether will also likely face heightened volatility, which could shake up things in the DeFi space. That in turn could cause more panic and uncertainty in the ether market. So, while bitcoin could initially see greater volatility, eventually ether’s volatility may catch up and surpass bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/29/bitcoin-facing-greater-price-volatility-than-ether-in-q3-options-market-data-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4983862dd481377482a0c6de909e05d48ef86a01-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAb5h,1593450610,Ethereum Developers Consider New Fee Model as Gas Costs Climb,"The Takeaway:    Demand to transact on the Ethereum blockchain has pushed fees to uncomfortable levels.  A new technical proposal helps address high fees by implementing a dynamic pricing system.  Called EIP 1559, Ethereum users would now pay a set “base fee” to the network plus a tip to miners.  One technical observer calls it “the biggest change to any blockchain post-release.”    The cost to use Ethereum has increased some 500% since April. That’s not very helpful for people running programs on it.      And while average gas fees are not at the all-time highs seen in July 2018, the problem will need fixing if decentralized applications (dapps) can be run reliably on the world’s leading smart-contract blockchain.      A potential technical savior is on the horizon, however – and it’s not the Eth 2.0 overhaul or Rollups, the latest en vogue scaling solution.      Read more: Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0      Called Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, this proposed update aims to reduce transaction costs by overhauling the network’s fee market in what independent analyst Hasu describes as “the biggest change to any blockchain post-release.”      Some Ethereum clients, the teams that maintain the blockchain’s software in various programming languages, are already working on implementations.    EIP 1559    Introduced in April 2019, EIP 1559 has roots going back to an August 2018 paper on Ethereum’s price-auction model penned by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The EIP itself was co-authored by Buterin, in addition to Ethereum developers Eric Conner, Rick Dudley, Matthew Slipper and Ian Norden.      EIP 1559 tries to solve fee pressure by implementing “algorithmic price discovery,” according to Ethereum Foundation researcher Barnabé Monnot in a technical deep dive.      The EIP solves two problems at once by dynamically changing the size of blocks depending on the number of transactions in the queue between certain thresholds and by pricing out certain users when demand gets too high.      This is accomplished in two parts: a burnt base fee (BASEFEE) for transacting and a tip to miners.      The base fee will reside at a set level, depending on network conditions, while the tip compensates miners for their work and can be increased to “skip” the transaction line – a nice feature of current blockchain networks that helps alleviate congestion.      Think of it like a regulated highway that can open and close lanes as needed. Plus, there’s a fast-pass lane someone can pay for if they need to scoot in an emergency.      Read more: Plasma Became Optimism and It Might Just Save Ethereum      The configuration also helps during moments of bottleneck where it’s near impossible to settle a transaction. To date, this has happened twice: once with the rise of CryptoKitties in 2017 and more recently, on March 12 (or “Black Thursday”) when the price of ether (ETH) dropped by more than 30% in 24 hours, creating a mad dash to exit various Ethereum-based applications.    A counter-proposal    Not everyone wants to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Etheruem has a fee problem, but that doesn't mean you have to dump the current model entirely.      EIP 2593, written by MetaMask developer Dan Finlay, proposes an “escalator algorithm” that allows users to change their fee structure based on their relative needs. In short, the EIP lets a user fine-tune a transaction fee to the lowest amount possible by slowly escalating the transaction fee until a miner decides to incorporate it into the next block. (A more thorough breakdown of EIP 2593’s pros and cons can be found here.)      Ethereum developers liked the idea – so much so, in fact, that the EIP is likely to be used in addition to EIP 1559 as a tweak to the latter’s “tipping” feature. As of June 24, developers have decided to launch a testnet to help model the effects of EIP 1559 and any other tangential work on the network.    Ethernomics    As Hasu, the pseudonymous blockchain researcher, states, those effects could be far-reaching.      While miners are currently rewarded in ETH for processing transactions via a block reward and transaction fee, nothing makes the denomination of that fee specific to ETH. For instance, a team could reach out to a mining pool and pay them in fiat to route their orders first.      Notably, EIP 1559 forces Ethereum transactions to be paid in the blockchain’s native token. The base fee is denominated in ETH, paid to the network and then burnt every time a transaction occurs, which also decreases the outstanding supply of ether over the long run.      (At some point, Ethereum will not pay mining rewards at all, once the network switches to the Proof-of-Stake [PoS] consensus algorithm in the mother-of-all network updates known as Eth 2.0. The current network, Eth 1.x, will run adjacent to Eth 2.0 for a number of years until the PoS chain is fully functional.)      Read more: The Zcash Privacy Tech Underlying Ethereum’s Transition to Eth 2.0      Consequently, the burning also provides a new deflationary pressure into Etheruem’s economic model, a pressure some argue would give the network a higher value proposition in the long term.      “The burning of BASEFEE, which is the bulk of transaction fee, is a deflationary force of ETH. It promotes its scarcity, and links its scarcity to the growth of the Ethereum economy,” David Hoffman, COO of Ethereum investment firm RealT, told CoinDesk. “The issuance of ETH that pays for security initially leverages the value of ETH. If BASEFEE is burning lots of ETH, the value of ETH should be higher, as it is more scarce.”    Mining incentives    Practically speaking, miners may have the most to lose from the proposal. Hefty transaction fees – such as one alleged Ponzi scheme that sent a few multimillion-dollar fees by “accident” – are unlikely to occur under the new system, which prioritizes user experience over miner pocketbooks.      “It is better for users since the base fee will become a constant, and that’s something users will no longer have to worry about when sending a TX [transaction],” MyEtherWallet CEO and founder Kosala Hemachandra said in an email. “They don't have to know how congested the network is, or when their TX will be mined.""      Read more: Ethereum’s ProgPoW Debate Is About Much More Than Mining      Yet, intuition may not be a valuable guide. Mining pools operate under the assumption of long-term block rewards, making them less worried about any programmatic changes than initial thought would suppose.      SparkPool CEO Xin Xu told CoinDesk in an email that both he and the pool believe a “better fee model design is needed” and that the group has been “supportive of EIP 1559 for a long time.” (For reference, SparkPool once operated under the name EthFans.)      “Maximizing every block reward is important to mining pools, including SparkPool.

According to Russian news agency TASS, head of the Moscow government’s IT technologies department Artem Kostyrko said an observation node on the blockchain had been targeted, but the system was still functioning correctly.

42422903,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qodh,1593448425,Blockchain Bites: EY's Auditing Slip and Bitcoin's Long Line of Pseudonymous Developers,"Balancer fell victim to a ""flash loan"" exploit, a mining conglomerate sees potential in blockchain and a shareholders association said EY should have caught Wirecard's multi-billion-dollar blackhole earlier.  Flash loans are one of many novel financial products made possible through decentralized technologies. But with innovation comes risk. Here's the story:  You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.  Flash loans & hacks A hacker exploited a smart contract loophole early Monday to drain $500,000-worth of tokens from DeFi liquidity provider Balancer Pool. CTO Mike McDonald said in a blog the attacker had borrowed $23 million-worth of WETH tokens in a flash loan from dYdX, and used those token to trade against themselves with a variety of investment-grade Stratera tokens. A flash loan was used in February to cripple the bZx exchange. These types of attacks leverage a protocol’s built in capabilities and novel financial instruments, rather than hacking the code base. This hack follows news of 870 bitcoins stored on Blockstream’s Liquid Network being made vulnerable to network moderators’ seizure last week, said Summa founder James Prestwich.  Blockchain deals Mining conglomerate BHP completed a $14 million deal with a Chinese metals giant using the blockchain-based MineHub platform to process contract terms, exchange documents online and provide visibility and accountability along the supply chain. Elsewhere, the South Korean government chose blockchain startup Sendsquare to develop a proof-of-concept blockchain registry to help analyze, anonymize and store clinical data for diabetes.  Privacy and pseudo-anonymity Bitcoin’s culture is heavily influenced by the rights to pseudonymity and privacy online. Beginning with Satoshi Nakamoto, a long line of crypto developers have taken the route of remaining pseudo-anonymous for personal safety as well as to maintain consistent worldviews. Sometimes seen as needless obfuscation, masked identities allow people to “be who you are,” Engineer Kee Hinckley said. It also informs the projects being built, such as the many privacy-forward experiments on Bitcoin.  Auditing slip A German shareholder body has accused “Big Four” auditor Ernst & Young of failing to spot a $2.1 billion black hole in Wirecard’s books soon enough. Shareholders’ association SdK filed criminal damages against EY Friday for not flagging Wirecard’s accounting practices earlier, reports CNBC. The group holds EY, and two current and one former employee in particular, responsible for not alerting the authorities and investors sooner, which ultimately culminated in the precipitous drop in the Wirecard share price.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped 1.2%, having suffered losses in each of the preceding five days, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Prices last took a beating for five consecutive days in early December 2019. Both five-day drops saw prices decline by around $900 over the 5-day periods. Sunday’s rise has kept the multi-week long trading range of $9,000 to $10,000 intact.  Volatility trends Recent market data suggests that bitcoin is becoming less volatile, while stocks are increasingly volatile, CoinDesk Head of Research Noelle Acheson said, in the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter. If the trend continues, it could have profound effects on bitcoin’s adoption, as Fidelity found the biggest barrier to entry is crypto’s market turbulence. “With the narrowing of the differential, that barrier could disappear, or at least significantly diminish. It’s not just that bitcoin’s volatility seems to be trending down – if volatility overall is more acceptable, bitcoin’s swings could be seen as less of a negative,” Acheson said. Though for some, she remembers, volatility is the whole point. “Where else are you going to get high potential returns?” Subscribe here to get Crypto Long & Short in your inbox.

42432179,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAbBh,1593446925,Why Bitcoin Will Take a Long Time to Dethrone the Dollar,"Byrne Hobart, a CoinDesk columnist, is an investor, consultant and writer in New York. His newsletter, The Diff (diff.substack.com), covers inflection points in finance and technology.      The most optimistic bitcoin investors are hodling out for one thing: the rapturous bitcoin rally known as “hyperbitcoinization.” The hyperbitcoinization thesis goes like this: Every saver in the world – individuals, companies, financial institutions, central banks – needs to own assets that maintain their purchasing power. If an asset, or the currency it’s denominated in, starts to lose purchasing power, this can set off a cascade of selling. And selling one currency means buying another. If the specific concern sellers have is that the supply of fiat money is unbounded, they’ll look at currency-like assets with a relatively fixed supply: gold, perhaps fine art, or bitcoin.      It’s a powerful narrative, and there’s plenty of historical evidence. The list of currencies that have lost most or all of their value in a short time is lengthy. Today, Venezuela and Zimbabwe are experiencing hyperinflation; the Turkish lira has lost 60% of its value relative to the dollar in the last five years, while the Russian ruble has experienced several inflationary bouts since the fall of the USSR.      See also: Byrne Hobart - PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet      In the 1990s, the Asian Tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia) saw their currency values collapse as financial bubbles in their markets unwound. Earlier, the Italian lira had high inflation before the euro (what is it about currencies called the “lira”?), while even the mighty dollar saw its value deteriorate rapidly after the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreements.      There’s a problem with this argument, though. It’s true that fiat currencies have a disappointing tendency to eventually lose most or all of their value. But not all fiat currencies are created equal, and even the strenuous efforts of irresponsible spending and high-speed printing presses can’t offset other forces.      Take the British pound, for example. It was the world’s preeminent reserve currency by the late-19th century. Central banks hoarded pounds and investors around the world bought pound-denominated assets to keep their money safe. The British government was able to issue perpetual securities, called consols, paying just 2.5% interest. By the 1920s, the U.S. was a larger economy, with a more developed banking system, and many investors had switched from pounds to dollars.    Ironically, the same factors Bitcoin advocates point to as evidence that the fiat system is broken – high leverage and a financialized economy – make it durable, too.    This caused the fall of the pound as a reserve currency – but it took almost a generation.      The trouble with destabilizing reserve currencies is that demand for them is sticky because it’s partially a function of the amount of debt issued in the currency. A borrower who owes pounds (or dollars, yen or euros) is a future buyer of that currency. And currency owners today can bank on the demand to buy them in the future.      There were other factors in the pound’s tenacious grip on the world financial system, which apply in interesting ways to the U.S. dollar. While Britain lost share of global manufacturing to the U.S. during the 19th century, and especially so in the early 20th, Britain still had a well-developed financial system. An over-financialized economy is not a good thing for most purposes, but one thing it’s great at is keeping demand for currency elevated. If you wanted to borrow large sums of money or engage in a complicated financial transaction, London banks were often the place where you’d start.      The pound had another advantage: a captive set of buyers. Britain’s colonies kept their reserves in pounds, borrowed in pounds and, because they had close trade relationships with Britain, they priced most of their trade in pounds, too. Even after their colonies achieved formal independence, the close relationship – and the monetary norms that went with it – persisted. Even though the U.S. economy topped Britain’s in the late 19th century, the pound still constituted over half of global currency reserves until the 1950s.      See also: Byrne Hobart - Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than This      Today, the U.S. is in a similar position. Our financial services sector is well-developed to the point of excess, but this means novel financial products are disproportionately likely to be priced in dollars. Large funding rounds, IPOs, buyouts and bond issues are in dollars by default. And the dollar is dominant in global trade – not just between the U.S. and other countries, but between pairs of countries that don’t have one of the top few currencies in the world. Commodity prices tend to be quoted in dollars, which encourages commodity producers to borrow in dollars and price their outsourced services in dollars, too.      The U.S. doesn’t have something exactly like the British Empire in form, but the substance is pretty close. From 1945 onward, the U.S. was the de facto guarantor of open trade for Europe, the Middle East and East Asia. These countries couldn’t necessarily defend themselves militarily and couldn’t ensure free shipment of goods, but the U.S. could. This relationship was reflected in close economic ties, and sometimes monetary ones: Many Middle Eastern countries, most notably Saudi Arabia, peg their currency to the dollar. East Asian exporters accumulate dollar-denominated assets to keep their currencies cheap. Japan, for example, owns $1.26 trillion of U.S. Treasurys and China is not far behind with $1.07 trillion. Meanwhile, Taiwanese life insurers alone own 14% of long-term U.S. corporate bonds.      All this doesn’t make it impossible for bitcoin to appreciate over the long term, but it makes hyperbitcoinization much less hyper than one might expect. Hyperinflationary episodes happen, and they tend to feed on themselves, but they don’t happen with reserve currencies. Borrowers act as a brake on high inflation. Inflation represents a general preference for goods, services and hard assets over cash, but anyone who has borrowed money has a legal obligation to get cash, often in exchange for the same sorts of goods, services and assets. As the pound example shows, it can take a very long time for that momentum to unwind. A reserve currency is a No True Scotsman argument run in reverse: Once a currency qualifies as a reserve asset, it can withstand a lot of bad policy before that status flips.      Ironically, the same factors bitcoin advocates point to as evidence the fiat system is broken – high leverage and a financialized economy – make it durable, too. With so many forces arrayed in favor of the status quo, even the inevitable can take a long time.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Byrne Hobart,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/29/why-bitcoin-will-take-a-long-time-to-dethrone-the-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a56509be1ae088dbce8b0c45a3ebb75e1da943b9-1300x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview with Bloomberg BNN, CFO Chen Lei confirmed the Hangzhou-based Ebang was planning to launch a regulatory-compliant crypto exchange that would strictly operate outside of China, where the government has cracked down hard on trading platforms.      Little else is known about the proposed exchange other than Ebang hopes to turn its fortunes around by tapping transaction fees as a consistent source of income.      Ebang's revenue stood at $109 million in 2019, which was roughly a third of what it made in 2018 – the tail end of the initial coin offering boom. Overall, the company has reported net losses in both 2018 and 2019.      The exchange will help diversify revenue so the company isn't as beholden to bitcoin's wild volatility, Lei said.      See also: Bitcoin Miner Maker Ebang Estimates $2.5M Loss for Q1 in IPO Prospectus Update      This is the next in a series of branch-outs for Ebang, which has already set up an advisory service for clients, which Lei predicted could see the company's revenue grow 40% this year.      Ebang's share price had slid 4% to under $4 after its $100 million public offering on Nasdaq on June 26. The funding would go toward developing new mining equipment as well as help fund expansions overseas.      At press time, Ebang was trading at $4.28.

42432169,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAavh,1593437225,"Facebook, IoTeX, R3 Among New Members of Confidential Computing Consortium","Facebook, Accenture, IoTeX, Nvidia and six other companies are joining the Linux Foundation’s Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC), increasing the size of the privacy-focused group by 60 percent.      The addition of members IoTeX, which leverages blockchain to secure the internet of things, and R3, an enterprise blockchain company, nearly doubles the number of blockchain companies involved.      Created in late October 2019, the CCC aims to bring developers together to accelerate the use of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies and standards. A TEE sequesters code and data away from applications on the main operating system, so they’re protected from adversaries who may gain access to the main operating system. If the main system is in the White House, for instance, with a variety of protections, a TEE is the bunker underneath it.      Within a TEE, unauthorized actors cannot view the data that is being used within the TEE and cannot alter the data. This enables applications and other systems to run without having direct access to extensive amounts of vulnerable data such as financial or personally identifiable information.      “Securing data-in-use in hardware-based TEEs, can ... strengthen other security- and integrity-related technologies,” like running a blockchain ledger, said Stephen Walli, the chairperson of the CCC’s governing board, in a statement.      “Confidential computing brings privacy-preserving smart devices to the next level by not only allowing users to own their private data, but also to use it in a privacy-preserving way,” Raullen Chai, CEO of IoTex, told CoinDesk in an email. “This has major implications for consumer-facing industries such as health care and smart homes, as well as enterprise for private multi-party data sharing and interactions.”      See also: Jalak Jobanputra -How Edge Computing Can Make Us More Resilient in a Crisis      Chai, based in San Francisco, said there are two immediate use cases where confidential computing could make an impact on everyday people’s privacy.      One is facial recognition in public spaces, an area that is under intense debate and scrutiny, particularly as protests against police brutality continue in the U.S.      There are traditionally two sides to this debate, said Chai. On one side are privacy-conscious people who don’t want images of their faces scanned and analyzed by governments and other actors. On the other are governments (their supporters) who, broadly, are prepared to sacrifice people’s privacy in the name of public good. Confidential computing has something for each hand.      “Reactive regulations will never achieve the goal of satisfying both sides, but confidential computing orchestrated by blockchain can,” said Chai. “With confidential computing, facial recognition processes can be executed within a secure TEE-based confidential computing environment, where the raw data (people’s faces) and a cross-referencing database of faces can be analyzed and subsequently forgotten after the desired results are obtained by governments.”      See also: Human Rights Foundation Funds Bitcoin Privacy Tools Despite 'Coin Mixing' Legal Stigma      Another area of interest is contact tracing, used to track the spread of COVID-19, and clinical research about the disease. Chai said projects such as Google’s Project Baseline, which leverages user-donated health and location data to combat COVID-19, are important. Google Cloud is a member of the CCC. But the project’s privacy policy includes concerning language, including the baseline terms and conditions, which prevents users from deleting health data once it is contributed.      Chai said confidential computing can serve as a win-win for initiatives like Project Baseline because it allows the project access sensitive data that’s important for pubic health, while also providing assurances to people sharing their data that they can trace and revoke it at any time.      Blockchain technology offers a coordination mechanism for computers using TEEs, allowing access to data among parties that might not trust one another, such as a consumer and a large corporation. Smart contracts can set the rules of engagement to be programmable, and make the end-to-end confidential computer process both trusted, and verifiable, according to Chai.      See also: From Australia to Norway, Contact Tracing Is Struggling to Meet Expectations      The U.S. Senate is considering several bills that would attack end-to-end encryption, according to critics, including the EARN IT Act and the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act of 2020. Simultaneously, companies within the U.S. are grappling with how to comply with privacy laws like California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which lets California residents limit the amount of data gathered about them and ask that companies delete information they may have.      Notably, the CCPA and its international counterpart the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, one of the most prominent privacy laws in the world, don’t prevent companies from abusing people’s data. They just impose fines and other consequences after the fact.      “Protecting organizational, partner and customers’ private data is table stakes to seeing this model truly achieve its potential,” said Michael Klein, principal director of Blockchain & Multiparty Systems Architecture at Accenture, in a statement.      “The open standards and tools provided by the Confidential Computing Consortium offer organizations new options to protect private data while ‘in use,’ and Accenture is proud to be a member of this initiative.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/29/facebook-iotex-r3-among-new-members-of-confidential-computing-consortium,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1bf68ccc9c7039d8cb63b8aa85dff7ec135181b-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an emailed announcement on Monday, Kyber said the upgrade will usher in changes around the role of its native token, the Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), aimed at attracting more participants to the protocol's development.      The Katalyst upgrade and subsequent KyberDAO platform are planned to support three types of Kyber stakeholder groups: reserve entities providing liquidity to Kyber; decentralized applications (dapps), which connect takers to the Kyber protocol; and general KNC holders.      KyberDAO, a platform that will allow the different stakeholders to participate in governance through voting, will be hosted on Kyber.org – a mobile dapp that can be accessed on platforms with Web3 connectivity.      See also: Kyber to Offer Delegated Token Staking After Coming Network Upgrade      The protocol upgrade, Kyber said, is aiming to reduce friction in liquidity contributions as well as provide incentive rebates for liquidity providers. The upgrade will also allow for Dapps to be integrated with Kyber to feature a custom spread for flexible rates.      The Katalyst upgrade will also bring in a new mechanism enabling KNC holders to stake the token and be rewarded for voting participation in ether (ETH) collected in the form of network fees resulting from trading activity.      Users of the network will gain access to the new Katalyst features a week after launch, on July 14, with the first KyberDAO proposal set up in ""Epoch 1."" KyberDAO operations are divided into so-called epochs giving users a two week window to vote.      According to Kyber, there is no minimum or maximum amount of KNC that can be staked, no hard lockup period, no loss of tokens due to penalties and no running of nodes required. KNC holders who do not wish to participate in governance are still able to earn rewards by delegating their voting power to KyberDAO pool operators.      See also: New Cross-Chain Network Plans to Bring Bitcoin’s Liquidity to the DeFi Space      To fulfill this role, entities such as StakeCapital, StakeWith.Us, RockX, and Hyperblocks are expected to go live on KyberDAO soon after launch.

Shareholders' association SdK filed criminal damages against EY Friday for not flagging Wirecard's accounting practices earlier, reports CNBC. The group holds EY, and two current and one former employee in particular, responsible for not alerting the authorities and investors sooner, which ultimately culminated in the precipitous drop in the Wirecard share price.      ""[T]his was an elaborate and sophisticated fraud, involving multiple parties around the world in different institutions, with a deliberate aim of deception,"" said EY in a statement to CNBC. It argued that ""even the most robust and extended audit procedures” would have been unable to uncover this scale of ""collusive fraud.""      Earlier this month, before the most recent revelations of accounting malpractice, law firm Wolfgang Schirp had filed a class-action lawsuit against EY for its failure to spot improperly booked payments in Wirecard’s 2018 accounts.      At press time, Wirecard stock traded at €3.50 (roughly $4). Shares had been worth $105 on June 17, before the company admitted employees had purposefully filed false or misleading statements “in order to deceive the auditor and create a wrong perception of the existence of such cash balances.”      For the time being at least, Wirecard remains a constituent member of the DAX 30, Germany's most prestigious blue-chip stock index.

But a report out last week from derivatives exchange ZUBR argues retail investors are not just here to stay, they could end up absorbing more than half of bitcoin’s daily fresh supply in as little as four years.

Using data from analytics firm Chainalysis, ZUBR found the number of wallet accounts holding small whole balances, anywhere between 1 to 10 bitcoins – sizes that suggest retail rather than institutional – had risen rapidly.      Since bitcoin hit its all-time high at the end of 2017, the number of ""retail"" wallet holders more than doubled, reaching 215,000 by the start of June 2020.      In total, these entities hold over 500,000 bitcoin (~$4.6 billion), up over 100,000 since the start of 2019.      On average, 144 bitcoin blocks are mined every day. After the next halving in 2024, about 450 bitcoin will enter circulation each day. Assuming demand continues at its present trajectory over the next four years, ZUBR estimates the amount of new bitcoins demanded daily by retail investors could be at around 250 – well over half the daily supply four years from now.      And that’s only wallet addresses with whole numbers. Adding in wallets with fractional balances and daily demand could be even higher. ZUBR also excluded crypto held in exchange accounts from its study.      At the start of the year, approximately 1,800 new bitcoins entered into circulation each day. Since the block reward fell from 12.5 to 6.25 in mid-May, the daily bitcoin supply has dropped to just 900.      Assuming the same level of mining activity, daily supply will likely fall down to just 225 bitcoin by the end of the decade.      These supply pressures make a highly bullish case for bitcoin, said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics.      “Bitcoin has a perfect supply curve, total (maximum) supply is always known, and it can only be lower due to lost coins,” he told CoinDesk.      Although bitcoin’s total supply stands at around 21 million, the estimated number of coins believed to have been lost or otherwise irrecoverable ranges between 1.5 million, according to CoinMetrics, or even as high as 4 million, according to Unchained Capital. That puts even greater pressure on supply.      But the real variable is demand. Should this continue to increase, there will come a point when it will outpace supply, causing bitcoin’s price to rise.      A rising price might help burnish bitcoin’s credentials as a store of value asset; possibly creating a virtuous circle where price increases help bolster the store of value narrative which, in turn, leads to further price increases.      Indeed, going back to ZUBR’s research, this virtuous circle may already be present.      Since the start of 2020, balances for retail-sized entities have grown continuously month on month. Despite unprecedented market volatility – bitcoin’s price fell nearly 40% in March – there has not yet been a month so far this year where the total amount of bitcoin held in retail-sized wallets has decreased.      Zooming out, there hasn’t been a month of net decline since April 2019. Going out even further, there have only been five months since the mining of the “genesis block”, more than 11 years ago, where the monthly amount of retail balances of bitcoin have decreased, rather than grown.      This natural “hodling” mentality might suggest that retail investors, as an investor class, see bitcoin as a natural store of value, rather than a medium of exchange, and are, therefore, hoarding as much as they can, anticipating further price increases.      Indeed, events such as “Black Thursday” on March 12, which temporarily took the bitcoin price down below $5,000, might have been seen more as a unique buying opportunity, rather than an existential threat to the cryptocurrency.      In fact, some institutions and brokerages told CoinDesk at the time they were offloading as much of their bitcoin as possible onto retail investors, some buying for the first time, who were buying up to two to three times as much as they were normally.      According to Deane, this should come as no surprise. If you assume that demand is going to continue rising, just as daily supply continues to fall, it's reasonable that retail investors may be buying in anticipation of further price hikes.      The market may soon be at the point where instead of dealing in bitcoins, many small-time traders will instead be buying in ""satoshis,"" bitcoin’s smallest divisible unit at approximately 0.00000001 BTC (currently around 0.009 of a cent).      “Obtaining a whole bitcoin will be very difficult in the future and most people will only deal in satoshi, which will almost certainly become the norm, especially for individuals,” Deane said.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,106 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,190 | 24-Hr Low: $9,025      Trend: Bitcoin's price bounce from lows below $8,850 seen over the weekend has run out of steam, and the cryptocurrency looks vulnerable to deeper declines.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $9,100, having faced rejection around $9,200 during Sunday's U.S. trading hours.      On the hourly chart, a bearish trendline connecting the June 22 and June 24 highs is still intact. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has fallen back into bearish territory below 50. The MACD, too, has crossed into the negative territory.      The same indicators are also reporting bearish conditions on the daily and three-day charts.      In addition, the weekly chart shows signs of uptrend exhaustion: Bitcoin has been above a trendline connecting the June 2019 and February 2020 highs (yellow line) for six weeks. Even so, buyers are failing to step in.      As a result, a retest of the weekend low of $8,830 cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose deeper support levels lined up at $8,630 (May 24 low) and $8,638 (50-week moving average).      On the higher side, immediate resistance is seen at $9,172, the hourly chart's bearish trendline. Above that, the focus would shift to $9,344 (a lower high on the hourly chart). The overall bias would turn bullish only after a move above $10,000.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/29/first-mover-the-return-of-the-bitcoin-retail-investor-and-why-thats-a-good-thing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/657b9664c8f78ba0f869a6230b37c06ec19e8cc4-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432183,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAbJh,1593432042,Bitcoin Closes in the Green Sunday to End Longest Daily Losing Run in 6 Months,"Bitcoin chalked out minor price gains on Sunday, ending its longest run of daily losses for half a year.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped 1.2%, having suffered losses in each of the preceding five days, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Prices last took a beating for five consecutive days in early December 2019.      Both five-day drops saw prices decline by around $900 over those periods.      Sunday’s rise has kept the multi-week-long trading range of $9,000 to $10,000 intact after prices briefly dropped below $8,850 on Saturday. Had the cryptocurrency established a secure foothold below $9,000, the resulting range breakdown could have invited stronger chart-driven selling and further losses.      However, the cryptocurrency still ended the week (June 22–28) on a negative note. Prices dropped nearly 1.8% despite news that fintech giant PayPal is said to be planning to roll out direct cryptocurrency sales on its platform, as well as its sister money-sharing app Venmo.      Also read: PayPal, Venmo to Roll Out Crypto Buying and Selling: Sources      The bitcoin market initially responded positively to the news, reported by CoinDesk on June 22, but failed to keep the bullish momentum going.      “After the news broke, bitcoin hit a very respectable $9,699, dropping off towards the end of the week as markets got spooked about the spike in coronavirus cases in some parts of the world,” Simon Peters, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro.      Also, some analysts are skeptical PayPal's plan, if confirmed, would prompt a big rally. “The tech giant’s plan may bring a $1.15 billion boost to bitcoin’s market cap. That figure alone is impressive, but considering bitcoin’s market cap is already $168 billion, the $1.15 billion, maximum, potential increase would only result in only ~$9,300 per coin,” said Messari research analyst Ryan Watkins, according to Forbes.      The cryptocurrency needs to beat resistance at $10,040 to confirm a major bullish breakout.      Bitcoin is stuck in a 2.5-year-long descending triangle breakdown on the weekly chart. A move above $10,040, which is the upper end of the triangle, would open the doors to a re-test of the high of $13,880 reached in June 2019.      On the downside, $8,800 could offer stiff support in the short term. Currently there are 1.27 million addresses holding 837,730 bitcoin that were purchased in the range of $8,805 to $9,076, according to IntoTheBlock's In/Out of the Money Around Price Addresses indicator.      “This is expected to act as support as holders in this range will attempt to remain profitable on their positions and push prices above this level,” the blockchain analysis firm IntoTheBlock noted in a weekly analysis.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity provider Balancer Pool admitted early Monday morning it had fallen victim to a sophisticated hack that exploited a loophole, tricking the protocol into releasing $500,000 worth of tokens.      In a blog post, Balancer CTO Mike McDonald said the attacker had borrowed $23 million worth of WETH tokens, an ether-backed token suitable for DeFi trading, in a flash loan from dYdX. They then traded, against themselves, with Statera (STA), an investment token that uses a transfer fee model and burns 1% of its value every time it's traded.      The attacker went between WETH and STA 24 times, draining the STA liquidity pool until the balance was next to nothing. Because Balancer thought it had the same amount of STA, it released WETH that equated to the original balance, giving the attacker a larger margin for every trade completed.      As well as WETH, the attacker performed the same attack using WBTC, LINK and SNX, all against Statera tokens.      See also: Hacker Exploits Flaw in Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange Bisq to Steal $250K      The hacker's identity remains a mystery but analysts at 1inch exchange, a decentralized exchange aggregator, said the hacker had covered their tracks well: The ether used to pay transaction fees and deploy smart contracts was laundered through Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based mixer service.      ""The person behind this attack was [a] very sophisticated smart contract engineer with extensive knowledge and understanding of the leading DeFi protocols,"" 1inch said in its blog post on the breach.      For its part, the team behind Statera batted away accusations that the protocol had either failed or been designed intentionally for this sort of attack to take place.

42432167,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAaph,1593424864,World's Biggest Mining Firm Makes First Ore Trade on a Blockchain,"Mining conglomerate BHP has completed its first trial trade of iron ore using blockchain technology.      As reported by Reuters on Monday, the roughly $14 million deal with Chinese metals giant Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd. (Baosteel) was conducted on a platform created by Canada-based startup MineHub Technologies. The MineHub platform was used to process contract terms, exchange documents online and provide visibility and accountability along the supply chain. The transaction took place in June.      BHP Group is an Anglo-Australian mining, metals and petroleum multinational based in Melbourne, Australia, and is the biggest mining firm worldwide by market capitalization.      Given the mining industry's dependence on paper-based legacy systems, the trial blockchain trade comes as BHP and Baosteel see a need for a shift to digital, the companies said.      “The bulk commodity industry needs a digital revolution to reduce physical documentation processes,” according to Michiel Hovers, sales and marketing officer at BHP.      BHP and MineHub said using blockchain would boost efficiency and transparency in statements, Reuters reported.      Baosteel is the Chinese state-owned listed arm of Baowu Steel Group Co. Ltd. The firm has not been shy about using blockchain technology in the past, having previously completed what was claimed as the first yuan-denominated international letter of credit (LC) via the Contour platform in May.

42432176,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAb3h,1593421270,Many Bitcoin Developers Are Choosing to Use Pseudonyms – For Good Reason,"""Here lies the huge irony in this discussion. Persistent pseudonyms aren't ways to hide who you are. They provide a way to be who you are. You can finally talk about what you really believe; your real politics, your real problems, your real sexuality, your real family, your real self."" — Engineer Kee Hinckley      Fiatjaf is a pseudonymous Bitcoin developer in the Lightning community where he contributes to LNURL. He’s also working on Etleneum, his ""centralized Ethereum"" app that uses the Lightning Network for faster and more scalable bitcoin payments. Like many other bitcoin users, Fiatjaf doesn't want to expose his real name to the whole world. He worries his bitcoin software projects could make him and his family a target for criminals.      As a resident of Brazil, where the crime rate is unusually high, Fiatjaf is particularly concerned for his safety. ""I think in Brazil criminals are greater than in other places,"" he said.      He also worries that if the price of bitcoin skyrockets, or ""goes to the moon,"" he could be painting a target on his back as a public figure in the Bitcoin space.      ""Local criminals might want to take my bitcoin. They'd see my name and think, 'Oh this guy is a local guy, not using any special precautions. He may be very rich because he's using bitcoins.'"" he said.      Though Fiatjaf doesn’t want to overreact to his safety concerns, he sees the threat of criminal activity in Brazil as enough of a potential peril to adopt a pseudonym as he carries out his work as a bitcoin developer.      Fiatjaf is part of a larger trend that isn't openly talked about much. He's one of dozens of developers working in the Bitcoin sphere choosing to conceal their real names.    Cypherpunk roots and pseudonyms    This widespread pseudonymity makes sense seeing as Bitcoin's culture puts so much emphasis on privacy.      The great mystery of Bitcoin is no one knows the real identity of its creator, who went by the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto. He, she or they released the Bitcoin software in 2010, posted on the Bitcoin forums regularly until 2011 and then disappeared.      Nakamoto's pseudonym set the tone for other Bitcoin developers to use fake names.      Also, privacy is a prevalent theme in Bitcoinland. The digital currency was born out of the cypherpunk movement, in which a loose worldwide group of cryptographers have promoted digital privacy and security technologies since the 1990s in hopes of bringing about positive social change.      Read more: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity: A Stand Against Doxxing      ""Being able to minimize what other people know about you is literally the theme of the first paragraph of the Bitcoin white paper,"" pseudonymous bitcoin researcher 0xB10C noted.      To try to meet that very goal, many bitcoin developers have devoted their research to improving Bitcoin's privacy.      ""Privacy should be a basic human right. As I am, in fact, a basic human of indeterminate detail, I would like to exercise that right,"" said pseudonymous Lightning developer ZmnSCPxj, who receives funding from Square Crypto to work on Bitcoin development. On his website, ZmnSCPxj describes himself as a ""randomly-generated Internet person.""      ZmnSCPxj is one of the most frequent posters to the Lightning mailing list, making several proposals (often related to improving privacy) and responding to others' posts with criticism and other feedback.    Personal protection    Similar to Fiatjaf, many developers choose to use pseudonyms out of an abundance of caution.      Samourai Wallet, founded in 2015, allows users to make more private bitcoin transactions. The two co-founders of the wallet chose pseudonyms when they launched the wallet partly for ""personal protection"" reasons.      ""What we're doing is going to offend *someone*,"" SW told CoinDesk. ""That could be from competitors or angry people online who feel that we're a threat, to — whoever.""      Other developers worry that governments won't like what they're up to, fearing persecution or retribution for their involvement in an independent monetary system that challenges the status quo. While many governments have welcomed Bitcoin and blockchain technology as innovations, others have taken a critical view of the new technology.    Being able to minimize what other people know about you is literally the theme of the first paragraph of the Bitcoin white paper.    ""There is always a possibility of Bitcoin becoming unpopular with some government, thus it is always safer to simply avoid possible conflicts with local governments by making it unclear who exactly I am,"" ZmnSCPxj told CoinDesk.      ""Alternately, it may become too popular, and the government might want to acquire more of it by other means,"" he added.      Not everyone sees the government as a threat, however.      ""I'm not paranoid enough to be afraid of the government. Google and Facebook already know my name and they can easily link my name with my pseudonym. So I'm not targeting them,"" Fiatjaf said.    Building a standalone pseudonymous reputation    Developers gave other reasons beyond feeling threatened. For some, it’s a simple matter of keeping their private lives private.      ""When I started working on Bitcoin I didn't see the need for having my 'real name' attached to my work. I was working for a company totally unrelated to Bitcoin. They didn't really need to know what I do in my free time. But it wouldn't have been a problem if they knew,"" 0xB10C told CoinDesk.      Now a well-respected developer in the space, ZmnSCPxj was initially worried about embarrassing himself when he started submitting his ideas.      ""My initial reason [for using a pseudonym] was simply that I was concerned [about] making a massive mistake; thus ZmnSCPxj was originally intended to be a disposable pseudonym that could be abandoned in such a case. However it seems to have garnered a mostly positive reputation, so I have retained it,"" he told CoinDesk.      Conversely, SW and TDevD wanted to use pseudonyms as they launched Samourai Wallet because the duo was already known in the Bitcoin world by their real names before they created their privacy-focused bitcoin wallet.      ""We didn't want it to be about personalities or anything. A lot of us are known inside of the space, outside of the Samourai project. And we didn't want it to be about our personal reputation. We wanted the project to stand on its own merits,"" SW said.    Freedom to be who you are    For others, anonymity provides a sort of end run around exclusion in an industry that tends to be dominated by a typical demographic. In such cases, pseudonyms truly do provide a way to “be who you are.”      ""[M]inorities of all kinds (economic, racial, communal, gender, etc) may not be confident in exposing identities easily traceable to their person, especially in contributing to communities where that minority is underrepresented,"" ZmnSCPxj said.      Read more: Money Reimagined: Crypto’s Diversity Problem      ""It is important to realize that the Earth is large and conditions in various points on it can vary tremendously, even in local social, governmental, or economic states, and habits and attitudes developed as protection against prejudices of local communities may prevent participation with the real identity even in online communities. But participation in online communities may be enabled by pseudonyms.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/29/many-bitcoin-developers-are-choosing-to-use-pseudonyms-for-good-reason,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b58390a1e131d10c26862d862e74f4ec685fee2c-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432184,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAbNh,1593415687,Crypto Long & Short: What Trends in Volatility Could Mean for Bitcoin,"By this stage, pretty much everyone knows that bitcoin’s volatility is well above that of equity markets. This is still true, even after the ructions of March.      What is less well-known is the balance of power when it comes to volatility is shifting. Market data indicates bitcoin markets are becoming less volatile, and equity markets more so. This seems to be unrelated to the crash in markets earlier this year.      You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.      Of course, it’s possible this trend turns again. On the other hand, it could point to a broadening interest in bitcoin as an investment asset, as well as a new role for the cryptocurrency in portfolios.      Let’s look at the details.    It’s all relative    First, bitcoin’s volatility is currently below its 2019 average. Not so for the equity markets.      (Note: We calculate volatility by annualizing 30-day standard deviations. This smooths variations while still reflecting short-term trends and, as of mid-April, removes the effects of the March crash.)      Over the past month, BTC volatility has continued trending down, while S&P volatility has levelled off.      This could be a short-term anomaly. Or it could mean the “standard” expected S&P 500 volatility is now at higher levels than before, while bitcoin’s is lower.      The VIX index, which measures expected S&P 500 volatility using options prices, is currently almost three times higher than at the beginning of the year.      Second, this shift is supported by activity in traditional market volatility instruments. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported on data from Cboe Global Markets data that showed more than a trillion dollars’ worth of derivatives tied to the VIX has traded this year, more than four times the figure a decade ago. It also cited figures from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research that points to a record $19.4 billion of assets in hedge funds that trade volatility.      And earlier this week, the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded notes (VXX) – the largest volatility ETN by far – had its second-largest daily inflow ever.    It doesn’t matter any more    When Fidelity Digital Assets released its survey earlier this month, in which institutional investors were asked about the barriers to investment in crypto assets, volatility was top of the list.      With the narrowing of the differential, that barrier could disappear or at least significantly diminish. It’s not just that bitcoin’s volatility seems to be trending down – if volatility overall is more acceptable, bitcoin’s swings could be seen as less of a negative.      Indeed, many of today’s crypto investors see the heightened volatility as an advantage. Where else are you going to get high potential returns?      What’s more, the strong growth in crypto derivatives gives professional investors more tools with which to hedge the volatility. The breadth of instruments available to crypto investors of all types is steadily widening, and the volume of open interest in bitcoin options heading into Friday’s expiry was more than six times its level at the beginning of the year.      In crypto as in traditional markets, options are not just used for hedging, they are also used to trade volatility, a further sign of the growing interest in the strategy.    Or does it?    Stepping back, it is curious something that used to be a performance metric is now an investment philosophy. Volatility has moved from the realm of statistics to the realm of strategy.      But now there’s an even bigger shift under way.      Volatility has traditionally been equated with risk. This makes sense – the greater the swings, the greater the chance you lose a lot.      But volatility is not the same as risk, it’s a historical performance metric. True, expected volatility derived from options pricing looks forward, but that measurement is based on data points that don’t claim to actually know what future volatility will be, let alone future risk. Especially in these uncertain times, where bad news lurks around every corner and capital flows can swell across oceans in nanoseconds, we may know what the volatility was yesterday and what is expected tomorrow, but we do not know what the actual risk is.      The more we attempt to quantify risk and to harness it for portfolio improvement, the more we lose touch with what it really means. And the more we actively seek it, the more it could spread throughout the system, introducing a systemic weakness that could hurt many.      The cryptocurrency world has long embraced risk. Ferocious creativity and the potential for staggering loss have been part of the DNA of the industry since the beginning. In other words, long-term crypto investors are used to this, and anyone who comes into the sector hopefully does so with his or her eyes open.      In regulated traditional markets, however, volatility is still a relatively misunderstood phenomenon, especially in these untethered markets. It may be creeping into the general vocabulary, and may even become a more entrenched aspect of portfolio construction. But most of those handling it do not have the experience of more-seasoned traders.      Yet, volatility is not a bad thing. In this low-yield environment, it can produce necessary returns unavailable in low-volatility alternatives. Managed with skill, it can provide the outperformance many fund managers need. And with the right tools, it can form a part of even conservative investment strategies.    Changing roles    This could influence the role crypto assets have in broad portfolios. One of the prevailing narratives of recent times has been bitcoin’s role as a hedge against market risk. If things go badly in the economy and the stock market, the reasoning goes, bitcoin will benefit from being seen as an alternative to a wobbly fiat system.      Yet, so far this year we have seen that narrative falter when faced with general turmoil and uncertainty.      Perhaps a new narrative is emerging. Bitcoin is volatile, yes, but so are a lot of other more mainstream investments that populate even conservative portfolios. And the volatility differential seems to be narrowing; this might continue. If so, bitcoin could become less a market hedge and more a volatility diversifier. As more investors embrace volatility, they will hopefully do so with a variety of tools.      You’ll have heard the saying: “They can pull the carpet out from under your feet, or you can learn to dance on a moving carpet.”    Anyone know what's going on yet?    The relentless and alarming climb in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and elsewhere seems to have spooked the markets a bit this week … but just a bit. The threat of walking back the tentative reopening enjoyed in some areas is denting confidence in the consumption recovery that the market was bewilderingly assuming was just around the corner. On the other hand, there’s a lot of fresh money apparently waiting in the wings, and it has to go somewhere.      As we’re pulling out our alphabets to get a handle on what’s ahead, what do you think: a V, a W, a swoosh or a flipped square root sign? I personally favor the ampersand. It feels less linear.      True to recent form, bitcoin acted like a risk-on asset this week, reflecting broader market skittishness by almost twice breaking its monthly lows. Meanwhile, correlation with the S&P 500 is, well, not exactly stable.    Chain Links    As the chess pieces move around the board of financial regulation and prosecution, various possible scenarios are playing out. One is especially intriguing: If current chairman of the SEC, Jay Clayton, is confirmed to become the new U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, President Trump will likely appoint one of the remaining SEC commissioners as acting chair until Clayton’s successor is confirmed. This could well be Hester Peirce, known for her pro-innovation stance on crypto oversight and for her public dissent on the dismissal of a recent bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal. TAKEAWAY: This is all in the realm of speculation, but it could end up being a significant turning point in crypto regulation.      The European Union is preparing a new regulatory regime that could include stricter requirements for crypto assets, including stablecoins. TAKEAWAY: Greater regulation is resisted by many in the crypto industry as it can stifle innovation. Most investors would welcome it, however, as it brings greater clarity and acceptance. And, let’s face it, it’s inevitable as cryptocurrencies grow in popularity. The increased attention from the regulators of one of the world’s principal economic blocs is a strong sign that crypto assets are being taken seriously at the highest levels.      The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) will consider issuing conditional licenses under which startups would be allowed to partner with existing licensed entities to begin operations in the Empire State, and it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the State University of New York allowing fledgling prospective licensees to experiment with use cases under the school’s supervision. TAKEAWAY: This is a significant change for the BitLicense regime, long criticized for being too onerous and restrictive. More importantly, this shift could usher in a new season of innovative crypto services in one of the world’s largest financial centers.      Commodity markets veteran Chris Hehmeyer, CEO of Hehmeyer Trading + Investments, is rebranding his firm to reflect its growing involvement in the crypto markets. TAKEAWAY: This is significant: Hehmeyer Trading has been a fixture of the commodities trading scene since 2007, and the pivot of such a legacy name into crypto markets sends a signal to other traders that this is where the “new” markets are. Hehmeyer has been trading crypto assets for a couple of years now, and has spoken publicly about them on several occasions, but this marks a deeper commitment to the evolution of the industry.      According to sources, PayPal plans to roll out cryptocurrency buying and selling to its 325 million users, possibly within the next three months. TAKEAWAY: The numbers alone point to how big the impact could be. PayPal’s user base is almost as large as the entire population of the United States. What is even more intriguing are the possible reasons for PayPal’s strategy shift. Could it be the significant revenue competitor Square is earning on its crypto platform?      LibertyX plans to enable cash purchases of bitcoin at 20,000 locations, including at 7-Eleven, CVS and Rite Aid stores. And Australians can now purchase bitcoin at post offices. TAKEAWAY: This significant jump in the number of onramps does not necessarily mean that retail investors will start buying bitcoin in droves; it does, however, make it a lot easier for those that want to try it out with small amounts. Going even further, just seeing the purchase points at highly frequented and trusted retail sites is likely to entrench the public’s awareness of bitcoin, and acceptance of its legitimacy.      Cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp shared some charts framing bitcoin’s role as a store of value. TAKEAWAY: Is bitcoin a store of value? There’s data for and there’s data against. The most compelling data against is bitcoin’s lack of correlation with gold. Is that the right metric to look at?      Coin Metrics looked into whether Coinbase’s announcements of possible listings has an impact on the asset prices. The outcome? Less than you would expect. TAKEAWAY: I have questioned this practice before. Surely an announcement of a potential listing, something that might increase liquidity of an asset (and therefore, in theory, its value), can be construed as price manipulation? Coin Metrics showed the price movements after announcements of potential listings is largely influenced by the market mood at the time.      Kaiko took a close look at bitcoin options market metrics, concluding that the options market has recently showed clear signs of maturity in terms of costs and trading behavior. TAKEAWAY: The recent growth in open interest and trading volumes in bitcoin options has attracted attention from market participants, who see it as a symptom of greater crypto market maturity overall. It is also a sign of deeper professional involvement, as heavy options volumes are a sign of deep pockets and high stakes. Also, more options products are coming to market, which should continue to enhance investor demand as the array of potential use cases and configurations broadens.      The net flow of bitcoins into miner addresses dropped on Tuesday into sharply negative territory, according to crypto data source Glassnode, reaching the lowest level since June 2019. Another metric shows that nearly all of the net outflow was to exchanges, which some are interpreting a bearish signal, given the accumulating sell pressure. TAKEAWAY: On the other hand, miners usually only sell when they believe the market can handle the orders. Furthermore, miners traditionally use OTC traders to move large blocks, so there may be something else going on here. And, as the chart shows, strong net outflows don’t always presage price dips. But, given that volumes are relatively low compared to previous weeks, this is worth keeping an eye on.      Barça Fan Tokens, listed as $BAR, went on sale on Monday, and reached its cap of $1.3 million within two hours. TAKEAWAY: This is more significant than it may seem. I’ve written before about how soccer club tokens can be a gateway into asset innovation for a mainstream audience – this news shows that where there is genuine interest, the underlying technology will not be a barrier. I doubt very much that the buyers were mainly crypto enthusiasts.
