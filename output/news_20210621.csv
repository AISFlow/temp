According to a press release, DCG – which is also the parent company of CoinDesk – will buy the shares on the open market with cash on hand.      The price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) tripled in May, reaching an all-time high of $177.26 before falling about 70% into the low $50s, where it remains today. Though ETC has returned 668% year-to-date – higher than ETH's 163% gain – many crypto analysts saw the ETC rally as a speculative fever akin to the dogecoin (DOGE) frenzy rather than an informed investment based on the potential of blockchain technology.      D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria sees DCG’s move as an arbitrage play.      ""Because of the volatility in crypto assets, DCG has opportunities to capitalize on disconnects between the price of its exchange-traded listings and the price of the underlying assets,"" Luria wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""Since they own the underlying assets, they can sell those to acquire shares in the exchange-traded listings and capture the spread.""      DCG did not respond to requests for comment.      The company made a similar move to shore up shares of Grayscale's flagship Bitcoin Investment Trust in March. The trusts are designed to give investors exposure to cryptocurrencies without the hassle of setting up a wallet or safeguarding cryptographic private keys.    Read more: Digital Currency Group to Buy Up to $250M of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Shares    ETC was created in 2016 after a schism among Ethereum’s developers over how to handle a hack that resulted in a hard fork, which is a radical change in a protocol.      Since 2017, Grayscale has funded Ethereum Classic’s developers, donating over $1 million to the ETC Cooperative from the trust’s management fees. Developers have used the funding to add Ethereum-based updates to ETC and improve interoperability between ETC and its more mainstream cousin, ETH. Grayscale has committed to funding the ETC Cooperative at least through the end of 2021.      Despite the upgrades, Ethereum Classics functionality still pales in comparison to Ethereum's, according to an analysis by researchers at brokerage firm eToro.",NEUTRAL,ETC,BTC | ETC | SPONSORED | TRADING | FORKS,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/21/dcg-to-buy-50m-in-shares-of-grayscales-ethereum-classic-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93f29fa63f4b14ea6cdae7227afbfdec353fff7f-1200x799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""[I]n spite of the hype, bitcoin failed to satisfy the notion of 'currency without government' (it proved to not even be a currency at all),"" the self-described flaneur writes in ""Bitcoin, Currencies and Bubbles,"" posted on his blog Sunday.  Bitcoin ""can be neither a long or short term store of value (its expected value is no higher than 0), cannot operate as a reliable inflation hedge, and, worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes,"" Taleb goes on, with characteristic assertiveness.  It's a far cry from 2017, when Taleb wrote the foreword to ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" economist Saifedean Ammous' book that made the case for the digital asset as a new form of sound money.  Bitcoin, Taleb wrote then, is ""an excellent idea. It fulfills the needs of the complex system ... because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. It is owned by the crowd, its users. And it now has a track record of several years, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.""  Taleb has since had a very public falling-out with Ammous, deleted his Medium post that contained the foreword and made his tweets private, meaning if you are not among the 743,000 people who already followed him on Twitter, you will now need his permission to see his posts. A new edition of Ammous' book is forthcoming with a foreword by MicroStrategy CEO and bitcoin bull Michael Saylor replacing Taleb's.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $32,590.39 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 7.88% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $31,744.99-$36,119.80 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $1,945.31 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 12.21% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $1,893.15-$2,276.16 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure in Asia    Monday’s sell-off was triggered by negative news in China once again. But the market is split on the severity of the renewed crackdown by the Chinese government.      The correction is “mostly driven by China FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] again,” Annabelle Huang, partner at Hong Kong-based Amber Group, told CoinDesk. “Hardly news, not that [banks and payment services in China] are really providing services to crypto-related [business] anyway.”      Read More: China Says Banks Must Block Crypto Transactions; Market Falls      Others, however, expressed less positive views.      “The statement of the central bank of China is relatively mild as mentioned before,” Colin Wu, a crypto journalist based in China tweeted. “But does this mean that the Chinese government’s crackdown is over? We are not sure. Just as no one had predicted that China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining would be so severe.”      Notably, prices for the tether and Chinese yuan pair on the over-the-counter (OTC) desks on Huobi and Binance, two of the most popular crypto exchanges among Chinese investors, have plummeted in the past 24 hours as well, according to data from Price Dancing.      The drop reflects a reduced demand for tether, a preferred stablecoin by many traders in China, on the OTC desks, as traders and investors in China are possibly selling their crypto holdings and turning them into cash.      “Since [China] shut down Sichuan mining operations, some miners had to liquidate their crypto holdings,” Huang said. “Mining ban is going to have a somewhat ongoing effect.”      Read More: Sichuan Becomes Latest Chinese Province to Order Bitcoin Miner Shutdown    Bitcoin futures 'backwardation'    Monday’s price slide has prompted institutional investors to exit bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), resulting in an unusual condition known as “backwardation,” which is when futures trade at a discount to the spot price.      JPMorgan, in a recent report, said that such a move on the bitcoin futures market should be seen as a sign of weak demand for bitcoin from institutional investors, who are the primary users on the CME, as CoinDesk reported on June 10.    Bitcoin inflows to spot exchanges highest since March 2020    On June 19, the mean of bitcoin's daily inflow to spot exchanges reached its highest level since the market crash in March 2020, according to blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, meaning that more BTC are available to be sold on exchanges.      Ki Young Ju, the chief executive of CryptoQuant, also noticed that bitcoin ""whales"" have started to sell their large holdings, intensifying the bearish sentiment.      Ju and his firm use a so-called whale capitulation index to monitor bitcoin whales’ behaviors. The index number has turned positive, which shows that an increased number of bitcoin whales are sending their coins to exchanges, according to Ju.      The number remained positive for an extended period of time during the bear markets of 2018 and 2019.      “I hate to say this, but it seems like the $BTC bear market [is] confirmed,” Ju wrote on his website.    Altcoins hit harder, following bitcoin’s sell-off    The alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market was hit harder on Monday, with dogecoin among the most significant losers of the day.      At press time, the meme-centered crypto is changing hands at $xx, down XX% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20.      Ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also faced a severe daily loss when its price dipped below $2,000, the first time since May 23.      “Notably, most major altcoins suffered relatively higher losses in the last 24 hours when compared with bitcoin, and we may, very soon, see a switch from alts to bitcoin in terms of capital flows,” Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights, told CoinDesk.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all lower Monday.

The regulator said Bybit is operating an unregistered crypto asset trading platform and encouraging Canadian customers to trade crypto asset products that are securities and derivatives on the platform.  The action against Bybit follows a similar one the OSC took against KuCoin trading platforms earlier this month.  Both actions come after the OSC issued a press release on March 29 notifying crypto asset trading platforms operating in the Canadian province that they need to bring their operations into compliance with Ontario securities law by April 19 or face potential regulatory action.  The OSC said Bybit has yet to contact the commission to begin compliance talks.

42406659,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeyywt,1624304716,"Strike Is Phasing Out USDT From Bitcoin-Based El Salvador Remittances, CEO Says","Strike, the startup building a bitcoin-based payment system in El Salvador, is phasing out its use of Tether’s USDT stablecoin as a U.S. dollar substitute, CEO Jack Mallers said.      “Tether is no longer a part of anything,” Mallers said on an episode of the ""What Bitcoin Did"" podcast released last week. “Tether was part of the plan originally because it had to be, because I didn't have a choice.”      Mallers’ remarks – which come less than a month after he introduced El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to the Bitcoin community at a Miami conference – may come as a relief to those concerned about USDT’s backing.      Tether, issuer of USDT, settled a New York State Attorney General probe into its finances in February. Last month, the company disclosed that nearly half of the collateral backing its token is commercial paper, without specifying the issuers or ratings of those debts, leaving the market guessing how creditworthy and liquid the assets were. (Stu Hoegner, Tether's general counsel, later wrote that ""the vast majority"" of this commercial paper is from issuers rated A-2 or higher, again without naming any.)      Prompting further skepticism, with more than $60 billion of USDT outstanding the breakdown would mean Tether has a $30 billion commercial paper portfolio – bigger than Google’s or Apple’s. According to the company, only 4% of Tether’s reserves are cash and 3% U.S. Treasury bills.      But when Mallers arrived in El Salvador several months ago, his options for building a faster, cheaper remittance system on top of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network were limited, he told podcast host Pete McCormack. (The relevant portion starts at around 23:00 here and ends at 27:00.) This was before Mallers met Bukele, who made international headlines this month when his country became the first to make bitcoin legal tender (alongside the dollar, which has been El Salvador’s currency since 2001).      Read more: It’s Official: El Salvador’s Legislature Votes to Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender      From early conversations with local financial institutions, Mallers learned that custodying dollars on users’ behalf would be illegal for a service like Strike’s, he told McCormack. Hence, USDT, a cryptocurrency that usually trades for $1, had to serve as a stand-in for dollars sent to El Salvador through Strike’s system.      “We built tether into Strike which was the equivalent of the Chase bank account in America and at least gave us some MVP basic functionality,” Mallers said, using the tech industry abbreviation for “minimum viable product.”    Beta pilot    According to a description of the beta pilot Mallers published in January, Strike would debit the bank account of a sender in the U.S. for, say, $1,000; convert it to bitcoin; send that BTC to the company’s Central American infrastructure; and then convert it to USDT, credited to the recipient’s account.      If users didn’t want to hold USDT, they could convert it to BTC through Strike and, if desired, cash it out for dollar bills at a local bitcoin ATM, Mallers wrote at the time.      As many skeptics pointed out in the wake of Mallers’ bombshell Miami announcement, one problem with that setup is there are only a handful of such ATMs in El Salvador and they can charge hefty fees. Another is the aforementioned limited information, and longstanding doubts, about USDT’s dollar backing.      But since meeting Bukele – an experience Mallers described to McCormack as nerve-racking at first because he had no idea going in if the president would support or frown on Strike’s activities in El Salvador – the entrepreneur has more options.    'Growth hack'    Strike is now integrating with the country’s top five banks and two biggest cashpoint distributors, Mallers told McCormack. These are stores where people can exchange physical cash for a balance on a mobile app or vice versa.      The integrations would presumably remove the need for USDT to serve as an ersatz greenback because Strike would be able to hold customers’ balances at the banks. It would also give them more places to cash out those balances for the paper stuff.      Mallers did not give a timetable for the integrations during the podcast. Neither he nor Tether responded to CoinDesk’s emails by press time.      Summing up Strike’s temporary use of tether in the interview with McCormack, Mallers waxed philosophical, speaking about his journey in the second person.      “You launch with tether, you growth hack, you learn and be a good listener, be a good observer, you end up meeting with the president and helping to find regulatory clarity in the country,” he said. “And then you roll tether out, get it the f**k out of here.”      UPDATE (June 28, 00:03 UTC): Adds detail about Tether's commercial paper portfolio.",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/21/strike-is-phasing-out-usdt-from-bitcoin-based-el-salvador-remittances-ceo-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c184d5f80758eed5f0c7df01dc02158668581f9-1500x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406666,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeyz1o,1624300953,Upstart Crypto Tracer Brings ‘Middleware’ to Busy Blockchain Analysis Industry,"Meat packers and gas magnates are paying massive bitcoin ransoms, prompting governments to trace, and sometimes seize, millions of dollars in crypto. Purists call these recent headlines regulatory encroachment. But to intelligence startup Blocktrace it's an opportunity.      The Austin, Texas-based software company on Monday unveiled Fusion, a product that seeks to further demystify illicit cryptocurrency transactions for government agents and financial institutions.      There’s already plenty of competition in the crypto intelligence space. Established startups including Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace and TRM Labs have made millions of dollars pairing inherently traceable blockchains with troves of proprietary information, such as illicit transaction histories, that investigators find useful.      But Blocktrace’s Fusion is a new software product, not another tracing service. CEO Shaun MaGruder calls it middleware: “It essentially brings all the data together, aggregated into a single central place.”    Read more: TRM Labs Raises $14M as Crypto Tracking Steps Into Spotlight    Think of Fusion as a bridge between crypto tracers’ data silos. One tracing firm might know bitcoin address xyz123 transacted on the dark web, and a separate transaction database knows that the same address likely violated sanctions. With Fusion, MaGruder said, investigators can access both bread crumbs in a single place.      “Whether it be CipherTrace or Elliptic or the anti-human trafficking intelligence initiative, or other data partners for that matter,” Fusion can pool the data for easy access, MaGruder said, arguing this “makes the picture more complete.”    Sleuthing partners    At launch, the product pulls from CipherTrace and Elliptic APIs as well as a handful of other databases that document the darker side of crypto. But MaGruder said that over time it could integrate with more hands-on streams such as bitcoin exchanges. He cautioned that personally identifiable information will be kept out of Fusion’s pipes.      The company itself isn't new. MaGruder, a former signals analyst for U.S. Army Special Forces who later worked at Chainalysis, started Blocktrace in early 2018 after seeing a “bottleneck” in the data processing market. He privately funded Blocktrace and then began building relationships across the crypto intelligence landscape.      “Most of what we do really happens behind the scenes,” MaGruder said. “A lot of folks that need to know about us already know how to reach out to us.”      MaGruder declined to say who those folks were.    Government partners    The company has been working with the federal government since at least May 2019, netting nearly $800,000 through Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) training sessions on cryptocurrency and providing Internal Revenue Service criminal investigators with analytical and technical support, according to contract data reviewed by CoinDesk. Blocktrace stands to make nearly $750,000 through an IRS subscription contract that stretches well into 2023.      Just last week, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement signaled its intent to pay Blocktrace $36,000 for a 30-day contract, according to public data.      That’s hardly a drop in the buck of the $30 million federal agencies have spent on tracing contracts since 2015.      “Our hope is that through collaboration we'll be able to increase transparency across blockchains more effectively, thus exposing and identifying cyber-criminals more quickly,” MaGruder said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/21/upstart-crypto-tracer-brings-middleware-to-busy-blockchain-analysis-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47507db8a9d43100729efc41f70c5b14dedd0bf4-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dave Feldman will join Dapper Labs after seven years at the NFL, where he served as the VP of social media marketing, the company said Monday. Before the NFL, Feldman was the director of social media at Major League Baseball (MLB), helping build its social team and strategy, the company added.

Rattink was the former head of studio at Hyper Hippo Entertainment, where he co-created the mobile game AdVenture Capitalist along with its two sequels, Dapper Labs said.

Photos appearing to show the equipment packed up and ready to be airlifted were shared on Twitter Monday by CNBC's senior correspondent in Beijing, Eunice Yoon. Guangzhou-based Fenghua International told CNBC it is airlifting 3,000 kg (6,600 lbs) of machines to Maryland.      This weight of mining machines ""would be about 200 units of S19,"" Thomas Heller, chief business officer at Compass Mining, told CoinDesk. An Antminer S19 Pro weighs about 15.2 kg.      The CNBC photos fit into an emerging narrative of bitcoin's exodus from China but the Fenghua shipment represents a very small load, Heller said. The recent crackdown on bitcoin mining involves partial bans on the industry in multiple provinces.      He said that ""3,000 kg sounds huge, but compared to the amount of miners that get shipped regularly it's just a small batch.""      So for how much does the Fenghua shipment account?      With a hashrate of about 95 terahashes per second, 200 of the machines equate to 19,000 TH/s.      Citing blockchain data, Heller estimates that 50 exahash per second of mining capacity in China has been turned off recently, or the equivalent of 526,000 S19 machines. One EH is equal to 1 million TH.      That gives about 80,000 metric tons of machinery potentially sitting idle.

The 277-year-old British auction house will be accepting bitcoin and ether for a rare 101.38-carat diamond that could fetch over $15 million at auction.      The auction house said the exceptionally rare rock will be sold in an upcoming single-lot sale to be held in Hong Kong on July 9. The acceptance of cryptocurrency as a supported payment option is a first.      Should it be bought with crypto, the transaction will be processed by Coinbase Commerce, Sotheby’s said.      “This is a truly symbolic moment. The most ancient and emblematic denominator of value can now, for the first time, be purchased using humanity’s newest universal currency,” said Patti Wong, chairman of Sotheby’s Asia.      Read more: Sotheby’s Opens Virtual Replica of Its London Galleries in Decentraland      Sotheby’s said 100-carat diamonds have achieved a “mythical status” and the pear-shaped cut echoes that of the “Cullinan I” currently residing in the Tower of London and mounted in the Imperial Sceptre of Great Britain.      Rare diamonds and their perceived value are due to canny marketing that, in the mid-20th century, created the almost universal expectation in Western countries that an engagement had to be marked by a diamond ring as a symbol of an eternal commitment, reports The Wall Street Journal.      The Pink Star holds the record for the most expensive diamond ever sold, fetching an eye-popping $71 million at a Sotheby's auction in April 2017. The 14.62-carat Oppenheimer Blue sold for $50.6 million in a Christie's auction in May 2016. More recently, in 2020, a 14.83-carat diamond was sold by Sotheby's for $26.6 million.      In May, Sotheby’s announced it had started accepting cryptocurrency as payment for artworks. It also delved into the NFT market, facilitating the sale of works by the artist Pak for $16.8 million in April.

Currently, only four exchanges – Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone and Korbit – have established partnerships with banks. These are often referred to as the “Big 4.”      According to South Korea’s Financial Transactions Reports Act (FTRA), crypto exchanges are required to register with financial authorities by Sept. 24 of this year. Exchanges need to have an official partnership with a domestic commercial bank in order to have their registration approved by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which operates under the Financial Services Commission (FSC).      After the registration deadline, exchanges will fall under the FSC’s regulatory net and be subject to regular scrutiny. The banks associated with them will also be monitored to ensure that know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols are being enforced.      Banks are reassessing their partnerships with exchanges to determine whether or not this additional scrutiny will be worth it.      As part of this assessment, K Bank (Upbit) Nonghyup Bank (Bithumb, Coinone) and Shinhan Bank (Korbit) will evaluate the “money laundering risks” associated with the Big 4.    South Korea's 'Big 4' under regulatory scrutiny    On May 2, the Korea Federation of Banks (KFB) released a set of “guidelines” for banks to follow when evaluating crypto exchanges. The guidelines mostly concern exchanges’ security protocols, their susceptibility to hacks, the thoroughness of their customer databases and their standards for listing tokens. Banks are also expected to review exchanges’ corporate structure and the transparency of their operations.      Although many industry insiders have come to assume that the Big 4 will survive the imminent regulatory tidal wave, it looks as if there are no guarantees for even these major players.      Upbit, the largest exchange in South Korea by volume, recently delisted 24 tokens and removed the fiat on-ramps for five tokens. Many view this move as an attempt by Upbit to remove any potential risk in its upcoming assessment by K Bank.      There is also speculation surrounding the potential impact of an ongoing fraud investigation of one of Bithumb’s major shareholders.      Compared to other exchanges, however, the Big 4 have much less to worry about. Currently, there are no South Korean banks that have publicly expressed interest in forming a partnership with an exchange outside of the Big 4. Leaders of smaller exchanges have even implored the FSC to encourage banks to at least negotiate with them.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/21/south-korean-banks-to-review-partnerships-with-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4722312216644d2879f4a1714cb49955d41a7ee8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406669,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeyz4l,1624279514,MicroStrategy Buys $489M More of Bitcoin; Price Drop May Mean Writedown Ahead,"MicroStrategy said Monday it bought about 13,005 bitcoins for $489 million in cash at an average price of roughly $37,617 inclusive of fees and expenses.    The business-intelligence software company now holds some 105,085 bitcoins, which were acquired for a total of $2.74 billion. That’s an average purchase price of $26,080 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.  Given MicroStrategy paid a per-coin price of $37,617, the company's purchase is already underwater with the leading cryptocurrency currently trading at about $32,000.  Should the price of bitcoin not fully recover to the purchase price by the end of June 30, MicroStrategy will have to write the value of the newly purchased bitcoin down to the price at quarter end. Were the quarter to end right now, with bitcoin at $32,000, the value of that $489 million in bitcoin would have to be reduced about $73 million to $416 million.  A call to MicroStrategy wasn't immediately returned.  CEO Michael Saylor has made bitcoin acquisition a second mandate for his 32-year-old company. Its other business is developing software.  The purchase follows MicroStrategy's raising of $500 million from the sale of debt to fund more bitcoin buying. As the company subsequently filed to sell $1 billion in shares to help buy even more of the leading cryptocurrency, we likely will see another purchase soon.  Shares of Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy are getting pounded today, down about 10%, as their fate are now largely tied to the price of bitcoin, which has fallen by a similar amount after China's central bank continued the nation's crackdown on crypto. The People's Bank of China said financial institutions must not provide trading, clearing and settlement for crypto transactions.  As mentioned earlier, the price of bitcoin was trading at about $32,000, less than half its all-time high set in April.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, is changing hands near $1,920 at press time, the lowest level since May 23.  The token powering Ethereum's blockchain is down nearly 15% on the day and appears on track to test the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) support at $1,872.  Bitcoin is trading 10% lower near $31,850, extending last week's 8.7% decline.  Other top cryptocurrencies including XRP, cardano and polkadot are nursing losses ranging from 5% to 10%.  In an announcement early today, the PBOC said major financial institutions must stop providing trading, clearing and settlement for crypto transactions.  While China's anti-crypto stance is well established, the latest statement comes after consultation with Alipay and major banks including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Construction Bank, Postal Savings Bank and Industrial Bank.  The central bank asked for prompt discontinuation of payments channels to crypto traders.  Alipay, the Agricultural Bank of China and Postal Savings Bank have put out statements saying they will take necessary steps to prohibit virtual currency-related business activities.  PBOC's strongly-worded communique has bolstered concern of a stricter regulatory crackdown. The resulting weakness in cryptocurrencies appears to be weighing over shares of companies holding bitcoin and involved in virtual currency businesses.  Per data source TradingView, shares in MSTR are currently down 7%, and those in Tesla, Coinbase, Square are nursing 1.5% to 3.5% losses, even though the S&P 500 is trading 1% higher on the day.  Crypto markets tanked last month on the back of environmental concerns related to crypto mining, China's crackdown, and fears of an early scaling back of stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  China reiterated its crypto ban last month, citing dangers associated with speculative trading. On Friday, the government intensified pressure on cryptocurrency mining by ordering the closure of 26 suspected mining projects in Sichuan.  The Fed unexpectedly brought forward the timing of the first interest-rate hike to 2023.

According to a report by the South China Morning Post on Monday, prices for GPUs have fallen by as much as two-thirds on e-commerce platforms following the crackdown. While the development is tentative for miners, gamers, who have long been locked out of buying the newest cards due to global supply shortages, are rejoicing.      On Friday, the Sichuan branch of the National Development and Reform Commission and the Sichuan Energy Bureau issued a decree to crack down on crypto mining operations. The region is particularly important as it is one of the largest hydro-based crypto mining hubs in China.

According to a report by Bloomberg on Sunday, McCourt's Project Liberty will focus on the development of a publicly accessible database of people’s social connections.      The hope is to encourage a more egalitarian approach by having social media companies, such as Facebook, draw from a shared place of social data.      The project will utilize blockchain technology to build a new type of internet infrastructure dubbed the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP).

In an interview with the Financial Times on June 14 and published Sunday, Fabio Panetta said his institution had no commercial interest in storing, managing or monetizing user data.      The issue over privacy in the digital euro is a focal point for Europeans as are concerns of security, according to a recent survey by the ECB.      ""If the central bank gets involved in digital payments, privacy is going to be better protected,"" said Panetta. ""We’re not like private companies.""      The banker also said people felt safer when their information was handled by a public institution, adding the bank would do a better job.      ""There are many ways in which we can protect confidential data while allowing the checks foreseen by law to avoid illicit transactions, such as those linked to money laundering, the financing of terrorism or tax evasion, said Panetta.
