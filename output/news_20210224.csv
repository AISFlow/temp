42386005,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQhuV,1614207881,US Central Bank Explains 'Preconditions' for a Digital Dollar,"Hours after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell declared 2021 to be a pivotal year in consulting the public on the digital dollar, his underlings issued a paper describing what that consultation might look like.      In a Wednesday FEDS Notes, Fed Reserve Senior Counsel Jess Cheng, Payments Specialist Angela N. Lawson and Technology Lab Manager Paul Wong said the onus would be on broadly engaging the public regarding the pros and cons of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC).      Privacy issues, ease of use, security access and delivery mechanisms should all be on the table as Fed officials work to “sharpen” a digital dollar with the public’s help, the paper said.      And any consultation should likewise include as broad a cross-section of the U.S. population as possible.      “Engaging with individuals and businesses and consulting with consumer groups, community organizations, and business associations to understand the use case for a CBDC will help in the decision whether to issue a CBDC and its potential design,” the authors wrote.      Think tanks and academia could also play a supporting role, they said.      The authors also outlined the basic “preconditions” essential to the Fed’s deliberations on how to proceed.    Digital dollar clarity    The Fed would need to clearly understand what a possible CBDC would be used for, the notes said. The technology used would also have to support the CBDC across different conditions while providing 24/7 instant settlement, secure transfer of assets and resilience.      Feedback should be drawn from “end users of various ages, geographic locations, payment habits, and financial literacy in the design and testing of a CBDC could help sharpen the basic features of a viable CBDC arrangement,” the note stated.    Read more: When Will We See the Digital Dollar? ‘Crypto Dad’ Says Soon    Its authors admitted a CBDC could grant the central bank “unprecedented” access into the financial goings-on of its users if designed to allow the most “granular transaction information” to shine through.      “This close linkage between money and data contrasts with physical banknotes, which do not carry with them transaction data that can be connected to a specific person and their history of financial dealings,” the note said.    Congressional oversight    Congress would have to authorize the Federal Reserve to issue a general-purpose CBDC, the note said. Powell echoed this view in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday, telling lawmakers the Fed would need “legislative authorization.”      Any digital dollar would be controlled as a centralized project by the Federal Reserve, though the actual nodes would be distributed, said James Cunha, a senior vice president at the Boston branch of the U.S. central bank.      The Boston Fed has been evaluating different technology platforms, including blockchain tools, with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative to determine what platform would be best suited to supporting a digital dollar.      However, support for the idea of a digital dollar, whether blockchain-based or not, seems to be growing. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this week “it makes sense” for central banks to consider issuing their own digital currencies.      “Too many Americans don’t have access to easy payments systems and banking accounts, and I think this is something that a digital dollar, a central bank digital currency, could help with,” she said at a New York Times conference on Monday (while also dismissing Bitcoin as being an inefficient system for payments).      Wednesday’s paper dropped just after a Fedwire outage blocking banks from transferring funds. Some crypto exchanges were unable to process ACH transactions during the outage.

42387611,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQloPj,1614201675,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes Around $49K After Two Extremely Volatile Trading Days,"Bitcoin has reversed its biggest two-day loss since March 2020, as prices returned to as high as above $51,000 on Wednesday after the derivatives market calmed down from an over-leveraged condition.  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $49,119.46 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.17% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $47,032.52-$51,445.67 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades below its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.  Bitcoin’s heavy losses earlier this week represented a retreat from price levels that some analysts characterized as euphoric.  But as prices stabilized around $49,000 on Wednesday, signs emerged that some of the excessive leverage had been wrung out of the market, implying the potential for a fresh more to the upside, analysts said.  The cost to fund bitcoin perpetuals swaps trades – a common way of betting on price movements in cryptocurrency markets, similar to futures contracts changes – have returned to “neutral territory,” according to the analysis firm Arcane Research. Prices even briefly traded above $51,000 on Wednesday after dipping below $45,000 on Tuesday.  Trading volumes on major exchanges have subsided following a furious level of activity in the past two days, with some $20 billion changing hands Monday and Tuesday on eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk. By late Wednesday, volume had registered just $4 billion.  On the technical charts, Wednesday has been an “inside day” for bitcoin, meaning the price range is completely within the bounds of prior day’s high-low range, according to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.  “This preserves the pullback despite the $50,000 threshold having been cleared,” Stockton said. “It appears that there is a short-term risk to the latest breakout point at the January high just below $42,000, which would be a natural support level.”  Also supporting bitcoin’s quick recovery from the sell-off is rising demand from investors who bought the price dip, expecting long-term gains.  “Bitcoin has rebounded from yesterday's sell-off, with both retail and institutional investors using the fall in prices to add to their positions,” Simon Peters, crypto asset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, said, citing Square’s new $170 million investment in bitcoin.  MicroStrategy, the business intelligence company led by CEO Michael Saylor that recently has become better known for its bitcoin holdings, said Wednesday it has bought another $1.03 billion worth of the cryptocurrency.  “With yet more endorsements from leading figures in the world of finance and technology, the direction of travel longer-term is clear – bitcoin and its peers are here to stay and are getting more integrated in our lives,” Peters said. “This bodes well for future prices.”  Not just in the West. The demand in bitcoin has increased in China, evidenced by the rising price of dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) denominated in Chinese yuan since last week,on over-the-counter trading desks.  Ether reverses losses from early sell-off  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was higher on Wednesday, trading around $1,605.26 and climbing 5.55% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).  Ether continues to trade in sync with bitcoin and the correlation between the two cryptocurrencies has strengthened since Friday.  Meanwhile, ether is still overbought on the technical charts, indicating that further sideways or “choppy” price action is expected in the coming months, said Fairlead Strategies’ Stockton.  Other markets  Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in green Wednesday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):  chainlink (LINK) + 12.65%  cardano (ADA) + 11.1%  algorand (ALGO) + 10.39%  ethereum classic (ETC) + 9.05%  omg network (OMG) + 8.33%  Notable losers:  cosmos (ATOM) - 1.97%  Equities:  Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed in the red 1.61% amid losses on tech stocks, which are sensitive to rising yields.  The FTSE 100 in Europe closed in the green 0.5% after investors became more optimistic about a post-pandemic economic recovery.  The S&P 500 in the United States was up by 1.14% Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reassured investors of his intention to maintain low interest rates.  Commodities:  Oil was up 2.55%. Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude: $63.24.  Gold was in the red 0.12% and at $1802.94 as of press time.

42386015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQi4Z,1614200492,How Institutions Will Take Crypto Mainstream,"Traditional finance is often viewed as the antithesis of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However, there should be, and needs to be, an overlap between the two worlds. The retail market was the driver of the 2017-2018 bull market, but the institutions will be the ones to drive the current one.      Our financial systems are antiquated, at best. No one knows this better than those working within them. They are in need of a huge overhaul and will receive that in the form of bitcoin and a digital revolution.    Eva Lawrence is the COO of Arcane Crypto AS, a bitcoin and digital asset focused company listed on Nasdaq First North, building the financial and payments system of the future. Eva was previously at Morgan Stanley for eight-plus years, most recently as a trader and Head of EMEA Flow Trading in Securities Lending.    We have seen significant players from the traditional finance sphere starting to recognize this paradigm shift. Morgan Stanley is considering betting on bitcoin with its $150 billion investment arm. BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank are offering crypto custody. And JPMorgan concedes it will have to be involved in bitcoin. Banks are receiving interest from their clients, seeing the gap in their offering and not being involved is now too much of a risk.      Satoshi Nakamoto described the Bitcoin network as “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” This seems to explicitly exclude financial institutions from Satoshi’s goal of a digital asset revolution.      If bitcoin is anti-establishment, what happens when the establishment joins the party?      Participation of financial institutions might not be a requirement for the success of bitcoin. In fact, decentralization is one of bitcoin’s key advantages. Still, institutional involvement will accelerate the adoption and accessibility for the masses.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - Banks Need to Adopt Crypto, Now      Institutional adoption can also be good for the market in general. With the support of traditional finance firms, crypto firms will have more clout with regulators and therefore a greater likelihood of a regulatory framework that is somewhat workable and tailored to crypto. These institutions are used to dealing with the red tape and political games this space is already starting to face.      When the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed that national banks could custody crypto assets, it was a significant development. Once this service becomes widely available, investors can ask their current financial services provider to custody all of their assets in one place, if they choose.      Justified or not, the entry of large financial institutions into crypto, especially via trading and custody, will bring increased legitimacy to the market. Seeing State Street or JPMorgan trading bitcoin could lead more people to exploring the area themselves. While many will go with a third-party provider, some will discover the possibility of self-custody and learn how to take full control of their own coins.      Involvement of the traditional finance sector will lead to increased acceptance of crypto companies by banks, improving access to open accounts. It will also add more custody solutions to the market and bring about more competition. This will result in more options for entry via companies that you might already have a relationship with and solutions tailored to your risk appetite or concerns.      If traditional financial institutions are able to facilitate crypto trading, they will build out support for blockchain infrastructure. This will enable more investors to enter the market, provide better liquidity and price discovery, bring more money into the space and encourage more development. This positive feedback loop will lead to overall growth in the industry and remove some of the perceived barriers for entry.      At the same time, bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption will shine a light on some of the failings of traditional finance, which should lead to industry reform and development to the benefit of companies and consumers.      Consumers are currently subjected to a multitude of charges to access their money: handling and processing fees, credit card charges, ATM withdrawal fees, overdraft and inactivity fees. Despite these fees and charges, the system does not enable 24/7 settlement. Crypto transactions can be verified and settled almost instantly. They can’t be reversed (avoiding chargebacks) and have competitive fees in comparison to traditional financial institutions and payments providers      Traditional finance has clunky onboarding, repetitive know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and assets are no longer traceable once currency is withdrawn from your account. Cryptocurrencies provide the opportunity for streamlined KYC, a transparent ledger and easy interoperability between different assets. Blockchain transactions will lower onboarding and compliance costs and provide 24/7 access from anywhere in the world.    The rise of DeFi and CeFi    Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers a more accessible, transparent framework for financial services, without middlemen taking a spread. Although some consideration needs to be given to the risks involved due to lack of regulation or third-party oversight, breaking down and then rebuilding financial products in this way should not be dismissed.      DeFi provides quick and convenient access to C2C lending, high-interest earning projects and staking for returns. All of this allows you to earn interest on your savings, to make your money and assets work for you. DeFi enables you to trade one asset for another 24/7, without hefty fees currently applied by each agent involved in the process. There are no delays caused by having to wait for your USD to settle, your wire to process or your bank to open.      The degree of decentralization of each DeFi project varies from protocol to protocol. Some, like Dharma, used centralized price feeds and centrally provided liquidity. Others, like Compound and Maker, have centrally controlled interest rates and platform improvements but controlled by a DAO (distributed autonomous organization).      Traditional finance will likely want to be more on the CeFi end of the spectrum, retaining an element of centralization. (I realize that a centralized DeFi system is somewhat of an oxymoron.) Perhaps they will use permissioned or so-called enterprise blockchains, rather than a public blockchain like Ethereum.      The DeFi of the future might look a little different from DeFi today. However, the principles and underlying technology should not be ignored. Traditional financial institutions will need to adopt certain parts of the DeFi infrastructure or get left behind. DeFi provides traditional finance with a new way to offer financial products, reduce costs, barriers to entry and diversify their revenue streams.    Moving forward together    Crypto purists have long since had (a justified) distrust and skepticism of the existing financial system and the main players within it, a feeling that has been mirrored somewhat in traditional finance’s views about crypto. As the two ecosystems move towards convergence, the focus should be on collaboration for the development and improvement of the existing system, rather than an either/or mentality. Crypto is about to get the chance to make the changes it set out to and turn the current financial system on its head.      Financial institutions and the traditional markets in general might find themselves to be less significant in the future, but they will still need to swiftly adapt to fit in with this rapidly evolving ecosystem.      We are each building our own bank of the future and, ironically, it will be the traditional financial institutions that will help us develop it and execute on our crypto exit strategy to escape traditional finance.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Eva Lawrence,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/24/how-institutions-will-take-crypto-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a28e3d64f90dd01f8f2584945848073c14525e4e-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But here's the kicker: They said gold won't be displacing bitcoin, either.      ""In an environment of broadband dollar weakness and still very low and negative real rates we do not see either asset cannibalizing each other and see enough room for both,"" wrote four Goldman analysts in a Wednesday research note obtained by CoinDesk.      The note, predominately a rather bullish take on gold's 2021 trajectory, cast the two commodities as inhabiting different ends of the investment spectrum: Gold remained the ""defensive"" play while bitcoin was more ""risk-on."" Bitcoin ""serves a different role in portfolios vs. gold,"" the analysts said, primarily because of the crypto's legendary volatility.      They attributed gold's underperformance last year to a rotation into riskier asset classes but did not elaborate on what role bitcoin may played had in that move, as JP Morgan did last December.      On the correlated assets front, the analysts steered clear of comparing gold directly to bitcoin. (That correlation turned negative in December.) But they noted a very strong correlation between bitcoin and non-precious metals – copper, tin, zinc – that have moved steadily upward since October.      ""Since the end of last year bitcoin has displayed a pretty tight correlation with base metals as both act as risk on inflation hedges with appealing long term growth stories,"" the analysts wrote.      Goldman's analysts said cryptocurrencies are uniquely sensitive to sudden, investor- and influencer-driven price movements. They pointed to Ripple's XRP token, which tanked as word of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's unregistered securities lawsuit began to spread (the price has largely recovered, however).

Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) gave 19% upside for SQ and upgraded its price target to $305 from $257, predicting the company would ""outperform"" (roughly equivalent to buy).

42433723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP3dZh,1614193758,"BitcoinPaperWallet ‘Back Door’ Responsible for Millions in Missing Funds, Research Suggests","BitcoinPaperWallet.com appears to feature a back door in its code that shares private keys for its paper wallets with anyone who has access to the website’s backend.  CoinDesk has spoken to BitcoinPaperWallet users who collectively claim to have lost millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.  Blockchain analysis shows these funds flowing to Binance and Poloniex exchanges.  The unfortunate scenario is a reminder that, in most cases, web-based bitcoin wallet generators should be avoided in favor of vetted bitcoin wallet software and hardware.    It was just past midnight on Jan. 7, 2021, when “Nick Wendell” (a pseudonym) lost half a million dollars in bitcoin.      Bitcoin’s price was roaring toward $40,000, and Wendell was moving some of his bitcoin to a paper wallet generated by BitcoinPaperWallet.com. These wallets allow you to store your private key on a pdf that can then be printed out or saved as a computer file.      Within a minute of depositing 14.5 BTC, worth over $500,000 at the time (and now worth over $700,000), it was all gone. Someone had swept the funds from Wendell’s wallet and, after playing blockchain hopscotch across multiple addresses, sent them to the Binance exchange.      The situation sent Wendell’s world spinning.      “Within one minute I realized what happened and it felt like I was falling but [wouldn’t] hit the ground for several minutes. I remember walking in circles around the kitchen as if I were dizzy,” Wendell told CoinDesk.      Wendell is one of at least half a dozen users who claim to have lost dizzying sums to the paper wallet. A quick Google search reveals posts on Reddit, Bitcointalk and elsewhere that tell several individual accounts of a multi-million dollar collective heist: Someone with access to the site appears to be filching user funds through a back door in the code that gives them access to private keys.      In fact, some users of the most popular bitcoin paper wallet generator on Google’s search ranking claim to have collectively lost millions of dollars worth of bitcoin over the past two years, CoinDesk has learned.      It’s poetic if tragic that something called a ""paper wallet"" is so fragile. While it might seem sensible to store your bitcoin offline on a slip of paper or a USB drive to protect it from hackers, doing so can be fraught with risk.    Read more: New to Bitcoin? Stay Safe and Avoid These Common Scams    Before loss or degradation, a couple of risks associated with storing bitcoin this way, the primary concern is private key generation – in other words, how you are creating your private keys. If you’re using a third-party software to generate a paper wallet, you’re trusting that the generator creates the private key securely.      If the software isn’t honest, then your wallet is vulnerable at its core.    The BitcoinPaperWallet.com back door    According to security researchers, BitcoinPaperWallet.com sends a copy of every private key it generates on behalf of its users to the site’s servers. Whoever has access to the BitcoinPaperWallet’s back end can then access these keys and steal the funds associated with wallets generated on the site.      Colin and Bryan Aulds, two brothers who run the PrivacyPros blog, nearly purchased the website last year. But after they were tipped off to the series of heists during the negotiation process, they began investigating it for fraud and published their findings on their blog.      If you have the MetaMask or MyEtherWallet (MEW) extensions installed on your computer, the app will automatically redirect you to a page warning you that BitcoinPaperWallet.com unsafe. According to MetaMask, the site is registered on their “domain warning list” because “it has been explicitly identified as a malicious site.""      In May of last year, Ethereum wallet provider MyCrypto released a video and tweet thread warning about a “vulnerability” in BitcoinPaperWallet which creates “a back door that leaves you at risk of your funds being stolen.”      The Aulds brothers mention that the code for this particular exploit no longer exists in BitcoinPaperWallet’s build. But something new has replaced it and people are still losing money because ""someone is actively changing [the back door] once the current exploit is published widely,"" Bryan Aulds told CoinDesk.      CoinDesk spoke with some of the wallet's victims. One, who asked to remain anonymous, had made incremental deposits into his wallet throughout August 2020. On the 21st of the month, his funds were gone, on their way to the Binance exchange.      “I mistook it for another legit website that I had used years ago. Basically, I googled 'Bitcoin paper wallet' and this scam comes up first,” they told CoinDesk.      Another victim interviewed by CoinDesk lost 50.1 BTC in December. The person deposited funds into a wallet generated by the website, went to get a COVID-19 test and came back to find an empty wallet address.      Still another, who also asked to remain anonymous, lost 1.8 BTC in May 2019. One user on Reddit reported losing BCH to the site as well.    How does the exploit work?    When you create a bitcoin wallet, you have to generate a private key that gives you access to and control over the wallet. To do this, most wallet softwares use a random number generator that multiplies one really long random number by another to generate a private key.      One Reddit user, Senor_Curioso, diagnosed how BitcoinPaperWallet’s key generation process appears to be used to steal funds in this Reddit thread. Per the explanation, the wallet generator automatically creates the seed for you when you load it up.      “When you load the wallet generator from the server, it dynamically embeds 60 random number seeds which hide in the HTML as ‘test keys,’” Curioso said.      Curioso told CoinDesk the test key is, in fact, the wallet’s private key.      When you generate one of BitcoinPaperWallet’s wallets to create the private key yourself, you have to move your mouse across a pop-up window to create the ‘randomness’ needed to generate a cryptographically secure key.    Read more: The Math Behind the Bitcoin Protocol    But “when the generator makes your wallets,” Curioso explained, “the cryptographically secure random seed you made by moving your mouse around is ignored. Instead, those ‘test keys’ are used as seeds to generate predictable public and private keys. … The proof: If you eliminate all but one of the ‘test keys’ in the HTML code, the wallet will simply generate the same private and public key over and over. There is no randomness.”      Since these keys are likely saved on BitcoinPaperWallet’s server, anyone who has access to the site’s backend can sweep them at will, he concluded.      A developer for PrivacyPros vetted Curioso’s findings and confirmed the presence of the back door code. He added that the test_key code for generating the private key behind a user’s back “isn’t present in the source code” on the BitcoinPaperWallet’s Github originally authored by its creator; the back door code had been added at a later date.      Dustin Dettmer, an independent Bitcoin developer and researcher, verified the findings as well.    Who owns BitcoinPaperWallet?    Up until 2018, BitcoinPaperWallet was owned and operated by Canton Becker, but it was sold to Sarkis Sarkissian in April of that year.      It wasn’t until after the sale that people began reporting losses from wallets generated on the site. Before the shadow play, one source commented, the wallet generator “was a well-known and trusted website used by the Bitcoin community.”      There’s no way to attribute the alleged thefts to any one person with certainty, but that person would have required access to the website’s code in order to sweep the funds. Unlike a phishing scam, where an outsider tricks you into revealing your private key or sending funds to the wrong address, this back door is internal to BitcoinPaperWallet's design.      One user told CoinDesk he lost 22.5 BTC to the website in mid 2018. By early 2019, others on social media began reporting stolen funds (one of whom lost 22.15 BTC).      When CoinDesk reached out to Sarkissian to request comment on the back door in the wallet’s code, he attributed the losses to “users who never had proper key management in the first place.”      “Indeed, we've received complaints from users who claim to have lost their bitcoin using our website. Those complaints are always resolved except for a select few who cannot fathom it was their own fault and must place the blame on us.”      When asked again to clarify if he knew of a back door in his wallet generator’s code, Sarkissian said, “We have searched our source code for the issues present in those documents and we cannot reproduce the same results. Our servers and source code has been verified clean by [our security expert Jonel Richard]. He is still on retainer and continues to investigate, trying to reproduce the issue found by others.”      CoinDesk reached out to Richard to ask for a copy of his analysis but did not hear back by press time.      Both Wendell and another victim have filed police reports with their respective police departments but nothing has come of the investigations thus far.    BitcoinPaperWallet scams larger holders    BitcoinPaperWallet appears to have featured flawed code since at least the middle of 2018, so how did it go under the radar for so long?      It seems the thief only drained high-value bitcoin wallets or those with at least 1 BTC deposited, not pocket change or smaller sums. According to social media and first-hand accounts, the culprit has stolen at least 124.85 BTC valued at roughly $6.2 million at today’s prices.    Read more: Multi-signature Wallets Can Keep Your Coins Safer (if You Use Them Right)    BitcoinPaperWallet’s back door is a reminder that, for small or large amounts, storing your bitcoin on a wallet generated from a website is probably not a good idea. In fact, unless you know what you’re doing and generate the paper wallet yourself from scratch, you should just stick with a hardware wallet from a well-known, verified manufacturer and, if you can, secure your funds with a multisignature wallet.      “It is critical wallet generation be completed by a trusted manufacturer in an entirely offline process,” Dettmer told CoinDesk. “You should think of websites, your computer, and the internet generally as trying to voyeuristically get a peek at your seed. Because sometimes they are — and they can steal your entire balance if they succeed.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | BNB,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/24/bitcoinpaperwallet-back-door-responsible-for-millions-in-missing-funds-research-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1b36d0cb273cb410363a4ad72af86d45280147b-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP3dVh,1614193171,Planning to Short Bitcoin? Better Check China’s ‘Tether Premium’ First,"Bitcoin’s rapid recovery from the biggest two-day sell-off in almost a year shows the power of a recently overlooked factor in cryptocurrency markets: demand from Chinese retail traders.      Prices for the largest cryptocurrency were higher on Wednesday, stabilizing around $49,000, after tumbling 15% in the prior two days.      The sudden demand for bitcoin (BTC) from Chinese traders, possibly motivated by the price drop, can be viewed through a hitherto largely ignored metric: the “tether premium” – or the difference between prices quoted in yuan on the dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT) by over-the-counter cryptocurrency traders, and the implied yuan-denominated price for tether based on the prevailing rate in global markets.      Under normal market conditions, tether should have depreciated against the yuan because the Chinese currency was appreciating against the dollar in foreign-exchange markets. However, tether denominated in Chinese yuan has traded at a premium since last week, ostensibly due to elevated demand from the country's traders, who routinely use the stablecoin as an on-ramp to crypto markets. The practice of trading directly from government-issued currencies is still banned in China.      “More Chinese investors have begun to enter the market, even though the bull market since 2020 has been mainly driven by U.S.-based institutional investors,” Flex Yang, founder and chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, told CoinDesk. “Chinese investors, especially those with very little bitcoin exposure, are now looking for channels to buy bitcoin. And buying bitcoin through USDT is the most direct channel, which led to an increased demand for USDT in the [over-the-counter] market.”      Tether has been sold at premium on Huobi OTC since last Friday, according to a spokesperson from the parent crypto exchange Huobi. The premium went as high as 2% on Tuesday. Under normal market conditions, the premium is zero or negligible.      “As people rush into the market in a bull run, the demand for USDT rises significantly,” Ciara Sun, vice president of Huobi Global Markets, told CoinDesk. “OTC merchants will also take the opportunity to raise prices that are far beyond the exchange rate.”      At OKEx, another Asia-focused cryptocurrency exchange, its over-the-counter desk also saw rising prices for tether, when denominated in Chinese yuan.      “Some traders are buying tether in order to buy the general dip in the market,” said Robbie Liu, a market analyst at OKEx Insights.      Liu said the so-called tether premium doesn’t simply imply rising demand for cryptocurrencies from new investors because during a volatile market many experienced traders will buy more tether to maintain margin requirements on leveraged positions.      The renewed interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from the retail market in China, which was the main driver of the last crypto bull market in 2017, might stem from mainstream media coverage in China, said Mable Jiang, partner at crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital. She pointed out that people in China have been buying the market dip in the past few days.      In a rare report on Sunday, CCTV 2, the state-controlled finance television channel, gave an update on the bitcoin market, claiming the cryptocurrency’s return since March 2020 has surpassed 1,300%. The stated performance record reflects what is perhaps the most bullish framing of bitcoin’s price run because it uses last year’s lows as the starting point and goes through the recent all-time high price above $58,000. But it’s not wrong.      The TV channel’s report continued by elaborating on Bill Gates’ changing attitude towards bitcoin (he’s neutral now instead of negative) and ARK Investment’s Cathie Wood’s support of bitcoin.      “As bitcoin continues rising, more and more corporates have announced that they are considering bitcoin as part of their asset allocation,” the news anchor said on CCTV 2.

42433717,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP3dLh,1614192713,Craig Wright Demands Bitcoin Developers Give Him Access to Stolen Mt. Gox Coins,"Craig Wright’s legal pursuits have leapfrogged from threatening to sue Bitcoin contributors over their hosting the Bitcoin white paper to a legal threat that sets his sights on bitcoin connected to the Mt. Gox hack.      The Bitcoin SV progenitor and self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator sent a Letter Before Action to Bitcoin Core contributors this week through his law firm, Ontier LLP. In the letter, Wright’s Tulip Trading Ltd. (TTL) demands access to two wallets that contain 31,000 and 79,957 BTC.      The larger wallet, curiously, is connected to the hack that drained 800,000 BTC from the world’s then most-popular bitcoin exchange in 2014. Wright claims the bitcoin in the wallets were stolen from him last year.      Even though Bitcoin Core contributors have no control over the network’s wallets, Wright wants Bitcoin’s developers to hand him the keys.      “In accordance with their fiduciary duties,” the letter reads, “each of the Developers is obliged to: a. Provide access and control to TTL of the BTC in the Addresses, which it owns but cannot access or control due to the hack/theft. b. Take all reasonable steps to ensure that TTL has access to and control of the BTC in the Addresses.”      The letter alleges that “on or around 5 February 2020, unknown hackers stole the private keys for the Addresses and deleted copies of the keys on Dr Craig Wright’s computer, preventing him from accessing the digital assets at those Addresses, which he operated on behalf of TTL.”    'Doomed to failure'    Craig Wright has made repeated headlines for his unsubstantiated claim that he is Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and he has even sued those who have challenged this claim. Most recently, he threatened to sue for copyright infringement Bitcoin Core contributors who hosted Bitcoin’s white paper.    Read more: Bitcoin.org Rebuts Craig Wright’s ‘Meritless’ Copyright Claim on Bitcoin White Paper    Ontier LLP says the letter could materialize into legal action if the recipients do not comply. However, the request in the letter – for Bitcoin developers to seize funds in Bitcoin addresses they don’t own – is literally impossible. To seize these funds would require forking Bitcoin's codebase into a new network and ""unlocking"" Satoshi's coins on the forked chain. But this forked chain would be an entirely new network with an entirely new coin, not the bitcoin trading above $50,000.      For myriad reasons, Stephen Palley, a partner at Anderson Kill law firm, told CoinDesk “a lawsuit like this is doomed to failure.”      “While I can’t speak to English law, the notion that a bunch of open-source developers will be compelled to fork public blockchains and require miners and nodes to adopt the fork so that Wright can receive funds that he claims were stolen is, in my opinion, not credible. [It] will do nothing more than force people to pay legal fees – all of which are likely going to be owed by Wright.”      Palley, whose firm is not involved in this lawsuit, said the claim that open-source developers owe Wright fiduciary obligations and damages for losses in absence of a contract “is novel and faces considerable legal and factual problems.”      “I can tell you with near certainty that any judgment in that case would not be enforceable in the U.S. And I doubt it will get very far in English courts either. I’m hopeful that the Bitcoin community will come together as it has in the past and provide support to any developer who has received these letters. We’ve already heard from some people who are outraged by this maneuver and expect to hear from more,” Palley concluded.

You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At stake  A big day for bitcoin balance sheets    MicroStrategy purchased another $1.026 billion in bitcoin Wednesday, bringing its total hoard to 90,531 BTC, worth some $4.78 billion. The business intelligence company, which is now better known for its bitcoin evangelism than its actual products, issued zero-interest debt to finance the purchase – in some sense making it a de facto bitcoin exchange-traded fund. CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson gives an overview of CEO Michael Saylor’s increasingly bombastic bitcoin pitch.      Square also bought more bitcoin, paying approximately $170 million for 3,318 BTC. It executed the deal with an average price per coin of $51,235.70, meaning the investment is in the red. It should be said, MicroStrategy’s most recent BTC allocation is also worth less than the dollars invested.      Why does this matter? Square putting 5% of its balance sheet into bitcoin is a huge vote of confidence for the asset. However, as CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo notes, buying at market tops could prove JPMorgan’s theory that few non-crypto companies are likely to follow in MicroStrategy, Telsa or Square's footsteps given bitcoin’s volatility.      Still, as Square proved, there are ways to make money with bitcoin that don’t involve direct investment. The revenue it made from selling bitcoin on Cash App swelled to $4.57 billion in 2020, clocking $97 million in gross profit.    Other stories    Alameda Research is leading a $40 million investment into Oxygen, a Solana-based platform that aims to become a Robinhood for decentralized finance (DeFi). Multicoin, CoinDesk sister company Genesis Capital and CMS joined the round. The platform will be integrated into the Google Maps alternative Maps.me, in which Alameda has previously invested. CoinDesk’s Ian Allison dives in.      CoinShares has launched a new Ethereum exchange-traded product (ETP), with each share backed by .03 ETH. The EPT will trade on the Swiss SIX exchange and already has around $75 million in assets under management (AUM).      NFTs are having a moment and causing confusion as to what exactly these tokens are. CoinDesk’s Brady Dale explains the tech behind the trend. People have paid $600,000 for a Nyan Cat NFT and over $1 million for a CryptoPunk, but in most cases, the image or media being represented doesn’t live on the blockchain – meaning those files could be taken offline. Stakeholders are working on solutions to the issue, though the industry has yet to settle on best practices.      Canadian bank VersaBank will soon launch a stablecoin for commercial use. In what’s claimed as a first, the VCAD stablecoin is issued and backed by deposits at a North American bank and will be redeemable for Canadian dollars.

Chainlink has unveiled its newest Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) upgrade, the network’s largest overhaul since it went live on Ethereum in 2019, a blog post shared with CoinDesk claims. Data was formerly aggregated on-chain, which increased overhead on node operators, not to mention data availability inefficiencies given the rise of on-chain congestion, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.      “OCR is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core client run by Chainlink nodes,” the blog post states. “The most immediate benefit to DeFi and its users will be a 10x increase in the amount of real-world data that can be made available to smart contract applications.”      OCR was co-developed by Chainlink Labs’ academic cast headed by Cornell computer scientist Ari Juels, former IBM head of research Christian Cachin and former BitGo CTO Ben Chan.      The new update – which has already been deployed for the ETH/USD and LINK/USD pricing feeds – aggregates data from disparate reporters on the Chainlink network. Each node signs off on its data source before committing the info to the on-chain contract which is pushed to subscribing applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.      “The initial versions of Chainlink did aggregation on-chain. And they did that on-chain because we knew we could rely on the consensus of the chain,” Nazarov said. Yet, on-chain aggregation becomes more inefficient as consumer demand increases application data needs, he added.      Chainlink states the update will also necessarily drop the data provider’s gas usage per average transaction on the Ethereum network. That’s a boon for DeFi apps subscribing to Chainlink given each call costs fractions of ether called gwei. Gas fees are currently at historic highs with an average transaction surpassing $40 Tuesday, according to Blockchair.      Not only will the update lessen congestion on Ethereum, but it should decrease call latency, Nazarov said.      “Really what OCR does is take the computation we were doing on-chain and porting it out to an off-chain environment, and that is creating a very large 10x increase in efficiency, which means we can put a lot more data on-chain,” Nazarov said.",POSITIVE,ETH | LINK,ETH | LINK | ZRX | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/24/chainlink-promises-10x-data-with-new-off-chain-reporting-overhaul,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/824a2f50435e9f48bb9c462e5e7c7c58f898d807-1500x763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433725,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP3ddh,1614176879,Does Crypto Fix the 'Robinhood' Problem? Not So Fast,"U.S. congressional hearings investigating the rise and fall of GameStop's stock didn’t yield much that was new. However, we did learn just how eager legislators were to grill both Wall Street and Silicon Valley at the same time: Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) actually interrupted Robinhood CEO Vlaimir Tenev's opening statement.      Legislative animus against technology and finance looks like a bad sign for crypto assets, which still exist somewhat in regulatory limbo. Except that what went wrong with Robinhood and GameStop in January has been remedied on crypto exchanges – superficially, anyway. Consider:    Robinhood stopped trading in GameStop stock because of the margin requirements of the clearinghouses – middlemen on which it depends (not because of collusion with hedge funds, as many suspected). As GameStop’s stock price spiraled up, the risk that counterparties wouldn’t be able to fulfill their sides of trades went up right alongside it. The clearinghouses' margin requirements – the cash Robinhood, as a brokerage, must keep on deposit to cover those risks – ballooned. Most crypto exchanges don’t use clearinghouses or brokerages, allowing the investor to interact directly with the exchange.  The risk that halted GameStop trading exists due to two-day (T+2) settlement terms for equity trades. Crypto assets settle in a matter of hours or minutes.    Bitcoin was designed as a peer-to-peer system, eliminating middlemen. But even crypto's middlemen are pioneers. The exchanges on which bitcoin and other crypto assets trade represent market structure innovations that address some of the problems that brought Robinhood to the U.S. Capitol (via videoconference, of course). However, to really solve those problems, crypto exchanges would need to be able to process transactions effectively, including and especially when there's an unusually large volume of them.      As we will see, that isn't the case.      The first chart shows the TradeBlock XBX bitcoin price for the year to date. (The XBX is a bitcoin reference rate that benchmarks billions in assets under management. TradeBlock is a subsidiary of CoinDesk.) The vertical lines signify outages on three major crypto exchanges, as reported by Downdetector, an outage monitoring service. Coinbase and Kraken are two of the four exchanges currently used to calculate the XBX price, and therefore represent two of the most liquid markets accessible to U.S. investors. (The other two are Bitstamp and LMAX Digital; the former had no reported outages, and the latter isn't covered via Downdetector, though status report history provided on LMAX Digital's site indicates no unplanned outages so far in 2021.) Binance is included as an example of a highly liquid bitcoin market that isn’t accessible to U.S. investors.      There are five dates on which multiple exchanges suffered reported outages. All of them coincide with significant price movements. One possible exception is Jan. 28, when all three had reported outages, and Jan. 29, when Coinbase and Kraken did. The XBX bitcoin-dollar price did not move as dramatically on those dates as it did around Jan. 7, Jan. 11 and Feb. 8, the other dates of multiple reported outages. However, bitcoin at that point was beginning a rally that followed a brief dip below $30,000 on Jan. 27. The following chart shows how volumes responded on the two XBX exchanges.      The five multi-exchange outage dates occur on or adjacent to four out of the five highest-volume periods of the year through Feb. 15. The inevitable conclusion: When investors want most to trade, some of the most liquid exchanges are unavailable.      Another thing this chart shows is how volume on crypto exchanges now surges when the price moves drastically in either direction. This is normal in traditional markets, but in crypto's 2017 bull market, volume tended to rise and fall with the price.      One factor that likely contributes to that market maturity is the increasing participation of institutional investors. Crypto exchanges like LMAX Digital are exclusively open to institutions and high-net-worth investors. Meanwhile, exchanges like Coinbase serve a mixed bag of retail and institutions. Days on which their volumes move differently may indicate days when one segment or another of the market is in control. Here’s a look at how that played out this year so far:      The chart shows each day's volume variance from the previous seven days' average volume. It's noteworthy how institutions' market activity, proxied here via LMAX Digital volume, records its largest increases (triple-digit percentages) at times when the bitcoin price rises across the $40,000 price threshold, as on Jan. 8 and again on Feb. 8.      Back to the Robinhood hearings. We heard Robinhood’s Tenev advocate for an end to T+2 settlement. However, as my colleague Noelle Acheson pointed out last summer, delayed settlement may be more a feature than a bug, when investors trade on credit and have capital committed elsewhere.      And that exposes another difference between traditional financial markets and crypto markets: Trading on credit is for the most part not available in crypto, representing a potential obstacle to institutional participation. In traditional markets, this may be the real ""Robin Hood"" problem because institutions trade on credit while retail investors must fund their brokerage accounts (and often wait days for a bank transfer to clear) before trading.      It's an issue that Robinhood the company attempts to address by allowing users to trade instantly on transfers of up to $10,000. In crypto, the equivalency is flipped: Offshore exchanges, where most institutions cannot trade, allow individuals to fund an account with bitcoin or the stablecoin tether and trade instantly in large amounts, often offering 100x margin and beyond. Whether that's responsible or not, the ways crypto exchanges are managing counterparty risk are innovative.      ""Bitcoin fixes this"" has become an ironic meme. How much more ironic if the centralized services, built to handle bitcoin, are where the seeds of market structure innovation are being nourished?      Clarification (Feb. 25): An earlier version of this article stated that LMAX Digital downtime data were not available. A clarification has been added to note that they are not available via Downdetector.

42433718,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP3dNh,1614175200,New Social Media Platform Instars Leverages Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography,"Partisia Blockchain, a Web 3.0 platform, and Insights Network, a market research firm, have partnered to launch Instars, a decentralized and privacy-focused social media platform.      A release regarding the launch claims it will be the first integration of blockchain and multiparty computation to protect privacy on a social media platform.      Earlier this month, Partisia Blockchain received a €120K grant (approximately US$145.7K) from the European Union-funded Next Generation Internet Trust (NGI Trust) to work on a new alternative search engine to those like Google that would be more private and have fewer ads.      “It took the last several years of intense development work in partnership with some of the world's leading cryptographers at Partisia Blockchain to create a complete end-to-end solution combining MPC and blockchain,” said Brian Gallagher, co-founder and CEO of Insights Network in an email. “We couldn't be more excited to finally roll out our social platform that transfers all of the economic benefit to the user base rather than centralized tech giants.”    What is MPC?    Multiparty Computation (MPC) is basically the computer invented again as a decentralized encrypted computer, according to Kurt Nielsen, co-founder and president of Partisia Blockchain.      It allows for large pools of data to stay encrypted while permitting information to be extracted from those data pools using encrypted computations.      CoinDesk’s Chief Content Officer Michael Casey described the process in relation to it being used by the cryptocurrency wallet ZenGo:      “With this approach, multiple non-trusting computers can each conduct computation on their own unique fragments of a larger data set to collectively produce a desired common outcome without any one node knowing the details of the others’ fragments.”    Read more: SecretSwap Is the Secret Network’s Answer to DeFi Privacy    Nielsen said a common explanation of MPC for a general audience uses the ""millionaires problem."" Using MPC, for example, several individuals could submit their bank account details into a secret ""pool"" of data. You would be able to determine who is the wealthiest of the group, without knowing anything about the contents or details of everyone in the pool's financial information, because of MPC.      This is one of the many examples of various cryptographic techniques that have found additional traction with the rise of cryptocurrencies and shows how they can spill over into other use cases.      “For the social media industry, this creates a new age system where data no longer has to be siloed in centralized servers, and each user’s information is fully exposed to whoever owns the server (for example, Facebook),” said Nielsen. “Rather, each user's device can hold all of their demographic and profile data locally and fully encrypted.”      Using MPC, this data can still be targeted by advertisers, but in a way where the users’ sensitive information is kept personal, on their own device, and they're able to consent and opt into each attempt at an advertisement from the requesting parties.    Read more: Google Down: The Perils of Centralization    The problem of centralization extends beyond social media, with centralized repositories of information, whether that be social media companies, health care providers, or even the federal government becoming a target for actors that want the information they have.    Instars    Instars, the social media platform launched today, gives users the choice to opt into every interaction, rather than having to opt-out of certain features as most social media platforms require now. In doing so, “users receive instant, direct economic benefit in the form of INSTAR tokens deposited to their personal wallet from advertisers who want to reach and engage them,” said Nielsen.      Users can also be awarded in DAI, EOS, and USDC.      Neilson contends it's also better for advertisers, as they now have direct engagement with their audience rather than simple clicks and views.      Instars uses smart contracts on the Instars blockchain to create a direct connection between a requester, such as an advertiser, and users of the network. Cryptocurrency is held in the smart contract, and then paid directly to the users' Instar wallet when they view an ad or complete a targeted survey.      “Partisia Blockchain's MPC technology is used to create ""matches"" between these requesters and providers, by first encrypting users' profile data locally on their devices, such as on their android, rather than on a centralized server,” said Nielsen.    Read more: Brave Browser Was Exposing Addresses in Tor Mode for Months    Integrating MPC technology also means advertisers can poll the devices connected to the network and find matches without ever needing to know the users' actual profile data information.      When matches are created, economic value is transferred directly to the user, rather than the centralized company, like Facebook, which takes all of the ad revenue from the platform, according to Nielsen.      The idea of data sovereignty and giving people control over their data is one that has percolated throughout the world of crypto and blockchain. A number of projects have worked to address it, with debates playing out about how much an individual’s data is actually worth, versus aggregate user data that social media companies offer up to advertisers.    INSTAR token    INSTAR is integrated throughout the platform. Users can include an INSTAR tip when sending a friend request or charge an INSTAR entrance fee for a private group. In order to “like” someone’s post, a user will have to tip with INSTAR.      Built into the smart contracts are also savings incentives, according to Nielsen, such as automated APR on your cryptocurrency when it is staked to the blockchain.    Read more: Duality Technologies Launches Platform for Analyzing Big Data While Keeping It Private    There are already a number of decentralized social media networks out there such as Twetch, Mastodon and others, but the addition of MPC tech in this instance creates an interesting model for protecting user data while offering an incentive to advertisers.      “It will be quite an experiment and we hope people will take notice and give it a try,” said Gallagher. “Many people complain about the censorship by Big Tech, the de-platforming, the abusive targeting and use of our data, yet the daily active user numbers continue to increase across all of these platforms. It's going to take a paradigm shift and people to switch platforms for any real change to come.

42433715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP3dDh,1614174600,Opera Adds In-Browser Crypto Options With Simplex Integration,"Opera, an online browser that claims to prioritize user privacy, has partnered with crypto-to-fiat onramp provider and payment processor Simplex to offer a crypto onramp for users of the browser.      A crypto on-ramp is basically an exchange or similar service that lets users pay fiat for crypto and is an important first step for newer crypto users. The move comes as bitcoin and cryptocurrencies generally have seen large financial institutions get involved and exponential price increases in 2021.      The result of the integration is that users will be able to buy and sell a range of cryptocurrencies quickly within the Opera browser.      The biggest takeaway for current Opera and Simplex users is that it makes on-ramping more accessible, according to Rachel Siegman, head of marketing at Simplex.      “Current Opera users can on-ramp using their debit or credit card with Simplex and Simplex users can now use the secure and instant payments on Opera,” she said in an email.    Opera browser    Initially released in 1995, Opera is one of the oldest continuously developed browsers in the world today and features a built-in VPN and ad blocker.      Read more: Opera’s Built-In Crypto Wallets Have 170K Monthly Active Users      In 2018, it launched Web 3.0 support, a decentralized application (dapp) explorer and its native crypto wallet in Opera for Android, making it one of the first Web 3.0- and blockchain-ready browsers. Opera’s wallet currently supports ETH, BTC and tron. Simplex will make it easier to buy major coins such as BTC and ETH. Now users can go into the Opera browser app, select what crypto they want and choose ""buy,"" selecting Simplex, according to Siegman.      Opera currently has over 380 million users worldwide.    Simplex    Launched in 2014, Israel-based payments processor Simplex became a principal member of the Visa network in December, meaning the company has permission to issue Visa debit cards, giving its consumers access to digital currencies daily.

Last month, licensed by the European Union, Simplex also launched Simplex Banking, which works with its partner network “to enable users to buy crypto with a range of local and global payment methods and convert it back into fiat in a bank account,” according to a statement on the release.      “It’s completely secure, and using Simplex's fraud-free network helps all users, throughout the world, enjoy the market dips immediately,” said Siegman of the Opera browser partnership.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/24/opera-adds-in-browser-crypto-options-with-simplex-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d39cf08c7454a1211dfe1b428fafb99cc824b742-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CEO Michael Saylor's business intelligence firm bought the 19,452 BTC at an average price of $52,765 per coin. It now holds 90,531 BTC worth $4.78 billion at press time, almost certainly bolstering its perception among Wall Street types as a de-facto bitcoin exchange-traded fund, albeit one wildly overpricedhttps://news.yahoo.com/microstrategy-add-bitcoin-widening-premium-194220225.html.    The latest buy, MicroStrategy's single-largest dollar investment in the crypto, is second only to Tesla's $1.5 billion investment on the list of (known) bitcoin allocations by a U.S. company. MicroStrategy was already and will likely remain the non-crypto firm with the biggest bitcoin bags as CEO Michael Saylor continues to pursue a coin acquisition strategy now codified in the business intelligence company's mission.      Led by Saylor's increasingly creative bitcoin evangelism (the longtime tech CEO now reframes famous cultural and historical quotes through crypto-colored lenses) MicroStrategy has become the chief proponent of corporate investments in bitcoin.      Saylor has fully steeped himself in bitcoin's swirling meme culture. He added laser eyes to his Twitter profile in apparent unity with the #LaserRayUntil100K movement last week. On occasion he trolls gold as an inferior reserve asset. He has shown a penchant for Lord of The Rings content, liking memes in praise of the ""One Coin to Rule Them All"" and retweeting videos in which he is Gandalf, leading the Rohirrim into battle against evil, evil fiat.      The CEO is certainly angling to rally his corporate brethren under the Bitcoin Standard; he's doing so with some success. Just days before Tesla poured $1.5 billion into bitcoin, a CoinDesk reporter spotted the senior director of corporate treasury for fellow Elon Musk enterprise SpaceX on the attendee list of MicroStrategy's bitcoin-heavy annual conference. Musk and Saylor had previously plodded through bitcoin topics on Twitter.      Indeed, the company reimagined its annual client conference earlier this month into a corporate bitcoin how-to complete with a stream of crypto services providers ready to sign companies on as bitcoiners-to-be. For its part, MicroStrategy has gone with Coinbase.      MicroStrategy's practice of issuing zero-coupon convertibles as a cash-raising mechanism is in line with that strategy. Investors in this latest round of convertible senior notes have been promised a 50% premium on MicroStrategy's Feb. 16, 2021, share price of $955.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/24/microstrategy-bets-another-1b-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56619c1083405511fee0da40afb0b04c732a7247-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433701,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2Dth,1614169800,The ‘Unique Opportunity’ to Upgrade Ethereum’s Virtual Stack,"With Eth 2.0’s first hard fork spec mapped out, attention has turned to the planned merge of Eth 1.x and Ethereum 2.0.      And, not wanting to lose momentum around the merge, Vitalik Buterin has proposed making some additional changes to the network, given most people don’t see Ethereum changing much afterward (minus some cleanup, more shards and, of course, our new favorite Ethereum word, rollups).      In two blog posts and on Friday’s All Core Developers call, Buterin made the case for stripping less useful – or maybe even harmful – functions in Ethereum’s codebank sometime before or during the merge. Buterin mainly focused on opcodes used in Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM).      “We have a unique opportunity to make some backwards-incompatible changes to the EVM that could be valuable for Ethereum in the long term,” Buterin said on GitHub Feb. 18. “The portion of applications that would need to be rewritten as a result of these changes is quite small, but it is nevertheless nonzero.”    Making changes to the EVM    Chief on that list is the SELFDESTRUCT function which rewards anyone who destroys a contract sitting idly on the Ethereum state. The intended purpose of the opcode was to incentivize Ethereum developers to practice “good hygiene” and destroy contracts when they weren’t necessary anymore. That would help reduce Ethereum’s long-term state size.      However, it hasn’t really panned out like that. Right now the function stands in the way of scaling Ethereum by making it “difficult to move to a different state storage format in the future,” among other reasons, Buterin said.      In fact, many people use the function as a discount of sorts in case Ethereum’s fees rise. Called gas tokens, these tokens can be bought when gas is cheap and spent later when gas is expensive to help lower the cost of a transaction. Ethereum developers have considered removing the opcode from the EVM a few times, most recently in September.      Making changes to the EVM or any other technical descriptions in the Ethereum Yellow Paper has not made everyone happy. Some decentralized application (dapp) creators expressed frustration that functions their projects rely on may be removed, such as the gas that enables dapps to check in on how much gwei is left in a contract execution.      It’s unclear how much support the EVM cleanup pitch will receive. Moreover, any changes to the EVM will come with ample warnings beforehand, Buterin said.      “The overwhelming majority of applications are not dependent on anything that is expected to break here,” Buterin said. “It's a very small percentage.”    Pulse check: The CoinDesk legend of Zelda begins    The CoinDesk Ethereum 2.0 validator, officially dubbed “Zelda” by Director of Engineering Spencer Beggs, was activated on Feb. 17. Over the past six days or so, Zelda has earned 0.04 ETH, which is worth roughly $61.80 at time of writing. At this rate, the annual percentage return (APR) of our validator operations is expected to be around 7%.      If you’re new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about jargon and terminology used throughout this newsletter.      In the first couple of hours after Zelda was activated on Ethereum 2.0, our validator operations lost roughly $3.45 worth of ether. This was due to a file permissions issue that prevented Zelda from signing off on attestations, which is the most common responsibility required of an Eth 2.0 validator node. (The other less-common responsibility is proposing blocks.)      Updating file permissions and rebooting Zelda was a simple fix that got our validator operations back in the green within 24 hours.    Setting up a validator? Keep these points in mind    The first lesson learned from this minor mishap was this: Remember to stay awake for the activation of your validator node to ensure all operations are running smoothly from the get-go.      Most validators after they have deposited their 32 ETH to the Eth 2.0 deposit contract will be put in a pending queue before they’re activated on the network and able to earn rewards. The amount of time needed for validators to wait in the queue before activation can range from a few days to a couple weeks.      Rough estimates of the exact day and time a validator will exit the queue, based on how many other validators are also waiting in the line for activation, can be found on block explorers BeaconScan and Beaconcha.in.      Unfortunately, Zelda’s activation took place at roughly 4:00 (ET) in the morning, which is why most of the CoinDesk staff, including myself, were asleep. Had any one of us been awake for the activation of the node, any irregularities in our operations could have been noticed in advance and resolved more quickly.      Another important thing to remember is to keep validator operations as simple as possible. About 132 validators have been slashed since the network launched on Dec. 1, 2020. Being slashed on Eth 2.0 carries more consequences than missing out on a few attestations. Slashing occurs when there’s evidence of malicious behavior by a validator. The network can correctly or mistakenly view the actions of a validator as a potential attack or attempt to rewrite blockchain history and data. This results in the validator being forced to exit the network, meaning it is no longer eligible to earn rewards on Eth 2.0.      Slashing happens commonly when Eth 2.0 validator operators are trying to maximize rewards by setting up two computers to run one validator. When one of the computers goes offline, the other automatically boots up and takes over validator operations. While this sounds like a perfect idea to maximize APR by having your validator running virtually without any downtime, it can lead to mistakes where both computers are running the same validator at the same time.      As soon as the network detects instances where a single validator is proposing different blocks or signing off on attestations more than once, operations could get slashed.      “The risk is not worth it,” said the co-lead developer of Prysmatic Labs, Raul Jordan, in an interview with CoinDesk.      While it might be tempting to try and maximize rewards by complicating the node setup so that there is never any downtime, it might come at the expense of losing the ability to earn any rewards on your staked ETH.

42433699,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2Dph,1614169453,Bitcoin Rebounds to $51K as Derivatives Market Cools Off,"Bitcoin looks to have turned the tide after suffering heavy losses earlier this week amid an over-euphoric derivatives market.      The number one cryptocurrency rose back above $50,000 early this morning, having suffered a double-digit percentage drop to as low as $45,000 from all-time highs around $58,000 around midnight UTC on Monday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Following the drop, the perpetual futures funding rate – the average cost of holding long positions on major exchanges – has declined to 0.02%. It had been signaling excess bullish leverage and scope for a price correction with a rise to a multi-month high of 0.13% earlier this month, according to data source Glassnode.      ""The funding rates have returned to neutral territory, and the market seems healthier,"" Arcane Research noted in its weekly report.      Exchanges offering perpetuals, or futures with no expiry, calculate the funding rate every eight hours. A positive funding rate implies that longs pay shorts and is reflective of bullish market positioning. Therefore, a very high funding rate is considered a sign of extreme bull sentiment, or ""froth,"" and often precedes violent price pullbacks, similar to the one seen this week.      Bitcoin's plunge to $45,000 this week triggered long liquidations worth over $2 billion, according to data source Coinalyze.      Long liquidation refers to a forced unwinding (selling) of bullish trades by exchanges, which often leads to an exaggerated price drop. Forced closure happens when the price drops beneath a predetermined limit (the liquidation price), creating a margin shortage on leveraged positions.      Essentially, over-leveraged traders have exited the market over the past two days. Hence, the chances of a deeper pullback previously anticipated by some analysts look to have dropped.      ""The decline in the funding rate will tame the selling pressure,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG, told CoinDesk. ""I am looking for consolidation between $45,000 to $50,000.""      A sharp decline in the futures premium – the spread between futures prices and spot market prices – seen over the past 48 hours also indicates that the derivatives market has cooled down.      The annualized three-month premium on the institution-focused Chicago Mercantile Exchanges has slipped to 14% from the multi-month high of 23% seen on Monday, according to data source Skew.      However, while the derivatives market has lost its froth, bitcoin may still be vulnerable to a continued rally in U.S. bond yields.      Also read: Bitcoin Retakes $50K as Powell Eases Market Jitters, Bond Yields Drop      That said, U.S. yields have come under pressure today, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets of continued monetary stimulus.

42433694,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP2DZh,1614168000,"Alameda Leads $40M Round in ‘DeFi Prime Brokerage,’ Plans Maps.me Integration","A group of crypto industry heavyweights are set on bringing the rather specialized world of decentralized finance (DeFi) to the masses.      Announced Wednesday, Alameda Research, a well-known trading firm within the crypto space, is leading a $40 million investment round in Oxygen, which aims to do for DeFi what Robinhood has done for stocks – only without the reliance on centralized legacy settlement systems. Alameda is joined by Multicoin, Genesis Capital and CMS in the round.      Oxygen is built on Solana, a blockchain that can handle 50,000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum’s 15 or so transactions per second. In a press release, Alameda said Oxygen will be integrated into Maps.me, a mobile alternative to Google Maps with about 100 million users.      Notably, Alameda led a $50 million investment in Maps.me earlier this year. Genesis and CMS also participated in that round. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)    Read more: Offline Travel App Maps.Me Raises $50M in Funding Round Led by Alameda Research    “On the back end you want the most powerful things you can have, but on the front end you want the most simple things you can have,” Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in an interview, adding:    “So all you need to show [users] of Maps.me is that if they want to lend out some dollars, they can get 12% per year. But behind it, there’s a full prime brokerage model on-chain that's capable of powering borrowing, lending, derivatives, structured products, portfolio margin and a lot of other things.”  Next-gen prime broker    “DeFi prime brokerage,” the elevator pitch for Oxygen, is almost a contradiction in terms; the white-glove service banks offer to big buy-side firms is far removed from protean lending pools of crypto, matched using Ethereum-based smart contracts.      Oxygen is not going to be prime brokerage in the sort of white-glove sense, Bankman-Fried said, but rather the protocol acts as a venue, catering to the needs of DeFi applications, financial institutions and individual users.      Those users custody their own keys to a Solana wallet, which is lending the assets on the Oxygen protocol. If they are starting out with dollars, a U.S. bank account can hook up via fintech facilitator Plaid. Thereafter a transfer to Circle's Silvergate account will result in USDC stablecoins automatically being minted on the Solana blockchain.    Read more: Interoperability Project Ren ‘Joining’ Alameda Research    “To understand where that yield is coming from,” said Bankman-Fried, “on one side you have non-crypto people lending dollars and earning interest. One the other, are people looking to invest in crypto projects. They tend to be pretty bullish and are willing to pay significant interest rates in order to have the right to get longer crypto.”    Retail assurances    All fine and well, but what about the risks associated with the Wild West of DeFi? To begin with, Oxygen.org AG is based in crypto-friendly Switzerland. It also works with a Big Four audit firm (name not disclosed) to keep an eye on how assets are handled and for general regulatory compliance.      “The places where fiat comes in and out of the system are where KYC [know-your-customer] is happening,” said Bankman-Fried. “On the safety side of things, I think one of the most remarkable things about DeFi is how little money has been lost to hacks. It's not nothing, but at like $200 million or something, it's less than a percent.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | SOL | SPONSORED | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/24/alameda-leads-40m-round-in-defi-prime-brokerage-plans-mapsme-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/347603cc8d9c2d0684e84133a0ba9220d3b9c314-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The yields came under pressure, possibly helping bitcoin scale the $50,000 mark, as Powell underscored the U.S. economy's ongoing weakness in written testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. Bond yields are reflective of investors' expectations of growth/inflation and interest rates.      ""The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain,"" Powell said, noting that millions of Americans are still out of work.      Powell's comments contradicted the bond markets' previous optimism that the U.S. economy would grow rapidly this year, putting pressure on the Fed to unwind stimulus (hike rates or scale back bond purchases) earlier than expected. The 10-year bond rose to a 12-month high of 1.39% earlier this week, diluting bitcoin's appeal as an inflation hedge, and sending the cryptocurrency lower to $45,000 from record highs above $58,000. The sell-off was accentuated by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's anti-bitcoin comments.      A continued decline in bond yields could propel bitcoin toward record highs. ""The focus remains on bond yields and stock markets,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Vinokourov added that ""buying the dip"" remains the best strategy, as institutional demand for the cryptocurrency continues to grow. Payments giant Square disclosed its additional bitcoin investment worth $170 million on Tuesday. Elsewhere, the recently launched Canadian bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is witnessing strong inflows, as noted by the data provider Glassnode.      Further, the settlement of a long-running legal dispute between Tether Ltd, the company behind the stablecoin tether, and the New York Attorney General's office has supposedly removed a potential systemic threat to cryptocurrency markets.      Analysts at JPMorgan warned last week that a sudden loss of confidence in tether posed risk to crypto markets, given the stablecoin is widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/24/bitcoin-retakes-50k-as-powell-eases-market-jitters-bond-yields-drop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0172504b64e7c35ff36b8bc2d0988d7f8757d2f7-1964x1331.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a memo on Monday, the Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy will hold its hearing on Thursday, Feb. 25.      Specifically, it will assess various means of terrorist financing including crowdfunding, charities, content subscriptions, cryptocurrencies and other funding mechanisms amid the backdrop of what occurred on Jan. 6.      As it relates to cryptocurrency, the hearing will assess ""the overall increase"" in its popularity as banks begin to tighten their measures against terror financing, the committee said.      Additionally, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has mentioned cryptocurrency use in terrorism as a key concern at least three times over the past five weeks.      A number of ""high-profile, high-value"" transfers to known ""alt-right"" cryptocurrency wallets have occurred including a post-death transfer of over $500,000 in bitcoin from a suicidal French extremist to a number of U.S.-based, extremist-owned wallets, the memo reads.      It is unclear whether those individuals were present at the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill insurrection in Washington, D.C.
