42399730,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybXj,1492112792,Investors Buy Firm Linked to Alleged Bitcoin Creator Craig Wright,"A startup tied to Australian academic and businessman Craig Wright, who last year claimed to be the inventor of bitcoin, has been sold.  The sale of nChain – formerly known as EITC Holdings – was announced yesterday. The buyer is a Malta-based investment fund, High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc, which is managed by Zürich-based Accuro Fund Solutions. A group of companies affiliated with nChain was also acquired as part of the deal.  An investigative report published by Reuters last summer connected Wright to EITC, through which as many as 50 patent applications were filed in the UK. Public records show that EITC submitted several dozen patent applications throughout 2016.  Wright made global headlines in late 2015 after several publications identified him as the possible face behind Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. Word that Wright was the subject of an Australian tax investigation and reports of police raids further heightened the situation.  The developments culminated in a media frenzy when Wright moved to prove that he was indeed Satoshi – only to drop the bid amid growing scrutiny and criticism. Yet as the controversy abated, rumors began to circulate in the industry that there may be developments related to intellectual property.  But, according to the firm's announcement, nChain may be planning a more open approach to the patents it is seeking.  In its release, nChain said that it ""intends to make some of its intellectual property assets available to the blockchain community through open source software and royalty-free licensing"" sometime this year. However, the firm gave no indication when that process might actually begin.

42399740,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybfb,1492105670,Alibaba Affiliate to Expand Blockchain Charity Project,"Ant Financial, the payments affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba, is moving to expand the scope of its blockchain-powered charity project.  The project – spearheaded by Ant Financial's charity arm, Ant Love – was first unveiled last summer. At the time, the company said that it was tapping the tech in order to ""bring more transparency to charity"". Specifically, the platform is designed to enable greater visibility into donor histories, charity disclosures, and other kinds of information involved with such efforts.  Ant Financial CTO Cheng Li told Bloomberg at the time:  ""We hope to bring more transparency to charity and blockchain technology’s decentralized nature fits that purpose well. It means that all the information and transaction history of funds will be more reliable and can’t be easily tampered with.""  Now, the firm is said to be looking to grow the initiative.  According to the South China Morning Post, Ant Financial is planning to involve more companies with the platform, including donor organizations, charities and media groups.  The project is a notable one given the scope of Alipay (Alibaba's payment service), which boasted more than 450m users as of last year, as well as the global footprint of Alibaba itself.  Earlier this month, Alibaba announced that it was working with professional services firm PwC on a blockchain project tied to preventing fraud in food supply chains.

42399737,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybga,1492100263,Australia’s Central Bank is Conducting Internal Blockchain Research,"Australia’s central bank is involved with several initiatives focused on blockchain technology, public records show.  In a published report on its work with financial markets infrastructure, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) disclosed that it had set up an in-house working group ""to consider the implications of the technology"", though it’s not immediately clear when the group was created.  The research is taking place in an environment in which both the Australian public and private sectors are exploring blockchain. AUSTRAC, one of the country's finance regulators, launched an innovation hub in March focused in part on experimenting with different use cases. That same month, the Australian government committed funding to help develop standards around the tech while its chief securities regulator moved to boost engagement with startups working on the tech.  Perhaps more notably, the Australian central bank also has its hands in several cross-institution organizations as well.  Key among these is a group within the Council of Financial Regulators – a sort of umbrella group for Australian finance watchdogs – that is ""examining DLT and its implications"". On a broader scale, the RBA is also working with the G-20 group of nations on regulatory approaches to financial technology.  That the RBA would develop its own research initiatives is perhaps unsurprising given that, in late 2015, then-governor Glenn Stevens hinted that the institution was looking to learn more about the tech.  Earlier that year, the Australian government began to assess whether its finance regulators, including the RBA, had jurisdiction over bitcoin.

42399736,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybec,1492096514,Washington Lawmakers Finalize New Bitcoin Business Rules,"Legislators in Washington state have put the finishing touches on new rules for businesses that offer digital currency services.  Senate Bill 5031  , public records show, has cleared both chambers of the state's legislature, setting it up to be sent to the office of Governor Jay Inslee. The bill was first introduced in January, clearing its first vote the following month.  While not guaranteed to be signed, the broad support the bill attracted signals that it may pass.  Still, its contents could lead some digital currency-focused startups to think twice about operating in the state – and in the past year, several firms have already pulled out, citing a difficult regulatory environment.  The bill represents an update to the state's existing money transmission laws, in order to make them account for firms that handle digital currencies.  According to the text of the measure, businesses would be required to maintain reserves – denominated in the relevant digital currency – equal to the funds they retain on behalf of their customers.  The bill states:  ""A licensee transmitting virtual currencies must hold like-kind virtual currencies of the same volume as that held by the licensee but which is obligated to consumers in lieu of the permissible investments required in of this subsection.""  Other requirements include mandatory third-party cybersecurity audits of ""all electronic information and data systems"", the text reads.  Even absent the new legislation, the past months have shown that some startups working with the tech have moved to steer clear of the state. These include digital currency exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Poloniex, the latter of which moved to exit Washington just last week.  According to an email  circulating on social media and dated 8th April, Poloniex said that it would be suspending services to customers in the state after 21st April.

42399732,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybag,1492091971,From AsicBoost to UASF: Greg Maxwell on Bitcoin's Path Forward,"""I'm sort of being scooped on the details by people just working it out for themselves now.""  Despite kickstarting another fierce period in bitcoin's now years-long scaling debate, Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell admits even he's a bit lost in the narrative he created last week.  That's when Maxwell posted a public note alleging an unnamed miner (largely assumed to be China-based Bitmain) was secretly using a more efficient mining technique, giving them an upper hand over other miners. Thickening the plot was that he alleged that this was the reason the company doesn't support Segregated Witness (SegWit), a preferred technical solution to the network's capacity issues that would accidentally turn off the technique.  With the post, Maxwell unintentionally kicked off a grassroots movement in support of pushing SegWit through by way of circumventing miners altogether, the latest in a long line of new technical proposals.  Called a user-activated soft fork (UASF), there are currently at least two groups working on a form of the idea, with a mess of discussion about whether the network can and should make technical upgrades in this way.  Still, Maxwell argues that this process, by which users and node operators aim to quarterback technical changes, might be the preferred way to make upgrades to the network in certain instances.  Maxwell told CoinDesk:  ""Ultimately, I think if we had a crystal ball and could get anything we wanted, we'd want to use UASFs always.""  Balancing act  But, is a UASF safe? While there's been an upsurge in support, the upgrading method is controversial.  Maxwell mentioned, as others have, that the change requires ""very, very broad"" support from the ecosystem. Yet, the trouble is, it's difficult to measure what bitcoin users really want and if there is such support.  Many point to bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 16 as a successful UASF, but it's actually one example where the method didn't go entirely smoothly. After activation, one pool mined invalid blocks for a couple of months (although, perhaps to its disadvantage and no one else's).  That's one reason that developers have been using a different method, Maxwell said. It's easier to deploy a consensus-level rule change if miners commit to upgrading and enforcing those rules.  Despite those challenges, Maxwell contended that some form of a UASF might be the best option right now.  If some miners are indeed running AsicBoost – the alternative mining method Bitmain is accused of employing – it poses a conflict of interest, as they don't want to push through a fix for economic reasons, he contends.  And, in his opinion, there are other tradeoffs to think about:  ""Not taking an upgrade has a cost too. As a community we have to balance those things.""  Word of warning  On that basis, Maxwell advocates for a form of a UASF to fix mining practice profiled in his mailing list post, but with a slower rollout than others have proposed. Maxwell said that discussions are still ongoing and it will probably be a few months before developers start writing the code.  For now, however, other groups are seeking faster solutions.  One UASF proposal, BIP 148, the one with a website and a Twitter account, is gaining support with announcements that certain companies are in favor of the idea currently dominating social media. (Fifteen percent of bitcoin companies now support the BIP, up from five percent on Monday, according to one measure.)  Maxwell is more cautious, though.  ""They're proposing time frames that I think the regular developers are not quite as comfortable with,"" he said. But, he didn't write off the effort.  ""Ultimately, bitcoin is owned by its users and by the people who own bitcoin,"" he said. ""I’m very interested in seeing where this stuff goes.”  Overall, Maxwell discussed the process in a largely academic tone, taking the recent developments as simply part and parcel to the kind of decision making that he seems to suggest is natural for a disparate community.  But, optimism  Stories about life-changing hugs aside, community discussions have been tense amid the block-size debate, with discussion dominating Twitter and Reddit at a constant clip.  One of the most obvious questions now is, what will come of the accusations against Bitmain?  As for how and where the community could find the missing pieces of the story, Maxwell didn't have an answer. He noted, however, that others have replicated his findings, posting them to Reddit.  Further, although he plans to release more information about the chip in question, he said it's not a priority because Bitmain already disclosed that it has used AsicBoost on its chip for testing.  Bitmain has denied that it is conducting its mining operations as alleged, and that this is the reason it does not support SegWit.  For all the contention this past week, Maxwell was largely optimistic when discussing the network's future outlook, framing the ongoing debate as necessary.  ""It's a consensus system after all,"" he said, concluding:  ""I think people often get a little too caught up in the disputes, where really, that’s just part of the process. It's natural. And, ultimately, it’s what makes bitcoin strong and secure.""

42399731,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybZh,1492090531,Russian Central Banker: Bitcoin's Legal Recognition Isn't Guaranteed,"It's too early to discuss legally recognizing bitcoin, a Russian central bank official said yesterday in an interview with state-run news agency TASS.  The comments  from Maxim Grigoriev, head of the Bank of Russia's Center for Financial Technologies, came after a senior official with the Russian Ministry of Finance first floated the idea bitcoin could be considered for legal recognition sometime in 2018 during an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week.  That idea, as might be expected, struck some as a sharp turnaround for the Russian government, which as early as 2015 was weighing steep penalties for the creation and distribution of so-called money surrogates, a category which would have covered digital currencies. Government ministers later backed away from that position, as indicated by reports from last year.  According to TASS, Grigoriev confirmed that 2018 would see some kind of regulatory position emerge from Russia's government, though he reportedly cautioned that discussions were ongoing as to what that position might be.  Grigoriev said, according to a translation:  ""We are communicating with the Ministry of Finance, Federal Financial Monitoring Service – as mentioned, we are going to 2018 to determine the position.""  The government's push toward finalizing digital currency regulation comes as agencies in Russia are exploring applications of blockchain in the public sector.

42399742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybmU,1492086634,"Blockchain for IoT: Promising, But Caution Needed","Joe Pindar is CTO and director of product strategy at Gemalto, where he formulates roadmaps and prioritizes development to align the digital security provider with market trends.  In this opinion piece, Pindar argues that while emerging blockchain technologies will gain traction in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, more work is needed to realize opportunities.  If blockchain has yet to reach peak hype, then at the very least, it is gaining traction in terms of investment.  With numerous VCs, startups and major tech companies all having poured significant financial resources into various applications of the technology, the effort they must focus on now is collaboration.  In the simplest terms, blockchain is a distributed database that provides a secure, yet transparent way to make, record and verify any type of transaction. A transaction does not have to be financial; it is simply any type of transfer between two parties that typically requires a third party for authentication and to broker the exchange.  Perhaps the most common example of the traditional third-party model is stock trading or other financial transactions that rely on clearing houses to execute.  The idea behind blockchain is to eliminate the need for a sometimes costly and performance-draining central authority, and replace it with a shared record of unalterable blocks of data, distributed across computers around the world.  The challenge now is to test and validate the various blockchain networks that have been built, and then to find a way to standardize and consolidate protocols so these networks can work together.  IoT potential  Since the technology first emerged in 2008, and then began to expand beyond bitcoin around 2014, so many standards and protocols have been developed that, at present, there are simply too many.  Once consolidation does start to happen, applications everywhere will have a blockchain layer somewhere in the back-end, enabling a number of new use cases in business and finance.  But there is no use case where this will have such 'game-changing' impact as with the Internet of Things (IoT).  This is because, for IoT to make the type of strides that its stakeholders are hoping for, blockchain's ability to help different systems communicate with each other in a trusted way will be essential.  Think of a connected car 'speaking' with smart parking meters to help you park faster, or to local coffee shops to figure out which one makes the most sense for your route to work. That smart car might even place the order for you.  Creating these types of closed-loop systems that give our lives new conveniences or make cities more liveable will require public and private IoT networks to trust in one another’s networks and devices.  Opportunity identified  So where does blockchain play a role?  Blockchain creates an easier way for devices to verify one another. Like so many other transaction types, financial, PKI (public key infrastructure) or otherwise, IoT communication has historically required a trusted third party.  Blockchain changes that dynamic, distributing the trust model, recording the transaction on a shared ledger, cutting out the central authority and making the transaction cheaper and faster.  This new design will also benefit the security of IoT, since it eliminates the restrictions imposed by the traditional central authority trust model which have made IoT vulnerable – most notably to Mirai-style botnets, which recently allowed hackers to take over thousands of IoT devices only protected with default passwords and then use them to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks.  In providing a distributed trust model, blockchain removes the 'single point of failure', in turn enabling device networks to protect themselves in other ways, such as allowing the nodes within a given network to quarantine any nodes that start behaving unusually.  Work ahead  Still, among the various blockchain networks in development, none have been rigorously vetted from a security standpoint.  In 2017, we will see more blockchain networks going through extensive security testing. We will also see continued efforts to standardize how these networks communicate with one another.  There are a number of companies currently working together to try to make this happen. A consortium of them recently met in Berkeley and have launched a collaborative effort to create a shared blockchain-based IoT protocol. Companies involved represent fields ranging from security to banking, logistics supply chains, energy, pharmaceuticals and health records.  All of these companies share in the belief that blockchain has the power to give us new and exciting IoT use cases, but also that we need to create a common protocol to make it easier for IoT to fully realize the benefits of blockchain.  And all that will require is a little cooperation.

42399749,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybqQ,1492083020,'Into the War Room': Overstock Looks Back on Bitcoin Embrace,"Jonathan Johnson is the chairman of the board of Overstock and the president of Medici Ventures, the Overstock subsidiary focused on advancing blockchain technology in financial systems and beyond.  In this entry for CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Johnson discusses his involvement in Overstock's decision to become the first major US merchant to accept bitcoin, and the influences that led it to kickstart what would be a frenzy of bitcoin activity in the retail industry.  Sometime in early 2013, my high school-aged sons began asking me when Overstock would accept bitcoin.  At this time, I was the president of Overstock and, I sheepishly admit, it was the first I'd heard of bitcoin. I began studying bitcoin and watching how it was used. Unbeknownst to me, my business partner, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, was doing exactly the same.  In particular, he was watching how bitcoin was being successfully used around the world after the Cyprus bailout and studying its underlying blockchain technology.  Toward the end of the year, the two of us began to talk about bitcoin...    ***    As bitcoin interest and adoption grew, we saw technological, capitalistic and philosophic reasons to offer our customers a secure, decentralized, immutable way to buy products. In December 2013, wanting to make it possible for bitcoin users to purchase products from us, we included our senior management team in the discussion.  And the team quickly decided bitcoin as a payment method was a good idea.  Because Overstock had lots of projects in the queue, we figured Overstock would get to coding the bitcoin project sometime during the first half of 2014. But, as news of this decision spread throughout the company, 40 of our best developers, all eager to be involved in the bitcoin project, wanted to speed it up.  ""Why take six months? This is a big deal,"" they said.  Our developers volunteered for immediate duty.    ***    Straight away, we formed a team that began work the week between Christmas and New Year's.  Wanting to be undistracted and uninterrupted, the team locked themselves in a room (and asked that pizza be slid under the door) so they could work on integrating the technology into our website.  (At Overstock, we often create special project teams and give them their own ""war room"" so they can focus on the project.) This was just such a case.  The team was singularly focused on the project over the holidays. They were bitcoin believers and it showed in their dedication to the project.  After just two weeks of hard work, on 9th January, 2014, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin.    ***    The buzz among the bitcoin community was huge. The press was quick to tout our pioneering action. Bitcoin holders came to Overstock in droves to purchase products.  In the following weeks and months, Patrick and I were asked to speak about bitcoin and why Overstock decided to accept the cryptocurrency.  While the decision to accept bitcoin seems like an easy and smart one, in retrospect, there were a number of factors that led our team to conclude an alternative currency was a good fit for Overstock.  Overstock is a technology company at its core. We built our brand around leveraging technologies to provide our customers with the best possible shopping experience. Because of this, we constantly experiment with new technologies across a variety of applications.  Bitcoin was no exception. As we began to better understand bitcoin’s underlying technology – the blockchain – it was clear the decentralized and distributed infrastructure allowed for almost no possibility of exploitation. That, when combined with the immutable nature of the ledger, provided a level of security and transparency never before seen in a currency.    ***    When we began accepting bitcoin, we accessed a new demographic of customers with plenty of bitcoin to spend, but few places to spend it.  The bitcoin community is a loyal and engaged one, and we believed they would return Overstock's faith in the currency with continued patronage. We were right.  Fiscally, the decision made a great deal of sense, too. We eliminated credit card transaction costs on bitcoin purchases, thus increasing our profit within the tight margins of e-commerce.  Bitcoin still combines the convenience, transparency and security of an online-based payment method with the virtues of a currency that has a finite supply of infinitely divisible units and predictable growth patterns. This duality supports our belief that a limited government, without the power to create currency at will for self-sustaining purposes, is the best business model for any nation.    ***    While you might not hear much about its retail use cases anymore, Overstock still accepts bitcoin.  The digital currency's non-governmental nature still allows for easy global adoption, leading to efficient trade between individuals and companies without the cumbersome currency exchange processes and costs.  Just as the internet allowed the world the freedom to communicate across borders and cultures, bitcoin and other non-governmental cryptocurrencies allow the world the freedom to trade goods in much the same way.  Other retailers and industries soon followed our lead and the public began to see bitcoin less as a fringe idea and more as a safe, globally accessible way to purchase goods and services from reputable organizations.  While bitcoin is responsible for less than 1% of our annual revenue, our experience integrating it with our website allowed us to understand the true potential of blockchain technology.  In late 2014, we went so far as to create Medici Ventures, a subsidiary company focused on developing and advancing blockchain technology.  Today, you can use bitcoin to pay for everything from a computer to a vacation to college tuition.  And, it all started with saying yes to accepting.

42399726,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZee,1492077619,Buy Litecoin? A Likely Tech Upgrade is Winning Over Traders,"With the price of litecoin rising, cryptocurrency investors have been forced to take another look at the project – one of the longest-running but frequently overlooked public blockchains.  Once widely heralded as the 'silver to bitcoin's gold', litecoin has in recent years struggled to find its value proposition in a sea of more novel blockchain projects. That may have changed, however, now that it could be utilized as a proving ground for a new technical solution.  As profiled on CoinDesk, litecoin miners have recently begun to show their support for Segregated Witness (or SegWit), a blockchain scaling solution originally designed for the bitcoin blockchain.  But whereas political divisions have largely stymied efforts to approve the upgrade for bitcoin, litecoin recently passed its 75% threshold for activation. Should this hold for two weeks, the new code will go live.  According to analysts, the market's recent response to this development has helped give the project new relevance to investors. All in all, the cryptocurrency has more than doubled its market cap in response, rising from $215m on 30th March to $550m yesterday.  Of interest now to traders and investors, however, is whether this capital will stay in the litecoin ecosystem, and whether the project can develop a long-term value proposition.  Obtaining consensus  While SegWit may be a minor code upgrade, analysts argued litecoin's technical improvements speak directly to the quality of the project's development team.  Further, obtaining the consensus needed to implement the update would show the community's ability to work together, one analyst emphasized.  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, told CoinDesk:  ""The activation of SegWit in litecoin is a strong positive for the cryptocurrency. It shows the ability to make headway where bitcoin has seen its progress stalled by vested interests.""  However, other experts polled for this article suggested that litecoin could at most only succeed in demonstrating the utility of the code upgrade for the bitcoin blockchain.  OTC trader Harry Yeh said that if SegWit is enacted on litecoin, ""bitcoin will be sure to follow"", potentially removing any competitive edge.  SegWit impact  Still, SegWit could potentially prove a driver for litecoin's price, analysts told CoinDesk, if only in the near to medium term.  Should the upgrade take place, Hayter told CoinDesk, he ""would expect the value of litecoin to appreciate"".  Others suggested that rising value could become more permanent.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged trading platform Whaleclub, argued that, since litecoin and bitcoin have similar codebases, litecoin could gain some of the bitcoin's market share should scalability remain an issue for the latter.  ""SegWit activation is very likely to create a mid-term bullish trend which will increase litecoin's market cap,"" said Zivkovski.  However, he concluded that any lasting benefits for litecoin are also good for bitcoin, given that bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that can most readily be exchanged for fiat currencies.  He concluded:  ""There is likely to be some amount of wealth transfer from bitcoin to litecoin simply because right now the most convenient and straightforward way to buy litecoin is to use bitcoin.""

In a statement, Broadridge revealed that a private ethereum blockchain was used as a backup system to more traditional voting software, and that the test was conducted at an annual meeting at Santander Investments.  A fruition of past statements about Broadridge's impending work, the test sought to showcase how blockchain could improve the transparency of proxy voting, the process by which shareholders cast votes at annual meetings.

Patricia Rosch, senior executive managing Broadridge's international proxy business, said in the statement:  ""The success of this pilot program reflects Broadridge's unique ability to leverage our domain expertise and deliver blockchain innovation to all industry participants.""  Notably, this is not the first time blockchain technology has been used to conduct proxy voting. Earlier this year, Nasdaq announced a project with Estonia's e-Residency platform using blockchains for proxy voting. The project was initiated in 2015 with the blockchain startup Chain.
