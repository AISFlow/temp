8010804,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517360,1674601214,SushiSwap To Redirect 100% Trading Fees To Treasury,"While the DeFi market has continued to mirror the crypto market rally, more innovations have been introduced to the ecosystem. In today’s news, SushiSwap, the sixth-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by 24 hours trading volume, has passed a proposal to relocate 100% of its trading fees to the SushiSwap treasury for maintenance and expenses. Related Reading: SushiSwap Head Chef Suggests Cooking Up New Token Model – Will The DEX Survive 2023? SushiSwap Introduces New Update This new update comes after CEO Jared Grey voiced warnings that the exchange treasury stability is numbered as it has “only 1.5 years of treasury runway left,” despite having cut down the annual operating expenses from $9 million to $5 million during the ongoing crypto winter. According to a presented governance proposal by the developers of the SushiSwap decentralized exchange, which was passed on January 23, the SushiSwap exchange will now extend the usage of trading fees by redirecting them to the exchange’s treasury to enhance the operation and maintenance of the exchange over the next one year. The proposal noted, “Revenue to the treasury will be 50% ETH and 50% USDC, with a projection of ~$6m being earned over the next year if this proposal were to pass.” In another proposal passed the same day, approximately 99.85% of voters voted in favor of “clawing back” 10,936,284 unclaimed SUSHI ($14.8 million) tokens to be rewarded to early liquidity providers during the DEX’s launch in 2020. SushiSwap Painful Loss And Recovery Undoubtedly the crypto winter hit most projects in the industry, including DeFi platforms such as SushiSwap. Last December, SushiSwap CEO Jared Grey revealed that the DEX experienced a $30 million loss over the past 12 months on incentives for liquidity providers (LPs). To counter that loss and initiate recovery, Grey revealed plans to refine SushiSwap’s tokenomics so that LPs are no longer bankrolled with emissions and redesign the complete model of bootstrapping liquidity on the exchange. The “Kanpai” governance proposal, which aims to relocate trading protocol fees to the treasury, was also referred to by Grey when illustrating the plans to update the SushiSwap exchange. “Put simply, it (Kanpai) allows the protocol to rebuild its cash reserves to continue to pay competitive wages, pay for critical infrastructure, & to diversify its Treasury with funds collected in the base pairs of assets, like ETH, stablecoins, etc. Kanpai is a temporary solution,” Grey stated. Related Reading: SushiSwap: Deciphering How SUSHI Is Posting Unparalleled Price Growth Speaking of SushiSwap, the protocol’s native token, SUSHI, has been in a rally, following the rest of the DeFi sector.

Equities closed mixed as traders continued processing the latest round of fourth-quarter earnings reports from companies including General Electric. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 0.31% while the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.07% and 0.27%, respectively.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Top Story  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, mistakenly kept collateral for some of the crypto assets it issues in the same wallet as funds belonging to its customers, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified Binance spokesperson.  The exchange issued 94 so-called Binance-peg tokens (B-Tokens), and reserves for almost half of those are stored in a cold wallet called Binance 8, Bloomberg said. The wallet contains more tokens than required for the number of B-Tokens issued. Because the tokens are supposed to be backed 1:1, the excess indicates the collateral is being mixed with customers’ tokens, according to Bloomberg.  “Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Binance is aware of this mistake and is in the process of transferring these assets to dedicated collateral wallets.” Assets held with the exchange “have been and continue to be backed 1:1,” the spokesperson said.  When collateral is pooled together and used for trading it’s locked up, and clients or holders of assets may not be able to withdraw if the pool is reduced, Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, said in a note to CoinDesk.  “In essence this means that there is no segregation of assets between clients' funds and any collateral used,” Kssis said. “This could lead to the owner(s) not being able to withdraw due to lack of funds or liquidity by the exchange.  Token Roundup  Ether (ETH): ETH slid 0.8% to recently trade at $1,615. Ether turned deflationary again, with nearly one-fourth of ETH burned stemming from non-fungible token trades over the past seven days, according to data from ultrasound.money.  Moving to on-chain data, remember the Wormhole network exploiter that stole 80,000 ETH last year? It reappeared this week. According to data from Etherscan, the exploiter swapped 95,360 ETH worth roughly $157 million on decentralized finance aggregator OpenOcean and then transacted smaller amounts of capital through several DeFi protocols Monday.  Axie Infinity (AXS), dYdX (DYDX) and Aptos (APT): AXS, DYDX and APT are recently showing signs of strength into token unlocks, which are normally perceived to be a bearish event. AXS token surged 40% in the lead-up to $64 million worth of previously locked tokens, while the DYDX token rose 64% to rally this month despite a token unlock coming on Feb. 2. APT followed a similar trend, up 262% this year.  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin, Ether Price Movement Stalls  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Bitcoin and ether's trading range has begun to narrow as the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization look to establish new areas of support. Following last week's 8% and 5% gains, BTC and ETH's price movement has yet to exceed a percentage point over the past four days.  BTC rose 0.4% on Saturday, declined slightly on Sunday and inched upward 1% and .09%, respectively, over the first two days of this week. Ether has traveled similarly during the same period.  Bitcoin's chart implies new support levels forming near $22,900. The volume profile visible range (VPVR) tool, shows increasing levels of activity and price agreement at this mark. Often these are called high volume nodes, and can indicate where the market sees an asset as fairly priced, at least for the moment.  Read the full technical take here.

The challenge, which kicked off Monday, is part of a week-long global treasure hunt dubbed “Hunting Sats” – a gamified educational bootcamp on best practices for private key protection.  The Hunting Sats wallet has been funded with 3,454,811 satoshis or ""sats"" (0.03454811 BTC) and counting. Participants from anywhere in the world will attempt to correctly guess the wallet’s passphrase and 12-word seed phrase in order to claim the funds.  A bitcoin wallet typically comes with a “seed phrase” made up of 12 to 24 random words and is sometimes protected by a PIN, password or passphrase. The seed phrase is used to “recover” or regain access to the wallet in the case of accidental loss.  Read more: What Is a Seed Phrase?  Randomly guessing passwords or passphrases to gain unauthorized access is a method known as “brute-forcing.”  “Hands-on learning through fun games like Hunting Sats is a fantastic way for users to learn about seed phrase security and other benefits of self custody,” the release states. “It shows how brute force becomes more achievable if users reveal part of their seed.”  The secret words from the Hunting Sats seed and passphrase were distributed to 12 partners, including prominent bitcoin companies like Blockstream, Trezor and BTCPay. Each partner will randomly reveal their secret word on Twitter, making brute-forcing easier each time a word is publicly revealed.  “When users work responsibly with their seed and keep their private key in dedicated cold storage, the risk of cracking the wallet is practically zero,” the release states. “Understanding these basic concepts is one of the first steps towards self-sovereignty and self-custody.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | WALLET,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/24/wasabi-wallet-will-pay-you-to-crack-a-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01f8f4999947e60886579a6df3b05901e26ca0a4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414563,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBAVk,1674596983,Aave Community Voting to Deploy Version 3 on Ethereum,"Decentralized non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol Aave is voting to execute its third iteration, or v3, on the Ethereum blockchain, a critical moment for the decentralized finance (DeFi) community hoping to benefit from v3’s focus on risk management and capital efficiency.  In the ongoing governance vote, all participating AAVE token holders have voted to activate the new iteration of Aave on Ethereum. Aave’s Twitter account is calling v3 the “most significant upgrade to the Aave Protocol” since it launched in January 2017.  That’s because Ethereum is Aave’s first and largest market for lending and borrowing crypto capital on-chain. Even so, Aave rolled out v3 on other chains including Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche before bringing it to the mothership.  The vote ends Jan. 25, 2023, at 18:58 UTC. If the proposal passes, the deployment will execute on Friday, Jan. 27.  Aimed at improving user experience, risk management and capital efficiency, v3 on Ethereum comes as Aave leads the charge as the largest lender in the DeFi space, with $3.8 billion in total value locked (TVL) across the Ethereum ecosystem, per DeFiLlama.  The change is being hailed by other Ethereum DeFi players who plug into Aave’s protocol for liquidity.  Kasper Rasmussen, marketing lead for Lido, a major protocol in Ethereum DeFi that plugs into Aave, said v3 will improve the lending and borrowing markets for Lido’s staked ETH – one example of how v3 could shape the broader market.  “It’s a big step forward for the Ethereum DeFi space,” Rasmussen said.  Aave did not return a request to comment by press time.  New features, such as efficiency mode, or ""eMode,"" will now come to Ethereum, but in a limited manner. For now, Aave’s v3 Ethereum market will only include the following pre-approved assets: wBTC, wETH, wstETH, USDC, DAI, LINK and AAVE.  Not everything is changing instantly, however.  Isolation mode, another key feature in Aave v3 that permits borrowing of a newly listed, risky asset up to a particular debt ceiling, will not be enabled for all assets when Aave v3 launches on Ethereum.  Moreover, even though v3 interest rate models vary somewhat from v2, with the main difference coming from stablecoin rates, Bored Ghost Developing Labs, the author of the proposal that has led the engineering effort behind Aave v3, said initial interest rate models on v3 “will follow those present on v2 Ethereum assets and other existing instances of v3.”  UPDATE (Jan. 26, 2022 16:15 UTC): Clarified Kasper Rasmussen's role at Lido",POSITIVE,AAVE | ETH,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | ARB,Sage D.

42411261,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMW2z,1674596709,A 5-Pronged Approach to Sensible Crypto Regulation After FTX,"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX guarantees that crypto regulation will be on the U.S. legislative agenda for 2023 – at long last. Six bills were introduced in 2022, some broad ranging and others narrowly focused on various aspects of compliance or investor protection.  It’s clear that there’s a lot of confusion. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are jockeying for position. There are many voices in the room. Some of the loudest still want no regulation. That includes people within the industry and anti-crypto lawmakers who think regulating crypto legitimizes it.  This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week. Mike Belshe is CEO of BitGo, a regulated crypto custody, financial-services and infrastructure provider.  For my part, I would love to have comprehensive crypto regulation. In the U.S. we have some of the strongest financial markets in the world, and that is due in large part to regulation. Regulation will make crypto markets stronger.  But the regulatory regime that governs traditional finance wasn't created in one fell swoop. It evolved over decades, with a lot of rulemaking happening in response to disasters like FTX.  The digital-asset industry is still in its infancy, but the problems we’ve seen with FTX are familiar. We have seen them before at QuadrigaCX and at Mt. Gox. We can get started now on the beginnings of regulatory oversight to prevent these types of losses. Here are five modest, sensible steps that could be taken now that don’t even require much crypto knowledge.  Stablecoin reserves  Stablecoins play an important role in the digital-asset ecosystem. They are intended to be less volatile than cryptocurrencies (err, stable!), and therefore more practical for everyday transactions. But they haven’t always been so stable.  Stablecoins are supposed to be redeemable 1:1 for whatever asset that backs them. But there’s no actual legal requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold reserves equal to circulating supply. That’s a problem. When a stablecoin loses its peg there’s a possibility that holders will rush to redeem their coins, resulting in something very similar to a bank run.  See also: Can Banks Issue Stablecoins? / Opinion  That’s exactly what happened with terraUSD in May 2022. It wasn’t actually backed by a reserve asset. It relied on trading based on a mint-and-burn algorithm linked to the supply of LUNA, the native token of the Terra blockchain. Ironically, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now under investigation for manipulating the market for terraUSD, whose collapse touched off the industry crisis that ultimately exposed his other misdeeds at FTX.  But you don’t have to understand any of that to see that if a stablecoin is backed by a U.S. dollar, you need dollars in reserve equal to the amount of circulating stablecoins. We should require stablecoin issuers to maintain 1:1 reserves at banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (Side note: FDIC insurance grew out of the bank failures of the early 1900s.) Quarterly audits of reserves and real-time reporting on mint-and-burn activity should be mandatory. We also need to implement safety and soundness controls with a diversity of banks proportional to reserve size.  Separate trading and custody  The market structure where customers have to keep their money with the exchange is fundamentally flawed. You don’t have to know anything about crypto to see why that is not a good idea. Suppose the Nasdaq approached the SEC about being its own custodian. That conversation would never happen.  The problem isn't just that it’s just too easy to dip your hand into the cookie jar. Even if you are completely honest, there’s still a problem with counterparty risk.  See also: 'FTX Has Been Hacked': Crypto Disaster Worsens as Exchange Sees Mysterious Outflows Exceeding $600M  Many of these exchanges are also participating in various forms of lending. They are doing arbitrage and market making. They are trading and hedging on other exchanges. You can't possibly measure counterparty risk on the exchange because it's the sum of the exchange’s risk plus the risk of whatever other markets they are participating in.  If there’s anything we should learn from the FTX collapse, it’s that assets should be stored until required for trading by external, qualified, regulated and insured custodians. This creates a check and balance for verifying reserve assets under any exchange’s control.  If trading and custody had been separate, we might have found out earlier that FTX was deep into a fractional reserve situation. We would have prevented the hacking and stealing of assets that happened after the bankruptcy filing.  Require digital-asset exchanges to be 100% digital  Disallow direct trading of digital assets with fiat or off-chain assets. This will make all exchanges on-chain auditable, enabling a proof of reserves that actually works.  Right now, proof-of-reserves statements provide an element of transparency, but they aren't a complete solution for determining who’s solvent and who’s not, for two main reasons.  See also: ‘Proof of Reserves’ Emerges as a Favored Way to Prevent Another FTX  One, you can't do it for reserves on fiat, which cannot be represented in a digital way. Two, you can’t do proof of non-liabilities, which is really the thing that matters most. FTX combined fiat and digital reserve components, and as we now know, its liabilities far outstripped its reserves. With pure digital exchanges with fiat represented digitally as a regulated stablecoin, we could have proof of reserves for everything in real time.  The last thing you have to solve is the liabilities component. If we fix settlement and clearing to be all digital, we could build a pretty robust and efficient system with compliance baked in. What's happening today is that exchanges are trying to build a business in a hybrid world because they don’t have any other choice. We can put fiat and securities in digital wrappers as a transition. Once we've gotten rid of the legacy wrappers, what we can do in an all-digital environment will be much stronger.  Regulate digital-asset exchanges’ use of omnibus wallets  Many crypto custodians use omnibus wallets where the funds of multiple clients are commingled under a single address. This makes key management easier for the custodian, and also makes it easier to enable efficient off-chain transactions.  The downside is that individual clients no longer have visibility into their transactions or into counterparty risk. It’s also unclear what happens to each customer’s funds in the event of a bankruptcy.  Omnibus wallets are acceptable only when the qualified custodian is aware of each of the exchange’s customers in the omnibus pool and assets are segregated in such a way as to provide bankruptcy protection to each customer. The custodian must also comply with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules.  Define securities for the digital era  This is the most cited complaint about the SEC: It is relying on a definition of securities developed in the 1940s to underpin its enforcement efforts. Builders in crypto have honest questions about how the rule applies to them, and they deserve answers.  How hard would it be for the SEC to provide an updated definition, detailed guidance and sensible grandfathering policies? Having that clarity would go a long way toward providing protection to innovators and investors alike.  The SEC should listen more to Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been outspoken in her view that the SEC shouldn't be leading with enforcement. Enforcement is clearly in the SEC's purview, but there’s an opportunity to make the enforcement load a lot lighter by providing appropriate guidance to begin with.  See also: 2023: The Year Regulators Finally Grasp Crypto?  What happened at FTX was a garden-variety type of financial fraud seen throughout the ages. The only thing it has to do with crypto and blockchain technology is that lack of regulation left an open field for unscrupulous players.  What we need right now is basic regulatory oversight aimed at preventing catastrophic investor losses. Designers and builders are more than capable of designing a better system to meet the requirements of regulators. Once people can't be rug pulled or defrauded, then we can start to talk about more nuanced issues and to build something more comprehensive.  We're going to get through this period. FTX isn’t the first exchange to run into trouble. It’s just the biggest. We could compartmentalize it as one guy who was a charlatan and go back to business as usual – but if we do that, we're just setting the industry up for the next failure. Instead, if we use this opportunity to take a few simple steps in the direction we all know we need to go in order to thrive, we’ll come out better and stronger.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Mike Belshe,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/24/us-crypto-regulation-approach,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccc85b4fad3e476be80314566a04a8c06aa8aa30-4855x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company, which raised $210 million in August at a $3.2 billion valuation, said in a press release Tuesday it will use the proceeds from the new capital to expand its mining facilities to meet strong demand for large-scale hosting services, according to the statement. ""Hosting has remained a resilient market segment as compared with 'prop' miners (and their lenders) who have been more directly exposed to bitcoin price volatility and compressed margins,"" the statement added.  Blockstream's new funding round didn't mention the valuation of the company. However, in Dec. 7, Bloomberg reported the company is seeking to raise funds at a 70% lower valuation than in its previous round, under $1 billion.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so customers can store their mining rigs and mine digital assets for a fee. The service has been a popular way for miners to earn bitcoin rewards without having to sink a large amount of capital into building out infrastructure, as crypto winter has weighed heavily on the industry and capital markets have been essentially inaccessible for many.  Blockstream was founded in 2014 with a focus on building infrastructure and applications based upon the Bitcoin network. The firm was co-founded by CEO Adam Back (inventor of Hashcash, a system for discouraging spam emails that influenced Satoshi Nakamoto's proof-of-work consensus mechanism design for Bitcoin) and nine others, including Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell.  The company has over 500 megawatts of power capacity underway for its mining services. It is also the developer of decentralized market technology Liquid Network, which enables trustless bitcoin swap settlements and helps financial institutions to tokenize assets. The company also plans to expand its renewable energy mining products and continue developing its own bitcoin mining machine.  “This fundraise allows us to accelerate the [year-over-year] revenue growth we created with our 2021 Series B and continue to build infrastructure for the future Bitcoin economy,” said Blockstream President and Chief Financial Officer Erik Svenson. “We remain focused on reducing risk for institutional bitcoin miners and enabling enterprise users to build high-value use cases on the most secure, robust and scalable blockchain in the world – Bitcoin,” he added.

The Chiliz project has many lucrative partnerships with soccer giants such as Juventus, Manchester City, FC Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain. It equips the club supporters with limited editions of fan tokens. Sports is a lucrative sector worldwide, with fans investing heavily in merchandise and fan tokens to support their favorite teams. The platform’s native token CHZ is the currency for purchasing these fan tokens through smart contracts. These fan tokens are offered in limited supply to preserve their scarcity and uniqueness. The Chiliz development team posted the progressive strides the network has made in 2022 and early 2023 on Twitter. It has formed new partnerships with notable partners such as Italian Serie A teams, MLS teams, and SL Benfica. Also, the Scoville Testnet upgrade launched in 2022 has recorded success in stages 1-5. According to the development team, Stage 6 will launch in 2023. CHZ Price Prediction Where Is it Headed? Chiliz (CHZ) is trading at 0.1461, a 5.29% increase in the token’s value. The Chiliz token is in an uptrend, as the formation of consecutive green candles with higher highs indicates. CHZ is trading above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and below its 200-day (SMA). It implies a short-term rally as the bulls seize control of the market. The support levels are $0.130459, $0.133246, and $0.136924, while the resistance levels are $0.143388, $0.146176, and $0.146176. Chiliz has broken its first resistance level of $0.133246 and turned it to support, leading to a positive movement on the charts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 64.85, showing that Chiliz is close to the buy zone but not in the overbought region. If the bullish pressure sustains, Chiliz will likely surpass its next resistance level soon. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is now above the signal line. It also indicates slight bullish pressure. However, the MACD is still tentative and reflects a possible reversal if the bears seize control.

Following last week’s 8% and 5% gains, BTC and ETH’s price movement has yet to exceed a percentage point over the past four days.  BTC rose 0.4% on Saturday, declined slightly on Sunday and inched upward 1% and .09%, respectively, over the first two days of this week. Ether has traveled similarly during the same period.  Unsurprisingly, both assets have paused after their strong start to 2023. Bitcoin is now trading at levels last seen in August. Ether last traded near its current levels in November.  Bitcoin’s chart implies new support levels forming near $22,900. The volume profile visible range (VPVR) tool, shows increasing levels of activity and price agreement at this mark. Often these are called high-volume nodes, and can indicate where the market sees an asset as fairly priced, at least for the moment.  Other recent high-volume nodes occurred near $17,000 and $19,000. As is common with high volume nodes, prices remained at those levels for extended periods. In short, supply and demand match relatively evenly at these levels. Low-volume nodes imply a lack of price agreement. Prices tend to move rapidly through these price ranges.  Monday’s crypto markets analysis mentioned the extent to which both short- and long-term investors are now in a profitable range on average, which could decrease the desire for some holders to sell.  One area is concerning, however. A report by digital asset firm CoinShares revealed that crypto investment products had $37 million of inflows last week. Of that amount, 68% was sent to short investment products, betting against the price of bitcoin.  Activity within the U.S. was decidedly bearish on this front, with 95% of inflows going into funds looking to profit on declines in bitcoin’s price.

42411250,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVZE,1674592177,How Policy Shaped Crypto’s Banking Prospects,"For years crypto businesses have been plagued with an inability to establish and maintain banking relationships – a situation downstream of a general lack of regulatory clarity. Today, banks in the U.S. and reportedly the European Union are facing increasing pressure to stand aside from the crypto industry. While it might sound like a positive thing for a movement looking to establish a parallel financial system – one bound by code rather than human intervention – the return to a lack of bank access would be devastating for many in crypto.  But that’s an unlikely scenario. Instead, in the coming years more banks – with higher profiles – will likely be willing to work with crypto firms. Better policy will be put in place, and mature crypto firms that survive, or start in, the bear market will have to meet tighter regulations and submit to more scrutiny. This prediction is in part based on a hunch, and a few background calls with bankers who could not go on the record and who said that crypto is still an area of business development. While things seem bleak, it’s important to recognize that bitcoin did not go to zero and that much of the industry is more than holding up.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Policy Week."" A version of it published first in The Node newsletter.  Crypto is not going away, in other words, and the longer that stays true the more likely it is that banks will again see it as a growth area. But compliance is dear to banks, and there is a patchwork of laws snaking through federal and state legislative processes that may impose strict requirements for both banks and their crypto clients. There are a number of institutions, such as crypto exchange Coinbase and stablecoin issuer Circle, that already function more like fintech firms than crypto-anarchists. It’s that “form factor” to which banks will try to sell banking services.  Far from challenging banks, regulated blockchain products and the companies that build them are only going to improve legacy financial businesses.  All of this cuts counter to the trend of crypto-friendly banks stepping back from the industry. These few, relatively small regional institutions saw digital assets as an opportunity for growth and have summarily been battered by the market downturn. Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which counted 6% of its deposits from crypto companies, will cut ties by the end of the year with its crypto clients in light of “recent developments” and regulatory shifts. Signature, which isn’t exiting entirely, is scaling back – including recently imposed restrictions on its dealings with the Binance exchange.  Signature and its competitor Silvergate, the crypto bank par excellence, both saw a dramatic drawdown in crypto-related deposits. That’s in part because both offered similar intercompany payment rails – Signet and Silvergate Exchange Network, respectively – that facilitated the exchange in hundreds of billions of transfers between their crypto clients. Both companies lost an astounding amount in crypto-client withdrawals last year, and have since taken out loans from the United States Federal Home Loan Banks System (FHLB), an agency created in the Great Depression to backstop the mortgage industry. (Turns out there is a buyer of last resort for crypto, the U.S. taxpayer.)  The worst may not yet be over, however. Silvergate, a much smaller bank with a relatively much broader exposure to crypto, may be implicated in the ongoing FTX fallout. It sold assets at a major discount last quarter to fulfill $8 billion of customer withdrawals, and lost more than it ever made from crypto since it entered the industry in 2014. That may serve as a serious disincentive for other banks thinking about crypto, all the more because some of the highest-profile clients – Voyager Digital, Celsius Network and BlockFi failed and filed for bankruptcy protection.  Meanwhile, three U.S. governmental institutions published a letter at the beginning of the month strongly discouraging banks from dealing in crypto. In a Jan. 3 joint statement, the U.S. Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said issuing or holding cryptocurrencies, tied to public, decentralized networks, was ""highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.”  ""It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,"" the letter read. Likewise, across the pond, the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is looking to limit the amount of unbacked cryptocurrencies lenders can hold – a preventative measure meant to stymie the chance that problems in the digital asset industry will spill over to the wider finance system.  A leaked version of a bill, which still needs to be passed by higher chambers of the European Union government, will require banks to hold an equivalent amount of fiat for every euro they hold in crypto, CoinDesk’s Jack Schickler reported. While that may sound onerous, it’s not far from collateralization requirements used by blockchain-based lenders such as Maker, the issuer of the dai stablecoin, which have better weathered the crypto contagion.  None of this is hard to interpret: It’s going to be harder for banks to deal with crypto. Regulators have taken a victory lap over supposedly insulating traditional finance from crypto contagion. As Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said, discussing the FHLB loans, “This is why I’ve been warning of the dangers of allowing crypto to become intertwined with the banking system … Under no circumstance should taxpayers be left holding the bag for collapses in the crypto industry – a market brimming with fraud, money laundering and illicit finance.”  See also: EU Plans Digital Euro Bill, Metaverse Policy for May, Commission Says  But, importantly, there are no outright banking bans being suggested, a premise that flies in the face of the commitment to free markets and regulators’ goal of promoting capital formation. So long as the majority of crypto users buy into the crypto economy with fiat and intend to exit with dollars in their pockets, crypto firms will need banks. Likewise, banks need deposits.  The hope is the industry changes enough so the headline and reputational risks Warren mentions remains history. Crypto is already learning to adopt new ways of presenting itself, and will be forever changed by increased governmental supervision and stipulations. Regulation is a sieve – it may filter out products for which there is clear demand, like lending platforms, but may also prevent the next Gemini-Genesis imbroglio.

The U.S.-based crypto exchange saw a small but noteworthy increase in average daily volume (ADV) of $1.6 billion so far in January, which is a 0.3% increase from the previous quarter. By comparison, other U.S. exchanges such as Kraken and Gemini saw declines of 13% and 46% respectively, according to JPM data.  Coinbase’s slight uptick in trading volume also signals change in direction given that the exchange saw an ongoing decline in volume in 2022.  “We think Coinbase has been cultivating a reputation as a reputable, trusted intermediary for some time,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote. “We think that reputation is helping to drive greater market share as activity levels rebound.”  Competitors of Coinbase, including Binance and Gemini, are grappling with the ripple effects of FTX’s collapse, which has triggered increased scrutiny over unregulated exchanges in the industry, making Coinbase one of the few options for investors to trade crypto without significant risk of fraud.  “Unlike a number of Coinbase’s high-profile peers, Coinbase did not have direct exposure to FTX and was insulated from the direct legal and reputational fallout from its demise,” JPM wrote.

42388162,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR8Dl5,1674589350,Celsius Proposes Restructuring to Offer One-Time ‘Meaningful Recovery’ Payout for Most Creditors,"Lawyers for Celsius Network said Tuesday that the bankrupt crypto lender is planning to reinvent itself as a new, publicly traded “recovery corporation” in order to exit the bankruptcy process – something it said could happen in “months.”  Under the newly unveiled plan – which has yet to receive approval from the U.S. Trustee's Office or other regulators – creditors with locked assets above a certain threshold would receive a token, called the Asset Share Token (AST), that reflects the value of their assets. AST holders would either be able to hold their tokens, which lawyers said would entitle them to dividends over time, or sell them on the open market.  The rest of the platform’s customers, which Celsius’ lawyers estimated would be between 60% to 70% of its customer base, would receive a one-time distribution in liquid crypto.  “[The distribution] would be at a discount. We’re not envisioning a full recovery, but it’s a meaningful recovery, Your Honor,” said Ross Kwastaniet, a lawyer for Kirkland & Ellis, the white-shoe law firm representing Celsius. “It would be a one-time distribution in liquid crypto – call it bitcoin, ethereum or stablecoins. Something that has, you know, readily tradable, readily ascertainable market value to everybody who has claims below a certain threshold.”  Celsius’ lawyers did not say what the threshold for receiving a payout would be. Kwastaniet said the company was still in discussions over the dollar amount of the threshold with the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC).  Lawyers for Celsius also stressed that, despite U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn’s recent ruling that assets in Celsius’ Earn program are the property of the exchange’s estate and not customer property, Earn customers would be treated like everyone else in the eventual recovery of assets.  “[Celsius depositors] all have something in common – they all deposited crypto, and they all have a claim for the return of the crypto and we’re focused on doing a plan that treats them equally … the Earn customers, we think, are going to be treated equally,” Kwastaniet said. “And they’re going to be entitled to a significant return of value here. The fact that Earn is property of the estate doesn’t mean that [we lawyers] can go out and have a party with it. It goes back to the customers.”  Recovery corporations and IOU tokens  Kwastaniet told the court that the decision to pursue the formation of a “recovery corporation” came after the company failed to receive any attractive bids for its assets.  “The bids we've received for discrete assets and for the transfer of customer accounts have not been compelling,” Kwastaniet said.  “The debtors can’t just simply distribute their assets and move on, so to speak, because the bidding process has revealed that this would require us to sell many illiquid assets at what we believe are fire-sale prices,” Kwastaniet added. “So, given that, the debtors are focused on placing their assets into a new [company] that would hold those assets and manage them over time to maximize value as markets improve.”  Though Celsius’ proposed solution is different from those that similarly situated firms such as Voyager Digital have pursued, it’s not totally unheard of in the crypto industry.  When crypto exchange Bitfinex was hacked in August 2016 by a still-unknown hacker who robbed the exchange of nearly 120,000 bitcoin, it created tokens, called BFX tokens, each representing the dollar value of crypto lost, and allocated them to victims. BFX holders were then either able to redeem the tokens for their dollar value or exchange them for stock in the exchange.  Mining upheaval  In addition to unveiling their plans for turning Celsius into a new company, lawyers for the bankrupt lending company also asked the court for permission to sell some of its unused mining equipment.  The company’s wholly owned mining subsidiary, Celsius Mining, was previously a major part of Celsius’ arguments that it could one day be profitable again.  Read more: Celsius Lays Out Mining-Focused Reorganization Plan at First Bankruptcy Hearing  Celsius’ mining ""Hail Mary,"" however, has turned out to be more of a fumble as stagnant bitcoin prices and a wave of bankruptcies in the mining industry – including one of Celsius’ major hosting partners, Core Scientific – have yielded less in profits than Celsius was initially banking on.  Celsius’ current CEO, Chris Ferraro, told Judge Glenn at Tuesday’s hearing that the company was seeking permission to sell 2,687 “new-in-box” MicroBT M30S ASIC mining rigs.  Ferraro described them as “some of the least-efficient rigs” in terms of energy efficiency, but told the court that the “north of a million dollars” they could generate if sold could help fund the case.  “And we’re still left with 120,000 rigs approximately to plug in and enjoy the upside to BTC prices, hopefully in the near future,” Ferraro added.

42393913,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3uj,1674587825,MiCA at the Door: How European Crypto Firms Are Getting Ready for Sweeping Legislation,"The European Union’s sweeping Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation is slowly moving toward becoming law, and local crypto companies are getting ready for the change. The new regulations, which will be the law for all 27 EU member countries, apply stricter rules than are now in place in some European countries.  In addition to very detailed rules and limitations for stablecoin issuers, which CoinDesk has been covering in depth, MiCA demands an unprecedented level of transparency from crypto exchanges.  This story is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  Under the legislation, not only must crypto companies keep the public informed about their pricing process and trading volumes in real time, but they must settle all trades the same day those trades happen. Exchanges must keep separate their own funds, including crypto, and funds belonging to their clients. The regulation also explicitly prohibits insider trading.  Most importantly, MiCA introduces a universal licensing approach for all EU member states, making it the most comprehensive legislation of its kind anywhere in the world.  Read also: Europe’s MiCA Crypto Rules Are Coming Soon. Here’s Why They Matter  Frédéric Montagnon, founder of French blockchain company Arianee, told CoinDesk the MiCA licensing and other rules are “more complex, more sophisticated” than those currently established by the French regulator, adding, “During the MICA process, they took a large part of what was done in France and made it deeper.”  At the moment, licensing is only mandatory in France for those crypto companies that provide any kind of crypto custody, meaning they store users’ funds in their own accounts. For those that don’t provide custody services, licensing is optional. MiCA – which as an EU-wide directive must be enacted at the member-state level – will make it obligatory for everyone.  Banking and insurance for crypto  On the first site, things won’t change much for the 60 companies that have already registered with the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) and “have already adapted their processes to what the French regulator told them to do,” Montagnon said. “There is nothing in MiCA that is impossible to reach for a startup.”  However, there’ll be one important change: If the final version of MiCA makes it mandatory for cryptocurrency service providers to get their businesses insured, it will be a headache for startups in France, Montagnon said.  “It’s hard to find someone to insure clients’ funds, especially in crypto, especially after the FTX crash,” Montagnon said. French banks have been unfriendly to crypto firms because it’s also nearly impossible for them to secure an audit by a reputable company. Some local household names among banks do work with select crypto companies (Montagnon won’t say which banks), but for most firms it’s almost impossible to get a bank account.  “The real challenge is to find a bank and insurance. And that’s really disappointing. You pass all the steps, you have your license and the market still says no. I would want to imagine that with MiCA that will change,” Montagnon said, but he is pessimistic that will happen.  In Germany, says Sven Wagenknecht, editor-in-chief of crypto news website BTC-ECHO, getting a bank account is also a pain for crypto startups.  “In Germany, most banks are against crypto,” he told CoinDesk. Smaller banks, such as N26 and Solaris, for example, are friendlier to the industry, but the biggest ones, like Deutsche Bank, are still keeping away from crypto. This may change once a pan-European regulation is in place, he believes: “Banks need some clarity in regulation, and MiCA is a step forward.”  There is another part of MiCA that can push European banks and crypto closer, at least in Germany, Wagenknecht said: MiCA will make applying for a crypto custody license an easier and more transparent process than current German regulation offers.  This will give a green light to the German banks that are interested in providing crypto custody themselves, such as Sparkasse, which has been reportedly working on a crypto trading service, and Hauck & Aufhäuser, which acquired a licensed crypto custodian Kapilendo in 2019.  Securing a crypto custodian license in Germany at the moment is a very taxing process, Wagenknecht said, and just a handful of companies currently possess one. “You have to wait long time and you don’t know what you’re doing wrong – it’s not a very transparent process and it’s very hard for a company without a lot of funding,” he said  John Ehlers, chief operating officer of the Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp, believes crypto companies will find greater comfort under MiCA.  The licenses for virtual assets providers under MiCA, unlike some of the current, lighter registration regimes in Europe (for example, in France) requires detailed disclosures: “MiCA license is a real license, a prudential license. They look at how you run your business. It’s very in-depth,” Ehlers said.  That level of transparency will likely give some peace of mind to banks and other traditional businesses that have been uneasy about crypto so far, Ehlers said. “You’re not at the same footing with the credit institutions, but you’re at the table with them.”  Time to get ready  However, the gap between what a crypto service is doing now to comply with regional laws and what it will have to do under MiCA can be quite wide, so companies must start getting ready now, Ehlers said.  “It’s always more complicated and takes more time than you think. My advice for the industry is you need to start now, prepare yourself for the MiCA application. What does your company do today and what does MiCA require?” Ehlers said.  On the user side of things, the onboarding process might become a bit longer for crypto exchange clients, Ehlers said. Exchanges will need to figure out how suitable a user is for certain kinds of products. At the same time, users will be entitled to more information about the assets listed on exchanges so they can make more educated choices while trading.  After MiCA passes, crypto companies will have 18 months to adapt. It’s hard to tell when exactly the regulation will become law because the vote has already been postponed twice, most recently pushed to April.  In the long run, MiCA will make the life of European crypto services easier, Wagenknecht said, with a more coherent approach towards regulation. But in the beginning there might be some pains harmonizing the existing national regulations with MiCA. One example is Germany’s law for blockchain securities, which is different from MiCA’s approach.  Some experts are already saying MiCA is not comprehensive enough and that the regulators of the world must go further. For example, a research group commissioned by the French government called for special attention to the metaverse, especially to users’ data protection rules, in October. The current text of MiCA does not contain any mentions of the metaverse.  There is also a concern that however profoundly Europe will be regulating crypto, it won’t really work until other parts of the world follow suit.  “There's no point in Europe being on its own, because this is a global development, and we can't put barriers on it,” European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/24/european-union-mica-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1f44a4e4e0c86ff6e3701a8ddeb816f409656b5-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Of the 7,500 tokens available, only 1,818 were minted at the time of writing.

Davidson of Ohio Says","Regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission aren't doing enough when it comes to crypto regulation, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday.  “You've got people that are engaging in overt pump-and-dump scams and getting away with it because the SEC is asleep at the wheel,” Davidson said. “Some seem to get a free pass, and others seem to get their business models killed.”  Davidson, vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, said that even before the collapse of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, “no one’s been happy with the job the SEC has done.""  He gave the example of the SEC's crackdown on celebrity influencer Kim Kardashian and her promotion of ethereummax (EMAX), a token built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Even though Kardashian paid a $1.26 million fine for not disclosing that she was paid to promote the token on social media, ethereummax continues to trade, Davidson noted.  “The results are self-evident. They are not getting the job done,” Davidson said.  Who regulates what  Meanwhile, the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have yet to decide which agency will regulate crypto spot markets.  To address that issue, Davidson said Congress needs to “craft a policy” that can make its way through the House and the Senate. That may begin with stablecoins, which are backed by a reserve asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold and to members of Congress are “concrete and tangible,” he said.  He said lawmakers must figure out the role stablecoins have in the payment systems and with banks and what role the SEC would have.  “They've [the SEC] engaged in regulation by enforcement, and that's frustrated markets quite a lot,” Davidson said.  During a separate segment on ""First Mover,"" SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce also said that regulating through enforcement isn't the best option.  While she said that “it's important to bring enforcement actions when there’s fraud,” and such cases fall within the agency’s jurisdiction, she also said that “there really is a better approach” to crypto regulation and that depends on what Congress decides and which government agency is granted that authority.

7997294,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517324,1674586837,"Bitcoin Surges To $23,000 As Miners Sales Sees Multi-Year Low","Bitcoin has continued with its bullishness as it surged its price above the USD$23,000 level, a positive signal amid miners reduced the sales of their mined coins. On-chain flows flagged by Bitifinex analysts indicate that the amount of Bitcoin moved from Bitcoin mining addresses to wallets owned by cryptocurrency exchanges has declined to multi-year lows. Selling Power Low, Favorable For A BTC Rally As per a Bitfinex analyst, Bitcoin miner sales are at a three-year low. The report claims that the selling could be a sign that Bitcoin miners are in the mood to accumulate coins as they expect the surge of prices of the flagship cryptocurrency. The declined Bitcoin sales from mining companies mean low selling pressure from these market actors. Therefore, it signals bullishness for the broader market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches One-Month High As Mini Bull Run Continues The analysts, however, stated that the recent uptick in Bitcoin price might witness a correction as investors try to recoup their profits amid the current price surges. The analysts identified large wallet sizes (>$1M) as the majorly responsible for accumulating Bitcoin. They further said such wallets, as well as major market actors, are the ones creating the buying pressure that comes after the FTX saga and a series of bearish events generally witnessed last year. The analysts mentioned that since the second week of January, the numbers of wallets with $1,000 and $10,000 worth of Bitcoin have increased. The analyst further acknowledged that the trading activities of retail investors had accompanied the uptrend. According to the figure above, the current low Bitcoin selling pressure coincided with the lowest sales in November last year. The current low level signals a green (bullish) indicator for the cryptocurrency. When miners sell more BTC, it implies a bearish for the coin value. Conversely, when mining firms don’t have the selling urge, this suggests a bullish trend for the crypto market.

As highlighted above, the rise in Bitcoin value could be attributed to whales committed to accumulating coins amid surging prices.

42388170,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR8ERB,1674586714,French Lawmakers Soften Stance on Compulsory Crypto Licenses,"Crypto companies in France would have to follow extra conflict of interest and consumer protection rules as of 202, under proposals voted on by lawmakers at the National Assembly on Tuesday.  The Assembly voted 61 in favor of, and 33 against, the proposed measure. But the move will likely lead to sighs of relief in the crypto industry because it represents a softening of a stance by the Assembly’s Finance Committee and by the French Senate, which favored a more heavy-handed requirement for firms to hold a compulsory license by October.  Like other members of the European Union, France is preparing for the arrival of new bloc-wide legislation known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA). In the wake of the FTX collapse, lawmakers want to ensure national procedures aren’t creating any new loopholes.  In December, Senator Hervé Maurey said crypto companies that aren’t registered with France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) by Oct. 1, 2023, should be obliged to seek a license – something that requires extra checks on governance and financial management, and which no crypto firm has yet succeeded in gaining.  Maurey was worried companies might otherwise seek to register in France (without seeking a license) as a way of avoiding MiCA rules for a further 18 months, given grandfathering rules set out in EU law, and were supported by the AMF. But the industry said the Senate’s plan was harmful and unworkable.  Under the plans agreed by the National Assembly on Tuesday, crypto companies applying to be registered after January 2024 would face extra rules to manage conflicts of interest, separate client assets and publish their fees. That represents a halfway measure between registration and full licensing that prepares the ground for MiCA’s arrival, its author Daniel Labaronne said.  “This amendment looks to select more reliable players for future registrations,” without abandoning the authorization system in place in France for a number of years, said Labaronne’s amendment.  “Making a French license entirely compulsory while other members of the EU are moving towards MiCA under its planned timetable would prove ineffective to achieve the goal of protecting consumers,” added Labaronne, who is from President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party.  Crypto advocates have previously voiced concerns that the requirements to secure a license, including to be insured and meet cybersecurity norms, impose unreasonable burdens on the industry and on regulators.  The vote will find favor in an industry that complains licenses are time-consuming, if not impossible, to obtain in practice. In a statement sent ahead of the vote regarding the amendment, lobby group ADAN told CoinDesk that it and the industry “very much welcome the pragmatic and proportionate approach reflected in these proposals.”  The changes proposed allow France to respond to concerns relating to the FTX collapse while allowing a better-adapted regime for emerging players and boosting innovation, French digital minister Jean-Noël Barrot told lawmakers during the debate.  MiCA, set to come into effect around the beginning of 2025, would allow an extra 18-month grace period for companies already registered in France before they have to comply with strictures on governance and reserve management.

Anyways, I’m OOO this week, so if you need anything email someone else.  The crypto industry went on a rehab tour last week in Davos, Switzerland, among the world’s elite at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. To my surprise, there was an audience interested in what the industry looks like now.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Snowcapped  The narrative  The industry projected strength and all of that good stuff during this week’s meeting in Davos. And there was an audience – in at least some of the panels – of people who aren’t normally part of the industry.  Why it matters  Obviously, FTX was a looming shadow over crypto’s presence in Switzerland. And as my colleagues and I wrote last week, the industry had a much lighter presence in 2023 than it did last May. Even without FTX’s collapse, we would still be in a bear market, so that makes sense.  Breaking it down  ""Crypto"" barely came up at some of the panels from the industry during last week's World Economic Forum (WEF) conference or during the side events in Davos, Switzerland. There were discussions about specific issues within the industry or about use cases for blockchain technology (and I was told the phrase ""use cases"" is getting phased out for ""case studies""), but the actual word didn’t come up.  Instead, you had the industry talking about issues that could be adjacent to crypto, such as data storage and sharing, or sub-issues within crypto like stablecoins. And you saw public officials speaking to use cases for the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies.  CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey wrote about what he saw, and also noted that whatever the industry may want, it won’t be able to escape the “crypto” term right now.  And yet, that may not actually matter. While the industry did have a smaller presence, the panels that did happen were substantive. The official WEF had more panels related to crypto and crypto-adjacent topics this year than last. The speakers at the side events represented the United Nations, NASA, CERN, BlackRock, the U.S. Congress, the Ukraine Parliament and a host of other traditional heavyweights.  These speakers didn’t wander onto a stage hosted by a crypto company by accident. Their willingness to be affiliated with the industry, even as loosely as a speaker, is suggestive.  Of course, the industry is currently still barreling full tilt toward adding to its impressively large dumpster fire status, so we’ll have to wait and see what the long term looks like.

7994747,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517291,1674583217,Repeat Of April 2019? Bitcoin Rally Shows Similar Break Above These Key Levels,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin has broken above these three key levels in a manner reminiscent of the rally in April 2019. Bitcoin Breakout Shows Initial Similarities To April 2019 Rally According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, BTC has broken above the three investor cost-basis levels for the first time since the COVID-19 crash and the 2018-2019 bear market. The relevant indicator here is the “realized price,” to understand the concept of the “realized cap” it needs to be looked at first. The realized cap is a capitalization model for Bitcoin that assumes that each coin in the circulating supply has its real value as the price at which it was last moved rather than the current BTC price (which the normal market cap uses for its calculation). Now, from the realized cap, a “realized price” can be obtained by dividing the metric by the total number of coins in circulation. Since the realized cap accounted for the prices at which investors bought their coins (which is to say, their cost basis), the realized price can be thought of as the average acquisition price in the market. This means that if the normal price of Bitcoin dips below this indicator, the average holder can be assumed to have entered a state of loss. While this realized price is the average cost basis for the entire market, the metric can also be defined for only specific groups of investors. The BTC market can be divided into two primary cohorts: short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs). Investors who bought their coins within the last 155 days fall into the STHs, while those holding them since before that threshold are included in the LTHs.

Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for the entire market, as well as for these two holder groups separately, over the last few years: BTC seems to have broken above all these levels recently | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As the above graph shows, Bitcoin had broken above the STH cost basis and the entire market’s realized price earlier in the latest rally, suggesting that the average STH and the overall average investor was back in profit. In the most recent continuation to the rally, the crypto has now surged above the LTH cost basis of $22,400. This means that the average investor in every segment is now in the green. Related Reading: Bitcoin Puell Multiple Starts To Leave Bear Market Zone, Bull Rally Here? The last time Bitcoin displayed a breakout above all these levels was following the black swan COVID-19 crash, which had briefly taken the coin below these prices. A similar trend also formed in April 2019, when the bear market of that cycle ended, and a bullish transition took place. Though it’s early to tell right now, this similarity between the two rallies could hint about the path that the current one might also end up following. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,900, up 8% in the last week.

Hydro-Québec didn't name a successor to Brochu – who joined the company as CEO in April 2020 – but said the board will recommend its candidate, with the ultimate appointment to come from the Québec Cabinet.  Last year, the utility firm proposed to Canada's energy regulator to suspend the allocation of new 270 megawatts (MW) power supply, already planned for the blockchain industry. The proposal didn't explicitly mention which part of that industry was being targeted, but the Canadian province has been an ideal place for crypto miners to set up due to its abundant sources of clean, renewable energy.  Read more: Why Crypto Miners Are Expanding Beyond Quebec  Miners who have their operations in the province such as Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Bitfarms (BITF) clarified, saying that after speaking to Hydro-Québec they confirmed their access to power would continue to remain in place.  Energy is one of the largest costs for crypto miners and the companies thus tend to build their operations en masse in the regions offering cheaper sources of electricity such as Texas and Quebec. However, their enormous power consumption has sparked a continued global debate among policymakers, with some arguing it puts tremendous strain on local power grid, adversely impacting other consumers. Meanwhile, supporters of crypto miners say their operations help absorb excess energy from the grid and incentivize more renewable sources of power.

Bitzlato allegedly processed over $700M of illicit funds, including ~$15M in ransomware proceeds. The U.S. Justice Department said Bitzlato touted the laxity of its background checks on clients, Reuters reported .

B-Token Disparity In other news, Binance admitted that it mistakenly kept collateral for some digital assets it issues in the same wallet as funds belonging to customers of its platform. A Binance spokesperson clarified that there was no commingling as it was a clerical issue, and not funds being mixed or used for other purposes. Binance issues its own versions of third-party tokens to make them usable on other blockchains as cryptos are only compatible with the blockchain they were built on. It issued 94 Binance Bridge pegged tokens (B-Tokens), Bloomberg reported , and reserves for close to half of these are stored in a cold wallet called Binance 8. Binance 8 is said to contain more assets than required for the number of B-Tokens issued. ""Binance is aware of this mistake and is in the process of transferring these assets to dedicated collateral wallets,"" a company spokesperson told Bloomberg, adding that tokens held with Binance ""continue to be backed 1:1"". The issue comes at a time when the safety of user funds in exchanges is being called into question. If an exchange is facing a liquidity crunch or an increase in redemption requests, users may not be able to access their funds if they are kept in the same wallet as collateral.

The arguments will take place at 9:30 a.m. ET on March 7, which is sooner than Grayscale had anticipated.  In a tweet on Tuesday, Grayscale said that “we previously anticipated oral arguments to be as soon as Q2 2023, so having them scheduled to begin on March 7 is welcome news.”  Separately, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein reiterated on CNBC on Tuesday that the company would consider making a tender offer to redeem shares of the trust if it runs out of options to convert the trust into an ETF.  “If we do exhaust all the judicial options to challenge the SEC stance on this product, we would entertain working constructively with regulators and shareholders to offer a tender offer,” Sonnenshein told CNBC.  Sonnenshein did not disclose details of the potential tender offer, but in a letter to shareholders in December Grayscale noted that one option is to tender an offer for up to 20% of outstanding GBTC shares.  Grayscale’s application to convert GBTC into an ETF was rejected by the SEC in June. Grayscale shortly thereafter filed suit against the SEC, arguing that the agency's logic for denying the application was “flawed” and “inconsistently applied.  GBTC shares have been trading at a discount to the price of the underlying asset, bitcoin, since February 2021. It is currently trading at a 41% discount, according to data from TradeBlock.

42393912,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3pb,1674579708,India Has Clamped Down on Crypto. What Will It Do With Its G-20 Power?,"A singular event has given India an opportunity to shape global policy for everything involving crypto – its presidency of the Group of 20 (G-20). Its term, which began in December, puts the country in the driver's seat as the developed world looks to define the future of money.  The presidency comes after India announced steep crypto taxes on Feb. 1, 2022, that were blasted by crypto companies operating in the country. As a result, Indians moved more than$3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges between February, when the taxes were announced, and October 2022, after the new taxes were implemented, according to the Esya Centre, a New Delhi-based technology policy think tank.  There's a lot that could happen for the crypto industry in India and how the nation regulates it. What India does during its G-20 presidency may provide some clues.  This feature is part of CoinDesk Policy Week, a comprehensive look at the outlook for crypto regulation and legislation. Amitoj Singh is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in India.  India’s year-long G-20 presidency gives the nation the power to set the crypto agenda for the intergovernmental forum. India can now bring together different stakeholders – the 19 countries and the European Union that make up the G-20, which together represent over 85% of global GDP – with invited international institutions including the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated the G-20 presidency is an opportunity for the nation. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that “how to regulate crypto assets” will be one of the presidency’s priorities.  Where crypto comes in  The crypto-related discussions will take place as part of the G-20’s Finance Track. Crypto has been included as part of the working group titled “Financial Sector Issues.” This is the only working group in which discussions directly involve G-20 finance and central bank deputies, signifying the priority crypto-related discussions have been given. (The seven other working groups have senior staff of finance ministries and central banks leading discussions.)  The first meeting of the financial working group was held in the middle of December, when “each member presented their stand on the global crypto regulation,” a senior official familiar with the discussions told CoinDesk. The second meeting will be held Feb. 24-25.  Read More: India Looks to Coordinate Global Crypto Rulemaking as It Assumes G-20 Presidency  Thus far, FSB’s “comprehensive” international crypto rules have served as the world’s blueprint. Its discussion papers have facilitated multilateral discussions. But India made a major change by giving the IMF more of a role in crypto negotiations for the duration of the nation's presidency. Under India’s presidency, deliberations will focus on contentious issues such as crypto-asset risk assessments.  It hasn't taken long for two broad camps to emerge, according to two people familiar with the discussions.  “Emerging economies are wary of the proliferation of crypto assets due to dollarization concerns,” one person who is familiar with India’s crypto-related discussions told CoinDesk, referring to the widespread use of dollar-denominated crypto instead of government-regulated money. “Developed economies have capital controls, emerging markets don’t. And the developed nations don’t have an answer to this concern.”  By September, when India hosts the G-20 Summit in New Delhi, officials are hopeful of a collective agreed-upon position steered by the IMF.  India’s current position  Meanwhile, the Indian central bank has not changed its position that cryptocurrencies should be prohibited. The government, through the finance ministry, has said global coordination is required for a regulatory framework for crypto. Without that coordination, no jurisdiction’s individual crypto legislation will be successful.  “The finance ministry and government have to think about the political economy while the central bank looks at the economy,” said another person familiar with the thinking of both the government and the central bank. Both want to avoid what they consider the systemic risk of a parallel economy – one without government supervision, which crypto would encourage.  This is why the Indian central bank has repeatedly advocated for a complete ban on crypto while the government has stopped short of a ban, instead imposing stiff taxes.  The thinking of the people in power in India has evolved on crypto. Publicly, opposition politicians have berated the government for imposing stiff taxes. But privately, when tasked with the responsibility of protecting India’s investors as part of a parliamentary committee on finance, the government has chided the crypto industry for doing too little to mitigate the risks associated with the industry like terrorism financing.  In short, where a person of power stands on crypto depends on where he or she sits.  A minister tasked with skill-development, entrepreneurship, electronics and information technology has supported the technology, saying, “There is nothing that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.” It is not entirely clear what he means by that because India has not laid out a clear legal process for crypto.  Read more: Jesse Hamilton - After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  What India has done is create an uncertain status quo.  “I don’t wait till regulation comes into place for taxing people who are earning profits,” the Indian Finance Minister said when asked how a nation can tax something that it doesn’t acknowledge is legal.  Which is why the G-20 presidency is forcing India to crystalize its position on crypto. Two recent events have put a spotlight on this.  The first was a closed-door focus group meeting involving officials of more than 10 emerging-market economies earlier this month in New Delhi, where the consensus was that crypto assets are “risky” and not “worth it.” This is expected to represent the view of the Indian Central Bank. The IMF is expected to include the observations on crypto in an upcoming discussion paper, potentially offering to replace the FSB’s blueprint for the G-20 talks, a person familiar with the discussions told CoinDesk.  The second was a discussion held at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), an autonomous research institute based in New Delhi. It was a first in terms of bringing policy think-tanks and industry players together. The government wanted to learn about the latest developments in crypto. Three different people confirmed to CoinDesk the developments of this meeting.  The finance ministry and government have to think about the political economy while India's central bank looks at the economy.  “I think [these discussions have] all been triggered by India’s G-20 presidency,” said a senior industry representative. “They [India] want to lead. They can’t be in a position where the majority of the G-20 nations are more informed about [crypto]. And they were keen on understanding the industry.”  Another person attending said the government’s representatives asked questions and “listened without engaging much.”  A government official asked, “Is the risk of investing in crypto for an Indian equivalent to the risk of an American investing in crypto?” said a person from a research organization.  All of these discussions have resulted in the Indian government sharpening its position:If there is to be a globally coordinated crypto regulatory framework, which many nations want, then it should be optional.  “It shouldn’t be that if one nation is following crypto regulation, the other must also,” said a senior official party to the discussions.  The IMF and NIPFP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Day of hope: Feb. 1, 2023  On Feb. 1, 2022, as part of revealing the annual budget, the government announced the 30% tax on crypto profits and 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions. Within 10 days crypto trading volumes plummeted, in some cases more than 70%.  The 30% tax went into effect on April 1, while the more controversial 1% TDS came into force on July 1.  The taxes became effective at a time when macroeconomic factors exacerbated the dire prospects facing the industry. Crypto trading had tailed off dramatically even before the taxes went into effect.  According to Chainalysis’ 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20, India ranked first in four of the five methods to measure a nation’s crypto adoption. Its poor P2P exchange trade volume ranking (82) placed it fourth behind Vietnam, Philippines and Ukraine but ahead of fifth-place United States.  In the meeting with the finance ministry, the industry and think tanks referred to this unappealing data and said they are now hopeful the government has taken notice and will adjust the tax regime. The Bharat Web 3 Association, representing the Indian crypto industry, has called for a change in the taxation structure as part of the new budget to be announced on Feb 1, 2023.  In order of priority, the association wants a reduction in the TDS ideally to 0.01%, or at minimum to 0.1%,at par with the securities transaction law, or establishing progressive taxes on gains instead of the flat 30% tax and allowing losses to offset gains. The securities transaction tax is a direct tax levied on every purchase and sale of securities that are listed on Indian stock exchanges.

India launched wholesale and retail CBDC pilots last year. The retail pilot is meant for the private sector and citizens. The wholesale pilot is restricted to financial institutions. India wants to launch its retail central bank digital currency nationwide by the end of 2023, several people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  The focus has been on the retail pilot. While several banks and cities are involved, a true picture of the results will emerge in the coming months.  In the meantime, India is grappling with two big questions regarding its CBDC: how will the central bank secure citizens’ privacy, and what is the public policy use case of the CBDC when you already have a successful digital payments system through its unified payments interface (UPI).  “While India’s digital rupee will work to complement the payments system, the pilots are ongoing and will give us a better understanding of all the best public use cases,” said a senior official familiar with India’s CBDC pilots.  In short, there’s a lot that could happen in Indian crypto regulation and development in the months ahead.

7992161,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517270,1674579650,"Money Leaves ADA, SOL To Small Cap Altcoins, Here’s Where It’s Headed","With the crypto market rally, altcoins have benefitted just as much as bitcoin. Digital assets across the space have been able to return to their pre-FTX collapse levels, signaling the start of a bull run. However, as the market begins to settle into this new normal, investors are moving gains around from larger cap assets to take advantage of possible price movement in smaller altcoins. Cycling Out Money To Small Cap Altcoins A recent report from on-chain data aggregation website Santiment shows that investors may be moving money out of larger cap coins such as Cardano and Solana and moving to small cap coins. This paints a picture of a rotation of funds rather than outright pulling money out of the crypto sector. Related Reading: Bullish Indicator: Bitcoin Shakes Off Genesis Bankruptcy Filing Santiment notes that the large gains recorded by the likes of Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot are now being moved into smaller altcoins. Most of these coins are top 200 and below tokens with market caps lower than $300 million. The cycling of funds into these smaller altcoins is shown by their address activity. The image shared by Santiment shows a significant uptick in the address activities of these coins. Most notably, the uptick was seen from last week as a lot of these larger cap coins hit new local peaks. Money flows out from large cap to small cap altcoins | Source: Santiment The small cap coins mentioned in the report are TRADE, RBN, SLP, PLSPAD, POND, MITX, MTH, and CBG. Most of these are coins flying under the radar. Ribbon Finance (RBN) which is the most prominent on the list is only at a $139.7 million market cap but has risen 24% in the last seven days. What Happens To These Tokens? The tokens mentioned by Santiment are still small enough that they can see prominent movement with just a fraction of the amount needed to move the prices of the likes of SOL and ADA. This means that if this rotation of gains from large caps to small cap altcoins continues, then these tokens could see positive movement in the coming days. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could See Another 30% Rally However, for coins with such low market caps, just as it is easy to pump their prices, it is also just as easy to drag their prices down with sell-offs from a few large holders. It becomes a double-edged sword for investors who follow the movement. On one hand, it could mean very large gains in a short time, but on the other hand, could see them lose money fast. A good thing about this though is that attention is being spread out instead of just focusing on a handful of coins. As wallet activity rises for these altcoins, it could trigger exploration into similarly priced altcoins which could benefit from new interest.

42388175,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR8Ejt,1674578532,Bullish Token Unlocks Buck Bear Market Trend in Spur to Altcoin Season,"The overcrowded short trade in the lead-up to token unlocks is beginning to backfire, with several altcoins showing signs of strength into what is normally perceived to be a bearish event.  This week Axie Infinity (AXS) surged by 40% in the lead-up to $64 million worth of previously locked tokens being unleashed on the market. This took onlookers by surprise as an increase in supply typically leads to a reduction in value, and also gives early investors or project team members an opportunity to liquidate their initial investment.  But AXS is not alone in bucking the trend – decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX's cryptocurrency has outperformed its peers with a 64% rally this month in spite of a token unlock coming on Feb. 2. And Aptos, the token that underlies the layer 1 blockchain that came out of Facebook's failed Diem project, has been a top-performing asset since the turn of the year, surging by 283% despite a notable token unlock that took place on Jan. 12.  The magnitude of gains has rejuvenated the altcoin market as a whole, with CoinDesk's DeFi Index (DCF), which tracks the price of 43 cryptocurrencies related to decentralized finance, printing a 49.35% increase since Jan. 1, surpassing the rise of the Bitcoin index, which is up by 37.92% over the same period.  According to Unlocks Calendar, a website that tracks upcoming token unlocks, the trend is being caused by projects withholding positive news until sell pressure climaxes before a scheduled unlock.  ""As we experience positive market momentum, teams with upcoming unlocks will release good news that they withheld for months when the market was dead,"" Unlocks Calendar tweeted on Jan. 14. ""The goal would be riding positive market moves to pump the price just before unlocks.""  There is also a sophisticated trading element to the value increase. Historically, in the cases of the IMX and APE tokens late last year, token unlocks caused a period of downside price action. This prompted traders to short the tokens before the event, but based on the recent flurry of short liquidations on AXS, it appears this trade has become overcrowded, leaving it vulnerable to the other side due to a lack of liquidity.  Liquidity across altcoins is significantly thinner than for major crypto assets such as bitcoin and ether. Market depth, which quantifies liquidity by working out how much capital is needed to move an asset in each direction, is currently at $49 million for a 2% move on bitcoin, whereas only $357,520 is needed to move AXS 2%, according to CoinMarketCap.  This means that when short positions pile up leading into an event, astute traders can capitalize on thin order books by initiating a short squeeze by purchasing the asset and going long. The short positions then either get liquidated or force closed, which triggers positive momentum to the upside.  The entire cryptocurrency market cap has risen by over $250 billion since Jan. 1 to $1.05 trillion, caused in part by a resurgence in the speculative altcoin market, a move commonly referred to as ""alt season.""",POSITIVE,AXS,ALTCOIN | AXS | MARKET | TRADING | APT,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/24/bullish-token-unlocks-buck-bear-market-trend-in-spur-to-altcoin-season,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fde84cadb8f296129e099039722986883421e527-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform launched on the Solana blockchain in December 2021 and raised $35 million in a seed round backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Solana Labs, Animoca, Coinbase Ventures and others. It now hosts dozens of Web3 games, NFTs and tournaments on its site and offers a suite of developer tools to help onboard new creators.  The company said in a press release that expanding into Polygon will help it ""focus on user acquisition and provide the blockchain tooling and financial infrastructure necessary to spur successful game development."" Its F Studio product suite will now offer a Polygon-based launchpad, marketplace, tournaments, developer SDK, game launcher and sign-in with Fractal service.  In addition, Polygon Ventures, the company behind the Ethereum scaling system, will be making an unspecified ""strategic investment"" in Fractal to help expand its services. Thirty of Polygon's top games will work with Fractal on a campaign of tournaments and activations to lead-up to the Game Developer Conference in March.  ""Inspired by Justin’s learnings from founding Twitch, Fractal’s mission has been to relentlessly support Web3 game developers with everything they need to build the future of gaming,"" said Robin Chan, co-founder of Fractal. ""From user acquisition to blockchain tooling to financial infrastructure, we put the framework in place so they can focus on successful game development.""  The move is another win for Polygon as it brings new projects and major companies into its ecosystem.

Here’s a quick glance at SOL performance of late: SOL metrics and trustworthiness score looking positive Solana’s TVL seen to jump higher Solana rolls out Saga Pass Cards There is sizeable growth seen both in terms of NFT with the rollout of the Saga Pass Cards and market cap.

Related Reading: Aptos Climbs 75% – What Keeps APT In The Green In Last 7 Days SOL Price Gaining Traction According to price monitoring by Coingecko, SOL price is currently trading at $24.28, up 3.0% in the last seven days. Evidently, following the FTX crash, short-term traders and the bulls were fixated on SOL which unlocked roughly 100 million coins from different contacts which could have punched a hole in the market, driving the price of SOL to null or $0. But, that didn’t happen as SOL holders chose to hold out their coins waiting for better days and not panic and sell their SOL holdings. True enough, the market gained traction and recovered with most assets moving north, including SOL which made the investors extremely happy with the gains. SOL total market cap at $8.9 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com With this hypergrowth happening with Solana, the investors decided to accumulate longs which triggered SOL’s open interest to accelerate higher. As a matter of fact, around $460 million worth of orders is currently open at crypto derivative exchanges. Could this be bad news for SOL? Now, the open interest really isn’t the culprit here as it can’t really pull SOL price down but it’s the increased number of longs that could trigger a squeeze brought about by SOL holders rapidly selling their holdings to counterpunch future risks. On the brighter side, nothing is set in stone and SOL holders and investors need not panic right now as SOL has not gained much momentum yet to trigger millions in the liquidation of assets.

42388173,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR8EfD,1674572403,"Crypto Recovery Specialist Asset Reality Raises $4.91M to Hire Engineers, Expand Ops","London-based Asset Reality has raised $4.91 million in seed money to build a full service solution for crypto asset recovery, according to a press release provided exclusively to CoinDesk.  The fundraising was led by Framework Ventures, TechStars, SGH Capital and Outrun Ventures' Chris Adelsbach. The company plans to use the funds to triple its engineering staff and expand operations.  Traditional asset recovery has existed for decades; but the decentralized nature and irreversibility of cryptocurrency transactions presents a unique challenge. Asset Reality believes it can solve that conundrum by building a one-stop shop for tracking and recovering stolen digital assets.  Read more: Craig Wright’s Blacklist Resembles Bitcoin ‘Kill Switch’ Satoshi Never Followed Through On  “The existing asset recovery system only recovers about 1% of criminal proceeds globally, with the emergence of digital assets adding more complexity to those efforts,” Asset Reality CEO and co-founder Aidan Larkin said in the release.  According to blockchain security firm Certik, 2022 was crypto’s worst year in terms of hacks, scams and attacks. The industry lost a staggering $3.7 billion to illicit activity.  To add insult to injury, 2023 kicked off with a hack that sent shock waves through Crypto Twitter when longtime Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dash Jr. tweeted that hackers had compromised his hot and cold wallets on New Year’s Day and siphoned off over 200 bitcoin (BTC).  Dash later tagged the FBI in a follow-up tweet, although it’s unclear if law enforcement ever got involved. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (also known as CZ) was quick to offer his assistance.  “Not everyone is a developer who can get CZ's attention, and this is why we exist,” Larkin told CoinDesk in an interview. “If someone like that comes on to the platform, we're taking the data about the loss that they've incurred and we're broadcasting that through our partners and through the analytics tools. So the first action is to do exactly what CZ mentioned.”  Per the release, the Asset Reality team has specific experience with crypto asset recovery including “managing and liquidating” bitcoin in the aftermath of the epic Silk Road case. More recently, the company has delved into all manner of digital assets.  “We manage seized [non-fungible tokens] for the Belgian government, for example,” Larkin said. “They will be sold by auction when the court order is granted, if the person is found guilty.”  Larkin envisions a future where stolen crypto will be easily restored just as stolen credit card funds are routinely restored today.  “Asset Reality has a team of ex-law enforcement and private sector asset recovery practitioners. We've investigated, we've seized, we've recovered, we've been to court,” Larkin explained. “So it's trying to fill that big gap that currently exists where you've got best practices, you've got good tools, but everything just isn't gelling together. That’s where we slot in.”  Read more: Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network Suffers $625M Exploit",POSITIVE,BTC,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | BNB,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/24/crypto-recovery-specialist-asset-reality-raises-491m-to-hire-engineers-expand-ops,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2170e5c4ecef92ed1fe6021223d13e6124cea973-5500x3667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Franklin has been the target of this exploit for the second time this week with the first one being January 20. Hey @opensea can you PLEASE fix your stolen ape policy?

According to Franklin’s tweets, the flagged apes can’t be sold since they are subjected for review. These stolen assets shouldn’t have been sold in the open market according to OpenSea’s stolen item policy. The exploit works as the attacker uses OpenSea’s “Match Advance Order” system to “Mint” and sell it to Franklin. According to recent news, the total amount of Bored Ape and Mutant Ape NFTs being stolen has now reached nearly $20 million. It happened again – second time in a week someone has exploited OpenSea’s stolen ape policy to sell to my collection offer after it was already marked as “under review for suspicious activity” (yellow mark).

The NFT marketplace has not responded since the news hit the market. Bored Ape. Image: Forbes ApeCoin Still Showing Potential Even with the negative news surrounding BAYC, the token is still poised to see gains in the coming days. At the time of writing, the charts show that ApeCoin bulls are able to break through the $5.867 resistance. For the bullish momentum to continue, the token should close today above its current resistance which would give the bulls a chance to move upwards. However, if the resistance holds, a retest of the $5.063 support could occur in the coming days.

The Core API handles the potential blockchain forks, upgrades and network interruptions for an app. A NFT API makes it easier to find non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their metadata, and the Token API lets users look up tokens by wallet, token transfers and token details, according to the QuickNode website.  The funding round comes a little over a year after the $35 million Series A led by Tiger Global – a traditional finance giant with its own ties to FTX. QuickNode has since grown its user base by more than 400% and hired more than 90 team members around the world, according to the company.  The near-term road map includes plans for QuickNode to achieve decentralization by the end of 2023 without compromising security or uptime, said Nabutovsky. QuickNode has some unspecified new products in beta testing, and the company remains committed to developer support, which is why the platform offers a free tier for test builds.  “We want to be the first platform that [developers] touch when they build, because when that project is ready to launch, we’re here for them and they’re already familiar with our platform,” explained Nabutovsky.

42411244,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVFO,1674568238,Why Tax Deferral for Crypto-to-Crypto Like-Kind Exchanges Would Be Good for Us All,"With the 118th U.S. Congress barreling its way in, right behind the lame duck session hobbling its way into history, it’s time to round out an attractive, legislative agenda for the blockchain sector for 2023 and beyond.  Todd White is the founder of, and Ralph Benko the senior counselor to, the American Blockchain PAC. This article is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  The blockchain industry, and the American economy, would benefit from tax deferrals for crypto-to-crypto transactions (e.g., BTC to ETH). This would be akin to the Internal Revenue Code’s Section 1031 like-kind exchange provision for real estate transactions.  Real estate investors can, within broad limits, “trade in” an apartment building for a shopping center or medical center or McMansion – or other property – while deferring realization of taxation on increased value until they cash out. Makes sense!  Until an investor starts consuming her profits – e.g., cashing out to buy yachts, caviar, champagne, Chippendale furniture (or dancers) – it really is better for the American economy to allow her to temporarily roll over her profits, tax deferred, into a “like-kind” asset.  Capital assets are the source of productivity and, thus, American equitable prosperity. That purpose – to “promote the general welfare” – is one of the six purposes of the U.S. Constitution cited in its preamble.  Arguably, failing to allow deferral of taxation on a like-kind exchange – such as crypto-to-crypto (until gains eventually are realized in a legal tender currency such as U.S. dollars) – could be considered unconstitutional, at least in spirit (since the preamble is considered non binding).  Look to precedent! What does the Section 1031 like-kind exchange deferral for real estate look like? Here’s what everybody’s favorite federal agency, the Internal Revenue Service, has to say:  Like-kind exchanges – when you exchange real property used for business or held as an investment solely for other business or investment property that is the same type or ""like-kind"" – have long been permitted under the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, if you make a like-kind exchange, you are not required to recognize a gain or loss under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031. If, as part of the exchange, you also receive other (not like-kind) property or money, you must recognize a gain to the extent of the other property and money received.  What kind of economic impact does this have? Per 1031 Builds America (a pro-1031 advocacy group): “Section 1031 like-kind exchanges play an important role in the U.S. economy: encouraging investment, contributing to federal, state and local tax revenue, reducing the use of leverage and improving liquidity in the market. From both the micro and macro views, the studies recommend the retention of Section 1031.”  The economist-authors of this study concluded that repealing the like-kind exchange deferral for real estate would cause:  Real property transactions [to] decline, inhibiting the stream of economic activity generated by exchange transactions  The cost of capital [to] increase  Average holding periods [to] increase  The velocity of investment in the economy would decrease  Real estate values would drop  Rents would rise  The economy would contract  Real estate, of course, is a much bigger segment of the U.S. economy than crypto. Yet, crypto is nontrivial and similar impacts can be expected. As Nir Kaissar observed in July in a Bloomberg guest essay, Americans who lost money in the crypto crash could be attributing to a wider dour market sentiment.  “Since late 2021, cryptocurrencies have given up $2 trillion of market value, their global market cap plummeting by two-thirds to about $1 trillion. … I’m not suggesting that cryptocurrencies are solely or even mostly responsible for these broader economic trends, not least because it’s hard to pinpoint how much of the global crypto gains and subsequent losses can be attributed to Americans. But they are a factor, and possibly a big one,” Kaissar wrote.  See also: Top 5 Crypto Tax Questions, Answered  And if crypto could have an impact on public sentiment on the way down, so might making crypto holders happy have wider repercussions. After all, equitable prosperity is consistently at the top of voters’ concerns. As the Pew Charitable Research Center reported in November:  “In the October survey, about eight-in-10 registered voters (79%) say the economy is very important when making their decision about who to vote for in the 2022 congressional elections, the highest share saying this about any of the 18 issues the survey asked about.”  It therefore makes good sense to amend the tax code to allow deferral of realization of taxable gains on proceeds of crypto sales reinvested in other cryptocurrencies.

Here’s what it may mean for DOGE’s price. Dogecoin Whale Sends 57 Million DOGE To Crypto Exchange Coinbase As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive Dogecoin transaction has taken place on the blockchain today. In total, this transfer involved the movement of 57,056,400 DOGE, worth upwards of $5 million at the time the transaction was sent. Since the amount here is so large, the entity behind the transfer is likely to be a whale, or at least a group made up of multiple large investors. Due to the sheer volume of tokens involved in transactions like these, they can sometimes cause noticeable ripples in the price of the asset. But what change may potentially be produced in the crypto’s value from such a movement of coins depends on several factors, with the exact intent behind the transaction being the main one. Related Reading: Bitcoin Puell Multiple Starts To Leave Bear Market Zone, Bull Rally Here? Here are some specifics surrounding the latest Dogecoin whale transaction, which may shed some light on why the investor decided to make this move: Looks like the holder only had to pay a small fee of $0.21 for this massive transfer to be possible | Source: Whale Alert As can be seen above, the sending address for this Dogecoin transaction was an unknown address, which is a type of address that’s unattached to any known centralized platform, and thus is likely a personal wallet. The receiver in this case was an address affiliated with the crypto exchange Coinbase. Note that the transaction details show there being another receiver present for this transaction, with the total amount of the transfer being almost $10.5 million. But on closer inspection, it’s clear that it’s just the same address as the sender, meaning that this output is only showing the amount still remaining in the original wallet (that is, a bit more than $5.3 million, as $5.1 million went towards Coinbase). Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Go On $1.4B Buying Spree A transaction like this where coins move from a personal wallet to an exchange is called an exchange inflow. Investors usually deposit to exchanges for selling purposes, so inflows can have bearish implications for the price of the meme coin. If this Dogecoin whale truly made this transfer with the intent to sell on Coinbase, then DOGE may feel a negative effect from it. Data from WhaleStats, however, shows that the crypto was in the top 10 most bought tokens by the largest BNB Smart Chain (BSC) whales just yesterday.

Selling is now at a three-year low,” Bitfinex analysts said in a note Tuesday. “It is a potential indication that miners are now either already transitioned or in the process of transitioning to a source of buying pressure.”  Crypto exchange Gemini is shedding another 10% of its staff, according to an internal message viewed by The Information. “It was our hope to avoid further reductions after this summer, however, persistent negative macroeconomic conditions and unprecedented fraud perpetuated by bad actors in our industry have left us with no other choice but to revise our outlook and further reduce headcount,” Gemini President and co-founder Cameron Winklevoss wrote in the internal message.  Shares of bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) rose as much as 14% on Monday after the company gained listing compliance with Nasdaq, thanks to a late December deal with Galaxy Digital to avoid bankruptcy and the recent rise in the price of bitcoin. Argo, whose shares are also listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it met the requirement to continue listing its shares on Nasdaq on Jan. 13, after bids for its shares remained above $1 for 10 consecutive days, according to a statement.  Chart of the Day  The chart compares bitcoin's price with the ratio of spot market trading volume against futures market volume going back to January 2022.  The ratio has pulled back sharply in the past week, indicating a pickup in the derivatives market activity.  In other words, leveraged traders are at least partly responsible for bitcoin's recent rise from $20,000 to $23,000, while the early move higher from $17,000 was mainly spot driven.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  A Dive Into 0xd62, a Genesis OTC Wallet That’s Moving Money  ​MakerDAO Approves Deployment of $100M USDC on DeFi Protocol Yearn Finance  VC Firm Pantera's 2023 Crypto Forecast Says the Future Is DeFi",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | YFI,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/24/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-tops-21k-outshines-sp-500-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5922004380acdc23008513da3beb7fab028e2fff-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange issued 94 so-called Binance-peg tokens (B-Tokens), and reserves for almost half of those are stored in a cold wallet called Binance 8, Bloomberg said. The wallet contains more tokens than required for the number of B-Tokens issued. Since the tokens are supposed to be backed 1:1, the excess indicates the collateral is being mixed with customers’ tokens, according to Bloomberg.  “Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Binance is aware of this mistake and is in the process of transferring these assets to dedicated collateral wallets.” Assets held with the exchange “have been and continue to be backed 1:1,” the spokesperson said.  When collateral is pooled together and used for trading, it’s locked up, and clients or holders of assets may not be able to withdraw if the pool is reduced, Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, said in a note to CoinDesk.  “In essence this means that there is no segregation of assets between clients' funds and any collateral used,” Kssis said. “This could lead to the owner(s) not being able to withdraw due to lack of funds or liquidity by the exchange.  “This could resonate like what FTX and Alameda did on a daily basis. An audit would generally highlight such shortcomings and ask to remedy it immediately,” he said. “If Binance was regulated, this would be an essential part of their internal controls.”  Binance has faced scrutiny since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and FTX's affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research. As a result, Binance sought to boost confidence in its platform by issuing a “proof-of-reserves” report from accounting firm Mazars in December. The report showed that Binance's customer bitcoin (BTC) reserves were overcollateralized.  ""To be clear, Binance holds all of its clients’ assets in segregated accounts, which are identified separately from any accounts used to hold assets belonging to Binance,"" a Binance spokesperson said in an email. ""Binance does not invest or otherwise deploy user assets without consent under the terms of specific products.""

The total volume of bitcoin options on Deribit rose to $4.25 billion last week, the highest since Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange, formerly the third largest in the world, went bust in the second week of November.  That's a 375% rise from the low of $895 million registered in the final week of December, according to data source provider Amberdata. Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, accounting for nearly 90% of the global trading volume and open interest.  The impressive recovery in volume has mainly been driven by an uptick in demand for call options or bullish bets offering protection against price rallies.  ""The share of calls relative to put volume is currently at more than 66%, its highest level in over a year,"" analysts at Kaiko Research said in a note to clients on Monday. ""This is yet another indicator that sentiment has improved in January.""  The dollar value locked in the number of open options contracts, also known as open interest, has increased to $5.92 billion, the highest since Oct. 27. Bitcoin's (BTC) price has rallied by nearly 40% this month.  An uptick in open interest alongside a price rally suggests an influx of new money on the bullish side and is said to confirm the uptrend.  Options are derivative contracts that offer the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. The call option gives the right to buy, while put options offer the right to sell.

42388179,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR8EoZ,1674561698,"EU Plans Digital Euro Bill, Metaverse Policy for May, Commission Says","The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, will publish a bill to underpin a digital euro and set out its strategy on virtual worlds in May, according to a document published on its website Monday.  Even though the European Central Bank has yet to decide whether to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the commission has indicated new laws could be needed to assert a digital euro's status as legal tender and set anti-money-laundering rules.  “Our legislation will be the framework for a digital euro,” Mairead McGuinness, the EU's financial-services commissioner, told lawmakers on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Tuesday. “It will be negligent if Europe did nothing now, but at some point in five or 10 years had to urgently rush through something.”  The bill is set to be published by the commission May 24. It's up to the European Parliament and governments of countries in the EU to “look at the finer points around the use cases of a digital euro” and “the technology to be used,” she said.  Lawmakers who would have to sign off on any of McGuinness’ proposals appear to be skeptical about whether the initiative has any real value.  “From a consumer point of view, what can I do as a consumer with a digital euro that I can't do with current payment systems?” Markus Ferber, the economic spokesman for the Parliament's largest political grouping, asked McGuinness, echoing skepticism others expressed Monday if the CBDC doesn't harness blockchain potential.  A separate initiative on virtual worlds is due May 3, to be led by EU competition and digital commissioner Margrethe Vestager. It is unlikely to propose new laws.  Perhaps with an eye on Meta Platforms' (META) incursion into the sector, two of Vestager’s officials have previously expressed concerns that large companies could come to dominate the metaverse and damage competition.  “The metaverse is one of the pressing challenges ahead of us,” a commission spokesperson told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “This new virtual environment must embed European values from the outset.”  Read more: Digital Euro Will Never Be Programmable, ECB’s Panetta Says  UPDATE (Jan 24, 14:10UTC): Adds commission comment on metaverse in last paragraph.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/24/eu-plans-digital-euro-bill-metaverse-policy-for-may-commission-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ad2439db5b1b144fc0b5dbd39aa465cedb2c150-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414580,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBUS9,1674559034,Crypto Tax Proposed by Lawmakers to Fund EU Budget,"Lawmakers in the European Parliament have proposed taxes on crypto assets to fund the European Union's annual budget of 170 billion euros ($185 billion).  Options included in a draft report for the Parliament’s budget committee, published on Jan. 16, include taxes on investors’ capital gains, transactions or mining.  The report “suggests the introduction of a European tax on crypto assets, whose revenues would flow into the European budget,” the report by French lawmaker Valérie Hayer and Portuguese Social Democrat José Manuel Fernandes stated. “Regulating and taxing crypto assets at the EU level is more efficient than at national level given their high mobility and cross-border dimension.”  In December, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, proposed new rules to exchange details of a crypto investor’s holdings between tax authorities – but decisions on what and how much to tax remain a matter for national governments.  Other lawmakers on the committee have until Feb. 2 to propose changes to the report. In reality, the Parliament’s 705 lawmakers have limited control over tax laws, which are usually agreed by the bloc’s 27 national finance ministers acting unanimously.  European Central Bank’ board member Fabio Panetta has previously said taxation could be used to address crypto's environmental costs, especially arising from the proof-of-work technology used in the mining of bitcoin (BTC).  The lawmakers are also looking at taxes on corporate profits, carbon-intensive imports and financial transactions as they seek to fund the bloc’s budget, which is now largely financed by national contributions and spent on farm subsidies and regional investments.

The measures, a leaked version of which was reported by CoinDesk Monday, are a bid to anticipate international norms that would limit the amount of unbacked assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) lenders can hold before the European Commission proposes more extensive rules.  In the meantime, “banks will be required to hold a euro of own capital for every euro they hold in crypto,"" Markus Ferber, the economic spokesman for the Parliament's largest political grouping, said in a statement. “Such prohibitive capital requirements will help prevent instability in the crypto world from spilling over into the financial system.  “Over the past couple of years, we have seen that crypto assets are high-risk investments,” he said.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a lobbying group that represents traditional-finance firms, raised concerns that the scope of the amendment may be too wide.  “There is no definition of crypto assets in the [legislation], and therefore, the requirement may apply to tokenized securities, as well as the non-traditional crypto assets the interim treatment is targeted at,” the organization said in an emailed statement, calling for the issues to be dealt with later in the legislative process.  The move from the Parliament's committee mimics rules set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the international standard setter for the industry, which has proposed that holdings of unbacked crypto should be given the highest possible risk weighting, and also be limited as a proportion of a bank’s total issuance of core financial instruments.  In order to pass into law, the measures still need approval from the European Parliament and also have to be negotiated with national finance ministers who meet in the Council of the European Union as part of a fuller package of bank capital reforms.

Both proposals were passed independently with a majority of votes by tokens holders, who staked sushipowah and xsushi – two Sushi ecosystem tokens – on Sushi’s governance forums.  Sushi, like other DeFi applications, called dapps, relies on smart contracts to provide financial services such as trading, borrowing and lending to users. It was one of the earliest dapps and locked up over $459 million in tokens as of Tuesday, down from a lifetime peak of $7.5 billion in 2021.  Kanpai proposal  The ""Kanpai"" proposal aimed to direct all trading fees from xsushi holders to the Sushi treasury, while the other sought to claw back unclaimed sushi tokens from a distribution held in 2021 back to the treasury.  xSushi tokens were issued to users who staked tokens on the trading platform SushiSwap allowing them to receive 0.05% as a reward from each trade. Of this, 10% was directed to the SushiSwap treasury. As a result of Monday’s proposal decision, however, 100% of all fees will be sent to the treasury, leaving no rewards for xSushi holders.  This model is scheduled to last for nearly one year until Dec.19, 2023. By then, the community is expected to propose and pass a new rewards distribution model. Developers have previously stated that Kanpai was a “temporary solution to a long-term problem,” as CoinDesk reported.  Distribution clawback  The Sushi DAO community voted in favor of retrieving 8.2 million SUSHI tokens, which were just over $11 million at writing time and which were initially rewarded to early liquidity providers during SushiSwap’s launch in 2020.  Liquidity providers are people or entities who supply assets to a dapp in return for a cut of fees generated from financial activities on that dapp or related product.  During the first six months after SushiSwap’s launch, liquidity providers were rewarded with SUSHI tokens with over two-thirds of the accrued rewards locked up and vested for an additional six months.  Those tokens were fully unvested last year, but more than 8.2 million SUSHI remained unclaimed. The Sushi community then proposed, and successfully voted in favor of, capturing the unclaimed tokens to further bolster Sushi's treasury.  Liquidity providers have until Apr. 23 to claim the tokens. All unclaimed tokens after that date will be sent to the treasury.",POSITIVE,SUSHI,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | SUSHI | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/24/defi-protocol-sushi-passes-two-governance-votes-to-strengthen-treasury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d454a0606b7acfb0e2e0eeae960912bccfbb430-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The top cryptocurrency by market value has risen almost 40% to $23,000 this month, the steepest gain since October 2021, according to CoinDesk data.  The bounce looks impressive, considering it has cleared key resistance levels despite lingering concerns about the fallout from the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX. A resistance level is the price where supply is expected to be strong enough to keep prices from moving higher.  Bitcoin's October bounce ran out of steam around $21,000, establishing that as a significant price hurdle. By moving above it, bitcoin has flipped the former resistance into support.  ""Bitcoin has extended its sharp relief rally, clearing resistance near $21,000,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said in a note to clients. ""The next resistance is more significant at the August high ($25,000).""  The weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and changes, is producing higher bars above the zero line, a sign of improving bullish momentum. At the same time, the overbought reading on the stochastic indicator is a signal for caution on the part of the bulls.  ""We remain neutral intermediate-term with the return of overbought conditions per the weekly stochastics,"" Stockton noted.  According to David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, any rally toward $25,000 depends on traditional risk assets.  Traditional risk assets have regained poise in the past two trading days, with technology stocks leading the way higher on easing concerns of recession and a less aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve.

With higher prices, motivation among investors may be increasing to use the current price level to exit and gain liquidity, especially after the long and painful bear market in 2022, as Glassnode discusses in its report. The renowned on-chain analysis firm examines in its newest research whether Bitcoin’s recent bounce above the price it has last seen before the FTX collapse is a bull trap or if indeed a new bull run is on the horizon. Bitcoin On-Chain-Data Suggests Glassnode notes in its report that the recent price spike in the $21,000-$23,000 region has resulted in the reclamation of several on-chain price models, which has historically meant a “psychological shift in holder behavior patterns.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Reaches Line Between Bear & Bull Market The company takes a look at the Investor Price and Delta Price, noting that in the 2018-2019 bear market, prices stayed within the confines of the Investor-Delta price band for a similar amount of time (78 days) as they currently do (76 days). “This suggests an equivalency in durational pain across the darkest phase of both bear markets,” Glassnodes states. In addition to the duration component of the bottoming phase, Glassnode also points to the compression of the investor delta price range as an indicator of the intensity of market undervaluation. “Considering the current price and compression value, a similar confirmation signal will be triggered when the market price reclaims $28.3k.” Regarding the sustainability of the current move, the analysis notes that the recent rally has been accompanied by a sudden increase in the percentage of supply in profit, rising from 55% to over 67%. This sudden increase in 14 days was one of the strongest swings in profitability compared to previous bear markets (+10.6% in 2015 and 8.3% in 2019), which is a bullish signal for Bitcoin. Following last year’s capitulation events, when a majority of investors were pushed into a loss, the market has now transitioned to a “regime of profit dominance,” which Glassnode says is “a promising sign of healing after the strong deleveraging pressure in the second half of 2022.” Less bullish, however, is the selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs), traditionally “an influential factor in the formation of local recovery (or correction) pivots.” The recent surge has pushed this metric above 97.5% in profit for the first time since its November 2021 all-time high, massively increasing the likelihood of selling pressure from STHs. Long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs) have risen back above the cost basis at current prices after 6.5 months, which is at $22,600. This means that the average LTH is now just above its breakeven base. Indeed, the current trend indicates that the bottom could be in: Considering the time length of LTH-MVRV traded below 1 and the lowest printed value, the ongoing bear market has been very comparable with 2018-2019 so far. Glassnode also states that the volume of coins older than 6 months has increased by 301,000 BTC since the beginning of December, proving the strength of the HODLing conviction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Gearing For Another Lift-Off and Might Surge To $25K On the other hand, miners have used the recent price spike to boost their balance sheets. Miners have spent about 5,600 BTC more than they have received since January 8. In conclusion, the research firm says that it is not yet possible to make a final judgment on whether the next bull market is imminent or whether the bulls are heading into a trap: [H]igher prices and the lure of gains after a prolonged bear market tend to motivate supply to become liquid again. On the contrary, supply held by long-term holders continues to increase, which can be taken as a signal of strength and conviction […]. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $23.085, remaining relatively calm after the recent spike.

42414587,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBV3I,1674550649,"Swapping More Than $157M of ETH for stETH and Levering Up, the Wormhole Network Exploiter Is a DeFi Degen","The wallet that stole 80,000 ether (ETH) from the Wormhole Portal Token Bridge last year sprung back to life on Monday after 355 dormant days, trading on leverage like a true Crypto Twitter ""degen"" as it moved a massive amount of capital throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  Data sourced from Etherscan indicates that the exploiter first swapped 95,360 ETH worth roughly $157 million on DeFi aggregator OpenOcean and then transacted smaller amounts capital through several decentralized finance protocols such as Kyber Network and 1Inch.  The exploiter levered up, borrowing DAI and interacting with several smart contracts on Lido, the top provider for liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum. The exploiter’s address, which begins with 0x629 is now the 3rd largest holder of wrapped stETH, according to data analytics platform Nansen.  Darkfi.eth (not related to DarkFi, the layer 1 blockchain with the Lunarpunk philosophy), one of the hackers who exploited the Nomad bridge in Aug. 2022 in order to rescue its funds from malicious actors, said, “Its possible that they are somehow using this to launder the money. Hard to tell for sure but there are definitely ways they could have extracted value on other wallets from this activity … Could also just be degens tho lmao, all kinda speculation at this point.”  The expoliter’s Lido shenanigans were so massive that they had a material effect on the market for the popular liquid staking derivative. Its 24-hour trading volume is up over 3000%, per CoinGecko. During the chaos of the day, stETH’s price increased relative to ETH, jumping above its 1:1 peg temporarily, before settling at 0.9985, per Dune Analytics.  The sudden activity by the exploiter prompted its victims to respond. In one transaction, an address belonging to Wormhole sent an on-chain message asking the exploiter to return the stolen funds in exchange for a $10 million bounty.  The Wormhole Network exploiter did not return a request comment to CoinDesk via Blockscan.  Here is the walk-through for the exploiter’s shuffle of funds  First, the Wormhole Network exploiter triggered a transaction on OpenOcean that swapped 96,630 ETH for 96,677 stETH, Lido’s derivative token that stands for the total value of a user’s initial staked ETH and its accrued interest.  Second, the Wormhole Network exploiter decided in another transaction to wrap 86,473 stETH.  Third, the exploiter deployed 25,000 wrapped stETH as collateral to borrow $13 million DAI.  Fourth, the exploiter used the $13 million DAI it just borrowed to accumulate almost 8,000 stETH on Kyber Network, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.  Fifth, the exploiter executed a transaction to wrap the roughly 8,000 stETH it received moments ago.  Sixth, the exploiter received $1.5 million DAI.  Seventh, the exploiter swapped out the $1.5 million DAI for some 923 stETH through DEX Aggregator 1Inch.  The exploiter has since continued receiving thousands of wrapped staked ether (wstETH) tokens.",NEGATIVE,ETH | DAI,ETH | KNC | TRADING | ZRX | DAI,Sage D.

The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose past $23,000 early Tuesday, amounting to a 30% rally in two weeks, according to CoinDesk data. On-chain flows tracked by analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex show the amount of bitcoin transferred from miner addresses to wallets owned by exchanges has declined to multi-year lows.  “Miners are also in better shape. Selling is now at a three-year low,” Bitfinex analysts said in a note Tuesday. “It is a potential indication that miners are now either already transitioned or in the process of transitioning to a source of buying pressure.”  “Miners are hodling their bitcoin because they anticipate further rises,” analysts added.  Miners are entities that supply computing power to any blockchain network in return for “rewards” in the form of tokens. These rewards are continually sold by miners to cover operational costs – which are fairly intensive. Some miners filed for bankruptcy protection last year – and liquidated holdings, contributing to selling pressure in the market.  Dwindling miner sales imply weaker selling pressure from those responsible for making coins and are generally viewed as bullish.  The recent price surge, however, may reverse course as traders take profits on recent gains amid lower liquidity in the overall market, the Bitfinex analysts said.  Bitcoin has rallied nearly 40% this month despite lingering FTX contagion fears. The cryptocurrency jumped over 7% on Friday, the highest single-day gain since Nov. 10, even as Genesis' crypto lending business filed for bankruptcy protection in New York. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Technical indicators tracking data from regulated exchanges such as Coinbase suggest bitcoin saw buying pressure starting in early January, while options markets are betting on higher bitcoin prices in July.  Meanwhile, data cited by Bitfinex analysts suggest whales – or large and influential token holders – were accumulating in November and December.  ""Bitcoin accumulation was mostly led by large wallet sizes (>$1M). These wallets and large players absorbed the supply that came post the FTX collapse and the plethora of other bearish events,” analysts noted.  “The increase in the number of wallets with $1,000 and $10,000 has upticked since the second week of January,” Bitfinex analysts noted, adding the metric was a sign that smaller investors were likely ""just joining"" the bitcoin rally while whales hold their spot positions.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/24/bitcoin-jumps-to-23k-as-miner-sales-hit-three-year-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e28a06f90155a8db2dec845fe46bebd32c8a7d41-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reports reveal that several whales jumped on the positive market sentiment to accumulate massive amounts of DOGE, triggering a 5% rally in the last day. According to WhaleAlert, Whales packed more than 500 million Dogecoin over the past two days. The tracker revealed that the largest holder of Dogecoin also partook in the accumulation and bagged almost 165 million DOGE coins. In addition, a top 20 whale also transferred 150 million Dogecoin tokens worth more than $13 million in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could See Another 30% Rally Robinhood Plans To Add Support For Dogecoin Robinhood Market is very influential both in the financial and crypto markets. The zone-free trading platform gave initial rollouts of its new wallet to 10,000 users in September 2022. The mobile wallet application would allow users to trade and send cryptocurrencies and NFTs. According to the announcement, the wallet would be available to over 1 million waiting users. But the wallets didn’t appear with initial support for DOGE, raising concerns among the meme coin community. However, the Robinhood platform assured the Dogecoin community that they are working hard to ensure the wallet app would support Dogecoin soon. Meanwhile, Robinhood’s main trading app already supports Dogecoin. In August 2021, the platform revealed that DOGE yielded up to 62% of the firm’s revenue in the year’s second quarter. As of then, Dogecoin gave Robinhood more revenue than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Technicals Suggest DOGE Must Clear $0.920 For Another Rally One of the features in the wallet that would greatly benefit crypto users is zero network fees for cryptocurrency trading. That explains why the market sentiment became positive around the news of the firm’s Dogecoin support. Data shows that Robinhood-linked wallet addresses hold the most significant DOGE tokens. For example, a Robinhood wallet named DPDLBA is the largest Dogecoin holder, with nearly 25.21% of the total supply. It has 34.76 billion Dogecoin worth $3.1 billion, while the second largest holder has 7.08 billion DOGE, about 5.14% of the total supply. The top 100 and 500 largest BSC whales are also making a move. As per data from WhaleStats, DOGE emerged as the top 10 purchased tokens among the 100 BSC whales in the past day. In addition, the memecoin coin also appeared among the top 500 biggest BSC whales. DOGE Price Surges – Is There Any Hope For More Rallies? Amid the whale accumulation, the DOGE coin price rallied 3.4% in the past 24 hours. It now trades at $0.9001 with a low of $0.8604 and a high of $0.9289. The technical and social sentiment indicators suggest a slight upward movement to $0.095 over the next few days. But, given the current market conditions, a rise above $0.1 seems unattainable. However, the meme coin has seen some good days since January. It has been on the upward trend over the last weeks, with a 14-day price surge of 21.8%.

The move will be the first by a private bank to issue shares as ledger-based securities under Swiss law, the company said in a press release. Cité will be partnering with digital assets firm Taurus to issue its tokenized shares as well as manage the smart contract that creates the shares and perform asset servicing of its securities, according to the statement.  Read more: Switzerland’s Tokenized Securities Law Ushers In New Chapter for Digital Assets  Tokenization, or the digitization of various asset classes, has been a popular trend among financial institutions because it allows traditional finance (TradFi) players to attract more investors by using blockchain technology. “Taurus believes that digitization of private assets and securities is becoming the new standard in the digital asset industry,"" Taurus said in the statement.  Most recently, investment management firm Hamilton Lane (HLNE) said it will tokenize three of its funds in a partnership with digital asset securities company Securitize, with the aim of making private market investments available to a broader set of investors. The announcement followed a similar move from investment giant KKR, which announced plans in September to tokenize its Health Care Strategic Growth Fund on the Avalanche blockchain.  Tokenization of Cité Gestion’s shares was carried out in accordance with standards established by the Capital Markets and Technology Association (CMTA), a Geneva based not-for-profit organization, the bank said in the statement. “Taurus and the application of the CMTA standards ensure that an adequate risk management framework is at the heart of the process,"" said Christophe Utelli, deputy CEO of Cité Gestion.  The tokens were created using the CMTAT, an open-source smart contract published by the CMTA and specifically dedicated to the tokenization of securities, and recorded on Ethereum, the company said.  Taurus, founded in April 2018, obtained a securities license last year from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to provide investors and banks the ability to trade a number of assets, including tokenized securities.  The company has been involved in the tokenization of 15 companies so far, covering equity, private debt, and structured products from firms in Switzerland as well as Europe.  “It was important for our bank to be among the first to take advantage of the new possibilities offered by Swiss law for the digitalization of securities by tokenizing our own shares,” Utelli said.

Review As not only precious metal prices (gold +19.3%, silver +39.7%), but also stock markets (DAX +28.7%, S&P500 +18.7%) recorded a significant recovery over the last three months, it was only a matter of time until Bitcoin would send a sign of life again, too. Already since mid-November, Bitcoin had barely reacted to the flood of bad news coming from the imploding crypto sector. Yet, many altcoins fell to new lows. At the same time, sentiment was beaten down completely and Bitcoin was hated and derided. Clearly, this was the best contrarian set up we have seen in a long time. Hence, it’s no surprise that bitcoin skyrocketed 31% higher since the start of the new year. The stellar rally took prices from 16,358 USD to 21,445 USD in lightning speed. Anyone who was not invested is now chasing the rally. And those who have even shorted Bitcoin are now desperately hoping for a significant pullback. Yet, despite the significant rise, the mood among market participants remains skeptical. First bounce in 2019 brought an increase of almost 330% Bitcoin in 2019 in USD, weekly chart as of January 17th, 2023. ( TradingView ) A comparative look into the past shows that Bitcoin, pretty much like in 2019, was suddenly given a new lease of life after a brutal bear market that ended with a basing pattern lasting several months. Back in 2019, Bitcoin managed to rise 328% from 3,200 USD to around 13,800 USD. The four-and-a-half-month rally did not offer any major pullbacks for an entry! Rather, more than 61.8% of the previous bear market were recaptured without any major pullbacks. Should Bitcoin currently have something similar in mind, prices could recover towards approx. 48,000 USD to 50,000 USD until the summer! Even if Bitcoin would take it a bit easier in 2023, a recovery up towards the 38.2% retracement at around 35,000 USD would be easily conceivable. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart – Upper edge of the downtrend channel is the 1st target Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of January 17th, 2023. ( TradingView ) On the weekly chart, thanks to the large green weekly candle, Bitcoin has now almost reached the upper edge of the downtrend channel. Basically, a pullback could therefore take place starting between approx. 22,000 USD and 23,500 USD. However, the weekly stochastic provides a buy signal and still has room to run further towards and into the overbought zone. The upper Bollinger band (22,268 USD) does not stand in the way, neither. On a higher level, Bitcoin probably wants to approach at least one of the orange retracement levels. Historically, a weekly close with a 20% gain after a prolonged bear market with a loss of 75% or more has always resulted in Bitcoin bottoming out! Overall, the weekly chart is clearly bullish and suggests further price increases. If the downtrend channel stops the bulls around 22,500 USD, the support zone between 18,000 and 20,000 USD should absorb the first pullback. Bitcoin Daily Chart – 200 day moving average now support Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of January 17th, 2023. ( TradingView ) In summary, the daily chart is bullish. The stochastic oscillator, which is currently embedded with both lines above 80, secures the steep uptrend for the time being. Major pullbacks are therefore not expected any time soon. The next target is obviously the upper edge of the downtrend channel (currently around 22,350 USD). Should a pullback or consolidation occur, plenty of strong support awaits in the area between 18,000 USD and 20,000 USD. Rather, the vast majority of market participants may have been completely surprised by the impulsive rally. Given the brutal 14-month bear market and the fact that Bitcoin can now be traded using numerous instruments or derivatives, the number of short sellers at the low in November was probably higher than ever before. These short sellers are now gradually getting further and further underwater and will become the buyers who could quickly push Bitcoin prices towards 35,000 USD and possibly even towards 50,000 USD by early summer as continuously rising prices forcing them to cover their short positions. Sentiment Bitcoin – Sentiment returns to neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of January 15th, 2023. (Lookintobitcoin) For the first time since the start of the bear market in November 2021, sentiment has recovered significantly. At 52 points, the “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” currently signals a rather balanced or neutral sentiment. Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of January 15th, 2023. (Lookintobitcoin) The contrarian buying opportunity which we have propagated in December is thus gone. However, significant price increases are likely to be needed until sentiment turns euphoric. Seasonality Bitcoin – Positive until June Seasonality for bitcoin, as of January 15th, 2023. (Seasonax) According to the seasonal pattern, Bitcoin is now very likely facing three to five positive months. Hence, the trend should be up until early summer. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of January 17th, 2023. ( TradingView ) In summary, the Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio has bottomed and turned around. A larger recovery or counter-trend bounce is to be expected. Ratio values between 13 and 14 would be the minimum target. Hence, it is recommended to increase one’s Bitcoin allocation against gold. Bitcoin has thus risen in price by almost 25% against gold in no time at all. The Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio has therefore clearly turned upwards over the last two weeks. It has already broken out above the downtrend line of the last 14 months! The weekly stochastic provides a new buy signal in favor of Bitcoin. A normal recovery or counter-trend bounce could lead the ratio to a value of almost 20 in the coming months. With that, you would get nearly twice as much gold as currently for your Bitcoins! The first price target in the coming weeks would be the upper Bollinger Band on the weekly chart (13.20). Macro Update – Stagflation and Cold War 2.0 PwC’s 26th annual Global Survey, January 16th, 2023. (PwC) High inflation figures and the thereby resulting sharp rise in interest rates, balance sheet reductions by central banks, the war in Ukraine and the bursting of the China bubble made 2022 one of the most difficult stock market years ever. However, following a month-long sell-off in almost all asset classes, there has been a gradual yet significant recovery in stock markets since mid-October. The weaker US-Dollar also favored a strong recovery in precious metal prices. Nevertheless, the mood among top managers is extremely pessimistic. Gross domestic product in China as of January 17th, 2023. (Holger Zschaepitz) For several weeks now, the end of the zero-covid policy pushed by the Chinese government has been providing additional inflationary pressure. While the Chinese real estate sector is likely to continue to struggle, overall growth in China ( CNYA ) should normalize, putting demand pressure on global commodity prices. Cold War 2.0 At the same time, massive geopolitical challenges may be lurking, as an end to the drama in Ukraine or a pacification between the West (USA & EU) and the East (China & Russia) are not in sight. For decades, geopolitical risks played only a minor role in financial markets. Now, however, the unipolar world order (“Pax Americana”) could be breaking apart, and the world might have to reorganize and rebalance itself in the coming years. In my opinion, China holds the better cards in this regard, as it is skillfully driving the de-dollarization of global trade flows via OPEC+, the BRICs and also by means of CBDCs. Thus, the US-Dollar has lost about 10% against the Chinese renminbi ( CNY ) in the last two months. Currently, growth in China is picking up, while it is slowing down in the U.S.. In particular, the growing trend of invoicing oil and gas sales in renminbi must be a thorn in the Americans’ eye. The U.S. probably does not have much time, if any, left to prevail against an emerging China after all. In view of all these developments, central bank policy might therefore lose influence on financial markets in the coming years and geopolitics could dominate instead. Wall of worry until spring or early summer In any case, regardless of the short-term recoveries, the monetary and fiscal policy situation in the West remains extremely complicated and the fundamental outlook unfavorable. I think that Stagflation will probably be the most likely outcome. The end of the restrictive monetary policy by the FED and the ECB is not yet in sight. However, we expect a reversal in the course of this year. For hard assets such as equities and precious metals, but also Bitcoin, this would be very good news in the medium to longer term. In the short term, the poor fundamental outlook is still countered by too much pessimism and too many shaky hands. The markets could therefore initially continue to recover along a “wall of worry” until spring or early summer. Conclusion: Bitcoin – Significant recovery expected Given the strong start into the new year (+30%), chances for a big recovery in Bitcoin are very good. With the steep correction (-77.5%) since November 2021, all weak hands and unprofitable or dubious companies and players should have been flushed out of the market. It’s not that these players have been wiped out forever, but they will probably only return to the Bitcoin market at significantly higher prices. The Achilles heel for the crypto sector and Bitcoin, on the other hand, remains the foreseeable regulation by policymakers. The FTX disaster has shaken confidence in the sector and has now really put all politicians and regulators on notice. Technically, the Bitcoin network is unstoppable, but with penalties and bans, exchange regulators might hit the sector hard in the coming months and years. Nevertheless, we are bullish and think a major recovery with prices of 35,000 USD to maybe even 50,000 USD by early summer is quite possible.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4571811-bitcoin-significant-recovery-expected-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7965069.jpeg

42414595,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBVJD,1674524642,First Mover Asia: Ether Prices Fall Relative to Bitcoin,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds steady near $23K for another day; ether remains above $1,600.  Insights: The price of ether declines relative to bitcoin.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,089.14 +6.5 ▲ 0.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,968 +189.4 ▲ 0.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,629 −10.2 ▼ 0.6% S&P 500 daily close  4,019.81 +47.2 ▲ 1.2% Gold  $1,934 +7.2 ▲ 0.4% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.52% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Rises Over $23K and Retreats Again  By James Rubin  Bitcoin cracked the lofty height of $23,000 on Monday before retreating just below this threshold in a repeat performance from the weekend that continued to reflect fresh investor optimism.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $22,968, up almost a percentage point over the past 24 hours, BTC has risen more than 35% since the start of the year amid concrete signs that prices are declining without the economy falling into steep recession.  Still, a number of analysts are unconvinced that the rally will last after a nearly 14-month bear market and a slew of crypto debacles that have shaken the public's already fragile faith in the industry.  In a weekly commentary, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of digital asset investment firm Arca, highlighted bitcoin's rebound and ""a sharp renaissance"" of tokens from ""applications and protocols largely left for dead,"" but also the difficulty in predicting if the current upsurge was ""just a bear market rally or if price increases will reflexively spark enough economic activity to justify the price moves.""  ""At a micro level, most individual applications and protocols are still near trough levels of users and activity,"" even if many have risen over 100% in recent weeks,"" Dorman wrote, adding: ""The market is trying to find equilibrium, something between last year’s dead zone and 2021’s euphoria.""  Ether also rose then dipped on Monday but continued to trade comfortably over $1,600, about flat from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptos were mixed with AVAX, the token of base layer protocol Avalanche, and XRP, the native crypto of open source public blockchain XRP Ledger, up more than 4% and 5%, respectively, but AXS, the governance token of gaming platform Axie Infinity, dropping more than 12%. AXS had soared more than 40% on Sunday. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of leading cryptos' market performance, was up slightly.  Equity indexes closed higher to continue their largely upward trend this year with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumping 2% and 1.2%, respectively, amid market hopefulness that the U.S. central bank will scale back its next interest rate hike from the 50 and 75 basis point increases (bps) of the past eight months to 25 bps.  Meanwhile, lawyers for Genesis Global told a federal bankruptcy court in New York City on Monday that they’ve been working with creditors’ representatives and the U.S. Trustee’s Office “around the clock” for the past two months to reach a “consensual resolution” with the embattled company’s creditors. Earlier this month, Genesis Global Holdco – the holding company of Genesis Global Capital – and two of its subsidiaries, Genesis Asia Pacific (GAP) and Genesis Global Capital (GGC), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection – part of the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's collapse. Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.  In his firm's commentary, Arca Chief Financial Officer Michael Dershewitz, the head of Arca's Risk Committee, wrote that the Chapter 11 filing represented ""an endgame"" to ""a long-running public insolvency.""  ""Chapter 11 is a useful process to stay liabilities and negotiate a court-approved restructuring,"" Dershewitz wrote, adding: ""We cannot add much to predict how these negotiations will end, but we are watching at the edge of our seats.""

The ETH/BTC currency pair has declined 8% since Jan. 11 as the price increase in bitcoin has been more pronounced than ether’s.  The decrease in the ETH/BTC ratio comes as the supply of ETH has been dropping. ETH’s current supply is currently 2,788 ETH lower than its supply in September 2022.  The relative strength index (RSI), for the ETH/BTC pair has since declined to below 40, reaching levels last seen in December.  A further decline below 30 could provide a compelling opportunity for investors bullish on ETH to add to their positions.

42414575,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBU1c,1674524070,NFT Management Application Floor Acquires Data Platform WGMI.io,"Non-fungible token (NFT) management application Floor has acquired WGMI.io, an NFT data platform, the company said Monday.  Floor, which allows traders to view and manage their portfolio of NFTs, will soon give users a more robust experience by incorporating WGMI.io’s dataset. Users will be able to view not only their assets but also associated price floors and trading volumes.  Chris Maddern, co-founder and CEO of Floor, told CoinDesk that NFTs represent the intersection of “culture and money,” and that it is important to create a platform that supports those facets with data.  “People just don't want to spend hours going and looking at all these [marketplaces] to figure out what's going on,” said Maddern. “What we found is that people can now start to spend more of their time actually making [trading] decisions and diving into the communities that are behind those collections.”  The Floor iOS and Android app is currently in a closed beta test for a small community of token holders. It is led by co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Christine Brown, who was previously the crypto chief operating officer at investing platform Robinhood Markets; and co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Siddhartha Dabral, who formerly founded software company Button Inc.  In June, Floor raised $8 million in a Series A round led by 6th Man Ventures, the investment firm led by Mike Dudas, founder of crypto publication The Block.  Currently, Floor supports data from collections minted on Ethereum and Polygon, and plans to incorporate more chains down the line.  ""I am very excited to be combining our communities and products, as WGMI users have been asking for a mobile app for quite some time,"" Thomas Mancini, CEO and founder of WGMI.io told CoinDesk.

42414590,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBVDu,1674522986,"Ether Turns Deflationary Again, Led by Spike in NFT Sales","Ether has become deflationary again amid this year's market rebound.  Data from ultrasound.money shows ether’s net issuance, or the annualized inflation rate, has dropped to -0.07%, meaning the volume of ether being burnt is outpacing the amount that is being minted.  Marcus Sotiriou, market analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, attributed the recent surge in ether burnt to a spike in non-fungible token (NFT) sales driven by positive sentiment about the broader crypto market.  More than 14,600 ethers (ETH), worth around $23 million, have been burnt over the past seven days, according to ultrasound.money. Some 3,400 of these ETH were burned during NFT trades. NTF marketplace OpenSea is the top seven-day and 30-day Ethereum gas-guzzler among platforms, ultrasound.money found.  According to data from cryptoslam, NFT sales volume jumped more than 5% to $244 million over the past week, and 81% of sales volume, or approximately $198 million, is based on the Ethereum network.  “More NFT sales on Ethereum means more transactions are occurring, resulting in more ETH being burnt,” Sotiriou told CoinDesk.  Market participants widely expected that last fall’s Ethereum Merge, which shifted the platform’s protocol from a proof-of-work (PoW) to more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, would turn ether deflationary.  Ether’s inflation rate also depends on a separate mechanism known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559, where fees paid for transactions on the network are “burned,” or eliminated from circulation. The EIP-1559 is tied to the amount of ether burned with network usage: The more transactions on the blockchain, the more ETH is burnt.  ETH became deflationary in November when the amount of ether being burned rose amid market volatility triggered by crypto exchange FTX’s implosion. But ETH subsequently turned inflationary because of slow network usage as the crypto market remained in the doldrums.  As the market rallied more recently, usage of the Ethereum platform spiked and ETH turned deflationary again. Daily burn rates soared from a range of 1,000 to 2,000 ETH over the past six months to a high of over 2,700 ETH on Jan. 18, according to data from Etherscan.  ETH was recently trading at $1,618 Tuesday, up roughly 3% in the past seven days.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/24/ether-turns-deflationary-again-led-by-spike-in-nft-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/965f78e035980cb8d0e8e5839cdcacf21ede33f0-1062x574.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
