42428062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5ahh,1510268416,More Charges Filed Against Trader Who Used Bitcoin to Conceal Fraud,"New charges have been filed against a Philadelphia-based day trader accused of manipulating a series of online brokerage accounts and using bitcoin to hide the source of his profits.  Joseph Willner has been charged with multiple offensives, including those related to computer intrusions and securities fraud. Willner, as previously reported by CoinDesk, was accused this month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of breaking into victims’ digital brokerage accounts and conducting a series of short sales designed to generate some $2 million in revenue.  More than 50 trading accounts were targeted during the alleged scheme, prosecutors have said.  When the SEC pressed charges, they alleged that Willner made some $700,000 in profits – an amount obscured through the use of the cryptocurrency, which was sent to an unnamed partner. The SEC's lawsuit is distinct from the indictment pursued by the Justice Department.  Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rhode said in a statement:  ""Cybercriminals continue to come up with innovative ways to steal money from victims using the Internet, as in this case where defendant Willner’s co-conspirators allegedly hacked into the victims’ accounts in order to execute fraudulent short sales.""  Willner faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted.

42428046,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5alh,1510261538,GE Patent Filings Hint at Blockchain Role in Aircraft Management,"New patent filings from General Electric suggest that the U.S. conglomerate may be looking at blockchain as part of a wider aircraft monitoring and maintenance system.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published five applications from GE today, each of which focus on a concept for a ""dynamic optimization"" system that would touch multiple aspects of managing and operating aircraft, including maintenance services.  One component of that system, the applications indicate, would be a mechanism for parties involved in the aircraft oversight process. While noting that these entities would typically be paid through traditional finance channels, they suggest that cryptocurrencies – or some application of blockchain thereof – could facilitate such payouts instead.  ""The delivery of the cash flows amongst stakeholders is certainly enabled with traditional debits and credits into financial accounts and may be implemented with crypto-currency mechanisms whose core logic is informed by precise allocation of cashflows,"" the applications note – though they don't include any other mention of the technology.  That GE would potentially investigate this area is perhaps unsurprising, given past developments from notable airline carriers. Earlier this year, Air France revealed that it was looking at blockchain as a way to track maintenance flows for its airplanes, with the idea being that the technology could underpin a shared database of update information.

In a new blog post, the developers behind the fork of the bitcoin blockchain said that they would release a formal software client for download at 7:00 PM UTC on Nov. 12. Originally set for a public launch on Nov. 1, the project is backed by LightningASIC, a seller of mining hardware based in Hong Kong, as well as a community of relatively unknown developers.  As reported by CoinDesk, the idea behind bitcoin gold is to keep most properties of the protocol, but restrict the use of specialized chips for mining, or the process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain (while also creating new tokens as a reward).  It's also the latest example of a ""airdropped"" cryptocurrency that will distribute new coins to anyone who owned bitcoin at the time of the split, or up until the date the ledger of transactions started to differ.  Yet in a move criticized by some observers, the team behind bitcoin gold has been mining blocks in insolation since the new network was formally created last month, with a certain amount of coins being set aside to support development.  In comments, the team behind the effort sought to send a signal of confidence to the market, perhaps owing to concerns circulating around the effort.  ""We are extremely grateful for the community around the world who have been contributing hash power to our testnets; besides patiently testing their own mining process, they allow exchanges, pools, wallet developers, and all other service operators to implement and test their support of BTG so that the bitcoin gold community can have a full suite of services at launch time,"" the project's backers said in a statement.  In the days ahead, exchanges will no doubt be watching the launch. Soon after its August release, bitcoin cash, another cryptocurrency that forked the bitcoin network, amassed a nearly $4 billion market value.  Exchanges and traders will no doubt be watching to see if history repeats.

The release followed a report in local media that indicated BaFin was preparing some kind of statement, though unlike those issued by other regulators from around the world, the agency's statement stops short of imposing any new requirements or guidelines for organizers. A more comprehensive guide for investors will be released on Nov. 15, according to today's announcement.  ""Before any consumer decides to participate in an ICO, they should make certain that they have fully understood the benefits and risks of the project or investment,"" the regulator warned.  Though BaFin didn't indicate that it might seek enforcement action against any ICO organizers – as has happened previously in countries like the U.S. – the agency suggested generally that ""authorities taking necessary measures"" could result in potential losses for investors in token sales that prove to be fraudulent in nature.

Days after a developer ""accidentally"" deleted a code library for the Parity wallet, Afri Schoedon, technical communications lead at the startup, said the issue may be addressed at a later date – possibly as part of the already planned ethereum upgrade Constantinople, set for 2018.  It's a notable statement, in that up to $152 million in ether – some being the business and customer funds of some high-profile initial coin offering (ICO) issuers – is locked up where owners can't access it. Yet, it points to the greater controversy over hard forks, with some arguing an emergency hard fork (as was executed last year after the collapse of The DAO) would be a company ""bail-out.""  While those involved have made it clear a hard fork is needed to free up the funds, Schoedon told CoinDesk that Parity has ""plenty of time"" to find a solution that would be ""backed by major parts of the community.""  Expanding on Schoedon's comments, ethereum virtual machine (EVM) developer for the Ethereum Foundation Nick Johnson, speaking to his own personal opinions, said, ""There's absolutely no rush. Unlike the DAO, there's no ticking clock, no funds in peril, they're simply locked up. The community can take as long as it needs to decide what, if anything, it should do.""  The Parity team is crafting a proposal, though when this will be released is currently unclear. According to Schoedon, Parity will at ""no point push for a bail-out,"" aiming for an ethereum-wide solution which is well accepted by the community.  Schoedon continued:  ""I'm expecting nobody really denies the ... affected projects and [wants] users to regain access to their locked funds. However, if that is not the case and discussions stay very controversial, we are more than happy to provide a switch that allows users to choose if they want Constantinople with or without the discussed proposal.""

42428033,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5aLh,1510245034,"Quantum Computers Could Jack Your Crypto Private Key in 10 Years, Researchers Say","Quantum computers are coming and encryption – including the kind used to underpin cryptocurrencies – is in trouble, researchers say.  That's according to researchers at the National University of Singapore and colleagues who have estimated how soon the computers might be able to break bitcoin's security. Based on the most aggressive estimates for the advancement of quantum computation, private keys might be cracked as early as 2027, their paper says.  Bitcoin encryption today is ensured by the difficulty of cracking its code using existing computers, but quantum computers will theoretically be able to work much faster because they are not constrained to working with bits (values that are either 0 or 1). Quantum computers use qubits, which take advantage of the very strange ways subatomic particles behave to contain more values (or even two values at once).  As first reported by the MIT Technology Review, the researchers investigated quantum computers' application against both mining pools and using the machines to attacks private keys. Miners will be safe for longer than wallets, the researchers contend.  Rewriting transactions  The greatest danger for bitcoin users will come when transactions have been broadcast to the network but not yet processed, according to the paper.  An attacker with a quantum computer is likely to be able to change the transaction before the legitimate one goes through, the researchers found.  Settled transactions will remain safe, at least for a while. Even a paradigm-shifting computer is unlikely to be able to change the ledger after several blocks have been processed.  If private keys are compromised, that's not just bad news for cryptocurrency. It would expose anything else that uses public-private key encryption, such as messaging apps, SSL certificates and data storage.  Glint of hope  As the researchers acknowledge, this finding holds true provided nothing changes in the way private keys are created. They write:  ""Many presumably quantum-safe public-key signature schemes have been proposed in the literature.""  However, their discussion neither completely endorses nor dismisses any of the proposals.  This summer, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania also proposed ways in which more robust private keys could stymie these new machines. And, as has been argued, quantum computers might also develop much more slowly than the researchers have modeled.

42428048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5aph,1510237826,Ether Shrugs Off Parity Concerns As Price Climbs to Three-Week High,"The price of ether, ethereum's native token, is gaining altitude today.  At press time, the ether-U.S. dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate is at $322. As per CoinMarketCap, ether has gained 6.8 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 11.92 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is carrying 5.6 percent gain.  The rise indicates that ether could be finally putting an end to a near three-week-long consolidation that saw prices restricted to a trading range of $280–$312.  The rally is perhaps surprising news, since it arrives when ethereum is considering a possible system-wide software update following a serious vulnerability arising with the Parity wallet. The issue has seen over $150 million in ether frozen – including the funds for a number of ICO projects.  So far though, ether prices are showing no signs of stress on the news.  A possible explanation for ether's new bullish tone could be the rotation of money out of bitcoin and into other cryptocurrencies.  The lure of possible ""free money"" for bitcoin holders – should a split have occurred during the Segwit2x hard fork – has now disappeared, with the upgrade being suspended yesterday. With the news, unwinding of the ""2x"" bitcoin trades could gather pace as money moves into other digital assets.  For the time being, the price action analysis indicates better days may lie ahead for the ETH bulls.  Ether 4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  Bollinger bands are squeezed, followed by a bullish break  Bullish channel breakout  Bullish relative strength index (RSI)  A Bollinger band squeeze occurs when volatility falls. A period of low volatility is usually followed by a period of high volatility/big moves on either side.  On the chart above, the period of low volatility (narrow range) ended with an upside breakout yesterday.  The good news doesn't end there. The price chart also shows a bullish channel breakout or the upside break of the consolidation. That has opened doors for a rally to $350 levels (target as per the measured height method).  View  ETH looks set to re-test $345 (Oct. 13 high)and $350 (Oct. 16 high) over the next couple of weeks.  On the downside, only an end-of-day close below $300 would signal a bearish trend reversal.

42428041,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5aZh,1510234211,ICO Funds Among Millions Frozen In Parity Wallets,"Some high-profile token issuers are feeling the effects of a vulnerability in an ethereum wallet software revealed this week.  After a developer stumbled upon the bug – ""accidentally"" deleting a code library for the Parity wallet and freezing more than $152 million-worth of ether – several startups and open-source projects that recently launched initial coin offerings (ICOs) have come forward, stating that theirs are among the 151 addresses impacted by the software failure.  As such, the development has put considerable attention on U.K.-based Parity Technologies, the developer of the software, which also saw $30 million in ether stolen in a July hack.  Further, it comes at a time when ethereum itself is receiving a significant amount of attention for fueling around 10,000 ICO projects, 13 of which have raised over $100 million.  One of those 13, interoperability platform Polkadot, raised more than $145 million in a token sale last month and is currently having to deal with $98 million-worth of its ether funds being locked up in Parity because of the flaw. In a blog post, the Web3 foundation, which supports the Polkadot project, asserted that all work will continue regardless of the frozen funds.  According to the post, while the wallet containing ICO contributions has been impacted, it does not represent the entirety of the company's funds, adding:  ""Our ability to build Polkadot as planned and to the original timetable has not been affected.""  Another ICO issuer effected by the hack but soldiering on is Iconomi, a digital asset management platform that raised more than $10 million from a token sale in September.  According to ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan, Iconomi's frozen wallet represents around $34 million. However, the company wrote in a blog post that the wallet holds only company assets, not customer funds.  ""All users' digital assets stored on the platform are completely safe, and the functioning of the platform is unaffected,"" the post said.  Musiconomi, the smallest ICO-funded company to announce publicly that it has been affected, has about $4.8 million frozen in Parity accounts right now. The project has yet to release a statement, although a company representative told CoinDesk it will elaborate as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, on social media, members of the Parity team have urged those affected to get in contact. The firm has also created a dedicated website that allows users to quickly find out if their wallet is among those frozen.  Currently, close to 600 wallets have been verified as locked by the issue.

42428049,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5arh,1510232429,'Segwit2x Rally' Unwinds? Bitcoin Looks Heavy As Fork Boost Fades,"Bitcoin is feeling the pull of the gravity today.  The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to new record highs yesterday, rallying to $7,848.31 on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) before falling to a low of $7,058 today. As of writing, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is trading at $7,253.50.  BTC began losing altitude soon after the markets were alerted that a controversial software update, known as Segwit2x, had officially been suspended. The software, which would have required a fork of the blockchain, had attracted a lot of attention in the media, and rightly so, as it could have led to chain split and the creation of free assets for BTC holders.  In this way, the BTC rally from the mid-Oct. low of $4,800 looks in part to have been fuelled by speculation that all BTC holders at the time of the ""2x"" hard fork would receive an equal amount of the newly created cryptocurrency – should a split have occurred.  Now that the hard fork has been called off, it's safe to assume that bitcoin prices may fade in the short term.  However, as backed up by the investors' comments on social media, the cancellation of 2x hard fork means less uncertainty going forward and that could bode well for the BTC in the long run. Still, prices could revisit sub-$7,000 levels in the meanwhile, as money rotates out of BTC and into alternative currencies.  The price analysis points to a potential bearish reversal pattern.  Bitcoin chart  A bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence would be confirmed if the today's candle ends with losses (red). A bearish divergence occurs when the price forms higher highs and the RSI forms lower highs.  Confirmation of the bearish divergence would mean the rally from September lows below $3,000 has formed a temporary top above $7,800. Prices could then revisit $6,200 (support offered by the trend line sloping upwards from the Sep.15 low and Oct. 5 low.  Furthermore, the shape of the yesterday's candle is somewhat bearish too. Prices clocked record highs above $7,800 yesterday, but ended the day well below the previous high of $7,630. The price action indicates, therefore, bull market exhaustion.  4-hour chart  The bearish price RSI is more clearly visible on the 4-hour time frame.  Immediate support is seen at $6,900 (Nov. 6 low), although it is likely to be breached, given the bearish price-RSI divergence.  View  BTC could take out support at $6,900 and drop towards the rising trend line support of $6,200.  On the higher side, only a move above $7,500 would revive the bullish view.  A potential rebound from $6,900 to $7,200 would be a call for caution for the aggressive bears.

The IRS Might Be Watching,"Bitcoin holders in the U.S. might be feeling giddy about the ""free money"" they've received as of late from bitcoin hard forks.  But with tax season right around the corner, they might also be feeling a bit uneasy.  While the money generated by the bitcoin cash hard fork – and the possible money generated by the bitcoin gold hard fork – has played a role in driving bitcoin's price surge, it's not all fun and games. Bitcoin owners have effectively acquired value for free, but there is still a cost associated with the assets.  According to Perry Woodin, CEO of Node40, a TurboTax-like platform for cryptocurrency owners:  ""People are piling into bitcoin so they can get the free money, but I think very few people are thinking about the tax implications of it. And if they are, they’re probably thinking 'Well, I can get around it'.""  But that might not be clear thinking.  For tax reporting purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently classifies bitcoin and ""other virtual currencies"" as property, meaning owners are legally obliged to report the capital gains and losses incurred from cryptocurrency holdings during each calendar year.  As bitcoin cash and the other cryptocurrencies created from hard forks act nearly identical to bitcoin (besides some technical code changes), some wonder if the same rules will apply. Currently, though, it's all a gray area.  ""From a tax perspective, the bitcoin hard fork really is uncharted territory,"" said James Markwood, a tax attorney with Cogent Law Group in Washington. D.C.  The choices  For those crypto holders interested in playing by the rules, though, there's really no clear consensus from tax experts on what should be done.  ""There are really two choices, and neither one of the choices are particularly appealing,"" said Woodin.  The first choice is to assign each new coin an arbitrary value to use as its cost basis. This could potentially be done by taking a weighted average of, for example, bitcoin cash's trading value in futures markets just before the August fork, or by assigning it a value proportional to that of a full bitcoin.  Any increase in the price after the cryptocurrency's inception and before the end of the year would then be subject to capital gains tax.  The other possibility is to assign the new coin an arbitrary value of zero and then pay the capital gains tax on the full value whenever the disposition of the coin occurs (when they are exchanged for other crypto assets or for fiat currency).  The latter approach would seem to match up with the IRS' thinking on other types of second-generation assets, explained Markwood, noting the situation could be similar to that of a farmer who owns a cow that gives birth to a calf or a landowner who discovers gold on his property.  Importantly, in both cases, the creation or discovery of the new asset would not necessarily trigger a taxable event. But when the assets are sold off, the full value of the disposition would be deemed taxable income.  While the latter approach may sound more appealing to bitcoin owners because it allows them to effectively kick the can until they sell an asset, it's unclear whether or not that applies to cryptocurrencies.  Bury your head?  Of course, a third option is to simply ignore one's reporting obligations altogether, a strategy that – as evidenced by the IRS's assertion that only 802 individuals reported capital gains from bitcoin in 2015 – has been employed quite frequently by U.S. traders.  While the approach was understandable given the complicated and labor-intensive process of reporting cryptocurrency (many traders may have been unaware of the requirements altogether), it becomes even more so since bitcoin holders sometimes don't have much choice over whether they get access to hard fork-created tokens or not.  During the bitcoin cash fork, bitcoin holders were given bitcoin cash at a rate of 1:1, and exchanges that supported the new coin merely dumped the equal amount in users' accounts.  ""People are really looking to avoid this, especially if you’re not interested in bitcoin cash or any one of the new forks,"" said Woodin, adding:  ""You don't want to have to pay tax on something you didn't want in the first place.""  But crypto tax-evaders face much higher risk in 2017 as the skyrocketing value of bitcoin and the newly created class of crypto millionaires are drawing scrutiny from the authorities.  The IRS has also wised up to how these new assets are being used and stored, as evidenced by the agency's John Doe summons of Coinbase user records in 2016, as well as this summer's revelation that the IRS has been using Chainalysis software to monitor the blockchain for bitcoin tax cheats since 2015.  Chainalysis did not respond to requests for comment about whether the IRS continues to use its product.  Clarity needed  More than anything, new assets being created by bitcoin forks underscore the need for greater clarity from the IRS on how cryptocurrencies should be reported for tax purposes.  The IRS guidelines for reporting cryptocurrencies has come under considerable backlash as too cumbersome, if not altogether impossible for higher volume traders or people using it to purchase everyday items such as a cup of coffee.  ""Taxing blockchain-based currency, like bitcoin, as property rather than as a competing currency has numerous adverse consequences,"" said Amy Davine Kim, global policy director and general counsel at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a Washington D.C.-based blockchain advocacy group.  ""Among other things,"" she continued, ""it imposes onerous reporting requirements that are difficult to understand and ultimately inhibit the widespread adoption in retail commerce of this promising technology.""  It's interesting to note that the mission behind the bitcoin cash hard fork is to increase the block size, so that more transactions can be verified on the network at less cost – for supporters of the move, bitcoin's current block size limit is holding back adoption of bitcoin for retail payments.  Many in the industry have asked the IRS for more formal guidance – the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act was introduced in Congress in an attempt to push the IRS to revisit its determination – but the IRS has yet to release an update.  According to Kim:  ""Forks represent just one example of activities on a blockchain that may have tax consequences that, with little guidance from the IRS, are difficult to determine.""

42428054,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5afh,1510210843,Renewable-Energy Blockchain Project Moves Past Test Phase,"Renewable energy may be clean, but it's not always available when needed, so a major power transmitter has kicked off a project using blockchain technology to manage the flow of power.  Tennet announced  last week that it was running the first European blockchain-controlled power stabilization scheme, in a partnership with battery supplier Sonnen, using IBM's blockchain software.  The two partners announced test pilots in May, as CoinDesk reported at the time. That work has now entered the phase of practical application.  Urban Keussen, Tennet's board chairman, said the project allowed the company to lead the way on the integration of renewable energy into the power supply of Europe.  He said in a statement:  ""As a grid operator, we are taking a new approach here to better integrate decentralized renewable energy sources and secure supply. At the same time we offer citizens the opportunity to actively participate in the energy transition.""  Blockchain technology makes it easier to securely and efficiently manage flow as new sources of power get added to the grid, Tennet said.  Sonnen provides batteries to homeowners that allow them to store power generated at their homes when they aren't there and using it. These batteries are networked, in the SonnenCommunityhttps://www.sonnenbatterie.de/en/sonnenCommunity. By connecting that network to Tennet's transmission system, the power distributor can tap stored power nearby as needed or offload excess power into the batteries.  ""Instead of firing up power plants in the south of Germany we just draw the required electricity from our storage systems,"" Sonnen Managing Director Philipp Schröder said in a statement.  A spokesperson for Sonnen explained in an email to CoinDesk that this isn't simply energy trading. Rather, it's making home equipment a part of the real infrastructure of the grid, not just an endpoint.  Currently, European transmission operators manage congestion on the network using expensive techniques like varying output at the power plant level, contracting with third-party plants for extra electricity and curtailing wind power output. Such approaches cost the system roughly 800 million euros across Germany in 2016, according to Tennet.  Tennet transmits power to 41 million users in the Netherlands and Germany.

42428030,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5aFh,1510203877,Wall Street Exec Sued for Role in Fraudulent Cryptocurrency Scheme,"Four investors in GAW Miners have sued Stuart A. Fraser for his role at the defunct crypto business, following a guilty plea of wire fraud by his longtime partner, Josh Garza.  In a complaint first filed in the U.S. District Court for Connecticut last year, the plaintiffs accused Fraser, GAW Miners and ZenMiner of violating federal and state securities laws.  Fraser, the vice chairman of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, subsequently filed a motion to dismiss all the allegations, which the court denied, according to a ruling dated on Oct 11.  The plaintiffs, Denis Marc Audet, Michael Pfeiffer, Dean Allen Shinners and Jason Vargas, stated in the complaint that Fraser had a ""deep involvement with Garza and GAW Miners.""  This relationship assisted Garza when he made a series of false statements to prospective customers and investors, such as GAW Miners' ""phony"" acquisition of ZenMiner, the complaint says.  Fraser's lawyer, Daniel H. Weiner from Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, told CoinDesk:  ""This is the initial phase of the case. We look forward to disprove the litigation as the case progresses.""  In their civil suit, the plaintiffs cited Fraser's long-time personal and business mentorship and relationships with Garza, and his engagement in the GAW Miners business, including making operational decisions and representing GAW Miners in third-party negotiations.  Fraser was also accused of leveraging his previous position at Cantor Fitzgerald to ""introduce potential investors to Garza and GAW Miners.""  The four plaintiffs, who seek class-action status for their case, had purchased Hashlets, a kind of investment contract that paid returns on GAW's digital currency mining.  On July 20, Garza, the former CEO of GAW Miners, was convicted for charges that derived from his operation of GAW, GAW Miners, ZenMiner and ZenCloud, all of which were suspected of fraudulent activities.  Originally scheduled for October, the sentencing may be postponed to early next year and Garza may face a penalty of over $9 million with up to 20 years in prison. In addition, on Oct 4, a U.S. federal judge signed a final judgment holding Garza liable for $9.18 million in another case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission less than two years ago.

Parity Launches Support Website In Wake of Exploit,"U.K.-based startup Parity Technologies is opening lines of communication with users a day after a code vulnerability locked hundreds out of their ethereum wallets.  Issued in an alert Wednesday, the provider of software for the world's second-largest blockchain explained what went wrong and launched a website where users can check their addresses to see if their funds were affected. Parity also posted an email address for users to contact the company.  As of Wednesday afternoon, the wallet-checking website showed that 584 wallets and 573 people have been affected by the exploit. However, it's not clear if this is a final number or if it's simply the latest one that the company has tallied.  Parity was not immediately available for comment.  The security alert goes on to describe how a flaw in the company's code was exploited following a patch in July that fixed a prior vulnerability:  ""Unfortunately, that code contained another vulnerability which was undiscovered at the time – it was possible to turn the Parity Wallet library contract into a regular multi-sig wallet and become an owner of it by calling the initWallet function.""  The person who discovered the fault did so and then deleted the new wallet, Parity said, in statements that showcase the company's ""current understanding"" of the incident.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the ethereum community is now seeking to understand how best to respond to the incident, given that a hard fork of the software may be necessary. No other known solutions have been put forward to restore the frozen ether to their owners, though it's possible one could be forthcoming.

The consortium is implementing this strategy by design.The potential outcome of this attack still remains unclear. Bitcoin could prove resilient to the attack and come out on top. However, if it does not survive the attack, transactions will grind to a halt and faith in Bitcoin will be all but lost.Hold on to your seats, things could get messy!",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | FORKS,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitcoin-bogeyman-51-attack,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15990359.jpeg
