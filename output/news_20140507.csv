42397617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSSj,1399495214,"Survey Finds Silicon Valley, Wall Street Bullish on Bitcoin","A new survey published by the SecondMarket-owned public investment fund, Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), suggests that as the general public learns more about bitcoin, overall optimism about its future financial applications is likely to improve.  The survey  garnered responses from more than 1,000 individuals, including those from the Wall Street, Silicon Valley and bitcoin communities. The results detail how the respondents first learned about bitcoin and how their view of the technology's potential changed over time.  Overall, the findings suggest that, should the experience of these individuals successfully translate to the general public, confusion regarding bitcoin will continue to decline. This rise in awareness, the survey suggests, could also lead to more bitcoin purchases this year.  Majority purchased coins  In total, BIT found that 66% of respondents plan to purchase bitcoins in 2014, and that 74% believe that bitcoin will become a viable alternative currency.  Fifty-three per cent of survey takers had previously purchased bitcoin, although, of those who had not, 87% indicated they were likely to purchase bitcoins in 2014 or were unsure if they would do so before the year's end.  Launched in September of 2013  , SecondMarket's Bitcoin Investment Trust allows high net-worth investors the ability to gain exposure to bitcoin's price movements.  Bitcoin awareness spikes in 2013  Almost half of respondents – 45% – indicated that they first heard about bitcoin in 2013. Notably, 30% reported that they learned of the technology between 2009 and 2011.  By comparison, just 22% of respondents reported becoming aware of bitcoin in 2012.  The survey also sought to assess how these individuals became aware of bitcoin, with 35% saying they first learned of the technology via a blog or social media. An additional 19% of respondents first learned of bitcoin through a family or friend, while 18% read about bitcoin for the first time in a magazine, newspaper or other publication.  Understanding leads to positive sentiment  BIT found that 50% of those who first learned about bitcoin found it 'intellectually interesting', while 30% believed it was confusing or that it would never be widely adopted.  Of those individuals who found the technology interesting, 66% were likely to purchase BTC. Notably, 44% of those who were confused by the technology still reported purchasing BTC.  Upon learning more about bitcoin, 83% said they became more positive about the technology and its potential applications.

42397610,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSKr,1399490404,China Bank Pressure Influences Latest OKCoin Service Upgrade,"Major China-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin has announced that it will halt peer-to-peer margin trading services for its domestic customers on 10th May.  The official release indicates that, after 10th May, users who have outstanding loans on the platform will be able to repay these extensions before their due date or expiration date, while new users will be unable to access the service.  Zane Tackett, OKCoin's Manager of Foreign Operations, told CoinDesk that the move is part of a previously planned process to upgrade its P2P margin trading system, and that the halt was necessary for this transition to take affect.  Perhaps most notably, one part of the process suggests that OKCoin is also being careful to ensure it complies with the tighter policy restrictions currently being enforced by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, during the transition.  ""Once finished, our customers will be able to sign a contract acknowledging the risks associated with using a margin trading system allowing them access to this service,"" Tackett said, adding:  ""We fear that new users might not have an adequate understanding of the risks or how to safely use margin trading and that this may result in the loss of their funds.""  On 6th May, OKCoin pledged, together with four other major China-based exchanges, to promote greater transparency in its business practices.  This declaration, however, was perhaps overshadowed by the announcement that OKCoin CEO Star Xu would cancel a planned appearance at this weekend's Global Bitcoin Summit.  How OKCoin's margin trading works  OKCoin offers a range of leverage in its peer-to-peer margin trading service depending on the status of the user – VIP members are allowed access to more advanced service capabilities than regular service users.  Those who take out loans on the service choose their desired interest rate, receiving at minimum the requested amount. For example, a lender who wanted to extend a loan at a 1.5% interest rate, but found that the lowest open borrow order was at 2%, would place the loan at the level.  OKCoin also keeps in place a risk management system in case of sudden market changes that automatically generates the sale of a borrower's coins at the market rate and ensures the lender's original investment.  Increasing risk awareness  OKCoin's decision to increase investor awareness as part of the service stop is indicative of a new approach being implemented at major China-based exchanges, which have seen the loss of key banking partners in recent weeks.  In addition to reaffirming its commitment to investor awareness, OKCoin also pledged to curb excessive speculation and protect investors, pay a flat fee for high-frequency trades, and report the latest industry developments to authorities.  Huobi, BTC China, BtcTrade and CHBTC also signed on to the pledge.  For more on that announcement and its implications on the Chinese market, read our full report.

42397608,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSJs,1399482053,SEC Warns Bitcoin’s Hype May Put Investors At Risk,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has released a new alert, warning investors about the risk of fraud in the digital currency industry.  In its latest guidance, the SEC, a federal organisation tasked with enforcing US securities law, advised investors to be wary of promises of large returns on investments in bitcoin ventures and schemes:  ""A new product, technology, or innovation – such as bitcoin – has the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities.""  Lack of controls, oversight  According to the SEC, there are several warnings signs that investors should watch out for when considering investments in bitcoin ventures.  Specifically, it noted that investors should be wary of investment offers that come from unlicensed or unsolicited sources. Sales pitches that seem overly aggressive or that guarantee high returns, the release said, should be warning signs for every investor.  The SEC indicated that investors who generated significant earnings during bitcoin's price boom in 2013 are particularly at risk of investment fraud. Additionally, participants in bitcoin forums like Bitcoin Talk face the risk of getting involved with fraudulent investments, such as an initial public offering (IPO) scheme.  The organisation also noted in the alert that the hype surrounding bitcoin may make it harder for investors to determine whether a particular investment opportunity is fraudulent:  ""Potential investors can be easily enticed with the promise of high returns in a new investment space and also may be less skeptical when assessing something novel, new and cutting-edge.""  Continued SEC scrutiny  The investor alert mirrors a report issued last year by the SEC, which explained the risk of Ponzi schemes involving digital currency. At the time, the SEC expressed concern that the rise in digital currency would lead to greater risks for investors because of a lack of regulatory guidance.  In recent months, the SEC has begun looking into potential fraud in the bitcoin marketplace as well.  The organization is reportedly investigating bitcoin websites. In March, the SEC began looking into the bitcoin securities exchange MPex and the gambling website SatoshiDice.

42397623,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSVg,1399475732,Bitcoin Bill Payment Services Taking Off Around the World,"Let's face it, we all hate paying bills, but the ability to pay them with digital currency might help put a smile on your face.  Earlier this year, CoinDesk reported on the launch of Bylls, a Canada-based service that allows users to pay bills in bitcoin at more than 6,000 organizations, including the government. It was one of the world's first. Now, new services are popping up around the globe that allow you to pay for everything from basic utilities to taxes in bitcoin.  Like merchant bitcoin payment processors, bill payment services solve the problem of requiring every organization to develop its own bitcoin payment infrastructure. The different systems available have varying degrees of utility, from just a few cooperating payees, to use for everything from credit card bills to taxes.  Living Room of Satoshi, Australia  An Australia-based service called Living Room of Satoshi (LRoS) now promises to pay anyone on that country's BPAY network in bitcoin for no cost.  BPAY  is a universal bill-payment system in Australia that allows people to pay by phone or online by entering two numeric codes. Nearly every major business and organization uses the system, including federal and state governments, and credit card companies.  To use Living Room of Satoshi, users simply enter the BPAY Biller and Reference codes plus the amount, and the site generates a bitcoin address/QR code. BPAY will issue a receipt within 30 minutes.  Co-founder Daniel Alexiuc is a long-time developer and entrepreneur, whose previous venture was an e-commerce company shipping live aquarium fish through the mail.  Experience with paying transaction fees to banks and payment systems as a small business, plus other experience working for banks and payment processors himself, got him interested in bitcoin. He told CoinDesk:  ""There are no fees to use LRoS. And we don't make any money on the exchange rate either. Ideally, Living Room of Satoshi will always be a free service for the users. How is this possible? Because of our plan.""  The plan is to help build the bitcoin economy in Australia, and Alexiuc's vision is to see a 'Pay with Bitcoin' option everywhere, with QR codes printed directly onto physical and digital bills.  Paying bills with bitcoin via BPAY is his way of getting people used to the idea of making such day-to-day payments, and presenting a large user base as a business case to potential companies in future.  Launched in 1997, BPAY was the world's first ""single bill payment service accepted across the banking system"", according to its website. Since 2002 it has also offered BPAY View, which delivers bills electronically to online banking sites, enabling payment directly from accounts.  In financial year 2012-13, BPAY processed A$265bn worth of payments. The average bill payment today is A$785. BPAY also has a 'third-party service provider' programme that allows software developers, printing companies, consultants, and other providers to link other services to the network, which is how Living Room of Satoshi was able to plug in bitcoin.  Quantified, Singapore  Like Living Room of Satoshi, Singapore-based Quantified also allows access to multiple companies and services, including government, meaning residents may also pay taxes and other governmental fees with bitcoin.  The company, which launched in March, offers a number of bitcoin exchange services of which bill payments is one. One of its founders, Finnish entrepreneur Ville Oehman, describes the service as like using a debit card to pay someone in a foreign currency: they still receive the amount in their local currency and are never aware what was used in the original payment.  Thus, bitcoin is exchanged and transferred to the payee in Singapore dollars. Entering your bill details into Quantified's online form generates an email with a bitcoin address and QR code, which the user simply pays and then waits for an emailed confirmation once the bill is processed.  Bitcoin values are generated via local exchange itBit's API. Quantified charges a 2.9% commission on the Singapore dollar (SGD) value of the transaction, and since bitcoin transactions are taxed in Singapore, a 7% of the commission itself is added as Goods and Services Tax (GST).  enBitcoins, Argentina  Launched in December amid the height of bitcoin's most recent price boom, Argentina-based enBitcoins is the product of former Internet entrepreneurs who are now focusing primarily on the bitcoin space.  Founder Matías Alejo Garcia indicated he was considering a number of opportunities – including ventures into 3D printing and drone delivery – before turning his attention to bitcoin last year. The idea arose from the difficulty the developers had in securing bitcoin in Argentina, but quickly grew in popularity due to its primary consumer use case, said Garcia, adding:    ""It was just an experiment, it was something we built in a week or something, and we got a really warm welcome from the bitcoin community in Argentina and they started trusting us with their coins.""              Today, enBitcoins operates with the help of three partners that conduct free bill payment services, and doesn't see earnings from the offering.      In the future, Garcia says enBitcoins may look to ink deals directly with major utility providers so they can earn as much as traditional bill payment intermediaries. However, such plans are still in the early stages.    Garcia indicates that enBitcoins is still a side project for the team, most of whom joined BitPay when it opened a new headquarters in Argentina at the beginning of 2014.  Pademobile, Mexico  Pademobile  is an international digital wallet service that accepts bitcoin and has localized sites in Spain and Mexico. Its iOS app, called Bills, allows users in Mexico to pay for services with bitcoin like electricity, gas, telephone, cable TV and a number of other services.  TuKarCash, Indonesia  TuKarCash  is an Indonesian payment gateway that allows money to be sent from a number of different payment services including: Western Union, bank transfer, PerfectMoney, EgoPay, cash, and bitcoin.  Once the money is in the account, users can pay bills for utilities including telephone/Internet, water and electricity.  Bahtcoin, Thailand  Thailand-based buy-sell exchange Bahtcoin is doing well for a country where bitcoin's legal status was once questioned.  Users can also use the site to pay bills for landline and mobile phones, Internet service and cable TV, plus power from Metropolitan Electricity, by submitting billing information via an online form and receiving a payment code. There's even at least one language school on the list.

42397609,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSMp,1399469689,Authentication Protocol BitID Lets Users 'Connect with Bitcoin',"Instead of selecting 'Connect with Twitter' when you log into your favorite website, you might one day log in by choosing 'Connect with Bitcoin' instead.  BitID is a decentralized authentication protocol that leverages bitcoin wallets as a form of identification and QR codes for service or platform access points. It enables users to access an online account by verifying themselves with their wallet address and uses a mobile device as the private key authenticator.  The protocol was developed by Eric Larchevêque, one of the co-founders of La Maison du Bitcoin, a bitcoin community centre located in Paris.  Larchevêque told CoinDesk that the greatest strength of the concept is the fact that nearly all bitcoin users have a personal wallet:  “In all the bitcoin services and websites, everyone already has a wallet and everyone is already taking care of securing their private key. So, in fact, for the user, it’s zero effort to be able to just to authenticate themselves.”  BitID relies on the blockchain as a store of information and could be deployed across a variety of platforms, including e-commerce sites and smart appliances.  Cryptographic site access  Currently, most websites require the creation of a private account with a username and password. In the past year or two, more sites have begun allowing the use of a social media account such as Facebook or Twitter.  Ultimately, access to a site requires the disclosure of at least some personal information.  With BitID, the only information a user has to provide to a webite is their wallet address. After scanning a QR code on the site with the user’s mobile device, or clicking the QR code on the mobile device for the first time, the server creates a new private key for that wallet.  BitID could also be deployed as a decentralized two-factor authentication process, in the same way that Google Authenticator functions. In addition to have a username and password, a BitID-integrated site could also require a QR code scan to confirm the user's identity.  Software and hardware applications  The BitID concept might also be utilized in a simplified e-commerce environment that removes the need to provide credit card or bank account information when placing an order online.  Using the BitID protocol, an e-commerce site would require proof of identity at checkout. When the user scans the QR code with their authenticator device, it would both establish their identity, while also authorizing the transaction.  According to Larchevêque, BitID would improve the efficiency of online ordering because it removes steps in the e-commerce process:  “You do not need to create an account, so it’s less clicks and more conversions. And in the end, it’s more money for the e-commerce site.”  BitID is also applicable to the concept of smart appliances. Larchevêque told CoinDesk that the projects origins began with what he called a 'bitcoin locker' that uses a bitcoin wallet address to authenticate ownership of an integrated lockbox. Once the owner scans the QR code, the lockbox recognises the owner and allows entry.  He said that the idea could used for home security and hotel services, with the latter constituting a hotel that accepts bitcoin as payment and uses wallet addresses to authenticate access to hotel rooms and charging the bill at the point of entry.  There is, however, some room for problems and potential fraud with BitID in the event that a user's device is hacked or stolen. This is an issue facing current digital authentication processes as a whole and poses a future challenge for security software developers.

The Kippt team recently expanded the idea with Inc – a version of Kippt aimed at enterprise users. The Kippt API is used in many third-party apps too.  “This marks the end of the journey for us at Kippt. Although our service has been loved by many, we never achieved the growth and the scale that would allow a sustainable future for Kippt,” the company said in a blog post.  Lallo and Saarinen said they are excited to join Coinbase’s product team. They argued that bitcoin is one of the most important inventions of recent decades and it is driving a major shift in the payments and financial industry.  The exact details of the stock-and-cash deal have not been disclosed. While it may mark the end of the road for Kippt, the team says it will keep both it and Inc alive as side projects. Kippt Pro paid plans will be discontinued, however.  VC backing  The Kippt deal is Coinbase's first acquisition since it raised $25m in series-B funding led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz last year.

42397604,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSFw,1399458932,When Payments Become Political Weapons of Mass Destruction,"Executives at Visa and MasterCard awoke yesterday morning to learn that Vladimir Putin's Russia had passed legislation requiring foreign credit card brands to post $3.8 billion in total security collateral, the equivalent of two days'-worth of transactions processed in the country.  After Russia reunified with (or annexed, depending on your point of view) Crimea, Visa and MasterCard complied with stringent White House sanctions and blocked transaction activity at several Russian banks. Both financial companies rightly feared a backlash from their actions.  Under the new law which goes into effect on July 1st, no foreign payment system may unilaterally cut services to Russian clients and they must base their processing centre in Russia, with transaction data maintained within its borders.  Additionally, there will be fines of up to 10% of the collateral deposit per day for unilaterally stopping services to a bank. For Visa, the required collateral deposit actually exceeds their annual returns from operating in the country.  Earlier, the credit card companies stopped working with Bank Rossiya and Sobinbank due to a previous round of US government sanctions.  Now, per the more recent sanctions, that ban is extended to the Russian banks SMP and InvestCapitalbank. Both banks are controlled by the Rotenberg brothers, Boris and Arkady, who are linked to large gas pipeline contracts and various Sochi Olympics contracts.  Payments networks have now become political weapons of mass destruction. This is a disturbing trend, because if the selective halting of international credit card networks can be deployed against political enemies, then nearly no country is safe.  Business models disrupted  An admittedly nervous Visa statement on Tuesday explained: ""We regret any disruptions that the institutions, their cardholders or merchants may experience. All of Visa's systems are processing normally, and we continue to service our other unaffected Russian clients.""  MasterCard stated that they will remain ""open for business as usual with all our Russian banks, with the exception of Rossiya, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and InvestCapitalBank. Service of cards issued by the latter two banks will be stopped shortly according to the revised US sanctions announced today.""  Visa and MasterCard process about 90% of all card transactions in Russia and the new law completely disrupts their business and technological models.  Visa's Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt told the Financial Times that ""issues with Russia and Ukraine were already affecting cross-border volume and sanctions would impact on payment volumes."" He added that the company expects several pennies of earnings per share impact for the fiscal year.  However, Visa CEO Charlie Scharf remains optimistic, telling analysts, ""If you just get down to reality for a second, we have 100 million cards in Russia today. And it's not in anyone's best interest, inclusive of the Russians, to make those cards not available to their own citizens.""  Home-grown system  Similar to France's Carte Bleue and Germany's Geldkarte, the Russian central bank plans to establish a national payments system for handling domestic card transactions in Russia.  For international transactions, Russia is inspired by China's UnionPay, the rapidly growing payments platform whose cards are accepted in 135 countries and is now bigger than MasterCard and second only to Visa in processing volume. Who needs Visa and MasterCard in a world of payments innovation?  We are witnessing more and more of these types of payment blockades in line with broader financial warfare occurring under the surface. In 2012, Belgium-based wire clearinghouse SWIFT discontinued service to 30 Iranian banks following intense pressure from Washington, DC.      And who could forget the proverbial rug being pulled out from under Wikileaks by the Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal giants.          In July, the US plans to unleash the IRS on Russian banks further destabilizing the current situation.        Risky game    Centralized systems have always had the weakness of being driven by both external and political forces. It's simply an inevitable temptation when a single choke point exists in the network.  The same mischief that plays out between mega-states on the international stage just as easily plays out domestically in inflationary regimes like Argentina, where credit cards are frequently limited to domestic usage only and where hard currency and precious metals are difficult to obtain.  Once the payment mechanism starts to become used for achieving policy goals, the system has lost its integrity. Alternative payment methods that rebuke censorship begin to emerge, attracting new capital and new economic activity.          Meanwhile, in other related news, Ukraine climbed to the No.9 position in global active bitcoin nodes and Russia currently sits at No.7. Global active bitcoin nodes measure number of nodes in the distributed p2p network that maintain and broadcast the full bitcoin block chain.      In the words of Jim Rickards, author of The Death of Money, ""only escalate the battle if you know where it's headed.""  Visa and Mastercard could be significantly harmed by this obvious retaliation. In addition to mandating changes to the rules of the local payments network, Russia could freeze assets of US companies doing business in Russia and also begin to unwind its positions in US treasuries. And, that's before they even get to the gas and oil markets.

42397616,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSRk,1399453297,Bitcoin Trading Platform Vaurum Raises $4 Million in Seed Funding,"California-based Vaurum, a company that offers financial institutions a way to trade and store bitcoins, has raised $4m in venture capital.  The investment is described as a seed round and comes from a group of investors that includes VC firm Battery Ventures, Tim Draper and former AOL CEO Steve Case.  Avish Bhama, Vaurum CEO, said in a prepared statement:  “Most investors—even savvy institutions—need an easy-to-use and compliant platform through which to buy and sell bitcoins, and we provide that solution.”  Bhama told CoinDesk the company plans to use the majority of its funding to hire additional engineering staff, while a small portion of the round will be used for regulatory compliance expenditures.  Plug and trade model  Vaurum's software can be described as a bitcoin exchange plugged into existing financial trading platforms already used by investors – a service sometimes known as a 'white-label' exchange.  Vaurum builds the bitcoin exchange software, but it is often branded as, and part of, a larger product that traders and investors have funds in. High trading volume is a major feature of Vaurum's platform, according to Bhama, who explained:  ""Our trading engine was built for high-frequency trade execution and is set up to process hundreds of thousands of transactions per currency-pair per second.""  The commission structure Vaurum uses for this software levies a percentage of bitcoin for the company, while its white-label partner takes commission on the fiat side of trades.  Customers  Vaurum says that its software is already being used at hedge funds, foreign exchange dealers and other institutional investment houses. However, it has declined to specifically name any of its customers at this time.  ""As we are set up in various different currency pairs across different networks around the world, it is compelling for arbitrage traders to come in and leverage our API to build trading strategies,"" said Bhama.  Roger Lee, a general partner at Battery Ventures, said in a prepared statement regarding Vaurum's funding that his firm believes bitcoin will flourish as an investment vehicle over the long-term:  “There is a need for a secure bitcoin-trading system, and we look forward to supporting Vaurum as it grows this nascent market.”  About Vaurum  Vaurum was accelerated at Boost VC as one of seven bitcoin companies to go through that incubator programme last summer.  The company competes with a number of other bitcoin-related startups for the attention of traders and investors interested in cryptocrrencies. One such platform in the same space as Vaurum is Singapore-based itBit, which has built a trading engine based on NASDAQ's software.  Another competitor is New York City's Coinsetter, which accesses exchange APIs such as Bitstamp in order to provide trading liquidity.  Vaurum's white-label approach, which quietly plugs into other platforms, is also reminiscent of bitcoin trading platform Buttercoin, which is backed by Google Ventures, and Bex.io, which raised $525,000 in funding at the end of 2013.
