42397232,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Hl,1379354940,Bitcoin wallet Armory raises $600k in seed funding,"Secure bitcoin wallet Armory has raised $600,000 in funding from a number of prominent investors.  The seed round investment was partially made in bitcoin, and featured a contribution from entrepreneur, journalist and avid freedom of speech defender Trace Mayer.  Las Vegas-based entrepreneur and Harvard University graduate Kevin Bombino also invested, as did Jim Smith, a fund manager and private investor.  Alan Reiner, founder and CEO of Armory, said he was ""super excited"" about the investment.  ""This project has been an obsession of mine for the last two years, and I had been looking for an excuse to quit my job and work on it full-time,"" he added.  Reiner, who previously worked as a physicist at Johns Hopkins University, said he is a great believer in bitcoin and thinks he can truly make an impact on the digital currency's success now he has the time to develop Armory.  The majority of the funds will be used to hire and pay three or four full-time developers.  Reiner explained:  ""This first 12 months is more about developing a quality product than it is figuring out how to monetize it. There will be some money set aside for travel, conferences and contractors to fill in gaps in our business capability, but most of it is for development costs.""  Mayer said he has great faith in Reiner and believes he is capable of pushing bitcoin forward and developing the advanced tools the space requires: ""Alan is among the best in the world at what he does and his fruit, Armory, is the best of breed bitcoin wallet, open-source and a free application.""  What's next?  Reiner said he has a number of features planned for Armory and is excited that, now he is working full-time on the wallet software, he'll finally have time to implement them.  As for what Armory has planned for the near future, Reiner said: ""We're currently just finishing up a new release that solves the RAM issues and long load times. It also includes 'fragmented backups', which protect your coins forever like single-sheet printed backups, but these can be split into multiple locations to improve physical security.""  He explained that a user's wallet can be broken into three fragments and they can use any two to recover all their coins. This means the user can improve their wallet's security by keeping one fragment at home, one in a safe-deposit box and one with a friend or family member, for example.  Reiner added:  ""We also plan to support hardware wallets in the immediate future, and start development on an Android app. In the longer-term, we hope to pioneer multi-signature transactions that allow for multi-device or multi-party authentication of funds.""  The Armory team believes this is critical if bigger players are to get involved in bitcoin. They claim many people are reluctant to invest in bitcoins as there is currently no safe way to manage lots of the currency as all wallets require only one signature to move funds.  Mayer said he feels confident in Reiner's ability to continue adding ""tremendous value to the bitcoin ecosystem"".  What features would you like to see added to Armory?

42397240,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Nf,1379352959,UNOCS altcoin partnership dismantled following Feathercoin pullout,"UNOCS, the partnership designed to take several altcoins mainstream, has been dismantled after Feathercoin announced its departure from the scheme.  The United Open Currencies Solutions project, originally announced just two months ago, met its end unexpectedly this weekend after one of the founding coins, Feathercoin, publicly announced that it had pulled out. This left the other two coins, Phenixcoin and Worldcoin, unable to continue with the project, said representatives.  Feathercoin’s new spokesperson, Chris Ellis, made the announcement at 4pm UK time via email, and in a post in the Feathercoin forum (registration required).  “We got carried away and rushed into a partnership that was being run by an external group of developers, a process in which we did not have enough control,” he said.  UNOCS had been working on a software payment system known as UNOCS Bridge, which would have allowed merchants to accept payments in the three currencies. There was also to be a fiat currency exchange component, allowing users to easily obtain the coins.  Worldcoin was to have focused on marketing and graphics, Feathercoin bought its strong community focus, and Phenixcoin was responsible for handling the lion’s share of software development, according to William Jones, a spokesperson for UNOCS, who also works on Worldcoin.  Peter Bushnell, founder of Feathercoin, told CoinDesk that he became concerned about Phenixcoin (PXC).  “PXC's attitude towards community is incompatible with ours,” he said. “They seem to have terrible project management. There is still no Bridge but they say that they are working on it. They now have a working exchange which seems to be taking up their time.”  Bushnell was also concerned about a recent change to the rate at which Phenixcoins are released.  “Phenixcoin shocked me when they launched a patch that changed the mint rate with a hard fork with six hours' notice,” he said. “That was a complete shock for everyone, especially anyone who had 'invested' in Phenixcoin.”  ‘MaGNeT’, who handles PR for Phenixcoin, told CoinDesk that this issue had been solved.  “I can imagine people were afraid it would increase the block generation of PXC, but actually we were behind on generation because of the difficulty lockups. The current update solved that,” he said. “Difficulty adjustment is now smooth and to our original specifications.’  Bushnell’s concern was one of several raised about Phenixcoin in the Bitcoin forum. He referred CoinDesk to this post, made by another forum member, which also calls out the coin on several other issues. Phenixcoin had not responded publicly in the thread at the time of writing, but MaGNeT makes a written response here.  One of the biggest problems for UNOCS seems to be the departure of John Manglaviti (aka JustABitOfTime on the forums), who had been the public face of Feathercoin, but who then left that community to work on UNOCS. Manglaviti subsequently left UNOCS, which apparently left a vacuum.  “We all have our coins to run, and it’s been tough times for altcoins so there’s a lot of stuff going on,” said Jones, who said that he hadn’t heard from Manglaviti for weeks. “There are all kinds of projects running, and you have your private life and private jobs. So we have our hands full.”  CoinDesk contacted Manglaviti, who seemed to have been holding the whole thing together. The UNOCS bridge was entirely Phenix's project, he said.  “While Feathercoin's lead developer Peter Bushnell helped both Worldcoin and Phenix with patches, the Bridge development had nothing to do with Feathercoin. They were led to believe it would be released at the end of the UNOCS website countdown, however, delay after delay plagued the launch,” he said.  “I worked my ass off trying to get all three coins to engage, [including] constant Skype. However, [there were] all kinds of nonsense internally with some of the coins that I care not to discuss. I wish all three coins the best of luck,” Manglaviti concluded.  Bushnell told CoinDesk that he would be happy to work with Worldcoin, but Jones has said he was “disappointed” at how the breakup was handled, alleging that Feathercoin made the public announcement before it communicated directly with the other altcoins.  Conversely Ellis, who took his role after Manglaviti left and was trying to get a status update on UNOCS, said that he hadn’t heard from UNOCS since September 4.  This leaves the three altcoins with no payment system, and little way forward together. It also leaves Feathercoin trying to rebuild its community, said Ellis, arguing that a lot of people were disillusioned over UNOCS.  “I’m trying to rebuild things back to how they were,’ he said. “A lot of people haven’t turned up in a few weeks on the forum.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WLD | FORKS,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/16/unocs-altcoin-partnership-dismantled-following-feathercoin-pullout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7189922ff8eb8477d5feb20507bc33de7bbe457b-1157x850.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397239,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Qc,1379346093,Australians can now buy beer in bitcoin at Sydney pub,"One of Sydney’s more ancient and traditional pubs is the unlikely place to be trialling one of the newest and most innovative technologies of the modern day.  Forget sleek, contemporary and stylish, The Old Fitzroy is as character-filled as they come and is now Australia’s first known pub to start accepting bitcoin.  Publican Garry Pasfield will start taking bitcoins at the bar from 29th September, at a launch event he is dubbing ‘Beer for Bitcoins.’  He made the decision to accept the currency after hearing so much about it from his brother, and learning about it from members of Sydney’s bitcoin meetup groups. He is now hoping to capitalise on the Sydney market by becoming the first bricks and mortar business in the city to take a virtual currency.  Located in the heart of the former working-class neighbourhood of Wooloomooloo, the pub is steeped in history and operates as a hotel as well as having a small theatre out the back.  “What that boils down to is that we have a good cross-section of the market,” Garry says, naming locals, young people, backpackers and post-work drinkers among the regular crowd. “We cater for people from 18 to 80 and we have a good opportunity with the tech-savvy youngsters,” he says.  Garry is no stranger to technology having already implemented a sophisticated, computerised payment and stock system, which he says some premises are only just beginning to adopt, and there is free wifi throughout the venue - invaluable when customers make their bitcoin transactions.  He has had help adapting the point of sale device to accept bitcoin, which will generate a QR code for customers to scan with their smartphone when they purchase drinks or food.  In conjunction with the bitcoin launch, people unfamiliar or interested in the currency will have the opportunity to buy it and try it from traders in the bar in a small Satoshi Square-style event. There will also be information about how to download a bitcoin wallet so that people can start using it on the day.  It is all in vast contrast to the way the pub presents itself, which Garry describes as having “a grunginess”. “People come here because it is small and old,” he says. He added:  “But progress doesn’t stop for anybody and I’m interested in bitcoin because it is progressive.”  The fact that “it is costing nothing to try it” also appeals to Garry. He will benefit from the relatively lower fees associated with taking bitcoin compared with credit cards as well.  “A lot of people will like the opportunity to steer away from the big banks and the fact these multinationals are taking over is irking a lot of people,” Garry told us. “I think [bitcoin] has a lot of legs if it can establish itself, and it is surprising that there is an opportunity to avoid the big four [banks].”  He will not, of course, be avoiding the taxman. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has said it will continue to monitor bitcoin’s volatility and how widely it is accepted.  “We use data-matching and industry benchmarking to focus on businesses that may not be reporting all their income and these would similarly identify businesses that may be under-reporting income received via a bitcoin payment system,” an ATO spokesman said. “The value used by the buyer and the seller in these transactions needs to be identical and consistent with market prices.”  It might be an area the ATO has to start looking into more closely; The Old Fitzroy’s move is just one significant step in Sydney’s burgeoning bitcoin scene. Author of the new book, An Idiot’s Guide To Bitcoin, is Sydney artist Gustaf van Wyk, who will also be attending the pub’s launch event to talk about the technology and concepts surrounding the currency.  The bitcoin meetups are also growing in popularity. The Sydney Bitcoin Users Group meets each week at the cavernous lower floor bar of 1 Martin Place in the city, but seventy-strong group is proof that the community is going anywhere but underground. In fact, there are more than 130 members across the three bitcoin meetup groups hosted in the city.  The Australian chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation has been born from one such group, with nine members from all over Australia and across the world. Jason Williams, one of the organisers, says they share the same vision as that of the Foundation in the US: “To promote bitcoin and offer apolitical advice on a range of topics regarding bitcoin.”  Jon Matonis  , executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation has welcomed the move. “Australia has been one of the early first-movers in organising local chapter efforts and they are considered a leader in the expansion of bitcoin globally. I look forward to engaging with the Sydney team in Australia,” he says.  It is not just in Sydney where bitcoin is taking hold. In a country of fewer than 23 million people, bitcoin groups have sprung up in almost every state capital, alongside two in New Zealand. The Melbourne community is also thriving. Bitcoin advocate, Dale Dickins, who has hosted Bitcoin for Beginners events in the city views Australia as a key player in bitcoin adoption.  “The number of people living in Australia with relatives overseas drives us to adopt new, inexpensive ways to connect with family. Until now there hasn’t been an inexpensive way to transfer money. From that perspective, I think Australians are responding favourably to virtual currency,” she says.  As if to back up her statement, she informs us that five of fifteen of the new Lamassu bitcoin ATMs being shipped globally, are heading to Australia.  Zach Harvey, CEO of Lamassu Inc. confirmed they are shipping several units down under. “We’re pretty excited about the interest in Australia, and it seems the regulators are more reasonable than in the US,” he says.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Louise Goss,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/16/australians-can-now-buy-beer-in-bitcoin-at-sydney-pub,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/869b2fbd0aff047c727578bfe6b9c409a3eeadd9-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397235,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Ik,1379338737,"BitPay now has over 10,000 merchants in its payment processor network","BitPay  has now helped over 10,000 merchants across the world accept payments in bitcoin.  The company, which was founded in 2011, only approved its 1,000th company this time last year, so it has experienced a huge surge in business over the past 12 months.  Of the merchants that use BitPay, some 50% are located in North America and 25% are in Europe. Over 90% of the merchants using the payment service provider are ecommerce businesses, and BitPay also counts blogging platform WordPress among its clients.  Tony Gallippi, co-founder and CEO of BitPay, said: ""Our largest merchants are selling high-ticket items such as computers, electronics, jewellery, precious metals and bitcoin mining equipment.""  He went on to say these businesses are more likely to get hit by criminals using stolen credit cards, so they are attracted by the prospect of accepting bitcoins as doing so reduces their risk.  Gallippi went on to say his company processes between $6m and $7m in merchant transactions each month, with transactions last month totalling $6.4m. Year-to-date in 2013, the company has transacted over $34m, equivalent to 270,830 bitcoins at today's Bitcoin Price Index.  QuickBooks  Last week, BitPay announced merchants could import their BitPay sales into online accounting software QuickBooks, which BitPay CFO Bryan Krohn said customers are ""thrilled"" about.  ""It makes reporting their bitcoin sales just as frictionless as the payment itself,"" he added.  Funding  BitPay is based in Atlanta, Georgia, which Gallippi describes as a ""hub for financial technology, especially in the payment and merchant acquiring space"".  He said there is a cluster of ""amazing"" companies in the city that are focused on ""delivering real results through innovation"".  Investors clearly see BitPay in this light, as the company received $2m back in May in a funding round led by the Founders Fund. This VC investment firm consists of five partners who were founders or early investors in companies including Facebook, PayPal, Napster, and Palantir Technologies.  Competitors  BitPay may be leading the way as the merchants' payment service provider of choice, but that's not to say it's without competition. Coinbase recently tried to increase its share in the market by offering merchants free payment processing for the first $1m in orders received from customers.  BIPS  also professes to be doing well, claiming to be the ""largest provider of bitcoin payment solutions in Europe"".  Kris Henriksen, founder and CEO of BIPS, said his company currently serves more than 15,000 EU-based customers from its offices in Denmark, with around 1,000 of these customers being merchants.  ""It's going really well for the merchants' section of BIPS. We have quite a few certified and individual qualified partners now so we can reach so many more merchants,"" he explained.  Henriksen said some exciting developments are currently underway at BIPS, although he wouldn't reveal too much.  ""What I can say is that we are going to be able to accommodate US customers when our new feature launches,"" he said.

42397238,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Ki,1379328618,Mt. Gox countersues bitcoin incubator CoinLab for $5.5 Million,"Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has responded to a lawsuit by former US partner CoinLab, asking for $5.5m in damages. The exchange alleges that CoinLab was not able to operate lawfully as its partner in the US.  The two companies had formed a business partnership last November, giving bitcoin business incubator CoinLab the exclusive license to market Mt. Gox’s services in North America. But CoinLab had filed a complaint on May 2, alleging that Mt. Gox had withheld information it needed to market to customers, instead continuing to sell into North America itself. It claimed $75m in damages.  On Friday, Mt. Gox responded with a counterclaim, arguing that it was unable to let CoinLab market in North America because the company had violated the contract. In particular, it hadn’t registered as a money transmitting business or money services business.  “One of the most important issues to Mt. Gox was that CoinLab be compliant with all applicable laws,” said Todd Gamlen, a partner in the ligitation services group at Baker & McKenzie LLP, which is acting on behalf of Mt. Gox.  “CoinLab promised Mt. Gox that CoinLab was, and would be, compliant. As it turns out, CoinLab was not properly registered with the federal government or in the necessary states,” Gamlen continued.  “CoinLab did not have the legal ability to conduct the services, plain and simple - if CoinLab had operated the bitcoin exchange services in the US called for under the Agreement it would have violated the law.”  CoinLab owner Peter Vessenes had told Mt. Gox via a Skype chat that the company was registered as a ‘prepaid access’ provider and that this was sufficient, said Mt. Gox’s counterclaim.  “Vessenes refused to disclose or say why this was the case even though requested by Mt. Gox, claiming it to be a ‘trade secret’; and, that if it were disclosed Mt. Gox would have no need for CoinLab,” the counterclaim said.  Mt. Gox  wants the $75m damage claim dismissed. It also says that CoinLab took $12,788,701 in payments from Mt. Gox’s North American customers in March and April this year, but only sent Mt. Gox $7,473,490. Now, it wants the other $5,315,210, plus interest. It also wants other monies that it says CoinLab gained under a revenue sharing clause, amounting to US $62,258, CAD $40, and 1,428 bitcoins.  Vessenes did not reply to requests for comment. A spokesperson for CoinLab said that the company was reviewing the counterclaim.  At the time of writing, Vessenes is still the chair of the Bitcoin Foundation’s boardhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/board, and Mark Karpeles, CEO of Mt. Gox, is also a board member.
