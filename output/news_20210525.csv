42386846,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXS3,1621981029,Consensus 2021: 6 Questions for Gartner's Avivah Litan,"Avivah Litan is a distinguished analyst at Gartner Research specializing in emerging technologies. She has deep insight into everything from enterprise blockchain to the buzzy world of non-fungible tokens (NFT). CoinDesk sat down with her to discuss what’s latest in emerging tech.      You've written and advised clients on enterprise blockchain. Where does enterprise blockchain stand now that Microsoft Azure has decided to shut down its blockchain department? Does this signify anything for IBM or ConsenSys' experiments?      Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) is not an area where enterprises need the most help. BaaS addresses the easiest part of blockchain implementation, i.e. provisioning and operating nodes, and related basic services. Instead, enterprises need help aligning their use cases and business ecosystems with blockchain distributed ledger technology. Most users are not clear on why they need the technology.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The value of permissioned blockchain is hard to understand since it does not implement the most revolutionary aspect of public blockchains – i.e., trust minimization and elimination of central authority, achieved via decentralized consensus. Instead of eliminating central authority, permissioned blockchain replaces it with task force authority managed by consortia. Task forces are good at producing studies and academic papers but often fail at getting projects implemented. Too many cooks in the kitchen translates to competing priorities and budgets.    Read more: IBM Blockchain Is a Shell of Its Former Self After Revenue Misses, Job Cuts: Sources    Several blockchain service providers add application services on top of basic infrastructure services, making them more useful to enterprises than just basic BaaS. These services include Kaleido and ConsenSys Quorum (Ethereum based). In fact, Microsoft suggested its BaaS users consider Quorum as an alternative to their dying service. But the problems inherent to task force management and group governance are never going to go away, no matter how great the blockchain technology services are. Companies simply do not want to give up control. If anything, they want to usurp more of it. The simple answer is to recognize this fact – central authority is here to stay in the enterprise. But that doesn’t mean centralized organizations cannot embrace decentralized applications wrapped by their centralized services.      In the meantime, there is real business value in enterprise blockchain so long as all participants agree to the terms of participation. Our 2020 survey showed that about 14% of projects made it into production (see Blockchain Trials Show Business Executives Drive Focused Solutions to Production), but even then transaction volume is limited. The promising enterprise blockchain use cases we identified and documented are still in early stages, mainly because of process and governance issues and not because of technology. Project participants are often stuck in those areas, and access to BaaS infrastructure services is the least of their concerns and won’t help them get unstuck.      What do you make of China's Blockchain-Based Services Network (BSN)? Is this a legitimate model for enterprise blockchain going forward?      It looks like a well thought out, easy to use and cheap service if all you want are infrastructure services. It's interesting how they only allow international customers on the public permissionless blockchains, but won’t let their Chinese customers use them. In any event, I wouldn’t advise any of our clients to use BSN because of privacy and confidentiality issues – it would be hard to trust.    Read more: Consensus 2021: 8 Questions for Ethereum’s Andrew Keys    Major corporations like ING Bank and Bank of America discussing the disruptive potential of decentralized finance. Is this how crypto penetrates the mainstream ... by getting folded into a banking app?      Centralized companies like banks and insurance companies must determine how to add value, protections and new revenue streams to DeFi while their legacy businesses are cannibalized by decentralized protocols and contracts. DeFi technology also needs to mature, and the user experience needs to markedly improve. This transition will inevitably happen. We already see this trend unfolding during recent Gartner client inquiries. The future of enterprise blockchain includes centralized protection services and products wrapped around decentralized apps.      It will take three to five years to come to fruition, but it will combine the best of both worlds – new school innovations with old school protections, such as KYC, custodial services, fraud detection, escrow services and more. At that point, many standalone enterprise blockchains will morph into CeDeX (Centralized Decentralized Everything) environments.      The use of ransomware is increasing and increasingly profitable. Many seem to suggest that crypto's open access and semi-anonymous design is part of this growing problem. Is that true? What would increased surveillance or the presence of law enforcement mean for the blockchain industry?      Law enforcement can already look at all the bitcoin transactions used for ransomware. They have a better chance catching the criminal if they get paid in bitcoin than if the criminal uses the opaque banking system transfers and launders the money through mule accounts. Increased law enforcement analysis of blockchain transactions alone (without subpoenaing centralized exchange records) should not be an inhibitor to blockchain growth and innovation. On the other hand, more regulation on [know your customer] and [anti-money laundering] at exchanges will not be positive for innovation and will likely not do that much in catching bad actors.      Look at how far KYC and AML has not taken us in preventing criminals from using the banking system for nefarious activities.    Companies simply do not want to give up control. If anything, they want to usurp more of it. The simple answer is to recognize this fact – central authority is here to stay in the enterprise.    Are there any consumer-level privacy/data preserving tools or online hygiene techniques you might recommend?      Certainly we advise to keep all sensitive data off-chain and use ZKPs or hashes of linked data (and other methods) if information must be linked to blockchain operations and functions.      What do you think of $DESK? Does tokenization have any promise for media companies or in the fight against mis/disinformation?      I didn’t check it out but I am a big believer in using blockchain to track provenance of information akin to a whitelist. I’ve written on that and can send you more info if you want to see it. You also have to detect misinformation along with whitelisting good information on blockchains since most information will not be whitelisted (so that provenance can be tracked). You need a layered approach that includes misinformation detection to cover the entire population of information out there.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/25/consensus-2021-6-questions-for-gartners-avivah-litan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb758bda726ea0b6b7e07161d42b9ed8bd36f13a-1152x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) alleged that Poloniex, which is based in the Seychelle Islands, has not registered as a crypto asset trading platform.  On March 29, the OSC had warned exchanges that trade securities and derivatives in the province they had “to contact OSC staff or face potential regulatory action,” the OSC said in a press release.  The OSC set an April 19, 2021, deadline for exchanges to comply with the registration requirement. The agency also determined that exchanges accessible to consumers were subject to securities regulation.  More than 70 exchanges have held compliance discussions with the regulators with most of them foreign. Poloniex was not among those exchanges to register.  The OSC is collecting and assessing information from exchanges that have begun the regulatory discussions “to assess the appropriate path to registration,” including deadlines for filing “key documents,” the press release said.

42386825,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXAR,1621979376,Dapper Labs' NBA Top Shot Has Crossed the Million-User Mark,"Dapper Labs’ non-fungible token (NFT) platform NBA Top Shot has notched over $700 million in total sales in less than a year, according to CEO Roham Gharegozlou.      Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 with investor Mary Meeker, Gharegozlou said Dapper’s NFT marketplace for basketball “moments” now boasts 1 million users, an eye-watering figure for a single crypto product. Half of Top Shot’s users have paid for packs or in trades, and between 150,000 to 250,000 log in every day.      The sterling growth numbers come as the broader NFT market gradually cools down from the breakneck highs of early 2021. Top Shot was no exception: desirable moments of top National Basketball Association stars traded for hundreds of thousands of dollars during the peak NFT craze.      “The headlines are always, you know, ‘LeBron sells for $200,000 or $300,000,” Gharegozlou said, “but the reality is, out of the four and a half-ish million transactions on the marketplace in the past few months, over 3 million have been less than $50.”    NBA Top Shot user numbers    Paired with its steady daily user count, NBA Top Shot’s small-dollar figures illustrate how the platform has risen above the heady, techy and sometimes scammy NFT landscape to become a mainstream hit.      Hundreds of thousands of basketball fans wait regularly, sometimes multiple times a week, in digital queues for a chance to buy blockchain-registered highlight reels of dunks, swishes and assists. Their favorite players are in on the fun, too: “Put that on Top Shot” has become a mantra of the current NBA season, according to the New York Times.      All this has paid off big for Dapper Labs, the NFT development firm behind Top Shot and its host blockchain, Flow. Dapper was reportedly valued at $7.5 billion in April. Three weeks prior, it raised capital at a $2.6 billion valuation.    Read more: Michael Jordan Joins $305M Investment in Firm Behind NBA Top Shot    Top Shot’s $700 million figure comes mostly from trading on the secondary market, Gharegozlou said, meaning it's not all money in the bank for Dapper and its partner, the NBA. Marketplace sales add a 5% fee to cover the league’s cut and on-chain transaction fees.      Pack drops represent “a good amount” of total sales figures but most are in the secondary market, he said.    Crypto’s UX win    Gharegozlou said his firm’s success stems from building products that people want to use, that are easy to use and that do not lock themselves in a corner by “yelling crypto.”      Dapper Labs is positioning itself to capture continued success from Top Shot’s wealth of users. It is the most popular application on Dapper’s Flow blockchain, but not the only one. Over 1,000 developers are now building for the Flow ecosystem, Gharegozlou said.      He made clear that Dapper’s out for crypto proliferation.      “Put a crypto wallet in everybody’s pocket, that’s the number one mission,” Gharegozlou said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | FLOW,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/25/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f55653138e9e691bdbc4c59c59ccd13908e2bd8-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386829,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXFT,1621976575,Russian Artists to Sell NFTs to Support Journalists Under Pressure,"NFT artists are launching a digital art auction in support of Meduza, a prominent Russian media outlet that recently fell under pressure from the authorities.      Meduza announced the auction on Tuesday alongside two groups of artists: NFT Bastards and Non-Fungible Females. Eighty-one artists from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan will participate in the creation of two collages, made of video clips and pictures dedicated to Meduza. The NFTs will be sold on Rarible on May 27.      Sasshhaaaart, a female artist from Moscow who hatched the idea, told CoinDesk she thought of assembling artists for the project when she learned that Meduza started a fundraiser after it was designated a “foreign agent” – a label that hurt the outlet both financially and reputationally.      Censorship is a concern artists and journalists in Russia share, Sashaaaart said.      “It’s not normal when a painter, an artist, a musician, a writer or a journalist is afraid to express themselves. Nobody wants a black mark to be put by their name and then get persecuted,” she said.    Light in the dark    “It was not even our idea,” Meduza Editor-in-Chief Ivan Kolpakov told CoinDesk. “After we were deemed a foreign agent, the next day NFT artists were reaching out to us via all possible channels. It’s like a beam of light in the dark.”      Meduza has been struggling with its new status as a “foreign agent” since April, when Russia’s Ministry of Justice gave it that designation. The editorial team told its readers in a statement that the ominous label scared away advertisers and spurred Meduza to drastically cut expenses, including reporters’ salaries.      “We lost all our advertising clients in one week, our plan for the annual revenue went to zero at once,” Kolpakov said. “And then the fundraiser started.”      In late April, Meduza launched donations in fiat and crypto, becoming one of the few media outlets in Russia that use cryptocurrencies. The crypto community appeared keen on the idea: In less than a month, Meduza received multiple donations worth around 0.88 BTC and 22 ETH in total, or almost $90,000 by Tuesday’s prices.      Read also: Russian Activists Use Bitcoin, and the Kremlin Doesn’t Like It      According to Kolpakov, over 80,000 people donated during the past month.      Now, the journalists want to tap another kind of crypto donation – an NFT sale.      “Our goal is to raise some money, drive attention to our fundraiser and tell people about a very vivid NFT community that emerged in Russia,” Kolpakov said.    Music, paint and police batons    Along with NFT artists, the project includes collaboration from the popular electronic band Aigel, which produced a soundtrack for the video NFT, famous TV journalist Leonid Parfenov, who did a voice-over for it, and the artist Artem Loskutov.      Loskutov is a founder of the Monstration movement, when people in Russian cities would go on the street with absurd and hilarious signs, like “Now what?” – or not so funny ones like ""Forward to a dark past.""      For the Meduza auction, Loskutov created a special edition of his dubinopis, or “baton drawing” series, in which he draws Russian, American or Belarus national flags national flags by striking a canvas with a police baton smeared with paint.      “I made a painting and filmed it: a baton is striking the canvas, the traces of paint compose the logo of Meduza,” Loskutov said.      Read also: Russian News Outlet Calls for Crypto Donations as Kremlin Cracks Down on Media      A fragment of the clip will become a part of the joint video composition, and the actual, physical painting will be sold separately on Loskutov’s Facebook page, Loskutove said. Proceeds will go to Meduza.      “I want to support the media outlet that is being attacked by the state and is under risk of closing. I myself used to work in three media outlets of this kind, and only one of them survived. I hope the journalists will fend off this attack and want to help them,” Loskutov said.      This is not the first time Russian contemporary artists launched an NFT sale to support social causes. In March, co-founder of the Pussy Riot music bank Nadezhda Tolokonnikova sold a series of video NFTs to support a shelter for domestic violence survivors.      At the end of the day, everyone can become a victim of political censorship and repression, said Konstantin Groub, one of the artists taking part in the project:      “If they are coming after independent journalists, they will one day come after artists, and anyone who voices dissent.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/25/russian-artists-to-sell-nfts-to-support-journalists-under-pressure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5dfd18b422bcc386effcde526d11ccf585ace782-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether (ETH) trading around $2,507 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 5% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,397-$2,750 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $37,310 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 5.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,591-$39,824 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether volumes rival bitcoin again    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading at around $2,507 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 5% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is near the 10-hour moving average and above the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.      Ether dipped from $2,750 at 00:45 UTC (8:45 p.m. ET Monday) to as low as $2,397 by 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET), a 12.8% decrease, based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin has since made gains, however, settling at $2,507 as of press time.      “There is a good deal of room to intermediate-term oversold territory for ether,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, in her weekly investor note. “The corrective phase has not damaged the long-term uptrend or positive monthly momentum indicators, so we ultimately would be a buyer into the weakness.”      Despite Stockton’s concerns about oversold territory, trading volumes for ether appear robust. Monday’s closing data from CoinDesk Research again highlights that traders will pool liquidity in digital assets that have long-term fundamental promise, and not just in bitcoin.      Volumes on major spot exchanges tracked by CoinDesk Research for bitcoin Monday were at $72,762,652,345, while ether was at $72,479,251,812, whereas BTC usually has dominated in the past.    Ether futures open interest rebounding on CME    On Feb. 8, when institutional-grade venue CME first launched ether futures, open interest was $20 million, according to data aggregator Skew.      By May 14, ether open interest hit a record high of $598.4 million, a 28-fold increase and a sign professional money managers were seeking increased exposure in the digital asset. Since that zenith open interest dropped to as low as $366.9 million on Sunday, but closing data from Monday suggests interest is heading way back up, spiking almost 20% to $437.2 million.      “Traders’ outlook on Ethereum switched yesterday to highly positive after being negative for weeks,” said Nick Mancini, research analyst for crypto analytics platform Trade the Chain. ""Such a jump in sentiment implies a hyper focus on Ethereum and ERC-20, or Ethereum-based, assets.”      Ether is up over 240% since the start of the year.

BTC was above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bullish signal for market technicians.      “Intermediate-term bitcoin momentum is to the downside,” said Fairlead’s Stockton. “But it should moderate in the weeks ahead, we expect temporary stabilization near a 50% retracement level of about $34,000.”      BTC fell from $39,824 at 00:45 UTC (8:45 p.m. ET Monday) to as low as $36,591 by 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET), an 8% decrease based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin has since recovered, however, settling at $37,310 as of press time. It’s similar market behavior to ether, with market ups-and-downs in tandem over the past 24 hours. Ether is gyrating more in percentages.    Bitcoin versus ether    Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation to ETH is trending back up after dipping to a three-month low of 0.69. It’s at 0.75 as of closing data from Monday, according to CoinDesk Research.      Action in the ether market might take the spotlight from bitcoin over time due to very different mechanics between the two assets, according to Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments.      “Due to the law of large numbers, it takes many more users today than it did a year ago to increase activity on the bitcoin network to the point it drives the price higher,” said McClurg. “ETH is getting traction due to ETH 2.0 and those staking their assets to the network in anticipation of proof-of-stake, taking out supply as demand comes in.”    Other markets    Fairlead’s Stockton sees promise in the relative stability of bitcoin over alternative cryptocurrencies in the week ahead based on her technical analysis of trends for her investor update late Monday.      Cardano, dogecoin, polkadot, XRP and stellar have fallen out of favor versus bitcoin, Stockton noted.      Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are red Tuesday.

42386834,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVXKV,1621975432,High-Yield Crypto Ecosystem Offers Alternative to Low Interest Rates,"People have flocked to high-yield crypto environments because interest rates for traditional investments are staying low by comparison. It’s been nearly a year since ""DeFi summer"", but the optionality has only increased, along with the amount of “money legos” that are being combined in different ways.      At Consensus 2021, Felix Fen, co-founder and CEO of Set Protocol; Zac Prince, CEO of BlockFi; and Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave, came together to discuss how people seeking out higher yield on their crypto assets can access a variety of services, and what the tradeoffs there can be.      Overall there was agreement that given the low interest rates seen in traditional finance at the moment (in the U.S. they’re at 0.25%, the lowest they’ve been in history) people are turning to crypto generally, not just as a hedge against inflation but also for the high returns they offer.    Translating crypto with interest rates    Prince said he saw real value in using interest rates to translate something really powerful that's happening in the crypto ecosystem in the terms that everybody is already familiar with.      “If you try to explain how the blockchain works, or why bitcoin has value, or some of the other more complex and in-the-weeds topics to folks when they're on their journey into the crypto ecosystem, they might struggle to wrap their heads around it,” he said. “Everybody knows what an interest rate is. And everybody knows that earning 8.6% on something is better than earning 0.2%.”      However, he said, banks are still a long way from being ready to finance the crypto ecosystem in a meaningful way. From his perspective on the front lines of trying to integrate crypto with traditional financing channels, he said, “we're not a day or two away.”    Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained    Kulechov spoke about how the Aave community governs the parameters of the interest rates, which are then determined by supply and demand. That transparency is appealing to people, as is the decentralized model of Aave, meaning no one entity can arbitrarily change those rates.      “The fact that everyone can participate in affecting what the interest rate will be in these markets is a very big thing because, traditionally, big interest-rate movements have been decided by the banking industry; for example, by a few people sitting down with a room in London,” said Kulechov.    Examine the variables    As an asset manager, Fen emphasized that the variable interest rate is indeed variable by nature. He noted it's important to take into account that associated risk as well, whatever platform people use. For example, he suggested that users evaluate the risk of the protocol in terms of its insolvency and take that into account when considering where to allocate funds. To him, a big part of that decision-making should involve evaluating the community.      “How stable is a parameter selection, how conservative or aggressive is a community in terms of its parameter selection, and how decentralized is the protocol overall?” he said. “I think those are some of the elements that we look at when thinking about yield, and so not all interest rates should be just looked at as a headline number. One has to dig a little bit more into this.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/25/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de9553e9e74b955fa34fab611c62ca0d7fa38dad-1400x870.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42434435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD0lh,1621975025,Michael Saylor: Mining Council Will 'Defend' Bitcoin Against 'Uninformed' and 'Hostile' Energy Critics,"The Bitcoin Mining Council was born of a desire to help shape the narrative around the cryptocurrency’s energy use, said MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor.      Speaking Tuesday at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021, the bitcoin evangelist said he worked with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a handful of North American miners to create a loose organization that could publish energy usage data in an effort to address concerns that the cryptocurrency is not environmentally friendly.      “It became pretty clear that bitcoiners have a good story, but it’s a pretty complicated story and we need to find a way to share our story,” he said.      Saylor said he connected Musk with the eight North American bitcoin miners to host a discussion around energy usage. (The founding members represent an estimated 10% of the hashrate, or computing power securing the Bitcoin network; most of the world's hashrate comes out of machines in China. No additional members have been announced since Saylor announced the council's formation Monday.) Musk sent bitcoin’s price plummeting this month after announcing his carmaker would no longer accept bitcoin as payment due to energy concerns.      “He thought we would all benefit if we were able to publish energy usage and source of energy usage data,” Saylor said Tuesday.      This is not information that the crypto industry currently shares, Saylor said, which allows other parties to create their own models which may be less flattering to the cryptocurrency industry.      Saylor, who is known for speaking of the benefits of bitcoin as he added over 92,000 BTC to his company’s balance sheet, raised the ire of the community on Monday by announcing that he hosted fellow billionaire Musk and a handful of mining firms in forming the Bitcoin Mining Council.      Critics likened the move to the ill-fated New York Agreement of 2017, a closed-door group that sought to influence how bitcoin scaled. Sunday’s closed-door session of bitcoin miners seeking to change how network participants report their energy use wasn’t made public until after the fact, showing a lack of “self-awareness,” wrote Great American Mining co-founder Marty Bent.      However, Peter Wall, CEO of council member Argo Blockchain, said Monday the group does not plan to change any aspect of the bitcoin ecosystem, just address environmental concerns.      “I think Elon’s first-order ask was ‘hey, can we come up with a way to publish or [boost] transparency for bitcoin mining energy usage,’” Saylor said Tuesday. “I think the first step is, let’s come up with a protocol for us to publish energy information in a way that we can share it with the world and then work together to make sure that we pursue sustainable energy goals.”      If Saylor and Musk intended to secretly try to control bitcoin with a private meeting, they wouldn’t have announced the meeting’s existence to the world, Saylor said.      “Everybody in that meeting, including Elon, are passionate believers in decentralization,” Saylor said.      The group is more interested in “managing concerns, especially from uninformed parties,” about bitcoin’s energy usage, the CEO said.      “We need to make sure that people that are hostile to bitcoin and hostile to the crypto industry aren’t defining these narratives and defining those models and defining those metrics,” he said. “In the absence of any good information or any response on our part, they will define those models.”      UPDATE (May 25, 21:30 UTC): Added detail about council members' combined share of global Bitcoin network hashrate.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/25/michael-saylor-mining-council-will-defend-bitcoin-against-uninformed-and-hostile-energy-critics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a16c643aceb1ae43dd8c8e78cc3da6f4acc8bdce-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, that ""threat"" is getting attention from the very top of the global giant.      “There is the intellectual curiosity of what this technology could do for us, or to us, over the coming years,” Durbin said in a conversation with The Block's Frank Chaparro. “Cryptocurrency just happens to be the tip of the spear.”      The main driver of Fidelity’s increasing involvement in the crypto space is client interest, as Durbin, who has run Fidelity Institutional since 2017, was keen to make clear.      “We follow the demand of our clients. These tend to be first-generation wealth creators looking for an easy, frictionless way to make an expression in crypto,” he said.      Durbin said the recent volatility of crypto prices in response to Elon Musk’s tweets had shaken some clients’ confidence in bitcoin as a store of value.      “It definitely gets a little more difficult,” he said.      But in his view, these are just “blips along the way” as the sector matures. One of the main applications of bitcoin investing – as a diversifier due to its lack of correlation with other asset classes – still stands.      Durbin confirmed his own personal interest in crypto investing, too: “I’ve dabbled myself over the last few years.”      A new Fidelity-affiliated bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is currently making its way through the process of regulatory review.

42434439,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD0th,1621973258,Artists Who Now Make a Living Because of NFTs,"Squirterer, a 24-year-old Filipina fine artist based in Davao, Mindanao, the Philippines’ southernmost group of islands, has earned 100% of her income in crypto since 2018.      Between making, minting and selling her creations via non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and writing blogs about her art to earn rewards on Hive (formerly known as Steem), she has stayed financially buoyant despite the coronavirus pandemic’s economic fallout.      In September 2020, she took a portion of her savings in hive and ETH and bought a brand new iPad Pro – a coveted tool of the digital art trade that she’d yearned for since 2018, and a massive upgrade from the $50 tablet that she’d previously been using to make her art.    Leah Callon-Butler is a CoinDesk columnist. In ""Play-to-Earn: NFT Gaming in the Philippines,"" a new documentary, she travels to Nueva Ecija to see how an Axie Infinity player community generated life-changing income from the game. At Consensus 2021, CoinDesk's virtual event, she will talk with key figures from the film. Register here.    She also replaced her old run-of-the-mill laptop with a much faster, more powerful Asus device built especially for running complex graphics and capable of powering her frequent trips into the virtual world Decentraland, an increasingly popular hub for creatives and collectors.      Recently, some opponents have criticized the NFT crowd’s exuberant rhetoric of artist empowerment. But for creators like squirterer the financial impact is real, and her ability to invest in the equipment that she needs to do her job well indicates the crypto bull run and NFT boom have done more than just make the rich richer.      That’s especially true in the Philippines, where unemployment hit 10.3% in 2020, the highest it has been in 15 years. As a result, consumer spending all but diminished and GDP contracted almost 10%, with women and young workers among the hardest hit. In March, the economy had cautiously begun to reopen, but then a spike in new cases of COVID-19 sent much of the nation back into strict lockdowns, wiping out millions of recently reinstated jobs.      Due to its struggles to provide enough stable jobs and to get people spending again, the Philippines has been called “the clear laggard in Asia” and the International Monetary Fund predicted it will be one of the slowest countries in the region to recover from the crisis.      What the Philippines desperately needs is more squirterers.    First mint    As a sufferer of PTSD, squirterer’s art reveals her personal turmoil: a lightweight wheelchair, a fluid bag and intravenous drip, a faceless nurse towering over a small child on a hospital gurney.      Upon being told she was “too emotional” to pursue her dream of an academic career in fine arts, she became determined to turn her painful experience into a competitive advantage by using it throughout her work – and making money out of it.      Her intro to crypto came through Hive, where she blogged about her art and learned from the community how to swap hive tokens for ETH on BlockTrades, before converting ETH to pesos (PHP) on Coins.ph – a popular choice for Filipino crypto newbies. As she became more savvy, she switched to other platforms, such as Bittrex and Binance, that charged lower trading fees.      Squirterer learned about NFTs in 2019 from her crypto friends in the Hive community, but didn’t sell her first until March 16, 2020. Titled ""Push Button,"" the artwork features a moon-bound bitcoin rocket emblazoned on the button of a pedestrian crossing. An artist and collector by the name of ruth allen picked up the first edition (of a total 10 tokens minted) for $22.30 at the time.    Read more: Leah Callon-Butler: For Filipinos, Axie Infinity Is More Than a Crypto Game    Today, amid bull market prices, many of squirterer’s NFTs are fetching well above the average price for NFT art, which peaked at $1,400 in February, according to Nonfungible.com. Her buyers are from all around the world, including the Museum of Crypto Art, Gabby Dizon of Decentraland’s Philippine-focused art gallery, Narra Gallery, and me.    Truth in transparency    When I asked for her two gwei on Jimmy Song’s accusation that NFTs are just bribes by the Ethereum network to spruik its own blockchain and exploit vulnerable artists, squirterer said: ""If you think artists are being exploited in a decentralized space, you don’t know a thing about the traditional art market.""      To explain the importance of transparency in her industry, squirterer recalls a situation where an art gallery took one of her physical paintings on consignment and resold it without notifying her.      But what irked her the most was that the buyer had tried to reach out to her via Facebook during the purchasing process, wanting to establish a direct connection with the artist. But the gallery explicitly said it was not allowed and forbade squirterer from engaging with buyers.    If you think artists are being exploited in a decentralized space, you don’t know a thing about the traditional art market.    Personal experiences like that helped squirterer recognize the blockchain’s usefulness in making all transactions public, immutable and verifiable. Since joining Hive back in 2018, she’s also appreciated the importance of decentralization and anti-censorship, as she’s seen other photographers and artists banned from mainstream platforms for posting their nude art.      Now, whenever she mints an NFT, she says she feels empowered because her buyers are transparent, she knows how much her pieces sell for on the secondary market, no one can remove or revoke her work, and she enjoys royalties on resales, too. Plus, with everything automated by smart contracts, there’s no chasing, debating, waiting or wondering.    Read more: Leah Callon-Butler: The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID    She also values the chance to make a direct, deep and authentic connection with her buyers, free of interference by gatekeepers and middlemen.    Sandbagging for success    In 2019, when Bon Jerald T. Paguntalan graduated from the Far Eastern University Institute of Technology in Manila, it took him more than half a year to land a job as a junior 3D artist.      “It’s very hard to get into a good company here in the Philippines,” he said. “All I got were rejections. No one saw my potential. I began to doubt myself. I began to think that the world doesn’t need my talent,” he told me, unable to hold back tears.      Finally, in August the same year, he landed a role with a startup gaming company called Kongan Games. Everything was going well until the pandemic hit and the company had to close temporarily. Although it had 10 mobile games under development at the time, the pre-revenue startup couldn’t keep its doors open for long (to this day, it has not reopened).      After being laid off, Bon decided to hone his craft through freelancing and found a niche creating 3D printable models. Acquiring his customers via a Facebook group for 3D artists, Bon charged his Filipino customers around $20 per model. Then, when he attracted his first international clients, he found they were willing to pay up to $600 for a full body figurine of their favourite Marvel characters, the likes of Black Panther, Silver Surfer and Deadpool. After he sent them the artwork file, they’d pay via PayPal, and some even tipped extra if Bon did a good job.      It wasn't a steady income but it covered his monthly expenses, which was his main concern at the time. After a few months of revenue, he even saved enough to buy his own 3D printer.      One day, his brother, a crypto trader, was shilling him a token called $SAND. Intrigued, Bon looked up the website for the token’s issuer, The Sandbox, and saw it was looking for 3D artists to help create and share NFT voxels via its video game platform. Bon decided to apply for the company's $2 million Creator Fund and was accepted into the program in August 2020.      “What’s great about Sandbox is that we own the assets that we create,” says Bon, pointing out the difference between the way he used to do it, which was to transfer ownership of his design files via email, versus the way he does it now, by minting NFTs. Because ""we still own the NFT, we always get a percentage of the product whenever it is sold on the marketplace,” he explains.      To date, KradSuperSoldier – as Bon is now known on The Sandbox – has designed more than 80 in-game assets to be put up for sale at The Sandbox marketplace. The main target is developers who purchase the NFTs, to be used in their own games and virtual worlds.      KradSuperSoldier gets paid in $SAND, which he converts on Binance to “something more interchangeable like XRP.” From there he can easily send the funds to his Coins.ph wallet, and from there withdraw pesos to GCash, the latter being a popular mobile wallet in the Philippines.      “It’s very hard to do at first because I’m not really familiar with how it works,” he says. “But once I learned on YouTube how to convert [$SAND] to another currency, it became really easy.”      By December 2020, KradSuperSoldier had earned enough to replace his old, broken mobile phone with a brand-new one. He also bought a Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming Laptop for a fellow artist who sorely needed a new workstation for her graphic design and videography projects.      KradSuperSoldier said he doesn’t expect his friend to pay him back, but that’s okay. All he wanted was to be able to help the people around him who needed it.    More art, more opportunity    Back in 2007, when Beeple began his Everydays project, its future buyer didn’t own and couldn’t afford a laptop. Eventually, in March 2021, Vignesh ""MetaKovan"" Sundaresan, would pay $69.3 million for Beeple’s resulting NFT. But when MetaKovan first discovered crypto in 2013 he had to look for ways to earn it because he had no money to buy it.      “It’s true,” said Anand ""Twobadour"" Venkateswaran, MetaKovan’s friend and steward of their crypto fund, Metapurse, when I interviewed him at a recent online event. “He used to walk around with a pen drive and plug it into his friends’ laptops to practice coding. More than a few times I think he crashed his friends’ laptops,” laughed Twobadour.      Today, at 32, MetaKovan is a young crypto billionaire, and together with Twobadour the pair are fervent supporters of the NFT space.

The team has also touted crypto as “an equalizing power between the West and the Rest.”      MetaKovan and Twobadour understand firsthand how crypto is making it possible for people from all backgrounds to participate and earn in global markets, removing barriers to trade and facilitating radical inclusion.      In the world of NFT art, not even a formal education is a prerequisite for success because most buyers are focused only on the output and are unconcerned with creators' qualifications. This is an important shift, particularly in the Philippines where university tuition fees are a huge expense that is considered a privilege and mostly out of reach for children from poorer families.      “Although having a formal training in art is an advantage to artists, I don't see it as a foundation or requirement to success,” says squirterer, adding that she has seen many self-taught artists with greater talent, skill and potential than those who have obtained formal qualifications.      “With NFTs, there’s an opportunity for the unknown artists, with or without a degree, to be seen and have a stable income with their art,” she adds.    Read more: Virtual Property Sells for $1.5M in Ether, Smashing NFT Record    Another massive hindrance to adoption is gas fees. At an average of $60–$200, the cost to mint an NFT is a lot in a place where the average annual household income sits under $6,500.      The First Mint Fund has stepped in to provide opportunity to those who wouldn’t have it otherwise. With around $20,000 currently in the kitty, the fund covers gas fees for artists from, and living in, Southeast Asia who want to mint their first NFT. Filipino music artist and longtime advocate for Pinoy creators, Apl.de.Ap of the Black Eyed Peas, has pledged support for the fund by donating a portion of his sales from an upcoming NFT drop.    What goes up must come down    Knowing the volatility of crypto markets, the concern is that soon these artists will be the ones left holding the bag once the bottom falls out of the NFT market.      But squirterer says she isn’t worried, at least not yet. Right now she only sees NFTs getting more and more popular. If and when the bear market does arrive, she plans to trade her crypto into stablecoins and buy back as necessary to survive the low (this isn’t her first crypto rodeo).      Conversely, KradSuperSoldier says he never stops thinking about the impending crash – a hangover from when he bought his first ETH on Coins.ph during late 2017 market highs and was forced to sell when the price was low because he needed the money for personal reasons.      “I should have kept it in ethereum,” he says.      Despite getting rekt early, today KradSuperSoldier takes a MetaKovan-like approach to his investments, putting over 90% of his $SAND earnings back into other cryptos. He believes that portfolio diversification is the best way to protect against significant losses, so he holds a lot of different coins (at the moment he’s loving DeFi tokens such as safemoon and safemars).      “I’m more into my future than the present,” says KradSuperSoldier. “There’s no one investment that can save you and I have a lifelong goal to take care of my parents,” he explains, demonstrating a quintessential cultural commitment to family that anyone with ties to the Philippines will recognize in a heartbeat.      Because when you buy from a Filipino creator, you’re not only supporting the livelihood of the individual.

42434442,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD11h,1621973102,How Investors Can Gain Crypto Exposure Through Stocks,"An allocation to cryptocurrencies doesn't necessarily require a digital wallet and keys. Instead, investors can choose from a variety of crypto-related stocks that typically trade in lock-step with the price of bitcoin (BTC).      Purchasing bitcoin outright might require a more sophisticated understanding about technology, security issues and questions about storage and keys, according to Adam Blumberg, co-founder of Interaxis, a digital asset education firm, during CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 on Tuesday.      ""You can get exposure to the asset class by buying stock in Riot Blockchain (Nasdaq: RIOT) or Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN),"" said Blumberg during a panel on how to get exposure to crypto through equities.      Riot, a bitcoin mining company, has returned about 55% year-to-date compared to bitcoin's gain of 30% during the same period. Coinbase, the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange that made a public market debut in April, is down about 26% year to date and is trading just below the reference price of $250 at the time of writing.      The mining business is competitive, which means investors should do their own due diligence when considering which company's stock to purchase.      ""Value businesses based on the miner's hashrate growth, assumptions on competition, network difficulty, and the bitcoin price,"" said Riot CEO Jason Les, another panelist.      ""The value of our balance sheet fluctuates with bitcoin,"" said Les.      And for publicly listed exchanges, stock investors could gain exposure to trading revenue across cryptocurrencies, which influence earnings.      Voyager Digital (OTC: VYGVF), a U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, has about 80% of revenue from non-bitcoin assets, according to Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager, who also spoke during Consensus 2021.

42434444,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD13h,1621969535,Bobby Lee Says Latest China 'Bitcoin Ban' Nothing to Fear and Nothing New,"China has taken a more active role in regulating bitcoin, but that won’t be a blow to bitcoin in the long-run – it will be a benefit, Bobby Lee, founder and CEO of crypto wallet Ballet, said in a Consensus 2021 keynote speech Tuesday.      Lee's session included a history lesson on China’s complicated relationship with bitcoin. He outlined many of the infamous “bans” that the media has hit on over the years. These began in 2013 when the Chinese government recognized bitcoin as virtual property but banned it as a transaction medium. Since then, China has progressed to the point of regulators instituting trading restrictions and now, mining restrictions, Lee explained.      This could all be leading to a boiling point where China’s government actually takes stringent measures against the currency outright, Lee explained:      “China will ban bitcoin again and again. By some future date, bitcoin will be over $100,000 and [China will] have more regulatory agencies [looking at it], and the question is, what more can China do to ban bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? It hasn't already banned everything. Now they're going to go after mining, apparently.”      The slow creep of regulation is typical of Chinese regulations, Lee said. Officials don’t want to go through the usually controversial process of changing laws outright to ban bitcoin mining, so they will instead guide the industry by enforcement, applying and easing pressure as they see fit.    Read more: Beijing’s Crypto Crackdown Is Not New but Don’t Dismiss It    ""China operates in a way where they rarely change the rules. Changing the rules can be very controversial. What they do is they change enforcement,"" said Lee. ""That's why these verbal announcements are just a signal to the market, that they're going to step up the enforcement again.""      He continued to say that because bitcoin is a “free currency” it’s going to be “constantly at odds"" with a capital-controlling society like China's.      “You see this in Korea and Vietnam and other countries. Countries that are under capital controls have a very hard time having a legitimate sort of crypto exchange market,” he said.    Taking bitcoin mining out of China    Given that Bitcoin is an open network, he believes China’s recent mining regulations and any future restrictions won’t negatively impact the market because these miners and the other economic activity surrounding Bitcoin will simply migrate elsewhere.      “Just because China has a lot of mining hash power doesn't mean that China controls it, because as we all know bitcoin mining is permissionless. This will actually be a good stress test on bitcoin if China does indeed get rid of all the mining ... what [miners are] going to do is move the mining machines abroad and start mining in other countries.”      Chinese miners are already looking to North America and elsewhere for real estate with more favorable regulatory regimes, and in some cases, greener energy.

42434431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD0bh,1621968732,What Is the Bitcoin Mining Council – And What Should It Become?,"Late yesterday Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor and Tesla CEO Elon Musk dropped a bombshell. They announced the formation, apparently spearheaded by Saylor, of something called the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC). According to Saylor, the group's goals are to “promote energy usage transparency & accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide.”      Few details have been provided so far of how those goals will be pursued. And it’s no great surprise that many bitcoiners have filled that void with suspicion, seeing the group as some sort of cartel or attempt at “centralized” manipulation.      It is certainly slightly worrying that Saylor and Musk are taking the lead on this despite apparently lacking any substantial mining experience. We’re long past the days of plugging in a bare metal rack in your basement to earn bitcoin. This is a nuanced and technical business that involves treasury management, power arbitrage, and a lot of other subtleties.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Saylor and Musk are best known, instead, as bitcoin investors and holders – a much simpler proposition. But in fairness, they would seem to be motivated by those experiences, particularly Tesla’s involvement in bitcoin, which Musk has paused because Bitcoin’s energy consumption doesn’t align with the company’s mission. Meanwhile, the group has looped in actual miners who know what they’re talking about, including Galaxy Digital, and Argo Blockchain. A representative for Argo Blockchain said that while Saylor and Musk were the public face of the initiative and had acted as conveners, the miners themselves would be in control.      All this matters whether or not you personally agree with the spreading narrative that Bitcoin is an environmental threat. It’s clear now that many people who might otherwise have some interest in cryptocurrency have been turned off by environmental concerns. If nothing else, Musk and Saylor’s initiative sends the message that the issue is being taken seriously, and may be solvable. That’s a message that benefits Bitcoin.      But whether it turns out to be more than a message, whether there’s a substantive impact on Bitcoin’s energy consumption – or on the other hand, blows up in everyone’s face – will depend on how the group pursues its goals. There are a few options, and some are much better than others.    A coordinated attempt to change Bitcoin’s code?    There is so far no evidence that this is part of the Council’s plans, and in fact, participants have explicitly denied any such intention. But many longtime Bitcoiners suffer from a sort of PTSD towards groups of influential people working together on Bitcoin “solutions.” When Saylor’s announcement arrived, some crypto longtimers immediately thought of the New York Agreement, which laid out a roadmap for scaling Bitcoin that ultimately ended in recrimination and the spinoff of Bitcoin Cash (Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company, was a leading player in those events).      That chaotic outcome only cemented skepticism of such coordinated attempts by powerful players to alter Bitcoin’s code. That legacy has helped foster a wave of paranoia in response to the BMC, with some worrying it could become a similar attempt at exerting 'centralized' pressure for deeper changes to the nature of Bitcoin.""      But again, it seems pretty clear this is not part of Saylor and Musk’s plan. Far more importantly, if they tried it, they’d get absolutely rekt.    Read more: David Z. Morris: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn’t Need a Savior    In 2017, the New York Agreement players successfully pushed code updates, but the landscape has changed drastically, with vastly more miners on the network who would need to be brought onboard to support any changes. Most of those are now in locales where the environmental concerns at the center of the BMC would be subordinate to pure profit calculations.      And that’s to say nothing of the resistance any changes would likely face from established Bitcoin developers. There’s no obvious technical way to make Bitcoin as a whole consume less electricity, or guarantee the use of renewable energy, so an attempt in that direction would be doomed.      In short, if they try to change the code, Saylor and Elon will almost certainly end up with several different kinds of egg on their face.    A truly independent standards body?    The best and most impactful approach for a coalition of Bitcoin miners who want to improve the sustainability of the system would be to create a truly independent regulatory and standards body that reviewed and certified miners' use of clean energy. This would probably be easier to pull off if it focused on North America, which seems to be the game plan so far.      This organization would be funded by dues from member miners, and would probably find supplemental revenue streams. Certified miners would benefit from increased demand for their mined coins from investors or users specifically looking for cleaner coins, such as investment funds that market themselves as socially responsible. The BMC would be motivated to be transparent and have good standards to maintain the faith of investors who rely on it for certification.      This would open a significant new potential pool of bitcoin investors, and ultimately, users. It might be unclear thanks to the histrionics of certain crusaders who have decided that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is a conclusive reason that it shouldn’t exist, but there is a significant cohort who care about the environment and are simultaneously curious about cutting-edge technology (just look at Tesla).      But as Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary has already pointed out, the most interest would almost certainly come from big companies and institutions. Many large financiers, corporations, and investors who might be interested in Bitcoin also face real reputational pressure from shareholders, the media, and other public watchdogs to be environmentally responsible. Giving them an avenue for cleaner Bitcoin investment would be addressing a pretty clear market need.    Read more: David Z. Morris: Musk Has Doge on a Leash. Is He a Manipulator?    A simple parallel would be the Better Business Bureau. Though somewhat obsolete thanks to internet reviews, the BBB still collects dues from member businesses, then awards a valuable seal of approval to members that meet its standards. Crucially, though the system is far from perfect, the BBB is formally independent from both the government and from its funding members, while its diversity of funding sources gives it more leverage to issue negative rulings to individual members.      There are some signs that the Council is headed this general direction, with Musk tweeting for instance that miners have “committed to publish current & planned renewable usage.” Saylor’s announcement also emphasized “transparency.” The broad goal seems to be visible and reputable measures of clean-energy bitcoin mining.      But simply urging transparency amounts to little more than a feel-good PR gesture (see below). If Saylor and Musk want to have an actual long-term impact, a BMC should establish its green certification as a standard for regulated investment funds who want to offer bitcoin, but also want their investors to feel good about their greenhouse impact.      This would involve investors paying a premium simply because clean energy is still often more expensive, or at least harder to get, than dirty juice. There might also be added administration costs associated with buying certified green bitcoin. But there are plenty of examples, especially in higher-end markets, of people choosing to pay a premium for a product or service because it’s less environmentally harmful than the alternative, without any regulatory pressure to do so (biodegradable disposable utensils are just one example). A green certification system would help the market find how much of a premium the market can bear, and create opportunities for investors who might not otherwise be willing or able to hold bitcoin.      This approach is important because it’s limited and subtle, based on influence instead of rules. It wouldn’t permanently “mark” coins or otherwise change the Bitcoin system. The focus would be strictly on influencing the most public and visible new coin onramps. It wouldn’t involve any government intervention, just voluntary signaling that provides consumers a clear and hopefully trustworthy way to exercise their choice to hold cleaner bitcoin.      Obviously that also means it wouldn’t be a perfect or complete solution that instantly makes Bitcoin green – but that’s by design. Everyone would still be free to do whatever they wanted on the network.    Read more: Nic Carter: The Virgin Bitcoin Fallacy    This is in general a good model for trying to influence Bitcoin at this point in its history. You’re going to have a hard time changing the underlying system in major ways, so you’re better off trying to leverage local conditions or specific circumstances to exert influence rather than trying to impose new rules. The growing involvement of mainstream, regulated institutions gives more opportunities for this.      This approach, crucially, doesn’t create “two bitcoins,” which was the ultimate fallout of the failure of the New York Agreement. Instead, it creates added value without tweaking anything on the blockchain.      Hopefully this also makes clear why “just let the market handle it” is not a viable alternative to addressing the public’s environmental concerns about Bitcoin. This is effectively a technical question. Carbon and other greenhouse gases are generally externalities, meaning that the true social cost of producing them is shifted away from the producer, and not efficiently reflected in market prices. It’s the sort of thing you need to engineer a bit more to get price and demand signals into the market. Voluntary certification is a light-touch, market-based, non-governmental approach.    A lobbying group or PR guesture?    If trying to change the code is the worst possible approach, trying to influence regulation would be a close second. Given his influence, Musk could probably bend U.S. government regulations to his will to at least a degree, and he’s shown limited real insight into why crypto matters or what it’s actually for. So letting him influence national policy on bitcoin mining would be a mistake, whether or not you believe such policy should exist in the first place.      This is the least ambitious possibility the BMC could become. It’s also by far the most likely. It will publish a transparency report from five or six Bitcoin miners every six months, fund a handful of upbeat ‘research reports’ on bitcoin and clean energy, and call it a day.      Without levers of real influence, it wouldn’t accomplish much, but it would make some rich guys feel like they were Doing Something. And I guess that’s what really matters, isn’t it?

That said, the effort opens “this interesting can of worms,” Bankman-Fried said in an interview during an episode of CoinDesk TV's First Mover show, held as part of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021.      “If you have a completely open network and the big open players on this open network openly and without any coercion decide to collaborate with each other, is that decentralization? It’s a little bit of a definitional issue,"" Bankman-Fried said.      As long as the network remains open, however, many concerns should be assuaged, he said. “If they're like, 'Oh, we're just all going to, like, lower hashrates,' then, [someone else could] just start mining, you know, if it's economically efficient.""    ESG escalation    Bitcoin's recent price crash to below $40,000 was partly triggered by a tweet earlier this month from Musk saying Tesla would stop accepting bitcoin as payment for electric vehicles due to concerns over the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.    Read more: Elon Musk Says Tesla Is Suspending Bitcoin Payments Over Environmental Concerns    According to Saylor, executives from Argo Blockchain, Galaxy Digital, Blockcap, Hive Blockchain and a few other mining companies based in North America joined a meeting over the issue on May 23. He tweeted that the ""leading Bitcoin miners in North America have agreed to form the Bitcoin Mining Council to promote energy usage transparency and accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide.""      The looming question is whether big institutional investors who otherwise might be tempted to buy bitcoin might be deterred by environmental, social and governance concerns, known as ESG – now a key consideration for many asset managers. Calls for ""greening"" bitcoin mining have ramped up in recent weeks.      The announcement Monday induced a flurry of debate as to whether such a ""cabal"" ran counter to Bitcoin's underlying principles of decentralization. As CoinDesk reported Monday night, one of the founding members said the council has no intention to change ""the nature of Bitcoin."" Still, the closed-door proceedings rubbed many the wrong way.    Read more: ‘This Isn’t the Start of OPEC’: New Bitcoin Mining Council Just Wants to Promote Greener Practices, Member Says    ""It's a healthy occurrence in some ways because I think there was a lot of stupid dialogue going on about ESG, and stupid not in the sense that ESG was stupid, but that the dialogue was,"" Bankman-Fried said Tuesday, adding:    ""The dialogue was centered around name-calling and centered around one side saying bitcoin was trashing the planet and the other side saying, 'Lol, these f**king noobs complaining about bitcoin, they're going to get rekt,' roughly speaking.""    Neither response was healthy, Bankman-Fried said. ""Let's do the math, let's figure out if this is a significant concern, and if so, let's figure out how we can address it,"" he suggested.    Carbon offsets    The FTX founder said the Ethereum blockchain's move away from Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a less energy-intensive system known as proof-of-stake might address some of the climate concerns. Bankman-Fried is heavily invested in the proof-of-stake Solana blockchain, among other projects.      ""Most of the major cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin will be substantially less energy-intensive, and so I think that's one piece of it. But I think that even within proof-of-work it's not prohibitively expensive to buy carbon offsets, and that's something we've been looking into and pledged to start doing, to offset the energy usage that FTX has,"" he said.      Bankman-Fried tweeted last week he figures that for every $1 spent on blockchain fees a donation of $0.0026 would cover the needed carbon offsets, and the FTX exchange tweeted that it was ""committed to being carbon neutral.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/25/sam-bankman-fried-says-bitcoin-mining-council-opens-an-interesting-can-of-worms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68b136e241981923cb14eba3ac48bd1803e7cad3-1300x720.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD0xh,1621965600,"Polkadot’s Gavin Wood: WebAssembly Is the Future of Smart Contracts, but ‘Legacy’ EVM Is Right Now","The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has the pole position among blockchain developers. That's why Gavin Wood says it's important for his Polkadot system of blockchains to support it — at least for the foreseeable future.      Wood was the lead developer when Ethereum was built and is now the founder of Parity Technologies, which created Polkadot and is in the middle of finally rolling out its system of interconnected “parachains.” The EVM is what enables Ethereum to run smart contracts, the innovation it's known for popularizing. When the original team built Ethereum, they tried not to stray too far from what the world was familiar with at that point, which was Bitcoin, Wood said.      Speaking at Consensus 2021, Wood acknowledged the EVM's place in blockchain development today.      ""I can't deny that a lot of people are already using EVM, so it's super important to support these legacy protocols, these legacy languages, and that's what we're doing with Polkadot,” Wood said in a pre-recorded interview. “People like EVM, people use EVM – absolutely fine until the next generation really proves its mettle.”      Polkadot aims to prove itself as a leader in that next generation of smart contract blockchains.    Legacy    The EVM has lots of developers and lots of software tools they can use to make coding easier. Other blockchains are playing catchup with those tools, so, Wood said, ""It's foolish to just throw those away. But it's not foolish to start thinking about where the next thing is, and that for me is using WebAssembly as smart contracts.""      WebAssembly is a software format that works across the web and works easily with multiple software languages. It was built by the giant web companies and works on all the major browsers.      Polkadot announced May 17 that its sister network, Kusama, had enabled the launch of parachains, the networked chains that allow Polkadot to run different blockchains with different logic but shared security. This is a key final test before running the same upgrade on Polkadot itself. If that happens, it would represent a realization of the Polkadot vision, which has been in the works since a $147 million initial coin offering in October 2017.      While Ethereum's existence enabled Parity to raise funds to launch Polkadot, the project was always meant to go beyond the original smart contract blockchain.      ""You see, the problem with EVM is it's a hugely opinionated design. It derives from an already very opinionated design, which is the Bitcoin script design,"" Wood said. His team wanted to give developers a very non-opinionated format to work with, and that's WebAssembly.    Upgrades    Wood also said he believes it's time for blockchains to move on from the idea that upgrading software is bad or dangerous.      ""Blockchains are not fit for purpose in the modern day, like legacy blockchains that rely on hard forks, rely on thwarting their own consensus, are not fit. for modern-day use. It's as simple as that,"" Wood said. ""People expect automatically upgrading apps. They expect automatically securing systems, and they expect it with a minimum of fuss.""      Polkadot comes with its own system for making upgrades on-chain, which Wood said is crucial. But he also explained that Polkadot runs on an extremely simple base protocol that will remain unchanged. The changes will occur a layer up from the base, and that should protect Polkadot as a whole from accidental or surprise forks, he said.      ""If you do it this way, then you can stay ahead of the curve. You can stay on top of technological development. And it won't be too long before people realize, maybe we should make a blockchain that does that as well,"" Wood said. “But as far as I know, at the moment, Tezos is the only one that kind of has this kind of functionality.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/25/polkadots-gavin-wood-webassembly-is-the-future-of-smart-contracts-but-legacy-evm-is-right-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6231f41c295d0951a4810913501ff7b2c91a083-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42434437,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD0ph,1621965472,Inner Mongolia Outlines How It May Ban Crypto Mining,"Inner Mongolia's branch of National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning agency in China, issued a detailed draft guideline explaining how local authorities can crack down on crypto mining activities in the region.      The guideline is part of Inner Mongolia’s efforts to implement an earlier notice that was released by the NDRC on Feb. 25. The earlier notice said the local authorities will eliminate mining operations due to environmental concerns and mining’s adverse effects on realizing China’s national goal to reduce carbon emissions.      The NDRC is seeking public comments on this guideline from May 25 to June 1, and has yet to carry out the plan.      The move is also in part triggered by last Friday's notice of a crackdown on crypto mining from the State Council of China. ""Due to the requirements in the notice from the Financial Stability Development Committee of the State Council, we will strictly implement the ban on crypto mining and further crack down on mining operations with heavier punishment,"" said the NDRC.      While the guideline will be only implemented in Inner Mongolia, which is an autonomous region of China, it may shed light on how central government bodies or the national NDRC would carry out a recent crackdown notice from the State Council.      The guideline includes eight specific measures to monitor and punish certain companies and individuals that are involved in crypto mining activities in the region, including data centers in industrial parks as well as cloud, data and telecom companies that are offering services to miners.      Apart from the companies that could be involved in large-scale mining activities, the guideline also includes internet cafes.      Compared to the previous crackdown on mining in the region in September 2019, the latest notice takes a more comprehensive approach by targeting a wider range of companies and individuals that might be involved in mining activities.      The previous crackdown was more targeted on data centers and left time for crypto mining firms to phase out their mining operations. It was also part of the national campaign to curb the development of high energy consuming industries.      The key question is whether the local authority will really enforce the ban according to this new plan, Bobby Lee, founder of crypto wallet Ballet and BTCC, which is one of the earliest exchanges based in China, said Tuesday during the China panel at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 conference.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | MINING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/25/inner-mongolia-outlines-how-it-may-ban-crypto-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6851216919b9fcf36f21925c2accb3ea91fcf6e8-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Peirce said custody is an especially important area when it comes to digital assets, but applying existing custody rules isn’t that straightforward when it comes to this class of assets.      “The bottom line message I have is that we have work to do in modernizing our custody rules all across the board,” Peirce said. “I think, as with many other areas, crypto may force us to do that modernization faster than we otherwise would do.”      Language coming out of the SEC can often seem too cautionary, Peirce said, but it's not the regulator's role to make a judgment on this asset class.      Peirce has long been an advocate for a calibrated approach towards crypto regulation, as highlighted in the latest version of her Token Safe Harbor proposal. But recent comments and guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department has raised concerns in the crypto world about possible stringent reporting requirements and a tightening of the regulatory noose around crypto assets.      Crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is another area where the industry is seeking regulatory approval but the SEC is less than anxious to comply. The agency indicated earlier this month that bitcoin’s volatility could mean that the digital asset is not yet ready to support an ETF.      During the chat Peirce said that “almost every day, someone asks me, when a bitcoin ETP?”, referring to exchange-traded products. She thinks the market infrastructure might be ready for one but added that the main issue is whether investors are being hurt by being forced to go outside of the traditional securities realm if they want to invest in cryptocurrencies.      She said the SEC is doing just that, “not only because some of the products that people are using are less convenient and more expensive than an exchange-traded product would be, but also that they can't go to someone like an adviser and get help,” Peirce said.      While Peirce didn’t offer any comments on the possibility of an exchange-traded product being approved in the U.S., she said approval for a crypto-exchange traded product could also mean more retail investors and financial advisers may want to get in on the action.      “We'll see what happens with our new chairman [Gary Gensler] in place as he starts to think about this issue with fresh eyes,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/25/crypto-may-force-sec-to-modernize-custody-rules-commissioner-hester-peirce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c465b21c5feffcde21863c114a3301fb086c5a2c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Internet Computer (TIC) is a new blockchain system from Dfinity that it claims enables decentralized services at speeds familiar to internet users, by running smart contracts (called canisters) on made-for-purpose machines in data centers around the world.      At Consensus 2021 on Tuesday, Dominic Williams, founder of the Dfinity Foundation, referred to this as a ""sovereign physical layer,"" distinguishing it from proof-of-stake infrastructure that runs on cloud services from companies like Amazon.      The new fund has 200 million Swiss francs (approximately $223 million) to put to work.      ""Our aim is to support the reimagination of all systems and services in new forms using smart contracts on an infinite public blockchain, and nothing else. What the world now builds to take advantage of blockchain's new capabilities shall be an important and fascinating next chapter,"" Williams said in a press release.      Interested developers can get more information on the Dfinity website.      The fund is available for projects such as tools for developers to speed up coding, infrastructure such as oracles and block explorers, accelerators and applications that might bring in users.      During his Consensus 2021 appearance, Williams said that over 100,000 identities have already been created on TIC, and described a forthcoming social network called Distrikt.      ""You're going to see a blockchain that evolves and progresses technically far faster than blockchains have evolved and progressed technically in the past,"" Williams said.      Olaf Carlson-Wee, founder and CEO of Polychain Capital, said in a statement, ""What I am excited to fund is a service or product that is native to the new system rather than what feels like a porting of an application from Web 2 to Web 3.""      Polychain leads the $14.5 million Beacon Fund which also funds projects built for TIC.

42434447,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD19h,1621960908,China’s BSN Builder Urges Developers to Look Beyond Cryptocurrency,"It’s not often you hear a battle cry for enterprise blockchain these days. But that’s just what the architect of China’s powerful Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) delivered at Consensus 2021.      Somewhat in line with China’s latest spate of warnings, Yifan He, the CEO of Red Date Technologies, strongly advised blockchain companies to look beyond mere cryptocurrencies, and urged developers to access this new, multiple cloud-based, “one stop shop” and start building.      “Do not put 100% of your resources into public chains and cryptocurrencies,” said He. “Just give a little bit of money and resources to the underlying technology and research. Because we can do so much besides cryptocurrency.”    Register for Consensus by CoinDesk, May 24-27, 2021.    The hype around enterprise blockchain endeavors in the U.S and Europe has died down, but China’s BSN appears to be fired up over private/permissioned or “consortium chains,” citing applications across industry, government and areas like medicine.      Red Date’s He showed off the BSN architecture for the first time in public, albeit at a “very early stage.” There was a cloud services layer with AWS, Google Cloud, China Mobile and AliCloud, and above it was a blockchain technology, or “Public City Node” layer, where various types of distributed ledger, both public and private, are made available.      Unlike blockchain projects in the West, China’s BSN initiative is backed (and guided) by the government. Red Date, which started out in 2014 building “smart city” technology across China, is joined by the State Information Centre of China, China Mobile and China Union Pay.    Read more: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision    “It has dozens of public chains, and almost all of the major permission frameworks,” He said. “We made a lot of changes for developers to easily access all the technology. We unified API gateways and certificate management so there is one set of certificates and one gateway to access all the public chains and all the private chains and make them interoperable.”      Oracle services and zero-knowledge proof technology will be added in the coming months, added He.      All this hand-holding equates to a system where developers can spin up blockchains at minimal cost in a matter of a couple of months. He did not stipulate which flavors of blockchains would be available to devs at the “Portal” layer of the BSN. But ConsenSys, which has now taken on full-time husbandry of the Ethereum-based permissioned Quorum blockchain, was part of a recent announcement involving BSN.      He continued by saying the BSN can easily be deployed within company intranets, while also allowing access to a range of public chains. Overall, he called it “a very powerful enterprise solution.”      Perhaps it’s not surprising the BSN espouses private blockchain deployments over public. After all, it’s not just a headline risk for a bunch of timid banks; the Chinese government holds sway.      “We have BSN China, and BSN International,” said He. “Because of regulations, we only offer public chain services outside China. Because it's not very legal in China.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/25/chinas-bsn-builder-urges-developers-to-look-beyond-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e07ffeb7f5b0f697710eaf647f15ac0118ac01a4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434441,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPD0zh,1621958487,Christie’s Auction House Exec: NFTs Are the ‘Art World’s Napster',"From art auctions to sports collectibles, non-fungible tokens (NFT), have had a breakout year. But where do we go from here?      Everywhere, according to panelists at a Tuesday discussion during CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 conference. Representatives from venerable British auction house Christie's, the president of Time Magazine and prominent NFT collectors MetaKovan and Whale Shark laid out the bullish case for future NFT applications that could range from collectibles to proof of university degrees.      “This is the art world's Napster, potentially, because it could be that disruptive to the way people do business,” said Noah Davis, Christie’s point person on NFTs, referring to the music-sharing service. The British auction house announced in February it would accept ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s native currency, as a payment method, right before Beeple’s watershed digital artwork went under the hammer. The artwork was eventually sold for $69 million to Singapore-based blockchain entrepreneur MetaKovan, aka Vignesh Sundaresan.      Time Magazine, the nearly centenarian publication, has also ventured into the NFT and crypto space over the past few months. The company said in April it would begin accepting crypto payments for subscriptions, and auctioned its first set of NFTs in March inspired by its April 8, 1966, “Is God Dead?” magazine cover.      “Covers are collectibles. Historically, they represent sort of moments of society, the world, they touch people,” said Keith Grossman, president of Time Magazine. He said the selling of NFT covers was almost like an extension of the magazine’s analog cover store. Grossman said Time places crypto use cases into three categories: high-end collectibles (via NFTs), mid-tier collectibles for niche spaces and a chain that allows the magazine to provide access to subscriptions, memberships and unique experiences.      Collectors MetaKovan and Whale Shark are very bullish on NFTs, noting that as people spend more and more time online it's only natural they’ll come to value verifiable digital ownership more significantly.      “Whether that be a skin on Fortnite, whether that be a weapon skin on CS-GO [Counter Strike: Global Offensive],” NFTs represent “a very mature solution” – one that takes such assets and is able “to give it provenance and scarcity so that they can be treated like normal collectibles,” said Whale Shark.      Responding to a question about whether an NFT could be used to fund museums, MetaKovan said it’s possible to do but designing one to ensure consistency and baking in the allure to get people to walk through the museum's doors is equally important.      “It's not about just putting something there. But you know, creating a culture of people being able to perceive something,” he said.      The panel agreed non-fungible digital assets are likely to have a strikingly bright future but a measured and patient approach is also important considering the scope of experimentations going on in the space.      Davis said that while Christie’s has spoken with “probably 1,000 people” with solid NFT ideas, the auction house is planning its strategy on a one- to three-month basis, with recent auctions involving blue-chip items such as Andy Warhol NFTs and more experimental rollouts.      “The future of NFTs is when the word 'NFT' actually just disappears from linguistics,” said Grossman, adding that it would be similar to the way tech specifications fell out of computer-speak when the experience took center stage.      “I expect NFT technology to be so integrated within society that when you ask people: ‘What is an NFT?’ They'll just say ‘I own it’” said Whale Shark.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/25/christies-auction-house-exec-nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee2fb3af3e2c121529dbe66a988cff981a5748a8-1200x901.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Tuesday, the firm announced two missions aboard SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets that are both expected to take place in June. The first, slated for June 3 and made possible by a relationship with space solutions firm Nanoracks, will see SpaceChain's ""space node"" launched and ultimately installed at the International Space Station (ISS). That will act as a first demonstration of Ethereum technology on SpaceChain's existing hardware aboard the ISS.      The development is just the latest in the crypto sector's long fascination with space travel. Earlier this week, for example, UMA and Opium teamed up to provide decentralized insurance cover for SpaceX flights.      The firm said having an Ethereum node in space brings physical security when transacting in crypto assets.      ""The security of space infrastructures also ensures the independence of Ethereum contract operation from centralized terrestrial servers, thus providing more efficient smart contract operation and greater application scenarios,"" the firm said in a statement.      The node will later enable the company's client, digital asset manager Nexus Inc., to develop additional blockchain capabilities for enterprise business applications.

The lawsuit against Telegram was filed in London, Da Vinci Managing Partner Oleg Zhelezko said in an interview with the Russian TV channel RBK.      Telegram shut the project, Telegram Open Network (TON), after a court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, offering investors partial refunds. The $1.7 billion token offering was one of the largest initial coin offerings in history. The fight with the SEC, which said the tokens, called grams, were unregistered securities, became crypto's biggest legal battle with the U.S. regulator.      ""Our fund got the offer 24 hours before the deadline, and many of our investors did simply not get a chance to analyze the documents and, therefore, they were not able to get a proper return on their investments,"" Zhelezko said. When the project was closed, investors were getting conflicting messages and struggled to decide what to do, he said.      Telegram offered investors a choice of either receiving back 72% of their funds or lending them to Telegram for a year and receiving 110% of their investments in 2021.      Da Vinci announced plans to sue Telegram in February. According to a Forbes report in March, Telegram received a pre-lawsuit document asking for $20 million in damages.      In the sale, Telegram only allowed investors to buy significant amounts of tokens, starting with tens of millions of dollars. Smaller investors could get in only through funds like Da Vinci's, said Vladimir Smerkis, who also invested via a fund, although not Da Vinci. For such smaller investors, the withdrawal terms were not favorable.      A return of 72% ""is quite a small return, especially if you take into account the fees,"" Smerkis said in an interview. He and some other investors decided to take the cash immediately, and he does not regret it. ""We made many times more money on the growing crypto market while that lawsuit was being prepared.""      Read also: Sidestepping Telegram, Devs and Validators Launch Fork of TON Blockchain      Earlier this year, poeple familiar with the process told CoinDesk that most investors chose to take the 72% option, but Telegram ended up with about $600 million as a loan.

In a call with CoinDesk, Arrington said the move is no mere NFT gimmick. It could one day open the doors to novel lending and borrowing schemes in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).      “We are increasingly excited about the role of NFTs in DeFi,” Arrington said. “With homes and really anything in the real world being tokenized, you can plug that physical item into DeFi, assuming the legal niceties are ironed out, and that’s fascinating.”      The auction process will involve the seller signing proprietary legal papers for the NFT to transfer ownership to any future buyers.

The digital currency, or ""eCNY"" as it is known, could give China ""a little more leeway for economic retaliation,"" according to Fanusie.

""Imagine if H&M and other foreign companies were required to [accept] eCNY for retail transactions – might it be easier to cut off transactions to them or to companies from countries that had a political dispute with China?"" Fanusie asked.      Fanusie was responding to the question about whether a Chinese CBDC could displace or undermine the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency, fears that he said are ""overblown."" The variables that affect whether the dollar is the top currency are ""big structural issues that aren't going to be displaced or offset just due to the introduction of a new digital currency,"" he argued.

42389288,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJthg,1621947600,Monetizing Genomic Data Is the Latest Use Case for NFTs,"Professor George Church, co-founder of Nebula Genomics and professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, is minting a non-fungible token (NFT) of his genomic data, a first for the world of NFTs.      Minted on the AkoinNFT marketplace, the NFT will be depicted as a high-resolution, artistic representation of Church’s genome and likeness. The NFT will also encode the digital location of Church’s full genomic data. That data will be hosted on the Oasis Network, a privacy-focused and blockchain-based cloud computing platform.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    Church, one of the first people to have his genome fully sequenced, said the inspiration for the NFT comes, in part, from thinking about how genomic and health data can be fairly shared and monetized.      “We think it’s essential that researchers have access to datasets that help them advance medicine, but we believe these datasets should be shared transparently,” said Church.      “Today, personal genomics companies have built their business models on monetizing user data. Unfortunately, the patient, or data owner, is frequently not even aware their data is being shared and is almost never compensated for it. NFTs and blockchain technology provide a new way to transparently share and monetize genomic data.”    Taking NFTs beyond artistic content    While NFTs are most widely known for popularity with artists, they are expanding into other areas. They’ve been used as a mechanism for selling cybersecurity exploits and for proving your location in the Internet of Things.      Church said he sees a future where individuals can choose to license their data to third parties as NFTs and set their own rules and permissions for who has access to that data.      “We’ve partnered with Oasis to develop technology where individuals can selectively grant permission to their data.” said Church. “This permission can also be revoked. Essentially, it will be possible to temporarily license data to third parties without forever giving it up. For my NFT, my genomic data will be hosted using Oasis.”    Read more: Oasis Protocol Adds Shyft Network in Bid to Attract Institutions to DeFi    Oasis will be using its Parcel product to store and protect Church’s genomic data.      Parcel is a set of privacy-first, data governance APIs designed to give customers better control of their data and oversight of how it is used according to Anne Fauvre-Willis, COO of Oasis Labs.      Parcel’s suite of tools enables developers to securely store sensitive user data, define and enforce usage policies over that sensitive data, share tamper-proof logs of access history with their users, and deploy an isolated compute environment for privacy-preserving analysis.      Currently in beta, Parcel is used by Nebula Genomics to give customers control over their sequenced genome data.    Read more: Permission.io Has Quietly Raised $50M to Make Advertising Personal and Data Private    “We think that genomic data is a great example for how non-fungible digital assets can be traded,” said Church. “We believe that the model we’re pioneering can be used for any data owner wanting to license out data to third parties.

Led by early Coinbase product manager Nick Tomaino, the fund, 1confirmation’s third, will follow the $800 million asset manager’s thesis of betting on projects with long-term disruptive potential.      “Our beliefs about the future have remained consistent since our initial launch four years ago,” Tomaino wrote in a blog post shared early with CoinDesk. Those beliefs: that crypto will empower individuals over institutions, that it has revolutionized online monetization and that social media platforms will create a wave of decentralized entrepreneurial communities.      One thing that has changed in four years is the sheer size of the fund’s launch capital.      1confirmation’s first vehicle, the seed-heavy Fund I, raised $26 million in 2017. Two years later the VC secured $45 million for a follow-up. Both are dwarfed by $125 million Fund III.      It's been a good time to raise capital for crypto-focused venture firms.

Gene Hoffmann described the schedule for an IPO as “near-term"" not long after Bloomberg reported the programmable money platform had completed a $61 million Series D funding round.      “This is on plan,” he said.      According to Hoffmann, the latest capital infusion from the likes of investment giants Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Richmond Global Ventures would enable Chia to expand even if “macro” conditions sour. “We can focus on building the business without worrying about external forces,” he said.      Chia has a roughly $500 million valuation, according to an unnamed source cited by Bloomberg, more than double the company’s previous valuation. Chia creator and BitTorrent founder Bram Cohen has been saying for several years that he aims to take Chia public. In a press release, Cohen said the company “was excited to welcome such a prestigious and proven group of investors who support our mission to radically improve global financial and payments systems.”      On Monday, Chia said it would use the funding for hiring and to bolster its infrastructure. Hoffman fleshed out those plans, saying that the company would grow its workforce to about 75 people by year’s end, roughly triple its current size. About half that number would be engineers who would focus on making its blockchain and smart transaction platform more user friendly. The company has already hired engineers from BitTorrent, Blockstream and Dash, among other companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.      The remaining hires would be part of a development and “go-to-market” team that will target big banks, government agencies and other institutions. “We want to ensure that we have the development resources that are needed,” Hoffman said.    Read more: Bram Cohen: ‘Getting Rich Is a Terrible Metric of Success’    In what Hoffmann described as a “barbell” strategy, the company is also targeting consumers who are seeking a more efficient way to send and execute transactions, including cross-border payments.      The company touts its decentralized blockchain and smart transaction platform as more energy efficient than competing systems.

Participating investors in the impressive seed funding round included environmental activist Bill Tai, Nima Capital’s Suna Said, Sangha Capital, tech investor Jack Herrick and the Tezos Foundation.      OneOf’s platform, which is built on the Tezos blockchain, will launch next month. Its first set of collectible releases is said to include music by the late Whitney Houston, Doja Cat, Quincy Jones, Jacob Collier and G-Eazy. Fans will be able to use credit or debit cards in over 135 fiat currencies, as well as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, to purchase NFTs, said the firm.      OneOf CEO Lin Dai told CoinDesk the funding will be spent on expanding the team, building on top of the platform's existing technology and supporting independent artists. The company is also to run an “Emerging Artist Spotlight Program, with the first artists to include Laura Mvula, Barbara Doza, and Erick The Architect.      “Primarily, a large part of the funding will go towards working with artists to secure rights to their art in the form of music that could potentially be collectible,” said Dai.      OneOf is marketing its business as environmental, social and governance (ESG) friendly and targeting environmentally conscious music consumers. It was co-founded by Dai, alongside digital media executive Joshua James and music industry veteran Adam Fell, in partnership with Quincy Jones and Quincy Jones Productions.      Using Tezos’ blockchain technology, OneOf claims minting an NFT uses two million times less energy than other proof-of-work networks such as Ethereum. It’s also aimed to be cheaper, with the firm pledging to support zero-cost NFT minting for artists using the platform.      By using OneOf, artists will be able to create NFTs at more “affordable price points to be accessible to all fans,” the firm said in a press release Tuesday.      “We really can't get ourselves comfortable enough to really commit to the Ethereum platform largely because of the environmental impact and the high gas fees,” Dai said in an interview.

What do you make of the second all-virtual Consensus? Is this a format you would hope to see continue even as the world returns to normal? Any thoughts on the metaverse replacing real life?      Call me old-fashioned, but I miss the human connection and look forward to attending in person next year. That said, it’s great that people have the ability to access the subject matter expertise that comes to Consensus, from anywhere in the world.    Andrew Keys, co-founder of Darma Capital, is a speaker on ""Ether for Institutions: The Next Frontier"" at Consensus 2021. Register here.    There's a lot of talk about ETH being ""ultra-sound money."" Is this an idea you buy into – or is it just wishful thinking?      I absolutely agree with this concept. Ether is an asset unlike the world has ever seen. It has three core properties that make it valuable as:    A capital asset: Owners of ETH own a piece of fees of world’s global settlement layer.  A consumable asset: ETH is a fuel, a digital commodity. For every computational step in Ethereum, a certain amount of ETH is ""burnt.""  A storage of value asset: ETH can be freely traded or used as collateral to borrow against in digital economy.    Two imminent catalysts to increasing the value of Ethereum include EIP 1559, wherein ether is burnt for every computational and storage transaction; and Transition to PoS, which reduces “sell pressure” associated with proof-of-work mining costs like electricity, hardware and real estate. Most miners have to sell 75% of what they mine to pay these monthly expenses.      There's a growing narrative that traditional finance folks understand Ethereum more than Bitcoin. Is this a replay of the ""blockchain, not bitcoin"" debates of the past?      Bitcoin addresses one simple use case. It’s digital gold with a total addressable market (TAM) of $10 trillion. With bitcoin, Alice can send Bob value peer-to-peer and it’s provably scarce. This is a non-trivial use case, and Bitcoin has been the patriarch of blockchain, but there’s much more we can do with next-generation blockchain databases.      Ethereum is the substrate to the digital economy. Its TAM is $270 trillion, for its total economy. Ethereum can digitize all assets (commodities, fiat, stocks, derivatives, insurance policies and prescriptions) as well as financial instruments (loans, derivatives and exchanges) and legal agreements (employment, syndication, purchase orders and investments).      What's your investment thesis?      We’re witnessing the birth of the digital economy. Ethereum is the only blockchain on Earth capable of being the substrate of the digital economy. Ether is an asset unlike any asset we’ve ever seen before. We invest in ether and the picks and shovels around Ethereum (like layer 2 scaling solutions) to help increase adoption.      You called Coinbase the AOL of Web 3.0. What's next?      Ethereum will exceed Bitcoin’s market capitalization in 2022.      Decentralized exchanges are growing rapidly, but there's a genuine concern that they're little more than ways to financialize token products. When will DEXs be able to support actual capital deployment and influence things in the physical world?      [Decentralized finance] has over $100 billion in [total value locked] with Ethereum settling $1.5 trillion of transactions in Q1 ‘21 … actual capital deployment is happening right now. Last month, [European Investment Bank], [Goldman Sachs] and [Société Générale] had to spend ether in order to issue a bond. Those entities needed ether for operating expenses. It’s happening right now.      You're known for your yearly Ethereum predictions. Have any been proven true so far?      I’ll defer to the fact-checkers, but in my view all of them have come true to some extent. One that I’m particularly proud of is 2021 being a breakthrough year for layer 2 solutions. What we’re seeing across the layer 2 landscape right now – particularly advancements in finality and security – makes me more confident than ever in the commercial viability of blockchain-based applications.

The count of accumulation addresses climbed to a record for the seventh consecutive day on Monday, taking the total to 545,115, according to Glassnode data.  The number has increased by 16,445 since May 8 – a sign of persistent bargain hunting by long-term holders during bitcoin's slide from $58,000 to $30,000.

Glassnode defines accumulation addresses as ones that have at least two incoming non-dust (tiny amounts of bitcoin) transfers and have never spent funds. Essentially, these are long-term holder addresses.  Over-the-counter (OTC) desks have also seen substantial outflows over the past two weeks, signifying dip-demand from institutional investors.  On Monday, OTC desks tracked by Glassnode registered an outflow of 11,883, the most since early September.  However, inflows to OTC desks wallet also spiked to a 5.5-month high of 12,392 on Monday.

According to a report by Reuters on Tuesday, the bank is not promoting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within its wealth management business.      Quinn's stance contrasts with that of other major global investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, which earlier this year relaunched its crypto trading desk three years after shelving the idea in 2018.      ""I view bitcoin as more of an asset class than a payments vehicle, with very difficult questions about how to value it on the balance sheet of clients because it is so volatile,"" Quinn told Reuters.      Bitcoin fell 47% last week, with the declines likely stemming from a number of investor concerns, including the decision by crypto exchange Huobi to scale back operations due to China's tightening regulations. The cryptocurrency is down 40.5% from its all-time highs near $64,900 and is currently changing hands for around $38,300. Year-to-date, bitcoin is up around 31% and is also 6% higher over a 24-hour period, CoinDesk 20 data shows.      Quinn also took aim at stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that have their value pegged to reserve assets such as government-issued currencies or precious metals.      Stablecoins ""do have some reserve backing behind them to address the stored-value concerns, but it depends on who the sponsoring organization is plus the structure and accessibility of the reserve,"" he said.      Still, HSBC's CEO was upbeat about the potential for central bank digital currencies (CBDC) within the evolving financial system.      See also: JPMorgan to Launch ‘Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket’ of Bitcoin Proxy Stocks      ""CBDCs can facilitate international transactions in e-wallets more simply, they take out friction costs and they are likely to operate in a transparent manner and have strong attributes of stored value,"" Quinn said.

But not necessarily in the way you might think.      The founder of Tron – a low-fee network designed to facilitate peer-to-peer sharing of digital content – recognizes the value of celebrity attention in the crypto space. Sun made his comments at Consensus 2021, CoinDesk’s annual conference that assembles experts and influencers from the crypto industry, global finance and more.

42389285,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJte7,1621909767,"'This Isn't the Start of OPEC': New Bitcoin Mining Council Just Wants to Promote Greener Practices, Member Says","The new Bitcoin Mining Council has no intention of altering the cryptocurrency’s software and merely wants to promote sustainable energy practices and transparency in the industry, a founding member said.      The council, spearheaded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, will respect bitcoin’s fungibility, and does not advocate discrimination between so-called clean and dirty coins, said Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain.      “We’re not talking about Bitcoin code or block size or anything related to changing the nature of Bitcoin,” said Wall, whose publicly traded company was one of a handful of mining firms that met with Saylor and Musk over the weekend. “We all love Bitcoin the way it is, as a decentralized, permissionless system.”      Further, “discussions with the group so far have been very clear that one 1 BTC is 1 BTC, and that the fungibility and essential properties of Bitcoin shouldn’t be changed,” Wall said in an interview Monday evening.      In the hours since Musk and Saylor revealed the meeting on Twitter Monday, hardened Bitcoin veterans have been comparing it to the controversial and ultimately unsuccessful New York Agreement of 2017. That closed-door gathering of startup executives was a major flashpoint in a highly acrimonious debate over how best to scale the Bitcoin network, and widely viewed as inimical to the currency’s ethos of leaderlessness.      As then, many users are questioning how a small group of companies and two charismatic figureheads can profess to lead a global community where, by design, no one is in charge.      “It's extremely concerning that this group of bitcoiners wandered into this ‘meeting’ without any sense of self-awareness,” wrote Marty Bent, co-founder of Great American Mining, in his newsletter Monday. ”Do they not recall the last time there was a closed-door meeting that involved industry stakeholders who attempted to speak on behalf of an entire industry? How did they think this would turn out? The hubris is astounding.”      Wall said such concerns are unfounded in this case.      “This isn't the start of OPEC,” he quipped. “The group is a way to get together and discuss. We are all independent, decentralized miners who have formed a voluntary group to influence the industry and each other.”      The group is not exclusive, he added, though it is still working out mechanisms for other mining operations to join. “This is an international challenge for Bitcoin and needs to be addressed on an international level.”    Bitcoin goes ESG?    The council’s formation also comes as public figures such as “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary are pushing the idea that bitcoins can be “clean” or “dirty” depending on how they are mined, and that green-minded institutional investors can, and should buy only the former.      Throughout his conversation with CoinDesk, Wall said the council’s two goals were to promote disclosure of and improve energy practices. Beyond those broad objectives, the companies haven’t agreed on much else, he said.      “What we do want to do is to make sure valid ESG concerns about people mining bitcoin with coal are being addressed,” Wall said, referring to the shorthand for environmental, social and corporate governance. “At this point, It’s not going any further than that.”      When asked about the efficacy of carbon credits, he declined to speak on the council’s behalf. “We haven't gone beyond the two things I've laid out, which is energy transparency and improving sustainable mining practices.”      Pressed on how promoting mining transparency squared with protecting fungibility, Wall said the council wasn’t considering labeling which coins were mined sustainably and which ones with coal-powered equipment. The information would begin and end on the company level, he said.      “What we're saying is we need to promote energy transparency around individual miners, not necessarily about coins that are coming out from individual miners,” Wall said. The question is “what kind of energy mixes are individual miners, publicly traded miners, using, with the goal to then take that knowledge and encourage people to move more towards renewables.”      Besides Argo, the other miners in the group are Hut 8, Galaxy Digital, Riot Blockchain, Marathon, Core Scientific, Hive Blockchain and Blockcap. Combined, they control less than 10% of the global computing power on the Bitcoin network, Coin Metrics co-founder and Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter estimated. Notably, all of them are based in North America; much of the environmental controversy centers around China, where mining activity is concentrated and said to rely heavily on coal and fossil fuels in areas like Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.      Fred Thiel, CEO of Las Vegas-based miner Marathon Digital Holdings, said he wasn’t on the call Sunday but broadly seconded Wall’s comments.      “It's more just an interest group that wants to get together and discuss,” Thiel said in an appearance on CoinDesk TV during Consensus 2021. “I think if you look at the ambitions of the council, you'll find that the council wants to be open to anybody who's a miner and it's really about sharing best practices.”      In other words, “nobody's trying to centralize or control anything,” he said.      In 2021, listed firms have to meet institutional investors' expectations for corporate social responsibility, Thiel pointed out.

42389299,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJuDl,1621902123,DeFi Is Rising in Chicago,"Chicago’s DeFi scene is thriving, and it has New York to thank.      That was the message from Colleen Sullivan, co-founder and CEO of Chicago-based venture capital firm CMT Digital, who spoke during a panel exploring the state of the crypto industry in the Windy City as part of Consensus 2021, CoinDesk’s annual conference that brings together influencers and experts in crypto, finance and more.      She puts the Chicago situation down to New York’s BitLicense, the state’s regulatory framework that debuted in 2015 and requires startups to obtain a license for cryptocurrency activities. It got 22 applications in its first round, while 15 companies closed down. Between 2015 and 2020, only 25 firms were approved. New York’s loss was Chicago’s gain and the result has turned the Illinois city into a hotbed of crypto collaboration.    Read more: Kevin O’Leary Doubles Down on ‘Green Bitcoin’    The DeFi Alliance is a prime example, Sullivan said. Based in Chicago, it provides a six-week accelerator program for decentralized finance startups, with backing from digital asset venture capital firms also headquartered there, including Jump Capital, Volt Capital and CMT. By connecting established crypto investors with startups, entrepreneurs can access liquidity and seed funding in addition to networking and mentoring.      “I can name at least 10 to 12 crypto startups that have roots in Chicago straight off the bat,” Imran Khan, partner at Volt Capital and lead at the DeFi Alliance, said during the session.      “We are just getting started in launching what are going to be iconic DeFi names in the coming years,” added Peter Johnson, partner at Jump Capital, a Chicago-based investment firm and member of the DeFi Alliance. “It’s a massive amount of collaboration that we haven’t seen before.”      The panellists agreed that the universities in the Chicago area make it one of the most fertile regions in the country for young developers. “We find that it is a really good place to attract young talent and developers,” said Wilson.      “We’re starting to see students at universities in the area starting their own blockchain clubs,” added Khan.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/25/defi-is-rising-in-chicago,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd5d2fe2f4c3f4e3da30e0b6e043e50f8a57735f-1420x948.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42389298,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJuAC,1621901754,5 Big Takeaways From Day 2 at Consensus,"We heard from China experts, bitcoin miners and some of the biggest names in non-fungible tokens during the second day of Consensus 2021. Here are five of the biggest takeaways.    1. Crypto could be a modernizing force for regulation: SEC    Crypto may force the Securities and Exchange Commission to modernize its custody rules faster than it would otherwise, Commissioner Hester Peirce said at Consensus 2021. “The bottom line message I have is that we have work to do in modernizing our custody rules, all across the board,” she said. “I think, as with many other areas, crypto may force us to do that modernization faster than we otherwise would do.”    Read more: Crypto May Force SEC to Modernize Custody Rules: Commissioner Hester Peirce  2. Making sense of the 'mining ban'    China’s highest economic planning agency has issued draft guidance on how to ban crypto mining in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. The guideline includes specifics on monitoring and punishing companies and individuals involved in crypto mining (including internet cafes!). Several Consensus panels discussed how this policy is different from a similar 2019 ban – with most in agreement that the new law, if it goes into effect, would affect a wider range of businesses. Ballet founder Bobby Lee, for one, raised the prospect that Mongolia may choose not to enforce the ban.    Read more: Inner Mongolia Outlines How It May Ban Crypto Mining  3. BTC, ESG, OPEC: SBF    Yesterday evening two bitcoin figureheads, Elon Musk and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, joined forces on the Bitcoin Mining Council, an apparent attempt to address bitcoin’s worrisome environmental footprint. The council has been derided by some as a shadowy cabal that could damage bitcoin’s fungibility or decentralization. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said today that an “OPEC-like” strategy wouldn’t work because “anyone can come in and mine bitcoin.” It’s unknown how the council will address the hashrate problem besides advocating for greater transparency of where miners source their energy and encouraging the uptake of renewables. For his part, Bankman-Fried has pledged to start buying carbon offsets.

A peek at what state-backed interoperability looks like    Yifan He, the CEO of Red Date Technologies, one of the technological backers of the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), gave a first peek under the hood of the so-called blockchain of blockchains. Although still at a “very early stage,” the state-backed BSN will integrate with AWS, Google Cloud, China Mobile and AliCloud to provide cloud services, and have a “Public City Node” layer to provide public and private blockchain services. The most significant technological advancement? BSN has “unified API gateways” to help developers connect to all the various supported chains with just a single set of credentials.    Read more: China’s BSN Builder Urges Developers to Look Beyond Cryptocurrency  5. Meet the NFT maximalists    Innovation is still happening in the NFT space at a breakneck pace, despite a recent pullback in hype and prices. Brian Transeau, the electronic musician known simply as BT, has unveiled one of the most innovative token projects to date. Called Genesis.json, the NFT/dapp is a 24-hour audiovisual event featuring about 15,000 bits of music and imagery all hand-sequenced and hard-coded by BT. Noah Davis, Christie’s point person on NFTs, called the token standard “the art world’s Napster” that could disrupt the auction system forever. He added that the auction house is planning to continue offering NFT “drops,” with recent auctions involving blue-chip items such as Andy Warhol NFTs and more experimental rollouts.    Day 1 Takeaways    The first day at Consensus 2021 was packed with news and insight, from Ray Dalio speaking freely on the coming debt crisis to a Federal Reserve governor indicating that the central bank “wants a seat at the table” in the development of cross-border solutions. Here are the five need-to-know takeaways from Monday’s events.

Competition is driving CBDC research    Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard didn’t exactly give a forward projection for the U.S. agency’s policy this morning, but she did say the Fed is more interested in central bank digital currencies (CBDC) than previously known. Brainard said it’s important to follow the rise of private money and CBDC pilots in antagonistic nations like China closely. “The issuance of a CBDC in one jurisdiction … does potentially have significant effects across the globe,” she said. To that end, the Boston Federal Reserve and MIT Digital Currency Initiative plan to publish a U.S. digital dollar white paper this summer.    Read more: Fed’s Brainard Breaks Down CBDC Policy Considerations, Sees Price Pressures Waning in the Future  2. Inflation will wane over time: Federal Reserve    Asked about inflation, Brainard cited April's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, showing a 4.2% increase in prices year-over-year. This is a worrying figure in-and-out of the cryptocurrency industry because it shows a real impact on everyday shoppers. Brainard poured cool water on the heated talking point when saying a rise in inflation was to be expected as the U.S. economy continues to reopen. This is a continuation of what Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been saying for months, including that the central bank will let the economy run hot. Brainard added these inflationary forces will ""subside over time.""    Read more: Fed’s Brainard Breaks Down CBDC Policy Considerations, Sees Price Pressures Waning in the Future  3. Dalio prefers BTC to bonds    Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, predicts that the U.S. dollar is on the verge of devaluation and could lose its position as the global reserve currency. Fearing rising inflation and the preponderance of debt in the economy, Dalio expects the Federal Reserve to resort to the new usual: more money printing to pay down debts. Under this inflationary scenario, the Bridgewater founder said he’d “rather have bitcoin than a bond,” if looking for an attractive hedge. What’s more, Dalio said for the first time he’s already a holder. Dalio also said that “bitcoin’s greatest risk is its success.” Though it may be bitcoin’s time to shine (over gold) during a coming inflation rout, if it cuts into the government’s ability to raise funds through bonds, a swift ban might be expected.    Read more: Ray Dalio: ‘I Have Some Bitcoin’  4. Dalio isn’t the only hodler    Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon revealed he owns cryptocurrencies while discussing the early successes of his state’s efforts to attract cryptocurrency companies and projects. “People often look to New York or Miami or Delaware before they look at Wyoming. But a lot of the pioneering work has been done here,” Gordon said. Indeed, Wyoming has set out some of the nation’s most favorable crypto laws, most recently a bill that would recognize decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs, or, bits of code) as legal entities. Does it pay to be early? Gordon listed off some of the big names that opened branches in the Cowboy State: Kraken, Ripple Labs and IOHK, the company behind Cardano. A $60 billion broadband expansion program also didn’t hurt in attracting these digital natives.    Read more: Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon Owns Crypto  5. Holding bitcoin is a 'fiduciary' duty    Inflation was one of the common themes throughout the day’s panels. Nowhere was that more on display than during a roundtable featuring MicroStrategy CFO Phong Le, whose company has become synonymous with the buy and hold mentality. Since August, MicroStrategy has purchased $2.3 billion worth of BTC, in an attempt to get cash – a depreciating asset – off its balance sheets. Today, Le gave a little more insight. “I’m not saying you should put all of your corporate treasury in bitcoin,” he said. “But if you’re not putting any of it into bitcoin, I don’t think you’re doing your fiduciary responsibility, which is maximizing shareholder value.”    Read more: MicroStrategy CFO Says Tech Companies Have an ‘Imperative’ to Hold BTC    UPDATE (25 May 22:45 UTC): Adds new information.
