42396307,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2fRq,1639611502,First Mover Asia: Fed Decision on Stimulus Money Buoys Crypto Markets,"(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin jumps above $49,000 after U.S. Fed’s decision to accelerate stimulus withdrawal.  Technician’s take: Bitcoin’s price momentum is stabilizing after several weeks of low trading volume.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $48,843 +1.3%  Ether (ETH): $4,014 +4.5%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,709 +1.6%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,927 +1.1%  Nasdaq: $15,565 +2.1%  Gold: $1,777 +0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped above $49,000 on Wednesday, after U.S. Federal Reserve officials approved the acceleration of the central bank’s plan to withdraw coronavirus pandemic stimulus efforts.  Following the news, crypto and traditional markets turned higher as the central bank’s decision diminished investor uncertainty. The Fed bankers signaled they are ready to raise the short-term interest rate at least three times next year to battle the current high inflation.  The whole crypto market was watching the Fed decision closely because many believe tightened monetary policy is typically considered bearish for risk assets, crypto included. Prices for bitcoin and other crypto fell sharply in recent weeks because investors were worried about the Fed’s anticipated hawkish policy adjustment. The price rise after Wednesday’s news showed “a relief rally,” as CoinDesk reported.  Bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges was slightly higher on Wednesday compared with a day ago. Prices for other major cryptocurrencies also rose. Ether went above $4,000 after it slipped below $3,700 earlier this week.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Rises Toward $50K; Resistance Seen Around $52K  Bitcoin (BTC) held support around $46,000 and is attempting to reverse a short-term downtrend. Still, upside appears to be limited toward the $52,000 resistance level, which is roughly midway through the 20% sell-off that occurred earlier this month.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since May 20, which preceded a strong price recovery. Momentum is also stabilizing after several weeks of low trading volume.  On the weekly chart, price conditions are less favorable as the uptrend appears to be slowing. For now, this suggests short-term buyers could struggle beyond $50,000-$55,000.

42411624,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP51W,1639608281,Crypto Is People and Culture. It’s Time the Media Saw It That Way,"It’s wonderful to be able to celebrate a culture week in crypto. As they have a penchant for throwing themselves off a cliff to see if they survive, Bitcoin and Ethereum and blockchain in general have many times looked like they wouldn’t get back up. For a few weeks after I got a deal to write my book in early 2019, I convinced myself it would be Ethereum’s obituary.  Matt Leising is co-founder of DeCential Media, which is dedicated to telling stories of the founders, builders and visionaries of the new decentralized world. This post is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  It’s interesting that the same can be said of the traditional financial world so much of this industry wants to replace; it just won’t die. Money has always been needed and always will, whether in shell form or packed into a 60-kilobyte block. What’s also always been needed are stories about money and power and all the fun stuff that comes along with it.  Crypto – I’ll refer to it broadly here as such, though I know many people loathe the term – is a particularly challenging and interesting and frustrating topic to cover. At this early stage in any industry or endeavor, stories are fantastically important. Think of how settling the western United States has been basically invented for our consumption and how, for the most part, we love it.  I came to write about crypto starting in 2015 after reading an explainer on the importance of blockchain in The Economist. Until then I’d dismissed Bitcoin as a fool’s game. My first story for Bloomberg News was about the blockchain-not-Bitcoin debate that raged for a while back then. It was rightly spiked. But I saw it coming, as many others did; Wall Street’s head had been turned. Blythe Masters led the charge of the bankers, and at Bloomberg it became a rich vein to cover.  Get the whole of Crypto 2022: Culture Week here.  I wish I’d kept track of the number of editors and other reporters I’ve given the crypto 101 speech to, and there are many in that newsroom and others all over the world who still think it’s a scam. It’s hard to know how to separate the daily news mentality from this certain kind of disdain, I think, as the news needs to be fed every day and never stops. It needs new stories, new sagas, and the rise and fall of Bitcoin fits that schema perfectly. Financial markets know all about froth and bubbles and internet companies with negative revenue and hundred-million-dollar valuations. And they know about the inevitable crash.  Going through the crypto winter of 2018-2019 as a reporter was one of the most valuable experiences I could’ve wanted. The euphoria of $20,000 bitcoin and ether at $1,400 led to some reckless behavior across the board, and newsrooms were no exception. Again, I understand this part. What I discovered that eventually disappointed me was how few in the media took that downturn to learn about this new way of organizing and transacting.  What was going on as ether was trapped under $300 as though being drowned was that people never stopped believing in it. They kept building and pushing and doing what they could to make this very different future a reality. This is an obvious point now, considering DeFi summer is in the rearview mirror and we’re perhaps starting to see a cooling off in non-fungible token (NFT) exuberance, but it wasn’t clear at all in 2019 that the Ethereum blockchain would gain the traction it promised.  Didn’t die  But crypto don’t die, remember? It has now re-created three pillars of traditional finance and culture, but in a peer-to-peer uncensorable distributed fashion.  The first was capital formation with initial coin offerings.  The second, collateralized lending.  And the third, digital scarcity through NFTs and a possible answer to one of the trickiest decentralized puzzles: digital identity in the form of profile pictures.  This is an amazing amount of innovation in a short time, let’s not forget. And, of course, there have been the scams and hacks and frauds and everything else that has dogged crypto from day one.  MORE from CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  And yet with all that in mind there are many still in the mainstream media who sneer at crypto. This is, in part, what led me to co-found DeCential. Like most of the skeptics, the press had gone on its merry way when prices fell and its bias seemed confirmed, yet then the industry came roaring back. Strangely, in my experience, it only seemed to harden some beliefs that clearly this was all an enormous Ponzi scheme. I mean, have you looked into Tether?  Looking back, there was a kind of quiet solitude during the crypto winter. I recall writing a lot of stories about traditional financial firms experimenting with blockchain or taking baby steps to offer crypto as an investment asset to clients. Chicago gave us bitcoin futures. And all the while the developers and dreamers working in the public blockchain space kept plugging away. Summer 2020 saw usage on Ethereum explode as collateralized lending and decentralized exchanges – which had been around for a while – became easier to access. Soon bitcoin and ether shot to all-time highs and the demand for stories in newsrooms followed.  I was soon stretched this way and that by too many requests for stories and pitches and editors way up the masthead with whom I’d never worked now demanding my attention. I distinctly remember thinking, “Where were you when all this seemed so fragile? You didn’t believe in it then and you don’t believe in it now. You’re just chasing a rising line on a price chart.” It’s the news judgment equivalent of “number go up”.  And the real shame is that for too many in the traditional press that lack of belief is still pervasive. At this point it’s on them. The explainers and real companies and exchanges and investment funds have been around for years now. Crypto’s combined market value is over $2 trillion. I don’t have time for people still doubting all of this. They can shout at someone else’s cloud.  Because what that leads to, at the end of the day, is a dismissal of the people creating this new industry. And that does upset me. Coming from many years of covering Wall Street and the type of banker who succeeds there, getting to know a lot of the most important people in crypto has been wonderfully refreshing. They’re good people, for the most part. They truly believe they can make the world a better place, and in today’s political and cultural moment I will take all of that I can get. (Bear in mind, I mostly write about Ethereum, and that is what has led me to this belief.)  With DeCential, I realized that crypto journalism deserves a new chapter, one dedicated to telling the stories of the amazing men and women making all this cool new stuff. The culture they are also creating deserves as much attention as the code. There’s too much focus on the tech, or the entire idea of decentralized systems is often dismissed with an eye roll as too hard to understand. Understand it through the people, from their life stories and why they want to see this alternate future. It’s a trick as old as storytelling – use characters to convey complicated matters. Make it human and you can bring anyone along.  So here’s to the culture of crypto, one of the most vibrant and remarkable and never-predictable places to be. It’s also resilient, and it’s here to stay. Hopefully, I can play a small role to help capture its dynamic true to form.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Matthew Leising,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/15/crypto-is-people-and-culture-its-time-the-media-saw-it-that-way,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46a79655b69349babe9ea0bb57fdcdb57658c010-6016x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407267,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKX6b,1639608241,From DOH! to DAO: The Rise of Decentralized Organizations,"In the summer of 2016, Joe Lubin, one of the eight co-founders of Ethereum, was in midtown Manhattan to talk about how blockchain could transform accounting practices. While surely a fascinating topic, most people in the room that day wanted to know Lubin’s opinion in the wake of the theft of $55 million in ether from The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  He’d never been a fan of the project – which pooled startup capital to fund Ethereum projects chosen by the DAO members. Only a week or so before, in a still controversial move, Ethereum users voted to change the history of the blockchain to allow the ether stolen from The DAO to be returned.  When asked about it and any lingering effects the so-called hard fork would have on the network he helped create, Lubin said Ethereum was still too young and unsophisticated to handle something like a decentralized private equity fund.  “It was deemed by some of us to be possibly systematically destabilizing,” he told the audience at Microsoft’s office in Times Square. Then, in what could certainly be the most evergreen quote in all crypto, he said, “Naïve people in the cryptocurrency space buy these tokens because they think they’ll get rich.”  While that sentiment hasn’t changed, DAOs sure have.  For years after the DAO hack and hard fork the d-word wasn’t spoken. In 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released a report on the incident where it ruled DAO tokens had been sold as unregistered securities, but chose not to go after anyone. Since then a lot of work has been done on how the terribly named entities are structured and funded, and 2022 may be the year that they make a broad comeback while touching on industries far afield from crypto. Still, a lot of questions are left to be answered and the tools to manage DAOs are in their infancy.  Read more: What Is a DAO?  “My starting assumption is DAOs are one of these inventions within crypto that are not going to be un-invented,” said Ryan Selkis, co-founder and chief executive officer of research and analytics firm Messari. “You’re now seeing an explosion of innovation around DAO design.” Messari recently released a suite of DAO governance tools called Governor to help the organizations keep track of voting, member participation and treasury maintenance.  At its essence, a DAO is an organizing principle. It can be applied to a lot of people or a few, but what’s constant is the hierarchy, which is meant to be flat, with every member given a vote in how the DAO’s mission – whatever it may be – is executed. While in many cases DAOs have to start with the vision of one person or a small group of people, the goal is to grow the membership until everyone is engaged in DAO management within an area they find engaging.  The projects employing that structure are now blooming far outside the crypto world. From a DAO intent on buying an National Basketball Association basketball team, to one that wants to restore ocean health to one dedicated to increasing the wealth of women, or a DAO that wanted to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution, the range and breadth of how DAOs are being thought of is staggering. The list of DAOs to emerge in 2022 and beyond is far more exhaustive than those examples, yet the connection from the digital world to the real one is a unifying strength most of these projects share.  “Using DAOs to pool capital to make a real-world impact is a big category,” said Aaron Wright, who almost single-handedly brought DAOs back into fashion when he helped create the LAO in 2019 as a co-founder at OpenLaw, a digital contracting system. (The LAO, with some important changes, seeks to serve the same funding function for Ethereum startups that The DAO pioneered.)  Other categories Wright expects to be big in DAOLand include ones that produce creative content, social groups like Friends With Benefits, not-for-profit DAOs and services-oriented groups built on a guild model where software developers, for example, can join to find work opportunities.  “The notion that small groups of people can compete with Silicon Valley is true,” Wright said. “That’s one of the visions of the DAO, that the community can support itself.”  Due to their open and collaborative nature, DAOs may also help diversify crypto culture that mirrors much of the traditional models.  “The face of crypto right now is white and male,” said Alana Podrx, founder of Eve Wealth, a DAO formed to build women’s wealth. She noted 75% of crypto holders are men. “If we’re going to invent the future of the financial system, we need to make sure it looks different and is diverse.”  Get the whole of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  The tools to pull together a potentially global effort like Eve Wealth in DAO form have been created in just the last six months, Podrx said. “Before this we would have had to develop our own token access tools and create smart contracts,” she said. “Instead, we did it in 15 minutes with CollabLand and Coinvise.”  What started as a small group of financially ambitious women from Podrx’s network in traditional finance soon grew to more than 300 female accredited investors. They set the goal of filling in the space between robo advising and high net-worth wealth management, she said. The collaboration or co-op ethos of a DAO has come naturally to the women in Eve Wealth, she said.  “We forget that women have had to use soft power for all of history,” Podrx said. “We are all invested in the success of the community.”  The global reach of DAOs is also gaining traction as seen when ConstitutionDAO formed and within a few days raised about $47 million to try to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution. While problems arose with refunding member money when the bid failed – more like ConstitutionDOH! – the network effect and international reach was impressive. That’s the force behind Krause House DAO as well, which is on a mission to buy an NBA basketball team.  Co-founder Flex Chapman (not his real name, but we’ll get to that) had initially been interested in creating DAO software tools with his partner. “DAOs have no shortage of problems with them now,” he said. They soon realized forming a DAO would be much more exciting than making software tools for them, and Krause House was born. In November, Krause House raised 1,000 ether on Mirror worth about $4.4 million.  A DAO structure rewrites the rules for collective ownership, allowing possibly hundreds of thousands of Krause House members to vote on team decisions rather than an owner and general manager making those calls, Chapman said. While the amount of money to buy an NBA team is in the billions of dollars, Krause House plans to keep its members engaged by hosting real-world events like pickup basketball leagues and virtual games like fantasy leagues and ask-me-anythings (AMA) with NBA players, according to the Krause House Mirror page.  Chapman said not everything in the world needs to be decentralized but that a DAO makes the outsized ambition of Krause House easier to achieve. “People are seeing the benefits,” he said. His partner and he chose to use pseudonyms to separate themselves from their past experience with Web 2 startups, he said. “I think Web 3 is a revolution and I wanted to have a clean take,” Chapman said.  There’s still a lot of work to be done to bring DAOs more mainstream, said OpenLaw’s Wright. “The shape of what they will look like, I still don’t have a clear vision of it,” he said. “That’s the question – where are we in the cycle and no one really knows right now.”  Messari’s Selkis was more sanguine. DAOs are as important as layer one blockchains, DeFi protocols and NFTs, and should be used to govern the broader decentralized landscape, he said.  “You’re talking about one of the primary building blocks for crypto,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Matthew Leising,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/14/from-doh-to-dao-the-rise-of-decentralized-organizations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89768a6a8c49dc24b2ca3739ee72e8e0e52fefc1-2524x1683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396296,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2fD5,1639608150,"Fed Speeds Up Stimulus Withdrawal, and Bitcoin Jumps","Federal Reserve officials took steps to accelerate the withdrawal of the unprecedented monetary stimulus used to prop up markets in the wake of the coronavirus, acknowledging the growing threat of inflation now at a 39-year high.  The U.S. central bank meeting was being closely watched by digital-asset traders because many bitcoin investors see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the potential debasement of the dollar that might result from the monetary stimulus, which is facilitated by Fed money printing. So a faster withdrawal of the stimulus might provide an extra headwind for bitcoin prices.  But bitcoin (BTC) prices jumped after the Fed decision was announced at 2 p.m. ET (19:00 UTC), signaling that traders may have been worried about an even more aggressive withdrawal of the stimulus and faster interest rate increases next year. The bitcoin price had fallen 15% just in December alone.  “The market went down before the fed announcement, so it’s probably correcting now,” Merav Ozair, a professor in the finance and economics department at Rutgers Business School, told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “Inflation is coming for sure, and we see it.”  As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 3.7% over the past 24 hours to about $48,700.  According to a statement Wednesday, the Fed will double the pace of tapering its monthly bond purchases, reducing them by $30 billion every month until they’re completely wound down early next year. Under the Fed’s previous plan, it would have withdrawn $15 billion of the stimulus every month to wind down the program by the middle of next year. For most of the past couple of years, the Fed has been printing money to buy about $120 billion of bonds a month.  A quicker winding down of the asset purchases could allow the Fed to proceed more quickly to start raising interest rates for the first time since 2018. After the spread of the coronavirus in March 2020 began to hit global markets and economies, the Fed cut interest rates to close to zero and has held them there since then.  “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation,” the Federal Open Market Committee, as the Fed’s monetary-policy committee is known, said in the statement.  At a press conference on Wednesday after the decision was announced, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the asset purchases would end by mid-March, a few months earlier than communicated just last month.  “The economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support,” Powell said.  Federal Reserve interest rates  The Fed said Wednesday it would keep the benchmark U.S. interest rate for now in the current range of between 0% and 0.25%.  Some traders and economists have referred to the Fed’s recent tilt toward becoming more hawkish – more aggressive in fighting inflation – as the “Powell pivot.” That refers to Powell’s repeated assurances for seven months earlier this year that inflation was “transitory.”  Powell and other officials at the U.S. central bank repeatedly used that term to suggest that the forces driving recent consumer price increases might abate as the economy accelerates from coronavirus-related lockdowns.  But the U.S. Consumer Price Index – a key gauge of inflation – climbed to 6.8% in November from 12 months earlier, the fastest in 39 years.  And on Nov. 30, Powell said during a U.S. congressional hearing that it was time to retire the term “transitory.”  The largest cryptocurrency is viewed by many investors as a hedge against inflation – based on the idea that its supply is tightly controlled by the programming built into the underlying blockchain. That hard-coded process is contrasted with the human-decided monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which has ballooned its balance sheet to about $8.7 trillion, more than double where it stood in early 2020.  But bitcoin is also seen as a risky asset, so there’s a view among traders that loose monetary policies encourage investors to make bigger speculative bets. A reversal of these “dovish” policies might prove a headwind for bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/15/fed-speeds-up-stimulus-withdrawal-an-extra-headwind-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5f7142a232e8d66b857f2c29cb052ec554f40d0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dapper Labs declined to disclose the acquired companies.  A regulatory filing from Dec. 9 showed that Dapper Labs had raised $6.5 million toward a $13.5 million goal in an equity offering. The company told CoinDesk in an email late Monday that the funds were used to purchase a “young, scrappy” company.  A new filing on Wednesday showed that Dapper had raised $23 million toward a $71 million goal in an offering that opened on Nov. 22.  “We did not raise funds. Instead, as our ecosystem and portfolio continues to grow, we’ve made, and will continue to make, a series of acquisitions that we are choosing not to disclose at this time,” a Dapper Labs spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email.  Non-fungible tokens are a booming aspect of the U.S. sports scene and NBA Top Shot was an early bellwether.

42411859,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiHm,1639607965,How to Buy a Tom Brady NFT,"Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL quarterback Tom Brady recently launched his own non-fungible token (NFT) collection – called “Live Forever: The Tom Brady Origins Collection”– focusing on the early years of his NFL career.  As expected, the collection sold out in under 10 minutes and grossed around $1.3 million in total sales. For those who missed out on the public sales of the NFT collection, it is not too late to get your hands on one, as you can follow the steps highlighted in this guide to purchase a Tom Brady Origins NFT on the secondary market. But first, here is everything you need to know about this collection.  What is Tom Brady’s latest NFT collection?  On Dec. 9, 2021, Tom Brady continued his stint in the NFT industry with a successful launch of an NFT collection depicting the beginning of his illustrious NFL career on Autograph, an NFT platform that Tom Brady co-founded with father-son duo Richard Rosenblatt and Dillon Rosenblatt. As its name suggests, the collection showcases some of the memorabilia that defined key events before Brady was drafted into the NFL in 2000. The collection consists of 16,600 NFTs stored in mystery boxes, each priced at $80 during public sales. Buyers involved in the sale had no idea which NFTs they purchased and had to wait for the big reveal event that took place on Dec. 14.  Another important thing you need to know about this collection is that it features 25 sets of tiered collectibles based on their rarity. Note that the memorabilia tokenized as part of Tom Brady’s Origin collection include his:  Combine cleats  College resume  Rookie draft card  Combine jersey  Combine stopwatch  For those unfamiliar with American football, “combine” denotes that the items in question were used during a week-long scouting event in 2000 when Tom Brady, along with other college football players, completed various physical and mental tests to impress NFL coaches.  In total, there are five possible tiers of rarity found in this collection. These rarity tiers are named:  Carbon  Platinum  Emerald  Sapphire  Ruby  For instance, the college resume collectible is available in Carbon, Platinum, Emerald, Sapphire and Ruby variants, with the Carbon set being the least rare and the Ruby set being the rarest.  Apart from the tokenized items highlighted above, the collection also features special NFT collectibles named “Immortal Statues.” Notably, these collectibles also have the Carbon, Platinum, Emerald, Sapphire and Ruby versions. The only difference is that the Immortal Statues are specially designed to reward users that successfully meet certain requirements.  More specifically, when buyers acquire all the five items listed above in the same rarity tier, they become eligible to receive 1 Immortal Statue NFT of the same rarity tier, provided that they hold the sets at the activation deadline set for Dec. 21, 2021. Also, those eligible to receive Immortal Statues can only do so if they had linked their DraftKings accounts to their Autograph accounts before the date of activation deadline.  For example, a collector who owns a Carbon set of the combine cleat, the stopwatch, the college resume, combine jersey and rookie draft card at the activation deadline will receive a Carbon Immortal Statue.  Interestingly, Tom Brady has signed each NFT that makes up the Ruby and Sapphire version of the Immortal Statues collectibles to provide additional value.  How to buy Tom Brady’s NFTs  As mentioned earlier, Tom Brady’s collection debuted on Autograph, an NFT platform launched in August of this year focused on tokenizing and selling memorabilia of sports athletes and celebrities.  Autograph is housed on DraftKings NFT marketplace, meaning prospective users will most likely have to navigate to DraftKings Marketplace’s website to purchase Tom Brady’s NFTs.  When the public sales of this collection kicked off on Dec. 9, 2021, it took just 10 minutes for the whole collection to sell out. Since the drop officially ended, you do not have to join a queue or wait your turn to get your hands on an NFT. Now, you can head to the platform’s secondary market to purchase from collectors that were lucky enough to buy directly from Autograph.  It’s important to note, however, that DraftKings Marketplace is only accessible to people living in Canada and the U.S. Also, you have to register and verify your DraftKings account to buy NFTs on the platform.  Once you have set up an account, all you need to do is deposit funds by using any of the supported deposit methods. The payment methods available to DraftKings Marketplace users are:  Online banking  Credit and debit cards  Paypal  Electronic gift cards  DraftKings gift cards  Looking at the list of supported payment channels, it is clear that DraftKings does not allow crypto purchases at this time. In other words, all orders are processed in fiat currency, more specifically, the U.S. dollar.  How much is a Tom Brady NFT worth?  The initial sales price of each NFT was $80 during the public sales. Understandably, this price is bound to change as collectors look to sell them to buyers on the secondary market for a profit.  Note that the processing fee on the secondary marketplace is 5%, while the royalty fee paid to Autograph is pegged at 10%. In total, each Tom Brady NFT sold on the secondary marketplace will incur a 15% fee, which is deducted from the proceeds of the seller.  For example, if a seller sells a Tom Brady’s NFT for $500 on the secondary marketplace, $75 will be automatically deducted by DraftKings to cover the royalty and commission fees, and the remaining $425 will be paid into the sellers’ account.  At the time of writing, the floor price of Tom Brady’s Origins NFT collection (or the lowest amount required to buy one of the NFTs on the secondary market) is $219. The floor price could potentially increase as buyers start to unveil new NFTs from their mystery boxes.  What is Tom Brady’s Autograph platform?  Autograph enables the creation and collecting of the NFTs of iconic individuals and brands in the sports and entertainment world. Simply put, it partners with icons to digitally monetize their brands by minting and selling limited edition celebrity-themed NFTs.  Since its August launch, the platform has partnered with prominent athletes like Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Tiger Woods and Tony Hawk. Besides Brady and the Rosenblatts, the board of directors includes FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman Fried, Apple’s Eddy Cue, SCS Financial Chairman and founder Peter Mattoon and Discovery Land Company Chairman and founder Michael Meldman.  Weary of the environmental implications of minting NFTs, Autograph has opted for a more environmentally-friendly blockchain infrastructure called Polygon. In essence, all of the Autograph NFTs sold on DraftKings Marketplace are based on the Polygon blockchain.

42396302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2fOt,1639607922,Bitcoin’s Decline Suggests Fed’s Hawkish Policy Shift Is Priced In,"Bitcoin appears to have digested the U.S. Federal Reserve’s impending hawkish, or anti-inflation, policy adjustment with a significant decline in recent weeks. Analysts said the cryptocurrency could see a relief rally after the Fed decision, due later on Wednesday.  The central bank is widely expected to announce a $30 billion reduction in asset purchases starting in January, doubling the pace two months prior in a bid to phase out the $120 billion per month program by March. Further, it is likely to signal two rate hikes in 2022.  The hawkish expectations have built up in response to elevated inflation pressures and Chair Jerome Powell’s recent decision to retire the word “transitory” from inflation discussions. Monetary policy tightening is typically considered bearish for assets, including bitcoin – a risk-on inflation hedge and emerging technology.  That said, a significant de-risking has already happened, leaving the door open for a classic “buy the fact” trade or relief rally triggered by a highly anticipated negative announcement.  Bitcoin peaked near $69,000 on Nov. 10 after the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) touched a three-decade high of 6.2% in October, but has since dropped more than 30%. The CPI rose to a four-decade high of 6.8% in November.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies like the euro, pound, and yen, has risen over 2% in the past few weeks, hitting a 16-month high of 96.93.  The two-year Treasury bond yield, which mimics the short-term inflation and interest rate expectations, recently rose to an 18-month high of 0.72%.  Meanwhile, the fed funds futures have pulled forward the timing of the first interest rate hike to May 2022 and priced in at least three hikes for next year.  So, the probability of a deeper sell-off on the Fed announcement is relatively low unless the central bank hints at more aggressive tightening than what’s baked in.  “The Fed is unlikely to come in more hawkish than what the market is expecting,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said. “That leaves the balance of risk tilted to the other side.”  “De-risking in anticipation has been extensive. Many already panic sold. Positioning is light. Therefore, if the Fed were to deliver accelerated taper, signal two hikes for 2022, and nothing else, I would expect a rally across asset classes,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.  Historical data supports the case for a broader crypto market bounce in the final days of December. “We’ve seen this pattern over the past four years -- where the first two weeks of December are very choppy, only to resolve incredibly bullish over the back-half of the month and into the new year,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, said in a weekly markets note published Monday.  Focus on peak rates  With faster taper and three rate hikes priced in, the focus will be on the Fed’s peak interest rate projection.  There is consensus that the impending tightening hike cycle will see rates peak well below the high of 2.5% observed during the previous cycle dated December 2015 to December 2018.  According to Reuters, “Markets are currently priced for a peak of just 1.5%-1.75%, a level that would likely not even top inflation.” Further, bond traders see rates averaging just 1.8% for the next three decades.  So, real or inflation-adjusted returns in the fixed income world are likely to remain negative for a prolonged time, driving yield-hungry investors to crypto. Despite the recent pullback, bitcoin is still up 66% this year.  Bitcoin and risk assets, in general, could take a hit if the Fed’s interest rate projections signal a higher than expected peak.

Balance Sheet Opportunities ETF, trading as VBB on Nasdaq, is long on MicroStrategy, Square, Tesla and other crypto industry bulls. An actively managed thematic ETF, it steers clear of bitcoin futures, sticking only to equities that invest in the coin.  The ETF is the latest example of mainstream financial instruments with a crypto tilt and comes at a time when about $70 billion worth of bitcoin is sitting on corporate balance sheets.  VBB probably won’t command the billion-dollar inflows that U.S. bitcoin futures ETFs garnered in their watershed November debut, Steve McClurg, Valkyrie’s chief investment officer, told CoinDesk. Still, he said the more traditional structure has a “bigger market” to tap.  “Futures mostly appeal to hedge funds and momentum traders,” McClurg said in an interview. “The reality is there’s a lot of financial advisors that can’t actually use it in their platform” in part because of futures market-specific quirks, like contango.

42396304,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2fQr,1639607796,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bounces After Fed Decision; Analysts Expect Sideways Trading,"Bitcoin bounced toward $49,000 on Wednesday as traders reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to accelerate its stimulus withdrawal. Some analysts suggested the Fed decision was already priced in, which means some traders already sold long positions, which created attractive price levels for short-term buyers.  The central bank will reduce its bond purchases by $30 billion every month to wind them down early next year, twice as fast as the current pace of withdrawal of $15 billion every month. Some crypto investors say the $120 billion-a-month program helped to bolster bitcoin’s appeal as an inflation hedge, CoinDesk’s Brad Keoun wrote.  For now, crypto prices are still stabilizing after the sell-off earlier this month. Bitcoin is up about 3% over the past 24 hours, compared to a 4% rise in ether and a 14% rise in Solana’s SOL token over the same period.  “The most likely path forward is more choppy/sideways price action heading into year end, though any major risk-off event or volatility spike that punishes risk assets would likely drag on BTC and the broader crypto market as well,” Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm, wrote in an Wednesday memo.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $49,251, +3.06%  Ether (ETH): $4,057, +5.87%  S&P 500: $4,709, +1.63%  Gold: $1,778, +0.32%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.46%  Bitcoin losses accelerate  During the recent correction, bitcoin holders have experienced an acceleration in realized losses (price declines below their initial cost basis). Oftentimes, negative returns can encourage selling as traders become fearful of further market declines.  “We’re currently observing an acceleration of realized losses among BTC holders, trending above $1 billion daily on two occasions during this correction,” crypto data firm Glassnode wrote in a blogpost.  The BTC price decline from an all-time high around $69,000 triggered a more cautious tone in the market. And the acceleration of realized losses is indicative of nervousness of another sell-off, according to Glassnode.  Despite higher losses, however, blockchain data suggests that some investors continue to hold bitcoin. For example, the balance of BTC on exchanges has continued to decline this year, which could mean investors prefer to hold bitcoin in their wallet instead of making it available for sale on the exchange.

Mainnet refers to a blockchain in production whose products, services and tokens are live in the wild.  The threat detection marketplace will use PolySwarm’s nectar (NCT) token, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain.  Here’s how it works: Users submit their URLs or files to PolySwarm to check for malicious code that could be embedded within such files. An automated engine then runs a search against several other “safe” codes, following which the user-submitted file is either deemed malicious or safe. Transactions for this service are done via nectar tokens, which are additionally rewarded to software partners and customers using PolySwarm.  In the marketplace, security experts will compete with each other to identify and protect users against threats. Those that can correctly identify threats, will be rewarded with nectar tokens. All suppliers and consumers will also need nectar tokens to use the marketplace.  PolySwarm has over 55 engines operating in its marketplace and these include Crowdstrike, Sentinel One and Kaspersky. Some of the company’s largest customers include Microsoft and Verizon, PolySwarm CEO Steve Bassi told CoinDesk.  M&A uptick  The M&A activity in the sector has picked up recently. One of the most notable deals in the sector was the $8 billion acquisition of Avast by NortonLifeLock in August 2021.  Special purpose acquisition company CYBA has signed letters of intent with Narf Industries and PolySwarm. In March 2021, CYBA was listed on the London Stock Exchange to acquire and then act as the holding company for a number of target cyber security businesses.  Read more: Anti-Virus Token?

Grayscale Investments is a digital asset management firm owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.  Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, highlighted the company’s position in a series of Tweets Wednesday.  ”What’s right is right,” Grewal wrote, continuing, “Good on the SEC for permitting futures-based ETPs. But there is no rational basis for disallowing a spot-based ETP while allowing a futures-based ETP – both are reliant on bitcoin’s underlying price.”  ”ETPs reduce discrepancies between trading market prices and underlying asset values through continuous share redemptions and creations. What could do more to advance both the public interest and the Commission’s mission to protect investors?” Grewal added in a tweet.  Coinbase has been vocal about its disagreement with the SEC over the crypto exchange’s lending product.

42420871,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlA5,1639599795,8 Trends That Will Shape Bitcoin Mining in 2022,"If you thought 2021 was a wild ride for crypto mining, you’d better strap yourself in for 2022.  The past year saw one of the biggest shake ups in mining history. Swathes of Chinese miners had to look for new homes due to the most intense regulatory crackdown in the country to date, while an ongoing global chip shortage capped the capacity of new mining machines globally.  But thanks to these developments, North American miners had a stellar year. With China out of the game, and their machine orders already in place, the U.S. and Canada have quickly risen to be the uncontested hashrate capitals of the world.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  As the price of bitcoin hit historic heights, mining profit margins were as high as 90%. The industry entered a “gold rush” period, said Amanda Fabiano, the head of mining at New York based Galaxy Digital, citing the high profitability of the miners.  At the same time, a subtler change took place. “Mining seems to have crossed the line where it was very risky and uncertain,” said Didar Bekbau, co-founder and CEO of Kazakhstan-based miner Xive. The global industry is now becoming more like traditional business, where risk is lower and investors are throwing money in and are ready to wait two or three years to get their return, he added.  However, the landscape for the digital asset mining industry in 2022 is shaping up to change significantly once again, as the delay in supply of new mining rigs starts to normalize and competition becomes more intense.  “As more miners enter the sector, margins will likely shrink, particularly for new entrants, as long as the bitcoin price stays stagnant,” Fabiano added.  With competition ramping up next year, some miners will start to feel the margin squeeze, leading to potential for increased mergers and acquisitions. “I think there’s going to come a time, in the not too distant future, where there are companies that have raised money, have machines on order and have not deployed them yet that are in a cash crunch,” said Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners.  “When that happens, you get some very interesting opportunities, because now you don’t have to integrate a company; you’re just acquiring their assets,” he added.  To be sure, this is not bad news for the industry in the long term. More consolidation and competition will not only make the industry more mature but will also help usher in the age of more efficient mining operations and incentivize use of more renewable sources of power.  “With the overall expansion of market boundaries, such a positive feedback mechanism will elevate the bitcoin mining industry to a more competitive and dynamic stage,” said Edward Lu, senior vice president of Canaan, one of the industry’s largest manufacturers of bitcoin mining machines.  Hashrate doubling  It’s unanimous; the hashrate for the Bitcoin network will increase significantly next year. Some estimates project it will double as more miners join the network. The hashrate is a measure of computational resources used to conduct mining activities and secure the Bitcoin blockchain, and it is an important metric of competition.  Read more: What Does Hashrate Mean and Why Does It Matter?  Along with new entrants, Chinese miners who exited the region have been coming back online outside of China and will continue to do so next year. This will add to the hashrate and consequently the difficulty of the network, according to April Luo, an institutional sales representative for Asia at BlockFi, a company that provides structured financial products to miners and also started mining colocation with Blockstream.  Echoing the sentiment, Juri Bulovic, vice president of strategy at Foundry, the Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary focused on mining and crypto staking, said that “mining difficulty will continue to increase and will exceed the previous all-time high next year, as miners continue to expand their operations, but also due to the increased efficiency of the latest generation of mining machines.” (CoinDesk is also a subsidiary of DCG.)  In fact, some industry participants are calling for hashrate reaching within the range of 300-350 exahash/second (EH/s) by the end of next year, which will be 70%-100% higher compared to around 179 EH/s as of Dec. 14, according to data from analytics firm Glassnode.  One such observer is Rob Chang, CEO of bitcoin miner Gryphon Mining, who thinks it’s possible for the hashrate to reach 300 EH/s by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer of Bitfarms, expects the hashrate to be between 300 and 350 EH/s by the end of next year. Bekbau of Xive also anticipates the hashrate doubling in 2022.  However, Bitmain-backed mining platform BitFuFu’s CEO Leo Lu doesn’t expect the uptick to kick in until March, because miners in Kazakhstan will likely continue to face power rationing while the build-out of new operations in the U.S. and Russia will slow down over winter. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are intensifying their crackdown in the country and are actively blocking mining pools.  Read more: Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power Shortages  Margin compression  As the hashrate and difficulty increases, miners will have to try harder to remain profitable, as long as there are no dramatic fluctuations in the price of bitcoin.  “If our top end scenario of 300 EH/s comes to pass, the effective doubling of the global hashrates would mean that mining rewards will be cut in half,” Gryphon’s Chang said.  As competition eats away at the high margins of the miners, companies that can keep their costs low and are able to operate with efficient machines will be the one that will survive and have a chance at thriving.  “Miners with low costs and efficient machines will be best positioned while those operating older machines will feel the pinch more than others,” Chang added.  New miners will be especially affected by smaller margins – and there are a lot of them. Power and infrastructure are among the key cost considerations for miners. New entrants have a harder time securing cheap access to these, due to a lack of connections and increased competition over resources.  “We anticipate that the inexperienced players will be the ones to experience lower margins,” said Danni Zheng, vice president of crypto miner BIT Mining, citing costs like electricity and data center construction and maintenance.  Miners like Argo Blockchain will strive for ultra-efficiency while growing their operations. Given increased competition, “we have to be smarter about how we grow,” said Argo Blockchain’s CEO Peter Wall.  “I do think that we’re in this kind of super cycle that is different from previous cycles but we still have to keep our eye on the prize, which is being very efficient and having access to low-cost power,’’ Wall added.  Rise in M&A  As winners and losers emerge from the hashrate wars, larger, more capitalized companies will likely gobble up smaller miners who struggle to keep pace.  Marathon’s Thiel expects such consolidation to pick up in the middle of 2022 and beyond. He also expects his company Marathon, which is well capitalized after raising nearly $700 million, to grow aggressively next year. This could mean acquiring smaller players or continuing to invest in its own hashrate.  Hut 8 Mining, which recently closed a $173 million public offering of common shares, is ready to follow the same playbook. “We’re cashed up and we’re ready to go, regardless of which way the market turns next year,” said Sue Ennis, head of investor relations for the Canadian miner.  Other than large miners, it’s also possible that big entities, such as power companies and data centers, may want to join the buying spree, if the industry becomes more competitive, and miners face the margin crunch, according to Argo’s Wall.  Several such traditional companies have already entered the mining game in Asia, including Singapore-based real estate developer Hatten Land and Thai data center operator Jasmine Telekom Systems. Malaysian miner Hashtrex’s Gobi Nathan told CoinDesk that “corporations around Southeast Asia are looking to set up large-scale facilities in Malaysia next year.”  Similarly, Europe-based Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group, sees a trend for cross-sector investments in mining in Europe and Russia. Companies are seeing that bitcoin mining can subsidize other parts of their business and improve their overall bottom line, Rusinovich said.  In Russia, the trend is apparent with energy producers, whereas in continental Europe, there tend to be small mines that integrate waste management with mining or take advantage of small bits of stranded energy, he added.  Cheap power and ESG  Access to cheap power has always been one of the main pillars of a profitable mining business. But as the criticism around mining’s impact on the environment has grown, it is all the more important to secure renewable sources of energy to stay competitive.  “We think more mining businesses will follow the trend of carbon-neutral or renewable-powered mining next year as ESG [environmental, social and governance] compliance continues to be a must for most tech companies,” said Igor Runets, CEO of BitRiver, a hosting provider for green cryptocurrency mining.  Read more: Crypto’s Carbon Footprint Could Hinder Adoption: Deutsche Bank  Miners are already leaning toward securing sustainable power sources, including solar, wind, hydro and nuclear, for their operations to reduce their carbon footprint.  A recent survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry forum, found that 58% of the total energy used in crypto mining globally during the third quarter of this year was sustainable, up 3% from the second quarter. The increase is partly due to the rapid expansion of North American mining amid the exodus from China, and miners rotating toward more sustainable energy and modern mining techniques.  Read more: China Crypto Bans: A Complete History  As mining becomes more competitive, “energy-saving solutions would be a game-determining factor,” said Arthur Lee, founder and CEO of Saitech, an Eurasia-based, clean-energy driven digital asset mining operator.  “The future of crypto mining would be empowered and sustained by clean energy, which is the shortcut towards carbon neutrality and a key to alleviating worldwide electricity shortage whilst improving miners’ return on investment,” Lee added.  In addition, there are likely going to be more energy efficient miners, such as Bitmain’s latest Antminer S19 XP, that will also come into play, which will make the businesses run more efficiently and have less impact on the environment.  However, efforts toward a more sustainable business model for the mining sector shouldn’t just be limited to more environmentally friendly mining but should also include the “social” part of ESG. With more new miners entering states such as Georgia, Texas and New York, community engagement in these regions will be even more important heading into the next year, according to Zach Bradford, CEO of bitcoin miner CleanSpark.  Read more: Why Shouldn’t the Navajo Mine Bitcoin?  “I think that community involvement is going to be incredibly important [in 2022]. You’re either going to be in with the community that you’re in or you’re going to be on outs,” he said. “Especially with some of the non-U.S. groups that are coming in, I think they’re going to have a harder time than U.S. domiciled companies,” he added.  Fast money versus value investors  One of the main reasons many new players are flocking to the crypto mining sector is due to its high margins as well as support from the capital markets. The mining sector saw a slew of IPOs and new funding from institutional investors this year. As the industry becomes more mature, the trend is expected to continue in 2022.  “Capital markets will continue looking to deploy capital in bitcoin and miners,” Bitfarms’ Gagnon said. He noted that so far it seems that initial fundraising (pre-IPO) is significantly easier for investors in the sector, as many are looking for a quick flip. However, the outlook for long-term value investors is still unknown, as it remains a largely untapped market, he added.  Currently investors are using miners as a proxy investment for bitcoin. But as institutions are becoming more experienced, they will change how they invest in mining, according to Gryphon’s Chang. “We are noticing that they are focusing more on the things institutional investors traditionally place a lot of emphasis on, which are namely: quality management, experienced execution and companies that act like blue chip organizations [established companies] as opposed to stock promoters,” he said.  But as more traditional finance looks to dabble in crypto mining, the higher the scrutiny of the sector. “It’s not so rosy. It’s a positive development in the sector, but we should pay attention to these other developments,” such as short-seller interest, Rusinovich said.  Another trend that is likely to grow among the miners is the shift towards structured financial products, as they increasingly try to lock in margins, generate additional income from their mined coins and hedge the rise in competitive landscape, according to BlockFi’s Luo.  Supply chain: The big uncertainty  A conversation about crypto miners’ outlook wouldn’t be complete without assessing the supply-chain issues that have been a big constraint for the industry this year and are likely to spill into 2022.  “The chip shortage is one of the defining supply chain issues of 2021,” said Philip Salter, chief technology officer of Genesis Digital Assets. (Note: Genesis Digital Assets is different from Genesis, the crypto lending firm owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)  Driven by Covid-19′s impact on global trade, as well as rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, the global chip shortage has impacted 169 industries, from cars to soap manufacturing.  Bitcoin miner Blockware Mining Inc.’s CEO Michael Stoltzner explained that before 2021, mining rig orders placed directly with manufacturers would be delivered within six weeks. Now, only large orders are confirmed in the first place, and manufacturer’s order books are filled well into 2022 and even 2023.  Blockware Mining has navigated these issues by planning ahead and determining the best way to negate the supply-chain challenges for miners that are looking to ramp up production.  However, the industry is divided on whether the chip shortage issue will be resolved heading into 2022.  “My hope is that supply chains are going to get better, probably mid-year, call it June, July,” said CleanSpark’s Bradford. He thinks that, right now, the squeeze in the supply chain is more pronounced given there is higher priority for holiday-related shipping.  If the supply chain issues get resolved next year, the smaller and newer companies that are feeling the brunt of the challenges currently will be able to enter the industry swiftly and compete with the larger miners, said Jonathan Manzi, the CEO and co-founder of Beyond Protocol, a blockchain technology company.  On the flip side, Gryphon’s Chang expects the supply chain bottleneck to last until at least mid-2023, as the chip manufacturers have stated that the global semiconductor shortage will extend through to 2023. And when chip manufacturers are eventually able to resume normal supply, the larger industries, such as cell phones, medical equipment and transportation, will be first in line before bitcoin miners get their fill, he added.  But other than the availability of rigs, where to put them will increasingly be a bottleneck. Both BitFuFu and BlockFi identified rack space as a major constraint for the coming year; BlockFi’s Luo specifically highlighted this problem within the U.S.  The second life of rigs  Following the China mining shutdown and consequent migration, thousands of mining rigs were abandoned in the country. While many have already been shipped overseas, others have yet to be snatched up in second hand markets and deployed.  Some miners will find opportunity in this secondhand market in 2022, even if the rigs don’t have the latest technology. “It clearly offers a lot of opportunity for some players ... to develop their hashrate,” Rusinovich said, adding that “people were already saying for a couple of years that S9s were out [of the game], but they are still around.”  In the future, the latest mining rigs will be first deployed in regions with “stable laws and regulations as well as developed infrastructures,” like the U.S. and Europe, BitFuFu said.  Meanwhile, inferior rigs from these countries will then flow to Kazakhstan, Southeast Asia and other crypto-friendly places with less-developed infrastructures. Old mining rigs will be installed in Russia and Africa, facing a certain level of policy and regional risks. All these can create new opportunities.  “It’s a matter of risk, you don’t want to send a S19j pro to a certain country where they might disappear or be turned off,” but an S9 that costs much less is an easier loss to stomach, said Alejandro de la Torre, founder of ProofofWork.Energy consulting firm.  New technologies in mining  As efficient mining becomes a more important tool in order for miners to stay ahead of the competition, companies will increase their focus on not just better mining computers but new innovative technologies to maximize their overall profit. Currently the miners are leaning toward using technology such as immersion cooling to boost the performance and lower the cost of mining without having to buy additional computers.  “Aside from reducing power consumption and noise pollution, the immersion liquid-cooled miner occupies significantly less space, with neither pressure fans, water curtains nor water-cooled fans needed to achieve a better heat dissipation effect,” Canaan’s Lu said.

Most recently, CleanSpark bought 20-megawatt-powered immersion cooling infrastructure for its Norcross, Georgia, bitcoin mining facility and is aiming to increase its mining efficiency by over 20%.  Riot Blockchain, one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners, also said in October that it plans to increase its mining hashrate up to 50% by using 200 megawatts of immersion-cooling technology at its Whinstone facility in Texas.

42393989,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdUR,1639596172,Why Corporate America Is Getting NFTs All Wrong,"Every corporate marketing department in America (and beyond) seems to be piling onto the NFT craze. But sadly for them, most have little impact and are making those businesses seem less relevant rather than the reverse.  Janine Yorio is the co-founder and CEO of Republic Realm, one of the most active investors in and developers of the metaverse real estate ecosystem.  That’s because every NFT project from Adidas to Campbell’s Soup to Budweiser follows a nearly identical format:  Announce an upcoming non-fungible token project  Declare that yours will be different from all the others because you spent more money or have a slightly different idea or it is the first of its kind in your industry  Launch an NFT project that is low risk and non-specific and doesn’t really make anybody feel anything at all  Desperately attempt to publicize the crap out of it  Culture Week is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2022 series, which also includes Policy Week and Future of Money Week.  For the following one to three days, a handful of media outlets will write about it and Twitter may explode with sentiment (though oftentimes, indifference), but then afterwards, nobody will care – not the press, not the company and not its customers.  So why do corporate marketing departments continue to launch these uninspiring NFT projects? Partly because they are afraid to take risks, but more likely because they don’t thoroughly understand NFTs. As their CEO nudges them to “do something in NFTs,” they react impulsively and kick off a project in earnest. Mostly they do it just because everybody else is doing it.  Here are a few things companies need to know to avoid the most common mistakes.  1. How an NFT looks matters very, very little.  Designing an NFT project should center around things like scarcity, innovation and community, but the actual NFT used to designate that community is arguably the least important thing to be designed, and definitely should not be the first or even a primary focus.  Take, for example, some of the generative art projects like Squiggles. To the untrained eye, the artistry of the NFT appears to be thin or non-existent, but to those in the inner circle it is known to be an NFT project of special pedigree. The artistry of the art is not what makes a squiggle valuable.  2. A successful NFT project starts with its community first, built around issues and an identity that the community cares about.  Successful NFT projects start from the ground up, and not top down. Communities aren’t about companies; they are about ideas that bring people together, people who otherwise might not meet except in these NFT communities.  The Toadz project, for example, started as the opposite of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC-see below), with a more open and inclusive vibe and an explosively growing online community. The community loved this ethos, and so when Toadz did its first drop a few weeks ago, they sold out quickly. Toadz NFTs are not great art – far from it! – but their developers mastered the community aspect before launching the project.  3. NFTs are social currencies that are important to specific communities.  Owning an NFT connotes value and understanding to a very narrowly defined community that others do not understand.  In the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project, an NFT profile picture project based around 10,000 ape cartoons of different rarities, the art itself is quite ugly, but that’s precisely the point. The art is designed intentionally to be a deterrent to people who don’t know or understand. It’s an insiders’ club, and one has to be inside to understand the joke. Being an insider in BAYC means either getting in so early one was able to buy at an affordable price or so wealthy that one is comfortable spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy an ape at current prices.  Both of these people have intense social currency among the NFT crowd, hence, owning a BAYC ape has become a massive symbol of social status. That status has absolutely nothing to do with the artistic merit of the ape.  4. Metaverse-native brands are currently more valuable than existing corporate brands in this new arena.  In the metaverse, RTFKT’s virtual sneakers sell for a higher price than existing footwear titans like Nike or Adidas. In fact, big corporations are antithetical to the entire ethos of crypto. There is a whole new virtual world in which their brand equity is not yet as valuable as it is in the real world.  These companies refuse to believe it, so they all keep making the same mistake thinking their highly recognizable real-world brand will legitimize the entire space. What they fail to realize is that the NFT and metaverse space is already legitimate, and they are the outsiders. Big corporations are the newbies and risk being tossed from this enthusiastic ecosystem that is highly tolerant of new ideas and quirky projects, but resents big corporations throwing their weight around.  5. NFT projects reward that which is very specific.  Corporations lean toward the generic or else go too far at being quirky that it feels inauthentic. The crypto community is perceptive, and will pick up on this in genuine effort and label it as either a corporate money grab or a lame attempt at seeming relevant. Companies should think about what makes their brand truly unique and cult-like and need to focus on what those superusers want from an affiliation with its product. From there, it should decide if that is a theme it can use to build a base for its NFT community.  6. NFT projects need an ever-evolving roadmap.  Dropping an NFT project with no future plans won’t inspire the community to participate and will instead invite criticism that the project is just a corporate money grab or a cheap marketing ploy. Sophisticated NFT buyers will see right through that. The best NFT projects are constantly evolving, adding layers and nuance to their existing projects and listening to the needs and wants of their community.  7. Not all products should have their own NFT project.  In fact, most products should never have an NFT. There are lots of other creative things that can be done that signal an understanding of the metaverse and NFT ecosystem. Dropping an NFT for a product that is too far outside the NFT fold doesn’t make sense and is probably a waste of time for building brand equity.  8. Most marketing agencies don’t really understand NFT projects either.  Companies should ask any agency pitching about an NFT project to explain their favorite NFT project and what attributes their favorite projects share. Ask to see their OpenSea wallet to see how many NFTs they own and to describe their favorites. Ask what they think of the metaverse and how they envision building a lasting and valuable NFT project that fosters a community that supports your brand. And if they pitch on selling or air-dropping still or video images of the company’s product, run in the other direction.  9. Good NFT projects take time.  The NFT market is saturated. The next wave of NFT projects will be a mix of forgettable derivative projects and also highly innovative and game-changing projects.

42411619,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4oI,1639595973,Web 3 Is More Than Fun and Games; It’s for Work,"If work and personal culture are to truly flourish online, then our digital spaces need to have the same assurances of privacy and security we can expect in our offline lives. Centralized companies and databases have proven at best inadequate on this score – and some have been seriously detrimental. But the decentralized tech being built and adopted today presents a better alternative.  Remote work requires a set of tools for communication, information sharing and project management, but we are already seeing the dire consequences of these tools in regard to individual privacy and organizational security – which are overlapping sets. On the one hand, the most popular online platforms for video conferencing, data sharing and project management, like Zoom and Slack, have proven themselves shockingly insecure, with fresh vulnerabilities surfacing in the wake of each new patch or “feature.”  David Chaum is a legendary cryptography, privacy advocate and founder of xx network. This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  On the other hand, large-scale breaches of databases maintained by corporations and government agencies were already becoming ever more frequent well before the e-commerce explosion of the last 20 months. As long ago as 2017, someone in America would experience identity theft every two seconds.  The list of organizations that experienced significant breaches in 2019-20 is staggering. Microsoft was breached twice, Facebook thrice and hackers gained access to 1 billion records kept by Oracle-owned web-tracking giant BlueKai. Elsewhere in the private sector, LabCorp, Princess Cruises, GoDaddy and Nintendo were all hacked, while countless public agencies – including the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency – have also been targeted. And that’s just the U.S. All in all, since 2019 over 16 billion records on individuals have been exposed in breaches worldwide – that we know about.  Much harder to track, because organizations are understandably reluctant to disclose them, are the security breaches due to corporate espionage, exposing proprietary information ranging from chemical formulae, software code and production process details to strategic analyses, business plans and HR issues. The same is true of government agencies – including, recently, the FBI.  As more and more intra-organizational communication happens over the internet and cellular networks rather than through firewalled internal systems, all these risks will continue to grow.  Back in the 1980s, as the internet was getting off the ground, a few people, myself included, saw some of this coming. We anticipated the compilation of huge databases on individuals that could be linked by universal identifiers like social insurance numbers, the vulnerability of internet traffic to hacking and the dangers of ultra-centralized information systems generally.  One thing even fewer of us knew at the time was that the internet was designed to be insecure. When Vinton Cerf of Bell Labs proposed to add cryptographic security to the packet headers of the original TCP/IP protocol he co-designed, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, a publicly-funded research and development hub) forbade him to do so. It required a more secure header design for their own communications.  Nor did we clearly foresee that hyper-detailed information about individuals would become the star commodity of the Internet Age. Gathered first by credit companies and later by websites, search engines and social media companies, this personal information is not only sold to advertisers and political groups but also provided on demand to government agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA) and FBI – and of course leaked to bad actors of all kinds via hacking and human error.  We’ve already seen many attempts to patch vulnerabilities in the existing global informational ecosystem fail, and given the growth of online life and work, this is bound to continue. But even among these troubling truths, there is good news. The technical means exist to go beyond patching, which is the informational equivalent of installing carbon-capture systems on new fossil-fuel combustion in the age of runaway global warming.  See also: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data  What if your emails and all other messaging could not only be end-to-end encrypted but protected from the gathering of metadata about who you communicate with and when? What if you could make digital cash payments in complete anonymity but could always, inalienably, reveal the identity of the payee?  What if blockchain-based, democratically managed networks could reach quantum-secure consensus in fractions of a second, allowing decentralization, including dapps (decentralized apps), to go truly global? What if the core business model of the Big Tech companies became within a few years as archaic as broadcast TV? The technologies to bring this new digital world are here and are being implemented, right now.  If “Web 3″ is to be more than a catchphrase associated with the vaporware of the “metaverse” and the efforts of certain large companies to rebrand themselves in the wake of scandal after scandal, it must mean real decentralization on a global scale. And that in turn means rebuilding the internet from the ground up. Web 3 must be built on the foundation of Web 2 – truly decentralized, truly protective of individual privacy and freedom, truly quantum-secure and truly democratically run.

42411611,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4R9,1639595485,Can NFT Art Survive Its Own Addiction to Elitism?,"As part of our Culture Week coverage, members of CoinDesk’s Layer 2 team have been comparing notes about our experiences of non-fungible token art events in New York and elsewhere over the past year.  One theme has been the prevalence of closed-door events – and equally closed-door attitudes. There are entire NFT gallery shows restricted to people who’ve already shelled out tens of thousands of dollars or more. One member of our team, comically, was yelled at just for walking a bit too close to the front door of an NFT event he wasn’t even aware was happening. The emergent industry seems really, really fixated on keeping out the riff-raff, and making sure you know about it.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  To many readers, this might sound like how the “real” art world already functions – as an exclusive club only for the wealthy. That’s certainly how art galleries tend to look on TV and in movies. Because many people involved in NFT-land don’t have much background in the art industry, I suspect some of this emphasis on “exclusivity” is based on these secondhand notions.  I’m intimately familiar with the highest heights of the New York fine art industry, through close personal connections and half a decade of haunting galleries in Chelsea and Brooklyn. And I can tell you, closed and exclusive events are NOT how the art world works. And the NFT industry’s imitation of a television caricature of “art galleries” may hurt it in the long run.  Even the very hottest New York galleries – places like, let’s say, David Zwirner – hold public openings that are not only entirely free, but usually even have free booze to entice people in the door. Before the coronavirus pandemic, it was common, even predictable, to see some disheveled-looking chancer stroll into a high-end art opening, take a cursory, performative glance at a few paintings, then surreptitiously fill a backpack with free beers before heading back out into the street. They’re basically never hassled about it.  That accessibility is great in terms of fairness, justice and equity. There are plenty of activists pushing for more accessibility in art, arguing that it’s part of a universal human legacy. They would unquestionably have a fit over the exclusivity and barriers in place in the world of NFTs.  But let’s just throw justice and equity out the window for a moment. Fine art gallerists aren’t in it for their health, or even really to benefit humanity. These are for-profit operations, and ultimately they’re willing to let in any rando off the street not because it’s the right thing to do, but because it helps them make money.  Most immediately, a public event is far more likely to capture an ineffable moment of bustle, liveness and excitement – all of which help motivate people to buy art. The young and/or broke people who have nowhere near $20K to drop on a painting provide a kind of assurance that there is inherent value to a piece. They’re there to tell rich people, who sometimes have little or no taste of their own because they’ve spent their lives making money and not doing much else, that a piece of art is Actually Good.  (That $20k, by the way, is very roughly what it costs to get a unique physical object hand-crafted by some of the top artists working right now. Keep that in mind as you watch NFTs of algorithmically generated cartoons sell for piles of ETH worth millions.)  On the other hand, you fill a room with people made of money, all of them with a financial stake in what’s going on, and every performance of being impressed or interested by the art itself immediately feels affected and stilted. If no one is walking around looking at the art as art, to demonstrate the pure pleasure of an image or object or an algorithm, it all starts to look like Potemkin Pokemon very fast.  That’s just the short-term upside of inclusivity, though. The real returns come on the back end. Because those young, poor outsiders often become influential and powerful, and when you welcome them early on you’re shaping their taste and building long-term loyalties. This is particularly true of artists themselves, who are generally just as broke as the stereotypes would suggest, but have real collective power to set the agenda for what’s cool – and in turn, what’s valuable.  One of the best examples here is the work that emerged out of New York in the 1980s, by folks like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring or (my personal favorite) The RAMM:ELL:ZEE. Basquiat in particular started getting paid very early on, but the value collectors saw in his work was completely inseparable from the grassroots scum and villainy that defined New York City in that era. Wall Street traders may have been buying the art, but it was actually about the B-boys, gay club kids, graffiti writers, smacked-out punks and crack dealers who populated cultural nexuses like the Mudd Club or Union Square.  Of course, not all NFTs are primarily about art and its complex dynamics. The Bored Ape Yacht Club shindig during the NFT NYC conference, for instance, was restricted to holders. These “profile pic” NFTs frequently lean into their status as an exclusive club for holders. Maybe there’s value in that – a kind of updated online country club.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  But other NFTs have been promoted substantially by leveraging the idea that “art,” broadly speaking, has produced great investment returns over time. Yet those returns have been the product of a complex and multifaceted apparatus known as the “art industry,” one which has evolved, in its modern form centered on for-profit galleries, over nearly a century.  It turns out that the long-term value of art, financially as well as culturally, is tied up in broader “scenes,” cultural moments that embody something larger than any one piece or artist. These scenes are structured like pyramids, with a small group of wealthy collectors funneling money to a much larger, mostly much less rich group of artists, curators and other workers. But, and this is crucial, the people at the top of the pyramid are themselves dependent on the much larger group of workers and cultural figures – influencers, in the neutered ad-agency newspeak of our fallen age – to affirm the value of what they buy.  NFT art has the potential to become that sort of scene, but to do so it has to open the doors to anyone who wants a free beer. Until then, the whole thing may be much, much more fragile than the velvet ropes and champagne flutes would imply.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH,David Z.

Bitcoin Trading Volume Sharply Drops Off In The Past Week As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the BTC 7-day average trading volume has significantly reduced recently. The &apos;trading volume&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin transacted on the chain during a particular period. When the value of this metric goes down, it means the activity on the chain is falling off. This can imply investors are less interested in trading BTC right now as they are making less movements on the chain. Such a trend may be because investors think the price of the coin will move up soon. And hence they don&apos;t want to move their Bitcoin at the current levels. However, it can also show disinterest in the market. On the other hand, when the trading volume rises, it means more holders are currently shifting their coins around. This kind of trend is usually the ideal ground for big price swings as you need traders for sustaining such moves.

The metaverse refers to the idea of digital worlds that would combine elements of augmented and virtual reality, the internet, gaming, art, culture and social networking – enabled by digital assets and distributed networks. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) play a fundamental role in the metaverse, giving people ownership of their characters, accrued in-game items and virtual land.  According to Hedera’s website, the network is “owned and governed by the world’s leading organizations,” listing among them Google, the electronics maker LG and the Singapore bank DBS.  “The metaverse is the future of human communication, collaboration and commerce,” said MetaVRse co-founder Alan Smithson in the press release.  HBAR token performance  The partnership comes at a time when sales of virtual NFT land on metaverse projects such as Decentraland and The Sandbox totaled over $100 million in the last week of November, according to a report from DappRadar.  Data from Nonfungible.com shows that there has been over $280 million in NFT sales over the last 30 days. That compares with just $18 million in September.  The wave of attention towards virtual worlds began with Facebook’s rebranding to Meta in November. The announcement pushed metaverse-related tokens to all-time highs and garnered attention from large institutions, too.  The Hedera Network’s native token, HBAR, has increased sevenfold year to date. That beats the fivefold gain for Ethereum’s ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, but it lags far behind the much larger gains for other projects, such as the 104-fold increase in Polygon’s MATIC.  The HBAR tokens have a market capitalization of about $4.2 billion, after having been surpassed this year by metaverse-related projects like Decentraland, whose MANA token has risen 35-fold this year to $5.5 billion.  ‘Virtual concerts and galleries’  MetaVrse provides no-code tooling for builders creating digital and interactive experiences. Its use of the Hedera network enables the assets it creates to be owned and traded across marketplaces and platforms of the builder’s choice.  The HBAR Foundation fuels growth of the Hedera ecosystem by providing grants, marketing, business development to developers, startups and organizations building on the Hedera Network. According to the foundation’s website, it has an initial budget of 5.35 billion HBAR tokens worth about $2.5 billion.  The partnership between HBAR Foundation and MetaVRse was launched with a plan to open up opportunities for careers in the metaverse.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Donald Thibeau, co-founder and chief strategy officer at HBAR Foundation, said he is excited to see what will be created with these tools offered, “whether that’s a virtual show room displaying tokenized versions of a new product line or NFTs giving access to virtual concerts and galleries.”  Hedera is a public distributed ledger that utilizes a hashgraph mechanism. Developers use distributed ledgers to build computational trust directly into their applications. Hedera focuses primarily on enterprise usage and offers 10,000 transactions per second and low fees and consumption, according to a blog post by the project.

The artwork by the host of “The Joy of Painting”is one of five inaugural collectibles being sold as non-fungible tokens on Wednesday to mark the launch of Otis House, an auction platform that turns physical collectibles into NFTs.  The Bob Ross NFT is of an Alaskan mountain scene that Ross painted in 1971 during his time in the military before he rose to fame. It was first listed on Tuesday evening, and its current high bid is 1 ETH, or just under $4,000. The physical painting is owned by Otis, which it acquired for the drop.  Otis House is a subsidiary of Otis, a company that sells fractionalized shares of digital and physical collectibles.  A professionally graded LeBron James rookie card, a 1993 Matt Groening “Simpsons” collectible and an original copy of Super Mario Bros 3 are among the other items up for auction, with all five inaugural auctions ending on Dec. 19.  Otis House mints NFTs based on physical items sent in by collectors, which then act as proof of ownership. The collectibles themselves are vaulted and insured by Otis House, which destroys the NFTs when their owners request the physical items be returned.  The NFTs can be traded on public NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea, allowing collectors to transfer ownership of their goods without having to deal with the logistics attached to their storage.  The service functions similar to a vault or lockbox at a bank, but its connection to a blockchain is the latest example of NFT technology in a practical use case.  The concept of merging digital ownership with physical items is gaining traction in certain niche collectible markets. Blockbar, an NFT marketplace founded in June, allows users to trade NFTs of valuable whiskey bottles that represent their real-life equivalents.  “When it comes to really expensive collectibles, a lot of owners prefer to keep them in vaults or safes, even if they’re insured,” Michael Karnjanaprakorn, founder of Otis, told CoinDesk in an interview. “The idea that you’d want to have something to represent the item, like an NFT, only makes sense. It may be new now, but I can imagine it becoming the standard for the larger collectibles world.”  UPDATE (Dec. 16, 23:36 UTC): Added ownership information and updated highest bid in third paragraph.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/15/auction-platform-otis-house-to-sell-the-first-nft-of-a-bob-ross-painting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00618d5176dd7754e96001b3e0115d8acefc70fb-1024x677.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411618,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4hg,1639589025,Why the Marijuana Industry Needs Crypto,"As organized mobs pillage all-cash retail cannabis stores in a wave of violent robberies across the country, the leadership of U.S. Senate just refused to do something to stop it.  If Congress won’t help, it’s time for the cannabis industry to help itself. Cryptocurrencies offer legal cannabis businesses immediate alternatives to both an exclusionary banking system and operating all-cash businesses. We need to adopt them now.  Over the last 25 years, the state-legal cannabis industry has grown exponentially, but banking the proceeds of even a lawful cannabis business is still illegal under federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws. This effectively excludes the industry (and any businesses that serve it) from accessing banking and financial services.  Khurshid Khoja is a principal at Greenbridge Corporate Counsel, a law firm that represents legal cannabis businesses. This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  The industry has struggled to address the rising threat to public safety caused by forcing legal cannabis businesses to go unbanked and self-custody large amounts of cash. With each new state that legalized cannabis, the problem has only grown in scale and geography while Congress has mostly stuck its head in the sand.  While cannabis businesses have always been keenly aware of the threat of armed robbery, the violence employed to carry out these robberies has also grown more organized and audacious, frequently employing heavily armed and organized crews and too often ending in gunfire.  I and other industry advocates (including cannabis business owners, cannabis workers, medical cannabis patients, drug policy reformers and others) have long focused our efforts to address this threat on the reform of banking laws, diligently lobbying lawmakers to pass the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act. Along with other members of the National Cannabis Industry Association, I’ve traveled to Washington, D.C., on a yearly pilgrimage to the halls of Congress in order to educate lawmakers on why banking access is a public safety issue.  As we explained to our members of Congress year after year at these visits, most state-licensed cannabis businesses have experienced being excluded from banking services and/or being abruptly and involuntarily unbanked after obtaining those services. This leaves these businesses in the unenviable position of operating primarily in cash, accepting payments in cash alone, and constantly housing, securing and transporting large amounts of cash every day – making their personnel subject to armed robbery or worse.  But despite years of effort to educate Congress, it has done little to reduce this threat. It has been especially frustrating to see state-legalized businesses (and their individual employees, customers and owners) continue to live under constant threat to their physical and financial well-being year after year from an avoidable risk to public safety. And, unfortunately, Congress just abdicated its duty to address this danger yet again last week, ironically through legislation to fund the defense of our country.  Specifically, Senate leadership refused to include the language of the SAFE Banking Act within the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act – despite entreaties from their colleagues in the House of Representatives (who have now passed the bipartisan SAFE Banking Act, in one form or another, multiple times). With the stroke of a pen, the act would have reduced the incentive to attack these essential businesses, removing the cash-rich honey pots from these stores.  To call this circumstance deeply disheartening doesn’t begin to capture the feelings of desperation and disillusionment at play, especially among already-struggling cannabis retailers. If Congress refuses to help, it’s time to help ourselves. As an industry advocate, I think it’s time to embrace the previously unthinkable – being completely and voluntarily unbanked as an ideal to be attained rather than a circumstance to be avoided.  It behooves the industry (and especially small, minority- and women-owned cannabis businesses) to look outside the traditional financial institutions for secure deposits, business loans, payment processing and other basic financial services. Cryptocurrencies offer the only immediate alternative to operating all-cash businesses, and a practical substitute for the banks that can’t yet service legal cannabis businesses (and for those banks that may choose not to, even after SAFE Banking passes).  Cryptocurrencies hold incredible promise, and not only for providing access to financial services through decentralized finance (DeFi). They have the ability to level the playing field between large, well-capitalized multistate operators (MSOs) on the one hand, and small businesses (including woman- and minority-owned enterprises, and social equity licensees) on the other.  See also: A Former Beauty Queen Raised $12M to ‘Revolutionize’ Cannabis. The Courts Can’t Find Her  The large MSOs can afford access to banking today under the currently effective, highly restrictive and overtly discriminatory FinCEN guidelines, and will pay the exorbitant fees charged by the banks to offset the cost of heightened surveillance needed for AML compliance.  Small businesses cannot access those banking services on relatively comparable terms, or at all. Put differently, while federal law remains unchanged, the biggest banks and their MSO customers have the financial means to get federal regulators to look the other way on their otherwise willful violations of AML laws – but everyone else gets shut out.  While my industry colleagues and I have no intention of abandoning the SAFE Banking Act, it’s been sobering to watch Congress’s purported cannabis champions repeatedly fail to champion public safety. It shouldn’t come as a surprise then if cannabis businesses grow steadily less apprehensive about the prospect of being liberated from the banking system (and the financial surveillance that comes with it), and increasingly more disillusioned about securing future access to financial services through congressional action alone. Cryptocurrency is a viable alternative today, and it’s time for the cannabis industry to help lead its adoption.",POSITIVE,SAFE,BUSINESS | REGULATION | SAFE,Khurshid Khoja,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/15/why-the-marijuana-industry-needs-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3455fddf8faadc01fd74f55404e3b8474e8bfe36-2048x1367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In 2018 he lost in the Republican primary run-off to be South Carolina’s governor.  “Over the past 10 months, my partners and I have built an institutional-grade bitcoin mining company by purchasing the highest quality machines and partnering with industry-leading companies to host these machines,” said Warren, who serves as Gem’s CEO and who co-founded Gem with four other partners.

Nearly 15,000 additional miners will be turned on over the next four months, the company said.  In addition, Gem owns over 32,000 mining machines that are either operational or will be delivered in the near term and won’t require additional capital for full deployment.  The company said it mined 431 bitcoins in the past nine months and has been profitable since February. It also had revenue of $7.8 million and adjusted EBITDA exceeding $6.2 million in November.

Roni Cohen-Pavon is the second high-ranking Celsius executive to be named as a result of an investigation into alleged crypto fraudster Moshe Hogeg. Hogeg has denied the allegations.  Last month, CoinDesk revealed Celsius Chief Financial Officer Yaron Shalem had been arrested as part of the same investigation, having previously worked at Hogeg’s firm, Singulariteam. (Israeli media were unable to name Shalem because of a gagging order imposed by the courts.)  A probe into Cohen-Pavon found he’d registered a company in Israel with Eliran Oved, a convicted money launderer who spent a year in prison in Israel for running an illegal gambling website, Play2bet.com, between 2004 and 2008, the Times of Israel said.  Cohen-Pavon, a former attorney who joined London-based Celsius in September 2020, set up NNY Capital Ltd. on May 5, 2021, with Oved, who later transferred his shares to his wife, Liat Kurtz-Oved, the owner of an Israeli call center that ran the binary options website PlusOption.com, the online newspaper reported.  Presented with these findings, Celsius told the newspaper that it was not required to disclose information about Cohen-Pavon’s side businesses to U.S. regulators.

Tornado Cash, a privacy tool for obfuscating the history of ether (ETH) transactions, announced on Wednesday the launch of Nova, a major upgrade that will take the protocol to sidechain Gnosis Chain, allow for variable deposits and withdrawals and enable privacy-preserving “shielded” transfer of funds deposited into the protocol’s pools.  The protocol currently accounts for over 150,000 ETH in its pools worth $580 million.  On-chain sleuths have been known to tie two accounts to one another based on deposit and withdrawal amounts, and as such the shielded withdrawals and partial withdrawals will help power users retain privacy.  “In Nova, the deposit amount doesn’t have to be equal to withdrawal amount,” said core contributor Roman Semenov. “But if a user deposits, say, 0.1337 ETH and then withdraws 0.1337 ETH it will be kinda obvious for everyone that it’s the same user.”  Additionally, the team envisions the shielded custody transfer as a broad-base upgrade to Ethereum transactions, in that xDai’s network lowers costs and the protocol protects privacy for the addresses involved and the quantities transferred. One of the oldest layer 1 alternatives, xDai is a popular Ethereum sidechain for developers.  “It’s a very convenient feature for private payments, anonymous donations and more,” said Semenov.  Gnosis Chain is the recent result of a merger between Gnosis and xDai, but Semenov says that the process won’t affect Nova’s rollout as “they are careful to not break any apps with migration.”  Read more: xDai Wants a Gnosis Merger to Stay Relevant, but Some Tokenholders Are Crying Foul  A press release provided to CoinDesk said that Nova is the first step towards Tornado Cash v3.  While the team declined to provide a timetable for v3′s release, they said it will include private NFT transfers, support for ERC-20 tokens and an overhaul to the project’s “anonymity mining” rewards structure.

42396321,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2jC2,1639577795,"NFT Music Startup Sound.xyz Raises $5M From a16z, 21 Savage","A buzzy new music startup called Sound.xyz has raised a $5 million seed round, with contributions from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Variant Fund, Li Jin’s Atelier Ventures, a handful of crypto angels and artists like Holly Herndon, 21 Savage and DJ Drama.  Sound’s pitch has to do with helping musicians make a living via crypto – specifically, a set of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) tied to new releases.  “There’s only 7,800 artists that make over $100,000 or more per year [on Spotify],” said Sound co-founder David Greenstein, who built the company in relative secrecy over the course of the past year. “The number for $50,000 or more per year is 13,400. This is before you pay a label, before you pay any bandmates or producers.”  The idea is to target artists with low-to-mid-sized followings, who could potentially use non-fungible tokens to supplement streaming revenue.  Said Greenstein, “If we build for the artists who are making a lot of money on Spotify, it’s 7,500. If we go for the artists that aren’t making sustainable careers, we’re dealing with the 99.9%.”  How Sound works  Artists putting out music through Sound.xyz can offer a limited supply of NFTs to go along with the release. They’re souvenirs, but they also let you leave a comment at a certain moment in a given song. It’s similar to the comment functionality on SoundCloud; when an NFT is traded, a new owner can overwrite the token’s original comment.  The music itself is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, through the decentralized storage provider IPFS, and the NFT contracts are branded with the artists’ names as opposed to the company’s. (Minting an NFT through companies like Foundation or Zora leaves protocol-specific branding on the blockchain – not so with Sound.xyz.)  An alum of the University of Pennsylvania and Y Combinator, Greenstein recruited two co-founders – Vignesh Hirudayakanth and Matt Masurka, better known as the electronic musician Gigamesh – both with technical backgrounds, to set the company in motion this summer.  It’s Greenstein’s second attempt at a music tech startup. The first, an analytics company called StreamReport (now TrendPop), was his Y Combinator moment – he’s described it as a stats-based “Moneyball” approach for discovering new talent. Greenstein also has family ties to the industry. His father, Scott, is the president of Sirius XM Radio, which owns Pandora, where David once worked as a product manager.  Music NFT experiments  For the past few weeks, Sound has been selling NFTs through a set of curated “drops” – 25 comments-as-tokens tied to a single, each priced at .1 ETH (around $400). There’s also a feature called the “golden egg,” where one of the 25 collectors is randomly designated to receive an additional one-of-one token.  Oshi, Marian Hill and one-time Kanye collaborator Allan Kingdom are among the seven musicians Sound has featured so far; all seven sold their full supply of NFTs in less than a minute.  A caveat is that Greenstein and his co-founders are currently hand-selecting the artists for these drops. Unlike SoundCloud, Sound.xyz doesn’t let artists upload their own music to the site – at least not yet.  “The last thing that we want is people to be DMing us about how to get on Sound,” said Greenstein. “And we’re very much exploring how to figure out a more scalable way to onboard new artists that is completely permissionless from our end. As for why we haven’t done that already: one, we’re brand new, and two, we’re an insanely small team.”  Sound is less than a year old, but its ambitions are grand. It eventually plans to push even harder on its “listening party” NFT drops, in an effort to make the experience of buying a token feel like buying a piece of merch at a live concert.  “I think when you mix the nerds and the culture, you get really powerful results,” said Greenstein. “The goal is to help as many artists as possible – maybe a million – live off their music.”  Disclosure: Greenstein attended the same high school as the author, but in a different class.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/15/nft-music-startup-soundxyz-raises-5m-seed-round-from-a16z-21-savage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/067f75e831d03872ddd15f8f03abc4caa4ea0045-3983x2655.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The apps are available on the Apple App Store and Google Play.  “We’re bringing a lot of the same benefits of centralized VPN, but in an open-source, peer-to-peer network where people are offering bandwidth and earning income for offering that resource to the network,” said Exidio co-founder and CEO Dan Edlebeck in an interview with CoinDesk. “And anyone that’s connected to the VPN network is actually getting a provably encrypted connection because there’s no middleman.”  The apps are built on the Sentinel network, a peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace that went live earlier this year on the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. Developers can use the network to build dVPN applications that tap into the Sentinel marketplace.  Users can make payments via DVPN, the native cryptocurrency of the Sentinel network, or with a debit or credit card. The pay-as-you-go pricing ranges from $1.99 to $19.99 depending on bandwidth needs.  Exidio’s future plans include launching desktop applications and a supply side-focused app that allows users to offer bandwidth and start earning income, Edlebeck told CoinDesk. There’s also a plan to launch a hardware router for easily offering excess bandwidth.

42396324,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2jE0,1639576800,CardCoins Offers Bitcoin Payments Over the Lightning Network,"CardCoins, a website that lets users trade prepaid gift cards for bitcoin, now offers users the choice to receive their BTC over the Lightning Network.  The Wyoming-based startup says this new option opens up a new speedy way for users to pay for Bitcoin with cash. Most methods of purchasing bitcoin, such as buying at an online exchange like Coinbase or Kraken, require a credit card or bank account. CardCoins users can buy the required pre-paid gift cards with cash at over 80,000 stores across the U.S.  The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment that aims to significantly improve Bitcoin’s often frustrating mainchain experience by making payments faster, cheaper and more scalable. While Lightning payments are not as widely accepted as normal bitcoin payments, it’s on the uptick.  Now that bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador, some companies there such as McDonalds are accepting payments sent via Lightning. As of last summer, popular paid newsletter platform Substack began to accept the novel form of payment. Twitter even lets users tip others with Lightning.  Read more: How to Send Bitcoin Tips on Twitter  Providing financial access to the unbanked  For CardCoins, adding Lightning support is a matter of ensuring that their users still have an option to buy bitcoin on their platform when transaction fees are high – which is an inevitability if the number of people using Bitcoin continues to grow. The Lightning Network, built on top of Bitcoin, has much less expensive fees.  “Our users make a lot of low value payments, and as fees in the Bitcoin network rise they risk being priced out. With CardCoins’ new Lightning integration, our customers can top up their Lightning balances and make payments without additional on-chain transactions,” a CardCoins representative told CoinDesk. A normal Bitcoin transaction, which is typically more expensive than Lightning, is what’s known as an “on-chain” transaction.  Some of CardCoins’ customers rely on their services, and Lightning can help make sure the service stays cheap even when fees swell. “As a business that primarily serves the unbanked and cash-preferred demographics, it’s imperative that our customers can participate directly in the Lightning Network,” the representative added.  CardCoins is also a possible method of buying “non-KYC” bitcoin for users interested in preserving their privacy. CardCoins requires identifying information to a degree, as the company’s compliance policy explains. But for users exchanging up to $500 a week, only a phone number is required. For the privacy-minded, it’s possible to add a number that isn’t strictly tied to an ID.  How to buy bitcoin with cash  What’s the process exactly? Once a user buys a Visa, Mastercard or American Express non-reloadable prepaid gift card, which are available at CVS, Walgreens, and other large U.S. retail stores, they can use the CardCoins website to trade it for bitcoin over the Lightning Network.  You’ll notice the price of bitcoin on CardCoins is more expensive than it is on most exchanges. That’s because CardCoins builds in a fee into the price for providing their service.  Read more: How Can I Buy Bitcoin?  In order to successfully send the gift card to CardCoins, the user needs to enter how much the gift card is worth, a phone number, the gift card identifying numbers, and photos of the gift card. The process is described in more detail on the CardCoins website.  On the payment page, it’s now possible to enter a Lightning invoice to accept a Lightning payment. An invoice is a long string of random characters making up a unique address that a Lightning payment can be sent to. It’s kind of like a temporary credit card number,  Users can use a Lightning wallet like Breez or Phoenix (or any of a range of other wallets) to accept their bitcoin payment.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/15/cardcoins-offers-bitcoin-payments-over-the-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/185ade31b8e32b0e49cf8f002f85289e7afa945f-3676x2451.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report comes as the Indian government is looking to introduce a crypto bill that will reportedly ban most private cryptocurrencies. But first it needs to be approved by the ruling Cabinet and then the parliament. However, recent reports suggest that this process could be delayed by several weeks.  CIS has previously been part of a group that delved into the “Right to Privacy” in India. The Supreme Court of India also cited CIS research during the landmark judgment on “Right to Privacy.”  Interim suggestions  As an interim solution, the report recommends reiterating that crypto is not legal tender and then taking “steps to classify crypto-assets under the existing financial framework.”  Another interim recommendation is to give existing financial regulators, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) jurisdiction over crypto-assets. For example, classifying crypto-assets as derivatives to grant SEBI jurisdiction, so the regulator could make its existing know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules applicable to crypto exchanges.  SEBI could also decide to classify crypto as collective investment schemes, which would lead to crypto exchanges issuing SEBI-compliant crypto assets, the report says. Similarly, crypto can also be notified as derivates giving RBI jurisdiction, the report adds.  Long-term recommendations  As a long-term measure, the report recommends that since crypto assets do not fit into any of the existing classifications of financial instruments they need to be regulated through “a specific and standalone regulatory framework.”  The report strongly recommends a specific regulatory structure for stablecoins, one that is held to a higher regulatory standard than other crypto assets. Additionally, the recommendations lean on global consensus on stablecoin regulation that rules applicable to stablecoins should be similar to the rules applicable to banks.  Blockchain regulation  Only crypto assets, not the underlying technology, should be regulated, CIS said in the report. This would allow for further innovation, the report adds.  This is in line with the narrative from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Last week, Modi said that “We must also jointly shape global norms for emerging technologies like social media and cryptocurrencies so that they are used to empower democracy, not to undermine it.”  The report also suggests a license and registration system for companies that are involved in crypto-related businesses, which would allow state governments to effectively monitor them. Limitations on crypto mining and appropriate taxation were also part of the report’s recommendations.  One of the key recommendations is the establishment of a separate body to oversee and research changes in the crypto market, which would then make recommendations to RBI or SEBI, whichever becomes the eventual regulator.

42390141,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUtbuF,1639573279,Mobile Bitcoin Gaming Is Powering Up on Lightning,"A new game will soon drop in the App Store. You are a cat – a cute cat, a cartoon cat – who flings items like fish, seashells and golden stars into the sky. Your goal is to smash targets.  I tested the game, called Thndr Bay, while it was still in beta. In the spirit of games like Candy Crush, it’s a bit mindless yet oddly addictive, and it serves the usual purpose of putting off work.  But the game has a twist.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Culture and Entertainment Week.  When you finish each level you win purple tickets, and these tickets automatically enroll you in a daily raffle that doles out free bitcoin. The day after I first played my game, I opened Thndr Bay and learned that I had just won 20 satoshi, or roughly $.01. Finally, at long last, I’m leveraging my journalism to get rich in crypto.  I might have only won a penny, but each month, 50,000 users are regularly playing other games from Thndr (the developer of Thndr Bay), such as Turbo 84 and Bitcoin Bounce, to “stack Sats.” Zebedee, another bitcoin gaming company, said 50,000 people have downloaded a mobile game called SaruTobi. These numbers are tiny compared to the 1.8 million daily users of Axie Infinity, but there are some in the space who see the rise of mobile bitcoin gaming – especially in a “normal” ecosystem like the App Store – as key to spurring global bitcoin adoption.  “Mobile games are the most frictionless way for people to onboard into bitcoin,” said Desiree Dickerson, the new CEO of Thndr. “Nothing feels safer than going to the App Store or the Google Play store. Everything feels safe.” You don’t need to upload a picture of your passport. You don’t need 2-factor authentication.  “That is the most beautiful experience for getting your first bitcoin,” said Dickerson. “You’re literally having fun and you’re earning bitcoin.”  Dickerson’s very presence at Thndr, in a way, is a massive vote of confidence in mobile gaming, and perhaps a signal for the future. She’s a good get. For years Dickerson served as vice president of business operations at Lightning Labs, arguably the most consequential project in all of Bitcoin. She had a top role at a top company. She’s popular in the space and well-connected, and she could have landed any job.  So why cartoon cats?  The shorthand is that Dickerson left Lightning to launch a bitcoin mobile gaming company. The truth is more complex. At the end of July, she left Lightning to help care for her mother, spending 14 hours a day in a Cleveland hospital – often sleeping there – as her mother battled diverticulitis. “I had to make a call on where to spend my time,” said Dickerson, and her mom was more important than bitcoin.  When her mother recovered, Dickerson, exhausted and drained, took her first break in years and went on an “epic vacation” with her husband and bounced around Europe – Barcelona, Krakow, Naples, Prague, Slovakia and on and on. “We ate and drank and did nothing,” said Dickerson. But wherever she went, and on every flight, she noticed something: People were playing games on their phones. Grandparents, teenagers, kids, parents, men, women – everyone was on their phone playing games. “It was literally everywhere,” said Dickerson. “Even in Ohio in the hospital waiting rooms. They’re not reading books anymore.” Even her mom was playing “these stupid Clue-like games.”  Meanwhile she had been doing research. Crunching numbers. “I was like, holy s**t, mobile gaming makes up 60% of the entire gaming market,” she said. “That’s larger than both desktop and console gaming combined. Insane numbers.” And there are an estimated 3.1 billion gamers in the world. She found the math compelling.  Then there’s the lure of gaming itself – a lifetime obsession. When Dickerson was a kid, her dad had the original Nintendo, and they played Duck Hunter. The N64 came out when her parents divorced, and the console brightened an otherwise bleak time, as “so much was breaking down in our lives.” Over pizza, she bonded with her father while playing Goldeneye and Mario Party. “It was such a huge, huge, huge part of my youth,” she said.  Later, at the University of Chicago, she got hooked on Facebook games, even using her student loan money on FarmVille. After college, working in management consulting for the federal government (she helped with the roll-out of HealthCare.gov, calling it two years of “non-stop nuts” and “insanity”), she was hell-bent on winning Pokemon Go battles … at the White House.  That gaming obsession continued at Lightning. She worked with Jack Everitt, the game developer who originally launched Thndr, and Christian Moss, the co-founder and head developer at Zebedee, to launch a bitcoin e-sports tournament called Mint Gox. “My favorite use case [for Lightning] is gaming,” Dickerson told me back in May of 2021, months before she made the switch. “Gaming is the perfect onramp for people who never thought about bitcoin. It’s a no-brainer.”  The story of Dickerson, Everitt and Moss is still largely untold – perhaps because they’re not part of any crypto speculation frenzy. (Yet.) But they could write the next chapter of bitcoin gaming and bitcoin adoption … and it all started with lighting. No, not the Lightning Network – “Force Lightning” from “Star Wars.”  Not strictly sadistic  Emperor Palpatine, as every “Star Wars” fan knows, shoots evil lightning bolts from his fingers. In 2008, a young computer graphics wizard from the U.K., Jack Everitt, was tasked with creating a Force Lightning plug-in for After Effects, the video effects software program.  So Everitt built the effect. It was cool. And it gave Everitt an idea. The iPhone had just been released, and Everitt knew that the App Store – still in its infancy – was an untapped goldmine for those who could code. Everitt quickly created an app, called Volt, where you touch the screen and then you see lightning bolts. That’s it. That’s all it did. This lightning-themed app shot to No. 2 in the paid App Store.  Read more: These Gaming Studios Are Bringing Bitcoin Payouts to Everyday Esport Gamers - Colin Harper  Laughing, Everitt remembers that in those early days of the iPhone, people were still dazzled by the ability to pinch your screen and zoom in on pictures, “and anything that wasn’t zooming in on the phone was amazing.”  He made enough money from Volt to quit his job and focus on creating more games, such as 2013′s “Smash Dude,” where you basically beat the crap out of a wooden doll with a variety of weapons: punches, tomatoes, darts, thumbtacks and Everitt’s beloved lightning. In a mixed review (2.5 stars), CNET called it a “frustration vent like none other” while clarifying that the game is “not strictly sadistic.”  Perhaps Everitt would have remained a traditional game developer forever, but two developments would change his course. Everitt was shocked when Apple yanked Smash Dude from the App Store, apparently because it was too violent. This struck Everitt as bizarre and capricious. The game was “cartoony, with no blood,” said Everitt. “They were opaque and didn’t give any explanation.” And it was getting harder and harder for his games to get noticed. Competition on the App Store and Google Play had stiffened – if you didn’t splurge on a marketing budget, your game would get buried by the algorithm.  The second development: Lightning. As early as 2013, Everitt toyed with the idea of somehow injecting his game with bitcoin, but the fees were too high and the 10-minute lag (to settle base-layer transactions) was a deal-breaker. Then came Lightning. Near-instant transactions. Near-zero fees.  Just before a Lightning Network conference in Berlin, in 2019, Everitt slapped together a quick game, called Bitcoin Bounce, that could demonstrate how players could win satoshis in-game. The game was crude and simple; Everitt created it as an “ice breaker” for the conference. You basically “bounce” on the blockchain and pick up satoshi coins. At the time, Everitt was still a nobody in the crypto world, so he attended the Berlin conference as a regular crypto-bro. But he noticed a spare booth where an exhibitor had no-showed, and without asking anyone’s permission, he claimed it as his own, set up shop and showed the Lightning community Bitcoin Bounce.  The game was a hit. Dickerson remembers downloading Bitcoin Bounce (shortly after the conference), playing the game and thinking, “Wow, this is really happening in the palm of my hand. Gaming on bitcoin is actually a reality.”  The Berlin conference is also when Everitt met another central figure in mobile bitcoin gaming: a fellow British game developer named Christian Moss.  Boozy coins  Soon after Christian Moss graduated university in the U.K., he moved to Japan to teach English. He found it odd that his computer science degree failed to teach him computer programming, so almost on a lark, he went to YouTube and searched “How to make an iOS app?” He taught himself how to program and make games, or what he now describes as “bad games,” like taking an image from your phone’s photo library and turning it into a jigsaw puzzle. When he uploaded his first app to the App Store in 2010, he excitedly checked the stats to see how many people had downloaded it. The answer was five. Not 5,000. Five people.  Moss soon built other games, better games, like one that incorporated robots, puzzles and time traveling. (A robot is trapped in an elevator and it has to press a button to open the doors. But the button is broken. So the robot needs to time-travel to a moment where the button wasn’t broken.) He moved with his girlfriend (now wife) to Australia, then landed a job with an app development company, and one day he was tasked with designing a bitcoin wallet app. “For a small amount of time I was the only bitcoin wallet app on the App Store,” Moss remembers.  Get the whole of Culture and Entertainment Week.  Moss realized that no one was putting bitcoin into games. So he made a game called SaruTobi, which literally means “monkey fly,” the name of a famous ninja in Japanese folklore. Like Everitt’s Bitcoin Bounce, the game wasn’t super complicated. You tap the screen and spin the monkey, and the monkey would fly through the air, and if you’re lucky the monkey would swing into some bitcoin. (CoinDesk covered the game’s release in 2015.)  Moss was now hooked on bitcoin gaming. He moved back to Tokyo where he attended bitcoin meetups – at the time organized by Roger Ver – and made connections who became sponsors of the game. That was the early business model: Crypto sponsors (like Genesis Mining and Bread Wallet) would give Moss the capital that he could then give to players.  One night at a Tokyo meetup, Moss got drunk. “You know how sometimes when you’re drunk, sometimes you see coins on the floor? But they’re really just bottle caps?” (Moss adds that “maybe you don’t, maybe that’s just me.”) This gave him boozy inspiration: Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if you can just drop bitcoin on the floor for other people to pick up? This was before Pokemon Go. “The idea is that people could drop bitcoin anywhere in the world for others to pick up,” Moss said, in an idea that now – with the price of bitcoin around $50,000 – feels hilariously unlikely.  But 2016 was a simpler time in crypto. So Moss created a game, called Takara, where you use your phone’s GPS to navigate to dropped bitcoin, and then you need to answer questions to prove you’re actually there.  Why the questions? Moss said that GPS can be faked, so he added real-world challenges as a safeguard. For example, if you’re at a diner, you might have to answer “What’s the breakfast special?” Japanese businesses even used the game for advertisements, such as Tokyo bars that dropped bitcoin into their establishments as a way to lure customers.  Takara and SaruTobi were fun, they were creative, and they were being played by actual people. Then came the scaling problem. The games “all broke because the fees became too high,” said Moss. He put a pause on mobile bitcoin gaming, a pause that would last for years, until a solution emerged that cracked the scaling problem – Lighting.  Moss was then approached by a crypto entrepreneur named Simon Cowell (not that one), who years ago played SaruTobi, remembered it fondly, and wanted to start a Lightning-infused bitcoin gaming company Zebedee. Moss is now Zebedee’s head of gaming, Cowell is the CEO, and Zebedee now creates both bitcoin games and tools to help developers make bitcoin games. “We think bitcoin will be the main currency of the digital world,” said Moss.  Idle clickers  Maybe mobile bitcoin gaming is the future, but to get there, Dickerson, Everitt, Moss and the other mobile bitcoin gaming developers (such as Viker) will have to solve some very real problems in the present.  Consider the design of the games themselves. Bitcoin can make it tricky. “You can’t just add bitcoin to a game and give it away,” said Everitt. “You have to think about it when you design the game.” Thndr measures every in-game metric: how many ads do people watch, when do they spend their money in the game, how quickly do they complete levels. You measure all of those metrics like normal, said Everitt, but “now you’ve got a hole in the ship. And money’s being leaked out of it.”  Thndr’s revenue model, at least in these early days, is almost surprisingly traditional. “We make money through ads and in-app purchases,” said Everitt. (And the ads, speaking from personal experience, can be jarring and annoying.) They’re not receiving crypto from players – it’s the reverse. They spread satoshis to entice users to keep playing. But how much should they give? How often?  Everitt and team are testing these variables constantly. They use A/B testing to compare different payouts – maybe Group A plays a version of the game that gives out 25 satoshis, and Group B plays an identical version but only gets 1 satoshi. They measure engagement and retention. Everitt was reluctant to share examples of this kind of testing, as “that’s where our edge is. It’s our secret sauce.” But he did let slip that they found something surprising in their analysis: Gamers seemed to find the prize of 1 satoshi more valuable than 25 satoshis. Perhaps the former feels fun and cute; the latter feels cheap. And this is obviously a happy insight for a gaming company; the players don’t notice any difference, but switching from 25 to 1 slashes giveaway costs by 96%.  Gamers seem to love these 1 satoshi giveaways. They even give satoshis to each other as a sign of fellowship. “When we want to give something nice to another player, we say that one sat equals one digital hug,” said a Venezuelan-based gamer who goes by Koty. He plays Bitcoin Bounce and Turbo84 every day for 10 to 15 minutes, hoping to stack sats, and is excited about how he can use them in the future. “Imagine playing a casual game, earning sats, and use those sats to buy a new armor in a MMORPG [massively multiplayer online role-playing game], or a set of tires in a racing game or to even do groceries in the analog world,” said Koty.  Maybe someday. But another challenge: The very “safety” of the App Store, which Dickerson credits for frictionless adoption, is also a brutal constraint to game design. There’s only so much, at the moment, that game developers are allowed to do with bitcoin. Can users make in-app purchases with bitcoin? Nope. This is one reason why the current crop of games (unlike Axie Infinity) generally only give out bitcoin, not create an in-game economy.  Adding bitcoin can warp the core incentives of a game. When Zebedee added bitcoin to a Mario Kart-style game, you scoop up coins when racing around the track. But then something funky happened. Moss found that instead of completing each level, players would actually drive the cart backwards to collect more coins. “The incentive to finish wasn’t there,” said Moss. So they tweaked the game to give an extra incentive to finish the level.  “As a game designer, you kind of want people to actually play the game,” said Moss. “Otherwise, you kind of feel like, ‘I might as well just make a game that has a button that you press, like a chicken.’ That can be disheartening.”  Game security is a constant danger. If you create a game that directly gives out bitcoin, then you have unwittingly created a juicy target for hackers. As Everitt describes it, maybe the game’s code has a line that says “give me 10 sats” and then the hacker rewrites that to “Give me 1,000 sats.”  Then there are the “satoshi farms.” Most of these games have daily limits, so you can only earn 500 sats (for example) before seeing a message like “You’ve reached your limit for today.” This prevents Thndr and Zebedee from getting bled dry. Moss said that to juke this constraint, some gamers create virtual accounts on multiple machines – an army of machines – to rack up the free satoshi. Moss is constantly playing what he calls “whack-a-mole” to ban the IP addresses of these satoshi farms, and said that “it happens all the time.”  Finally, it can be helpful to look at that original game I played, the cartoon cat shooter Thndr Bay, and to consider the logic that went into the design choices. “We have to choose easy game play,” said Poland-based Grzegorz Flor, Thndr’s new chief product officer. “In the beginning we have to focus on the very easy games for the mass audience.”  Flor, who has a background in both psychology and traditional gaming (he has made over 100), categorizes mobile games in different buckets: “hyper-casual,” “bubble shooters,” “idle clickers,” and so on. He teaches Dickerson the nuance of gaming; she teaches him the nuance of bitcoin.  Read more: The Lightning Network Is Going to Change How You Think About Bitcoin - Jeff Wilser  “Idle clickers,” Dickerson said, amused. “I didn’t know that was a category. All you do is click it. Like, teenage girls will play these games in class, and they’ll put it under their leg and just click without looking.” She’s particularly amused by a game called KleptoCats, where you “have this cat, and you feed him, and you watch him, and you just click, and he steals s**t from people and he brings it back to you,” Dickerson said, laughing so hard she can barely speak. “It’s so stupid, and I’ve already spent $10 on it.”  Thndr is not making Idle Clickers, but Turbo 84 is a racer, Thndr Bay is a bubble shooter, and all of these games fit squarely in the lane of “casual.”  That could change. Consider the track record of Flor, who said he is “connected with MS Excel on a cellular level.” In Poland, he used big data to create a MMORPG game, Blackout Age, that blends in-game action with real-world knowledge.  Blackout Age is a dystopian survival game. That’s not so unique. But Flor gave it a new spin: He used the data to create maps and scenarios that conform to the real world, allowing players to benefit from their knowledge of actual neighborhoods. (Data sets of real-world light pollution, for example, helped inform the game map’s city density. Actual crime data might inform the difficultly levels of neighborhoods.)  If the player needs a weapon, and she knows that a sporting goods store is only a few blocks away, she might head to that store in the hopes of finding arrows. It’s a slick concept. The game has over 1 million downloads, according to Flor, and 25,562 gamers on Google Play have given it an average rating of 4.1.  Suddenly the game doesn’t feel so casual. Now imagine this kind of inventive, sophisticated game on a mobile device – one that you can safely grab from the App Store – and injecting it with bitcoin. That’s the kind of magic that could help realize Thndr’s end-game. As Dickerson described her modest mission: “We want to gamify the world with bitcoin.”",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/15/mobile-bitcoin-gaming-is-powering-up-on-lightning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/001c1ca35b8895a677a975c96a91245936e828cc-2388x1668.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420835,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlLR,1639571400,Why Ethereum’s ‘Difficulty Bomb’ Has Been Delayed Again,"The Ethereum network recently underwent the Arrow Glacier hard fork on Dec. 9, with the sole purpose of delaying the “difficulty bomb” to June of next year. The difficulty bomb is a mechanism to force the proof-of-work network to stop producing blocks, making mining unprofitable and disincentivizing miners from keeping the chain alive after the network merges to proof-of-stake.  Ethereum core developers have made significant progress toward the Merge, with client interoperability and a functioning developer network, Amorpha. However, more time is needed to deliver the mainnet level change to proof-of-stake.  While this marks the fourth time that the difficulty bomb has been delayed, core developers have signaled almost unanimous confidence that the Merge will be ready by next summer, and they will continue to provide updates during weekly All Core Developers meetings.  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Optimism announced the removal of its application whitelist, allowing developers to build on top of the rollup. BACKGROUND: Optimism, a highly anticipated Ethereum layer 2 protocol, used a controlled launch with only select applications several months back. “Opening the floodgates” to all developers signals high confidence in Optimism’s safety and user experience.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) showed resilience during the recent pullback across crypto markets, with only a tiny portion of loans getting liquidated on platforms like Aave and Compound. BACKGROUND: DeFi is often thought of as risk-on and a means of getting cheap leverage. However, on-chain liquidations were just a drop in the bucket compared to the wipe on centralized exchanges. A Delphi Digital analysis showed a majority of loans on Aave and Compound used very low leverage.  The Ethereum Foundation announced a grant that would award high-functioning client teams with Beacon Chain validators. BACKGROUND: A diverse range of high-quality clients is vital to the success of Ethereum, so that the network can maintain health even if one client runs into a bug, since the rest will still be running smoothly. In order to align the network and client teams in the long run, the Ethereum Foundation announced it would give 144 vesting validators to each client team to run with their respective software.  Polygon moves closer to bringing EIP 1559-style fee markets to their proof-of-stake scaling platform. BACKGROUND: Internal analysis showed that the fee burn would remove 0.27% of Polygon’s total supply annually. Unlike Ethereum, Polygon has a fixed supply and will immediately become deflationary when the upgrade takes place on mainnet. Outside of burning token supply, the upgrade will help bring predictability to the Polygon fee market, and software providers will be better able to predict acceptable transaction fees.

The firms were criticized for “irresponsibly taking advantage of consumers’ inexperience and for failing to illustrate the risk” of investing in cryptocurrencies.  Crypto firms have caused consternation at regulatory bodies in the U.K. before, including the Financial Conduct Authority, following advertising campaigns involving Transport for London, for example. Such promotions usually accompany a spike in the price of crypto tokens.  Other companies censured include pizza chain Papa John’s, which in May offered to give away £10 ($13) in bitcoin with orders over a certain amount. In response, the company said it has a long-running association with cryptocurrency, dating back to May 2010 when it was believed that bitcoin had been first used to buy two Papa John’s pizzas.  “In that context, and when there was high customer interest in pizza and bitcoin, they [Papa John’s] ran the promotion to raise awareness of the connection between cryptocurrency and pizza,” said the firm’s response.

Ledn said all of its existing investors also participated in the latest raise, which included billionaire hedge fund investor Alan Howard, and Kingsway Capital.  With its bitcoin-backed mortgage loan, Ledn clients will be able to purchase real estate and use an equal amount of bitcoin and property collateral as part of the mortgage loan. Ledn intends to make the product more broadly available to clients in the U.S. and Canada early next year.  Ledn says there is a waitlist for the product and aims to reach over $100 million in bitcoin-backed mortgage originations by the end of the first quarter of 2022.  “Most people that hold extensive wealth in Bitcoin still can’t utilize their assets to qualify for a mortgage at a bank,” Ledn’s co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds said in the statement.  Ledn developed the bitcoin-backed mortgage product after seeing strong client demand, Ledn co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Mauricio Di Bartolomeo told CoinDesk.  Di Bartolomeo said that not having to sell bitcoin is key for holders of the cryptocurrency, and that the mortgage product will be a great way to “teleport some of that wealth from bitcoin into the real world.”  Since the third quarter of 2020, Ledn has grown its assets by over 4,000%, exceeding $1.7 billion, according to the statement.

Tezos is also the blockchain being used by video game giant Ubisoft for its recent entry into the NFT space.

Under the strategic collaboration, Rarible will feature Tezos NFTs on its marketplace and support secondary sales of projects that live in the Tezos ecosystem.  Rarible will also immediately support secondary sales from Ubisoft’s Digits, which are in-game collectibles with active utility value for players.

42396325,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2jEz,1639565334,Dogecoin Leads Gains as Crypto Market Shows Muted Recovery,"Cryptocurrency prices showed signs of recovery across the board on Wednesday after almost a week of declines.  Dogecoin led growth among cryptos with large market values, rising for a second day. Prices of the meme coin had jumped Tuesday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the electric-car maker would start accepting it as payment for Tesla merchandise. Dogecoin immediately surged 33% to more than $0.21 before retreating to as low as $0.17. It is trading at $0.18 at press time, CoinGecko data shows.  The dogecoin bump led to a resurgence of sorts in the broader crypto market. Bitcoin added nearly $2,000 Wednesday morning compared with Tuesday’s lows. It continues to battle the $50,000 price resistance, one the asset was rejected from on Monday.  Ether recovered after yesterday’s dump to $3,680, adding 3% on the day to $3,880 at press time.  Crypto funds were behind some of the big ether bids in the past few weeks. Wallet activity of Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital showed the fund moved thousands of ether from crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance in the past day, having snapped up $400 million worth of the asset earlier this month.  That move came despite Three Arrows founder Su Zhu criticizing Ethereum for its slow and expensive network. Zhu later told CoinDesk the fund remained bullish on ether as the macro environment became calmer and global stock markets appeared “healthy.”  Other top gainers on crypto charts were tokens of Avalanche with 15% gains at press time. Solana tokens added 7% and terra (LUNA) 5%, CoinGecko data show.  Elsewhere, Polygon’s MATIC rallied 8.9% on news of a new deflationary mechanism. The proposal rolled out a testnet version of a “burn” implementation on Tuesday to introduce eliminating a set amount of MATIC on each transaction. A testnet is an experimental environment for software under development.  Tests estimated nearly 0.27% of MATIC’s 6.8 billion circulating supply would be burned annually if the implementation is passed.  Troubles remain  Meanwhile, some say the market could take more time before seeing a noticeable recovery.  Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, said he doesn’t anticipate an imminent move upwards, based on liquidations and trading volumes.  “The U.S. has woken up and bought on anticipated lower bitcoin prices, which has pushed the price up slightly but it is still under pressure,” Kssis told CoinDesk.  Crypto prices remain suppressed compared with last week. Prices of bitcoin, ether and Binance coin, the three largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are down 4.2%, 9.9%, and 8.3% in the past week. And investors have lost even more on SOL, LUNA and MATIC: The three tokens are down 12%, 14.8%, and 15.4%, respectively, on the week.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/15/dogecoin-leads-gains-as-crypto-market-shows-muted-recovery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae9a59aeefc6191fe0558375296c21f8a7c44d57-5090x3397.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2j86,1639562919,India’s Crypto Bill Likely to Be Delayed for Several Weeks: Reports,"India’s highly anticipated crypto regulation bill probably won’t be introduced to Parliament until next year’s session begins in late January or early February, several media outlets reported.  Media reports citing unnamed sources said the crypto bill is not on the agenda of the Cabinet meeting scheduled for Wednesday.  The process requires the draft bill to be submitted to the Cabinet for consideration before introduction in parliament. With no Cabinet approval this week, time is running out for the bill to be introduced in this session of parliament, which ends Dec. 23.  The next Cabinet meeting is on Dec. 22, and therefore it is highly unlikely the crypto bill will get Cabinet approval and then also be introduced in the parliament.  The bill is also unlikely to be introduced in this session because the government is considering changes to the proposed bill, CoinDesk has learned.  This does not completely rule out the possibility of crypto regulations in the near future or even before the next session of parliament. The government has the option of promulgating an ordinance instead of presenting the bill in parliament first if it determines that the need has arisen.  CoinDesk has learned the Cabinet has already had informal discussions around the draft bill. Once the bill is approved by the Cabinet, it is likely to go to the standing committee on finance in parliament for further scrutiny and discussions.  Policy experts have indicated to CoinDesk the bill is unlikely to be introduced in this session of parliament, as the crypto space is fast evolving and the framework of the bill requires further consultations.  On Dec. 11, at the virtual Summit for Democracy hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “We must also jointly shape global norms for emerging technologies like social media and cryptocurrencies so that they are used to empower democracy, not to undermine it.”  The Economic Times quoted an unnamed senior Indian government official as saying, “After several rounds of discussions at the highest levels, it was felt that any legislation surrounding cryptocurrency must be in tandem with a global framework which is still evolving. It might be a better strategy to wait and observe how this space evolves globally.”  The crypto bill has been listed for the ongoing winter session of parliament and was also listed in the last budget session, but has not been introduced in either session.

The Series D funding round was led by global investment firm KKR and included Goldman Sachs, Alameda Research and Andreessen Horowitz among other big names.  Multibillion-dollar valuations are becoming the norm for crypto custody specialists like San Francisco-based Anchorage, which will manage digital assets for institutions looking to spice up their clients’ portfolios going forward. Take custody-tech providers like Fireblocks and U.K.-based Copper, both of whom recently closed funding rounds, for example.  CoinDesk reported in October that Anchorage was raising at a $2 billion-plus valuation.  “As more and more institutions look to add crypto services into their offerings, we find ourselves at an inflection point,” Anchorage co-founder Diogo Mónica said in a statement, “This funding positions Anchorage Digital to meet the unprecedented institutional demand for this rapidly evolving market.”  This will be KKR’s first direct equity investment in a digital asset company, through its Next Generation Technology Growth Fund II.  “As a pioneer in enabling institutional investors to access digital assets, Anchorage has built a best in class, institutional grade digital asset platform that combines the best practices of both modern security and usability,” said Ben Pederson of KKR’s Technology Growth Equity Team in a statement.  Goldman Sachs is known for having a smart digital assets team, one of the leading banks in the space.  The bank’s backing is testament to Anchorage’s dynamic year, which has included receiving a U.S. federal banking charter from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, as well as bagging an $80 million Series C round.  “We are certain Anchorage will be a crucial part of the digital asset infrastructure and we are excited to be an investor,” Goldman Sachs Head of North America Digital Assets Oli Harris said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/15/crypto-custody-firm-anchorage-raises-350m-funding-at-3b-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72be36a792095a00c348bef7c142410c93d73dee-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396312,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2j2C,1639558327,55% of Aave’s Community Votes for ‘Business License’ to Prevent Forks,"A governance proposal floated by the Aave community centered around the platform’s code licensing ended on Tuesday, with 55% voting for the ecosystem to apply for a “business license.”  “This vote is essentially a signal on whether or not the Aave community wants to protect its intellectual property from unauthorized use, or simply allow anyone to use the code in any way they prefer,” the proposal’s pseudonymous author explained.  DeFi-centric funds like Singapore-based DeFiance Capital called it one of the most important proposals in the Aave ecosystem. “This has been one of the most important, if not the most important proposal on Aave,” said Goh Yeou Jie, who oversees portfolio growth at the fund.  The proposal was part of Aave’s broader “3 release” strategy, one that introduces additional features such as cross-chain transactions, improved risk mechanisms, a better codebase for community contribution, and added mechanism to promote usage of layer 2 products (layer 2s are scaling solutions or implementations that run atop a primary blockchain).  Aave, one of the so-termed “blue-chip DeFi” cryptocurrencies, is an Ethereum-based, open-source protocol allowing users to earn interest on deposits, borrow assets, and take out zero-collateral loans. It relies on smart contracts that automate protocol services like other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Aave’s decentralized nature means aave token holders can propose further improvements, integrations, and partnerships on its governance forums – with proposals passed based on majority votes which are calculated on the amount of aave tokens used to place those votes.  Why the vote matters  The proposal offered the community two major choices for voting: 1. A legal business license that restricts others from using Aave’s code — despite it being open source, which essentially means anyone is allowed to use Aave’s code for themselves, until a period of one year; or 2. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) License, a permissive free software license originating at MIT that puts limited restrictions on code reuse.  A business license would mean any project or developer that uses Aave’s code for their project would have to take permission from a legal entity that would be set up to control such decisions. An MIT License, on the other hand, would have meant little in the way of such restrictions. A majority chose the former.  55.44% of the community voted for Aave to have a business license, representing over 387,000 aave in vote stakes. An address called defimaximalist.eth emerged as the top voter, putting up 191,000 aave tokens to vote for the business license option.  “Having a business license (similar to Uniswap v3) initially will help to prevent a fork for the time being, and we suggest a [two- to three-years] delay for it to transition to an MIT license. This will give Aave more time to build their ecosystem further,” explained DeFiance’s Goh Yeou Jie in a tweet. The fund voted for the business license option.  44.48% of holders went with the MIT License option. Address 0xc4a936B003BC223DF757B35Ee52f6Da66B062935 was top voter for this option with a stake of 100,000 aave tokens.  The remaining, a paltry 0.29% of votes, went with the third option, an (A)GPL License that allows users to distribute, run, study, and share free software.  Meanwhile, some on Crypto Twitter expressed dismay over the outcome. “Really sad about the outcome and last minute vote,” said Lefteris Karapetsas, founder of portfolio tracking service Rotki. “Who is defimaximalist.eth?

42396308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2iyG,1639553851,"Bitcoin, Cardano, Ether and Everything Else Are Still Down 99% on CoinMarketCap","The price of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down 99% on crypto tracking site CoinMarketCap. But don’t worry, your bitcoins aren’t suddenly worthless. The extreme drop in prices was due to a glitch on the website, which surfaced during the early hours of Wednesday.  The glitch wrongly displayed cryptocurrency trading prices and was solved after nearly an hour. Pricing data has since come back to normal at press time, but data for all-time highs for cryptocurrencies remains faulty. For example, bitcoin’s all-time high is still being displayed as $8.6 million on CoinMaketCap, which is far beyond its $69,000 peak in May 2021, as per CoinGecko.  Sites like CoinMarketCap, owned by Binance, and CoinGecko are gatekeepers of the crypto world for retail audiences. They track pricing and trading data on crypto exchanges in real time – referencing the data against each other for a double-check – before publishing prices on their site.  This means if bitcoin is shown trading at $49,000 on CoinMarketCap, the figure is calculated by recording the actual trading prices on several trusted crypto exchanges.  But as with all things technology, mistakes do occur. A bug on CoinMarketCap wrongly displayed the prices of all cryptocurrencies early Wednesday, even as exchange data itself remained accurate.  This led to the price of bitcoin being displayed as high as $789 billion, giving it a market capitalization of $14.7 quintillion. Other large-cap cryptocurrencies like ether and ADA witnessed similar woes, reaching prices as high as $757,200 and $256, respectively. The real prices, at press time, are $3,867 and $1.25.  The glitch caused the likes of Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov to recommend decentralized alternatives to provide pricing data.  “This recent glitch is exactly why blockchain applications and smart contracts need to use decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink,” he said in a message to CoinDesk. “Relying on a single oracle, or a single source of data, is a recipe for disaster that undeniably puts user funds at risk.”  Also, some decentralized finance (DeFi) projects that use CoinMarketCap data halted their offerings as a measure to protect their mechanisms. “Due to an error with the CoinMarketCap API, all DeFiChain Vaults have automatically been halted, for now, ensuring the safety of your loans,” said DeFiChain, a bitcoin-centric lending service.  DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts for decentralized services like lending and borrowing, using pricing data from third-party services to ensure products offered to users are in line with market prices.  Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap addressed the glitch and detailed the next steps in a tweet this morning, “Following the irregularities we observed on our platform this afternoon, despite the issue having been fixed, we will be rebooting our servers as a final step in accordance with our internal remediation plan.”  However, pricing data for all-time high data on CoinMarketCap remains faulty at press time.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/15/bitcoin-cardano-ethereum-and-everything-else-is-still-down-99-on-coinmarketcap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e9400c7b7bf36dc897b292ffb6804f2d654b37c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A substantial economic force to be reckoned with, the cryptocurrency market is a legitimate source of debt securities that are no less reputable than their equivalents. With interest rate derivative products, the creditors in the cryptocurrency market, mostly comprised of lenders and borrowers, hope to stabilize their revenue and reduce their risk. There are two types of interest rate derivatives in the crypto market: one that lets you extend the length of your loan and one that enables you to raise the interest rate. In the traditional financial markets, there is a big difference between the interest rates offered to borrowers, and the interest rates offered to lenders. The same is true in the crypto-financial market. ADALend&apos;s Utilization Ratio The interest rates for both borrowers and lenders will fluctuate with the changes in the utilization ratio of the loans in the specific pool. The interest rate is dependent on the total amount of money available in the liquidity pool, which is denominated in the platform&apos;s LP token. If more people are looking to borrow than funds in the liquidity pool, the interest rate increases; if more people are trying to lend than borrowers, the interest rate decreases.

The rise of NFT gaming has led to an explosion in play-to-earn games whereby players can earn and own digital in-game assets to sell at their discretion.

It is also designed with an innovative dual token model to slow down inflation and sustain a balanced in-game economy. Also, users pay no gas fees to get started with Monsterra, instead only paying a transaction fee when converting their assets into NFT items.
