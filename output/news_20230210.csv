9215216,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577442-coinbase-staking-business-at-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1676073271,Coinbase: The Staking Business Is At Risk,"Summary Coinbase lost 14% of its market value yesterday with Kraken reaching a settlement with the SEC that included discontinuation of its crypto staking business in the United States. CEO Brian Armstrong, in a series of Tweets, claimed the SEC's approach is not the right way to deal with innovative technologies. Coinbase's chief legal officer claims the company's staking program is fundamentally different from Kraken because of one major reason. Empirical evidence suggests undermining the SEC's threats could be a fatal mistake. Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) stock plummeted 14% yesterday (Feb. 9) with rumors that surfaced regarding a potential SEC ban on crypto staking in the United States. These rumors were triggered with the popular crypto exchange Kraken agreeing to pay $30 million to settle SEC allegations that its staking products were violating securities laws in the United States. As part of the agreement reached with the SEC, Kraken will also discontinue its staking products in the U.S. but these products will be available to international traders via a subsidiary of the company. With the SEC promising to tighten its grip on the crypto industry in light of risks associated with many crypto products, investor fears stemming from Kraken's settlement with the SEC seem justifiable. This analysis aims to shed light on how crypto staking works, the importance of Coinbase's staking business, and the outlook for this business segment. What is Crypto Staking? From a trader's perspective, staking is the practice of locking up some or all crypto assets owned by an investor in exchange for a percentage-rate return. Every cryptocurrency uses a consensus mechanism to validate and verify transactions to add them to the blockchain. There are two widely-used consensus mechanisms. Proof of Work - used by Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Proof of Stake - used by Ethereum (ETH-USD), Cosmos (ATOM-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), etc. For staking to be allowed, traders need to own cryptos that use the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which is why Bitcoin does not facilitate crypto staking. Transaction verification through Proof of Stake works via crypto investors staking their cryptos to validate these transactions in exchange for rewards in the form of cryptos. The functionality of crypto staking, therefore, is similar to crypto mining. Becoming a staking validator requires substantial investments in hardware and technical knowledge but major crypto exchanges in the world offer simple staking products where traders can stake their holdings in just a few clicks in exchange for potential rewards. Exhibit 1: The dynamics of crypto staking CNBC Ethereum shifted to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism last year, and this decision boosted the staking business of many crypto exchanges worldwide. Illustrated below are the yields associated with different cryptocurrency staking projects in the United States. Exhibit 2: Yields of different crypto staking products Staked The SEC believes some of these staking programs need to be registered as securities offerings because of their characteristics, and the SEC alleged that Kraken failed to do this. Coinbase CEO Defends the Company In a statement announcing Kraken's settlement, the SEC quoted its Chair Gary Gensler saying: Whether it’s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries, when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors’ tokens, need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws. Today’s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection. The SEC's issue is with staking-as-a-service providers who design contracts that resemble traded securities but avoid registering them with the SEC. In a statement to Bloomberg, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said : Coinbase’s staking program is not affected by today’s news. What’s clear from today’s announcement is that Kraken was essentially offering a yield product. Coinbase’s staking services are fundamentally different and are not securities. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to claim that he has been hearing rumors of the SEC prohibiting retail traders from participating in crypto staking programs in the future and claimed that such a decision will harm consumers and also pose a threat to national security. Exhibit 3: Brian Armstrong's Tweet Twitter Mr. Armstrong went on to say that new technologies should be encouraged to grow in the U.S. and urged regulators to come up with ""sensible solutions"". Hester M. Peirce, who serves as a Commissioner on the SEC, released a statement yesterday criticizing the regulator's decision on Kraken's crypto staking program. She makes the case for using an effective regulatory framework to promote new technologies while protecting consumers. We have known about crypto staking programs for a long time. Although it may not have made a difference, I should have called for us to put out guidance on staking long before now. Instead of taking the path of thinking through staking programs and issuing guidance, we again chose to speak through an enforcement action, purporting to “make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection.” Using enforcement actions to tell people what the law is in an emerging industry is not an efficient or fair way of regulating. Moreover, staking services are not uniform, so one-off enforcement actions and cookie-cutter analysis does not cut it. The SEC, regardless of the fightback from the likes of Coinbase's CEO, seems laser-focused on investigating the crypto staking industry. Undermining the SEC's Threats Could be Fatal Investors should be wary of dismissing the threat posed by the SEC to Coinbase's future as a crypto staking business. The argument made by Coinbase executives is that its staking process does not involve transferring the title of ownership of crypto assets from an investor to any other entity. Although this seems a valid argument, the SEC might still ban the practice of crypto staking, in which case Coinbase will have no option but to discontinue this business. If Coinbase begins a battle with the SEC over its decision on Kraken, it would not be the first time the company gets in a fight with the watchdog. Back in September 2021, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, in a series of Tweets , accused the SEC of ""sketchy behavior"" as the regulator did not approve Coinbase's proposed crypto lending product. Coinbase eventually had to scrap its crypto lending product later that month as the SEC found these products to be too risky for retail investors. The Staking Business of Coinbase In the September quarter, Coinbase generated $62 million in revenue from staking services, which was close to 11% of the total revenue the company reported for the quarter. Amid the continued decline in trading revenue, Coinbase investors have found solace in the company's efforts to diversify its revenue by promoting the use of non-investing products such as staking. The company, on the other hand, has regularly highlighted the importance of this business segment to its future as a 360-degree crypto solutions provider. Below are some of the remarks of CEO Brian Armstrong in his Q3 letter to shareholders . While staking monetizes at a lower rate compared to trading, we are pleased by the growth in absolute revenue as compared to the prior crypto winter when our staking products did not exist in earnest. In Q3, Blockchain rewards benefited from increased participation in staking - both in terms of number of users and an increase in the number of native units staked across all assets supported on our platform - compared to Q2. Staking user growth was driven primarily by Solana, which we began supporting in June. In Q3, we launched Institutional staking for Ethereum globally and while adoption is still in its early days, we are optimistic about the long-term opportunity. It is abundantly clear that Coinbase views the rising popularity of staking as an opportunity to meaningfully diversify its revenue streams. The characteristics of the staking business bode well for Coinbase's long-term strategy of reducing the volatility of revenue. With the SEC continuing to probe into the business practices of major U.S. crypto exchanges offering staking programs, decentralized finance apps such as Lido, Rocket Pool, and StakeWise stand to gain the most. According to data from Dune, Lido is already the market leader in the Ethereum staking business, well ahead of Coinbase which is in the second position. Exhibit 4: ETH stakers by the amount staked Dune Decentralized apps such as Lido are thought to be immune to regulatory headwinds because of the autonomous and anonymous features of these platforms. Commenting on how SEC's crackdown could turn out to be a windfall for these platforms, Henry Elder, the head of decentralized finance at Wave Financial, said : This is a huge gift to decentralized staking providers like Lido, Rocket Pool and StakeWise. Their competitive advantage is an innate resistance to regulatory action — something that mattered little in the absence of such action. Investors and traders are likely to choose decentralized apps over Coinbase in the short term amid the dark clouds hanging over the staking programs offered by crypto exchanges. The SEC's probe, therefore, could have a long-lasting impact on Coinbase's staking business. Takeaway Investing in Coinbase stock, in my opinion, remains the best way to get exposure to the crypto industry assuming that COIN's positive correlation with Bitcoin prices will eventually decline along with the success of the company's non-investing business. The company's staking business, however, is likely to attract regulatory scrutiny, which might push stock prices lower in the short term.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | RPL,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577442-coinbase-staking-business-at-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9215216.jpeg

In September 2021 it raised $10 million led by crypto venture firm a16z to build out its global community on and offline.

FWB said in a blog post that the app aims to build genuine relationships by allowing members to connect with each other, read governance proposals and discover upcoming in-person events.  “Our social platform isn’t meant to onboard millions of users as quickly as possible; instead, it is a human-scaled piece of software that optimizes for positive group dynamics, digital socializing, meaning-making and hanging out,” FWB said on Twitter.  To join the app, community members must hold 75 FWB tokens, the community’s native cryptocurrency, which is about $800.  You can apply to join the FWB community through its website. According to the organization, the community is made up of over 3,000 engaged members so far.

42393856,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQyhr,1676066162,Crypto Markets Analysis: Cryptos Upswing Stalls This Week Amid Fresh Regulatory Concerns,"Bitcoin and ether momentum stalled this week as investors fretted first about vibrant jobs data and continued U.S. central bank hawkishness, and then about the potential for increased crypto regulation. Kraken’s agreement to sunset liquidity staking services for U.S. customers particularly darkened the market mood late Thursday.  Bitcoin and ether dropped 6.8% and 7.3% over the last seven days, respectively, losing a sizable chunk of their gains from the first five weeks of 2023. Both are now up about 30% year to date – spearheads in a wider crypto revival – although this week’s declines supported a number of analysts who have predicted that bitcoin support will sink to the $20,000 level.  The week also marked cryptos’ decoupling from traditional finance indexes, with the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 falling more than 50%. Many leading digital assets spent much of the week in the red.  Top performers  Among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, only Polygon's MATIC finished the week in positive territory. BTC and ETH ranked sixth and ninth, respectively.  Solana (SOL) and avalanche (AVAX) were the weekly laggards, with both down more than 15%. The large number of declining assets sharply contrasts to the prior week, when 16 of the 20 assets finished higher.  While the macro narrative has dominated crypto markets for much of 2023, industry-specific developments assumed center stage starting late Wednesday and culminating Thursday with Kraken’s agreement to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that its staking services for U.S. retail investors amounted to offering unregistered securities. Along with halting the offering, Kraken will pay a $30 million fine.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s warning for crypto companies to “take note” and “fall into compliance” following the Kraken announcement presented a larger, long-reaching overhang for the industry. The statement clearly signaled the SEC will be stepping up its crypto regulatory efforts.  The risks to crypto markets appear to be shifting from all-encompassing systematic risk to sector-specific nonsystematic risk, and investors should monitor the flow of coins to and from exchanges for bullish and bearish signals.  The Exchange Net Position change for BTC has been negative this week, implying that investors are transferring coins from exchanges into storage (bullish). A shift in this trend, however, would indicate that investors are becoming leery of BTC’s immediate prospects and sending coins to exchanges to be sold (bearish).",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/10/crypto-markets-analysis-cryptos-upswing-stalls-this-week-amid-fresh-regulatory-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc38a55a4b09ee592f218b669282a7362663cdfd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sepolia, a closed testnet for the Ethereum developers only, is the second such network to undergo the upgrade. Earlier this week, the Zhejiang testnet ran its own successful simulation of staked ETH withdrawals. There’s one more test network set to get the upgrade, and then the main Ethereum blockchain is expected to undergo the Shanghai hard fork next month.  The Sepolia testnet is closed to developers who run validators on the network. By contrast, Zhejiang is a public testnet, meaning that it was open to anyone, including staking providers, who wanted to practice the release of staked ETH.  After Sepolia goes through its own round of testing, Goerli will be the final testnet to get the Shanghai upgrade. Goerli will be the most anticipated test, given that it is the largest public Ethereum testnet, representing the last chance for staking providers to ensure that staked ETH withdrawals work before Shanghai goes live on the mainnet.  Barnabas Busa, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk that the difference between the three tests comes down to “the number of visitors participating and network load.”  Shanghai will be the first hard fork for Ethereum since it went through the Merge in September, which switched out its old energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model for a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Under PoS, ETH is “staked” on the blockchain as a mechanism for helping to validate and secure transactions.

42411220,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMDDo,1676064738,What Does Kraken's SEC Settlement Mean for Crypto Staking?,"There were a number of bankruptcy hearings this week, but the big news was Kraken settling charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and ending its U.S. crypto staking program as a result.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Banning all staking  The narrative  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against crypto exchange Kraken on Thursday, alleging its offering of a crypto staking-as-a-service program amounted to offering unregistered securities products in the U.S. To settle the charges, Kraken is paying $30 million and shutting all of its U.S. staking services. (CoinDesk was the first to report this news.)  Why it matters  The action’s raised a number of questions about what this means for staking at large in the U.S.  Before we get further into this, it’s worth defining some terms. Proof-of-stake is a consensus mechanism wherein nodes are supported by people locking up, or “staking,” their crypto. It differs from proof-of-work consensus mechanisms in that rather than putting energy and computing power into securing the blockchain, you’re putting your “money.”  Staking has gotten an increasing amount of attention in recent years, especially in 2022 after Ethereum, the world’s second-most-valuable cryptocurrency network, transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.  Companies offer staking services in the U.S. because operating your own node just isn’t as easy as letting someone else do it for you (I’m not judging!).  Breaking it down  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong raised the alarm on Wednesday when he tweeted about rumors the SEC was targeting retail staking at large.  But it seems to me that what’s really happening is the SEC is going after companies like Kraken, which are offering staking services and promising their customers some kind of yield.  Let’s look at SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s own past remarks to set a bit of a baseline here: In September he said staking could meet the parameters of the Howey Test.  He highlighted intermediaries in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, saying staking through an intermediary “looks very similar – with some changes of labeling – to lending.”  Some of the big questions bouncing around after the Kraken announcement (and, to be quite frank, Armstrong’s tweet) include whether the SEC is going after all staking in the U.S., how crypto companies can actually offer staking services and whether the SEC would offer any guidance for companies hoping to offer services without drawing the agency’s ire.  An SEC official, speaking at a media briefing after the settlement’s announcement, told reporters that the agency basically looks at the offering of a staking service as being similar to offering any other type of security.  In other words, companies hoping to offer staking services would have to register as a securities platform with the regulator, get SEC Division of Corporation Finance approval to offer the product and file regular disclosures.  The security in this case was the investment program itself, meaning the representations Kraken made in offering the product and the agreement it entered into with its users, another official said.  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in one of her most fiery dissents to date, pointed out that the mere act of registering may be more complex than at first glance.  “An offering like the staking service at issue here raises a whole host of complicated questions, including whether the staking program as a whole would be registered or whether each token’s staking program would be separately registered and what the accounting implications would be for Kraken,” she said.  The officials declined to comment on whether the case had any implications on staking at large.  Another component of the lawsuit the SEC filed against Kraken noted that the company determined what the staking rewards would be for users. The exchange was not just sending the actual protocol rewards to Kraken’s investors.  This may have been a big factor here. As attorney Gabe Shapiro points out, this likely “does make a big difference legally.”  An SEC official did say during the briefing the agency couldn’t comment much on this aspect, though the official did say not to read too much into it.

42414490,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB7TDl,1676064315,Former SEC Attorney: Kraken Action Not a Condemnation of 'Staking Writ Large',"The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) shutdown of crypto exchange Kraken’s U.S. staking-as-a-service business may certainly lead to a wider industry crackdown. However, “this is not a condemnation of staking writ large,” said Zachary Fallon, a former special adviser to the regulator’s general counsel and previously senior special counsel to the director of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance.  Rather, “this is a condemnation of Kraken’s staking program specifically,” Fallon said on CoinDesk TV's “First Mover.”  On Thursday, the SEC announced it had settled with the San Francisco-based Kraken, which will “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay a $30 million fine.  The exchange did not deny nor admit to any wrongdoing, Fallon noted.  He said the SEC’s move is an “obvious shot across the bow to others” that offer staking services to retail users in the U.S. However, he said, the circumstances might have been different had Kraken’s staking program been “merely a technological connective tissue to underlying protocol.”  Instead, “what Kraken appears to have done is essentially run a program on top of what the underlying protocol itself spits out,” he said.  According to the regulator’s press release, “When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.”  Proof-of-stake is a method of maintaining integrity in a blockchain by ensuring users of a cryptocurrency can’t mint coins they didn’t earn. Proof-of-stake relies on ""proof"" of how much of a ""stake"" users have in a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Some, however, delegate their node operations to a third-party operator, such as Kraken.  According to Fallon, the SEC has a habit of announcing an enforcement action and expecting the crypto industry to fall into line rather than providing guidelines for legal operation.  ""We've seen this over the years"" through such actions as the initial coin offering (ICO) crackdown, he said.  When it comes to crypto, “the SEC relies on a facts- and circumstances-based test to assert its oversight.”  At some point “the SEC makes its points and the rest is up to the private markets to sort of fall into compliance or to rely on different facts and circumstances to have a different result than to take a different position,” Fallon said.  But the downside, he said, is that a particular action could be limited to those facts and circumstances.  “To the extent that they're different facts, different circumstances, you might have a different result,” Fallon said.  For now, he says, the industry should “stay tuned.”  Read more: Kraken to Shut US Crypto-Staking Service, Pay $30M Fine in SEC Settlement",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/10/former-sec-attorney-kraken-action-not-a-condemnation-of-staking-writ-large,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e63b64f16e53d665ed317cdf6f7bcabcb5b780a7-2048x1086.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

C3 positions its platform as a transparent self-custodial platform that’s as easy to use as centralized exchanges, which took a reputational hit with the collapse of multi-billion dollar exchange FTX due to liquidity issues. C3 users get to choose how to custody their funds and can trade from a variety of noncustodial wallets or through a preferred custodian without having to entrust the funds directly to the exchange, according to the statement.  ""In the wake of this heightened uncertainty and anxiety, there is an opportunity for new entrants to build a more reliable, self-custodial approach to trading, leveraging the fundamental innovations of blockchain technology,"" said C3 co-founder Michel Dahdah in the press release. ""It is clear that the current market structure of cryptocurrency assets is far from where it needs to be to onboard billions of users, let alone completely replace traditional financial markets.""  Other backers in the round included a mix of traditional investors, quant firms and liquidity providers, including Jane Street, Hudson River Trading, Flow Traders, Jump Crypto, Cumberland DRW, Golden Tree, CMS Holdings, AlphaLab Capital and C² Ventures.

42411210,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCWp,1676058734,An Ode to LocalBitcoins (and a Lesson About Maintaining Bitcoin's Public Goods),"Thursday, storied peer-to-peer crypto exchange LocalBitcoins said it will wind down services due to financial pressure. The news is a loss for the industry. The Helsinki-based firm was founded by Jeremias Kangas in 2012 and became a critical, if increasingly unused, part of the Bitcoin “circular economy.” And it’s possibly a wake up call for the contemporary Bitcoin scene about incentivizing on-chain payments and conserving or building foundational infrastructure needed for Bitcoin adoption.  LocalBitcoins was one of a few onramps into bitcoin markets that offered users a way to transact more-or-less directly with peers. The company facilitated transactions by holding coins in escrow, interjecting an intermediary in Bitcoin’s native P2P design to help people find buyers and sellers. Users typically charged a premium for BTC on the platform, a price worth paying especially in regions facing capital controls, economic instability and financial isolation or sanctions.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Decrypt published a moving account of LocalBitcoins’ legacy in Venezuela, an oil-rich but politically unsteady country largely cut off from the global economy following U.S. sanctions, which has become a hotspot for crypto adoption. ""LocalBitcoins was the main reason for the huge use of Bitcoin in Venezuela during the 2017-2019 period,” Ernesto Contreras, head of business development of Dash, said. The company facilitated intra- and international transactions when banks and remittance firms like MoneyGram could not. LocalBitcoins competitors including U.S.-registered Paxful and U.K.-based Uphold withdrew from Venezuela, citing sanctions and political risks, as have most centralized exchanges.  See also: Crypto Donations Pour in for Turkey Following Massive Earthquake  According to the company’s data, Russia, Venezuela and Colombia accounted for 41% of LocalBitcoins trade volumes in 2020. Russia was later cut off from the platform to conform with the unilateral economic stranglehold targeting the country following its invasion of Ukraine. Putting aside the real need to punish war criminals like Vladimir Putin, this situation may speak to why LocalBitcoins ultimately failed. Only when pariahs can transfer value on-chain can the public be sure that everyone is free to transact – perhaps the greatest (or only) good crypto can provide.  For several years, LocalBitcoins faced political pressure, in part due its lax identification procedures. In 2015, the company pulled out of New York after failing to obtain a BitLicense from the state. In 2016, two people were charged with violating anti-money laundering laws while using the exchange (though, funnily enough, before pleading guilty they looked to dismiss charges because “bitcoin is not money”). Similar cases followed. In 2019, following a CipherTrace report that called LocalBitcoins a “go-to” destination for illicit coins and the introduction of new regulations in Finland, the firm instituted a cash ban as well as know-your-customer (KYC) procedures in compliance with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.  Before the imposition of those compliance mechanisms, LocalBitcoins was a useful tool for people to enhance their privacy on-chain. But even after, the stripped-down service helped facilitate a native bitcoin economy – the platonic ideal of which would look like alphanumeric addresses interacting with similarly pseudonymous entities relying on Bitcoin’s architecture to estable mutual “trust.” The company onboarded and verified users from 189 countries. At its peak, in 2018, some 2,400 BTC traded hands weekly. By 2021, average weekly volumes dropped below 1,000 BTC. Last week, only 283 BTC were traded.  There are likely several causes of LocalBitcoin’s slow demise. It had a bare -bones user interface (which some loved but didn't exactly scream stability like ensconced bank buildings). For years, it remained “Bitcoin-only,” limiting potential use from other crypto holders (and then alienating self-identified “bitcoiners” when it integrated Dogecoin and Cardano). And, surely, the Bear Market bit through margins. But I’d wager, even if LocalBitcoins leadership disagrees, that the company failed simply because it was a company.  By subjecting itself to the law of the land, LocalBitcoins was transformed into a money transmitting business that I find hard to believe Kangas envisioned for himself in 2012. No one is to blame for this process, what some might even call maturation; the company today reportedly has some 50 employees and when dealing with other people’s livelihoods tough decisions need to be made beyond ideological commitments. That includes calling it quits.  It’s worth noting here that in Venezuela, LocalBitcoins faced some competition from P2P platforms such as KYC-less HodlHodl and noncustodial Bisq. Of course, all three were dwarfed by Binance’s entrance into the world of unmediated transactions in 2019, offering more tokens – including coveted U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. Further, Binance P2P, which I think launched without even an official name, does “not have a transparent policy for auditing its P2P market transaction volume,” to use Decrypt’s parlance.  See also: DeFi's Difficult Governance Decisions Lie Ahead | Opinion  Bitcoin needs fully-P2P services that protect people’s privacy – a niche (and it is a niche) LocalBitcoins once cornered. If there is a lesson here – it’s that companies will not be able to sustainably provide these services. Skirting the law is also not viable in the long term, as the collapse of BTC-e, Silk Road and countless other “non-corporate” entities demonstrates. It’s here that I suggest bitcoiners take a leaf from Ethereum’s book, and consider seriously what it means to build, fund and maintain “public goods,” the essential pieces of infrastructure that must remain open for all.  Ethereum is not perfect, but its community of developers has experimented with new models of distributed organization and protocol maintenance – to greater and lesser success. I say this amid a period of debate in Bitcoin Land, where, following the creation of Bitcoin NFTs [non-fungible tokens], a non-financial use case that is generating more fees for miners that has been seen in years, some are questioning the correct use of an open protocol. Bitcoin itself seems destined to reliably provide a way for peers to interact indefinitely. But community – nay, the world! – also needs a platform where peers can find one another. (Because, not everyone wants to set up a Telegram chatbot.)

42411209,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCdR,1676057719,Policymakers Should Embrace DAOs in the New Future of Abundance,"When scarcity is the dominant economic model, accumulation of capital is the priority: This is the status quo for now. Within our current model the most successful tool ever invented to accumulate and deploy capital is the joint stock company. And joint stock companies, corporations, represent most of the private sector. But what happens if capital is not scarce anymore? Do we need corporations or should we be looking for something different and better?  There are not many things that will always be scarce, but human attention is at the top of the list. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and co-operatives might be much better vehicles for accumulating attention and engagement. In DAOs, co-operatives and staking systems, critical decisions are made by the members for the benefit of the members, and the rewards for engagement flow back to the members in proportion to their engagement and in alignment with their constructive participation.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  There has been much discussion about the shortage of clear, positive rules that would pave the way for the crypto ecosystem to return to growth. These are essential to bringing in good actors. We do not need a lot of new rules about what isn’t allowed because nearly all the bad things that happened in 2022 were already illegal. Borrowing customer deposits without consent? Not legal. Pumping and dumping tokens? Not legal. Borrowing multiple times against the same asset? Not legal.  The good news is that there already exists a legal framework and organization structure that DAOs can use to establish their real-world credentials: the co-operative. co-operatives (co-ops) have been around for a long time. And while the traditional corporate sector is about five to seven times larger, the world’s top 300 co-ops still represent more than a trillion dollars in revenue combined.  DAOs and co-ops counter predatory digital monopolies  Co-ops are member-owned and, unlike corporations, key decisions are made on a one-member, one-vote system. Profits are distributed to members based on participation, however, so those contributing the most also earn the biggest benefits.  Co-ops fix what I see as the single biggest problem in the Web 2.0 era: the creation of so-called predatory digital monopolies. The story of many Web 2 businesses goes like this: Clever entrepreneur comes up with an application that connects buyers and sellers in a digital marketplace. They invest heavily and for years in developing the digital infrastructure that coordinates information, products and payments across an ecosystem. They invest in sophisticated analytics, reputation management systems and community engagement growth.  All those things are good. And no one can deny that enormous investments have been required to build the infrastructure that makes everything from online auctions to ridesharing to consumer shopping into frictionless digital experiences. The problems come with success because these systems resemble natural monopolies. As they become dominant, they start to raise prices and slowly but surely shift from adding value to an ecosystem to extracting value from that ecosystem.  We need policies and approaches that anticipate our future. And that future is one of abundance.  Now imagine if all these big companies were co-ops instead of corporations. Imagine if, having paid back the initial investments with a good return, these co-operatives started distributing back the excess profits to the network participants.  This sounds great, but if there is a defect in the vision of future abundance it is that we are always approaching this end state, never arriving. Some things, like real estate and human attention, will probably never be unlimited. A marginal cost of zero is not the same as an average cost of zero. Interest rates at zero do not mean that you can walk into a bank and walk out with a pile of money for any reason in any amount. Good ideas will still need teams and investors and customers and profits.  The good news is that co-operatives may be a very good fit here. A recent white paper by law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe explores if co-ops are an ideal legal model for DAOs, and it also outlines how co-ops can work with for-profit enterprises to accumulate capital and provide investors with exits. Co-operatives can buy shares and even wholly own for-profit enterprises. They can also sell those shares to give for-profit investors an exit without leaving them in near complete control of a digital ecosystem while alleviating pressure to perpetually extract more value from a community.  From B Corporations to co-ops to DAOs, the future of the enterprise is the future of harnessing the power of communities, accumulating attention and engagement, and putting that to work for the public good. We need more policies and systems that make that possible.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/10/policymakers-should-embrace-daos-in-the-new-future-of-abundance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93c914252c3001806c652ac62a360e1a6583f1ba-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I’ve preferred to see it as a wrong-headed but well-intended effort to protect consumers.  Recent events have me wondering if something more sinister isn’t afoot. (And that maybe I am naive.)  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  First, all indications are that the Securities and Exchange Commision will outright prohibit companies from providing staking services to retail customers in the U.S., products that give investors an opportunity to share in the token rewards that proof-of-stake blockchains deliver to validators. Following a hint from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Wednesday that such a ban was coming, news broke Thursday that, in response to an SEC lawsuit, Coinbase competitor Kraken is indefinitely abandoning the staking service it offered to its U.S. customers and paying a $30 million fine.  Second, per observations from Castle Ventures general partner Nic Carter and Blockchain Association chief policy officer Jake Chervinsky, and evident in other signs such as Binance’s problems with U.S. dollar bank transactions, it seems regulators are pressuring U.S. banks to stop servicing crypto companies.  These latest moves will make it even harder for average U.S. citizens to participate in this industry, limiting it to large institutional investors, while various innovative startups looking to disrupt those same rent-seeking intermediaries will struggle to access liquidity. It’s hard to understand how these actions serve to protect consumers or further other policy objectives such as expanding financial inclusion. It feels as if government agents are deliberately trying to force this industry into the hands of Wall Street fat cats.  But here’s the thing: Making it hard for Americans to invest in and build crypto projects won’t stop people outside of the U.S. from doing so. Hardline actions here will just push activity overseas. And while the U.S. might continue to generate business in “institutional crypto,” it will miss out on the true innovations occurring at grassroots levels.  Staking ban?  To be fair, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been warning for some time that staking services could constitute unregistered securities, which would mean that exchanges such as Coinbase could be barred from listing them.  The argument hinges on the income-like earnings that validators of proof-of-stake blockchains earn in the form of new tokens and transaction fees when they lock up pre-existing tokens, putting them at stake in a mechanism intended to keep them honest. It could be argued that the promise of fresh token income meets one part of the all-important Howey Test, which posits that for an investment instrument to be a security the investor needs to have an expectation of return. And from the complaint against Kraken, it appears that the exchange’s role as an intermediary managing the pool of staked token investment meant that, in the SEC’s eyes, it tripped up another Howey prerequisite: that the expected returns are “derived from the effort of others.”  Fine. In a letter-of-the-law sense, the SEC’s backlash against staking may have some standing. But why do this now, and in such a brutal way, shutting down a well-functioning program in the U.S. without offering a company to get its program into an SEC-compliant structure?  In a statement explaining her lone dissent on this action, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce argued that the core problem is the overall inaction around creating a workable regulatory framework for crypto assets:  “Whether one agrees with [the commission’s Kraken] analysis or not, the more fundamental question is whether SEC registration would have been possible. In the current climate, crypto-related offerings are not making it through the SEC’s registration pipeline. An offering like the staking service at issue here raises a host of complicated questions, including whether the staking program as a whole would be registered or whether each token’s staking program would be separately registered, what the important disclosures would be and what the accounting implications would be for Kraken.”  Read more: Dan Kuhn - Crypto Would Survive an SEC Crackdown on Staking  The timing here may be related to Ethereum’s development. It is less than six months since the second-largest blockchain successfully migrated from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in what became known as the “Merge” and comes just before the blockchain launches its Shanghai upgrade, which will allow holders of locked ether tokens to unlock them.  The action also comes just one month since the Commodity Futures and Exchange Commission declared ether to be a commodity – i.e., not a security – which suggests there might be a little turf war here. Determining the policy treatment of Ethereum is a key marker in the race to establish a regulatory standard for blockchains.  More importantly, what is the greater purpose here? Securities law exists to protect small investors – specifically, unaccredited investors of lower income and wealth who are deemed to be less sophisticated and more vulnerable to abuse by the founder of an investment project than wealthier individuals and institutions. How is it that these retail investors in Ethereum are at risk now that they have a chance to earn yield on their tokens, but supposedly weren’t at risk when Ethereum was a proof-of-work chain with zero yield?  Whatever the motive, the SEC’s move raises issues around the thorny matter of centralization risks in Ethereum’s validation network. Immediately after the Merge, concerns grew that a small pool of corporate-run staking pools were validating the bulk of Ethereum transactions and could collude to censor transactions. If hedge funds and venture capitalists are free to stake but small investors are not, doesn’t that risk rise?  A solution, my colleague Daniel Kuhn writes, might lie in decentralized alternatives to Kraken’s offering, such as Lido and Rocketpool. But, given that U.S. regulators have signaled a belief that decentralized protocols aren’t outside their purview, is there not a risk the SEC would deem these projects illegal too and go after their founders and developers, in the vein of Tornado Cash (the Ethereum “mixer” that was sanctioned last year by the U.S. Treasury Department)?  For now, it would seem there’s nothing stopping individual investors from staking the 32 ether needed to be a validator, but not everyone has that kind of money to put away (almost $50,000 at today’s prices). And, let’s be honest, doing this on your own is too complicated for Joe Public. Eventually, small U.S. investors might be able to gain easier staking exposure through tightly regulated exchange-traded funds, but the SEC has yet to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, let alone an ether ETF.  Another outcome is that retail investors’ priorities might shift back to proof-of-work chains such as Bitcoin. But it’s baffling that the SEC would want to promote that considering it’s also devising guidelines for environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and Bitcoin’s carbon footprint is now massively larger than Ethereum’s on account of the latter’s move to proof-of-stake.  In all of this, it seems we can expect to remain baffled because the SEC rarely offers comprehensive guidance on its crypto thinking.  Gensler and his defenders might counter that he has consistently warned that most, if not all, tokens are securities. But the industry’s gripe goes beyond that. It’s that, other than the occasional public invitations to “come in and talk to us,” there’s been no real effort to collaboratively develop a regulatory framework that accommodates the unique, decentralized features of this technology. Worse, industry leaders say, the SEC practices “regulation through enforcement,” with the Kraken suit being a case in point, which leaves everyone on their toes.  The practice might be a good way for the SEC to show off its bureaucratic clout but, without a clear legal framework for how to move things forward and reduce the risk of such enforcement actions, it fosters uncertainty and fear. And that’s antithetical to innovation and entrepreneurship.  New 'Operation Choke Point'  Meanwhile, an even more stealthy regulation-by-enforcement approach is playing out in banking supervision.  As Nic Carter explained in his blog post, the widespread reports that U.S. banks are being instructed not to service crypto providers comes with no official communication from any regulator. He compared it to “Operation Choke Point,” a stealth campaign during the Obama administration to restrict fund flows to fringe but entirely legal services such as gun stores, marijuana dispensaries and porn providers.  Without a clear legal framework for how to move things forward, these enforcement actions foster uncertainty and fear.  The new, unannounced policy was likely a factor in Signature Bank’s move to close the international arm of Binance’s account, which led the world’s biggest crypto exchange by volume to announce that it was temporarily suspending U.S. dollar transfers.  I got wind of the crackdown last month when the London-based head of an Eastern European bank told me that SWIFT, the U.S.-headquartered international bank messaging service, was telling banks it would not permit large transfers to providers of “crypto” services.  The banker’s comment got me thinking: What defines “crypto?” Therein lies another problem: Banks have some discretion in how they will carry out these instructions. Do we honestly believe they will stop dealing with BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, because it now custodies bitcoin? Would Microsoft have its bank accounts shut off because it works on blockchain and metaverse projects?  Legislative clarity  These events underscore the crying need for U.S. regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies, specifically in the form of new legislation from Congress. The SEC’s actions against staking tokens might be technically in line with the Howey Test precedent and with the commission’s guiding statute, but those Depression-era laws now seem woefully out of date. And as the Blockchain Association’s Chervinsky noted, when there’s a vacuum in legal clarity, regulators tend to default to the kind of stealth operations described above.  Meanwhile, other jurisdictions – big ones such as the European Union and Japan, and smaller ones such as Bermuda – are moving forward with clear rules of the road for digital assets, cryptocurrencies and blockchains. That’s going to mean that innovation and trading activity that would otherwise have occurred in the U.S. will shift offshore.  Obviously, regulators in Washington, D.C., are under pressure to take action against “crypto” right now, given the high-profile blowups of last year. But doing so in this ad hoc, seemingly capricious, counterproductive fashion will ultimately backfire.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Michael J.

Waller, echoing other U.S. regulators who have cheered their success at protecting the financial system from the cryptocurrency sector’s woes, said Friday the fallout from the FTX collapse and other recent firm failures hasn’t caused significant damage to the system the Fed oversees.  “The lack of spillovers to date may be attributable in part to the relatively limited number of interconnections between the crypto ecosystem and the banking system,” he said at a Global Interdependence Center event in California.  “I'm supportive of prudent innovation in the financial system, while at the same time concerned about banks engaging in activities that present a heightened risk of fraud and scams, legal uncertainties, and the prevalence of inaccurate and misleading financial disclosures,” he said. A bank that wants to involve itself in crypto “would have to be very clear about the customers' business models, risk-management systems and corporate governance structures to ensure that the bank is not left holding the bag if there is a crypto meltdown.”  Waller, who was nominated for his job by former President Donald Trump, said he expects the digital assets industry to mature and work out its governance, risk management and transparency issues.  “They’ll get there, and when that happens there’s a lot more ability to think about interacting crypto into the traditional financial sector,” he said, noting he’s not in a hurry to get involved personally.  “To me, a crypto asset is nothing more than a speculative asset, like a baseball card,” he said. “If people want to hold such an asset, then go for it. I wouldn't do it, but I don't collect baseball cards, either.”  Waller’s also not convinced that letting the Fed form a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a good idea. He said nobody has yet made a convincing case that there’s a problem that a digital dollar is uniquely able to solve.  “I don’t see a really big value gain from doing this,” he said, adding that he doesn’t think it’s the role of the seven unelected Fed governors to decide, and that he’s waiting for orders from Congress.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/10/federal-reserve-governor-reinforces-us-regulators-preference-for-keeping-crypto-apart-from-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82d9afba4c4ccb28f2e9501dd5a554af0690c24f-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414482,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB7SS0,1676054776,Coinbase’s Staking Service Faces Questions After Kraken’s SEC Settlement,"Though Coinbase’s (COIN) current revenue from staking is relatively small, there is potential for speedy growth if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) doesn’t crack down on the service altogether.  Speaking one day after his agency extracted from Kraken a $30 million fine and an agreement to shut down its U.S. staking-as-a-service operation, SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned other platforms to “take note,” hinting at possible further investigations into other U.S.-based crypto exchanges.  Coinbase – which offers its own staking business – could be one of them. Its shares fell 14% on Thursday following the Kraken news and CEO Brian Armstrong's tweet late Wednesday about rumors the SEC might ban retail crypto staking. Coinbase stock is lower by another 3% on Friday.  Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal argued on Twitter on Thursday that his exchange’s staking business is “fundamentally different” from Kraken’s, which he described as a “yield product.” And he reiterated this in a statement to CoinDesk on Friday, saying that ""Coinbase's staking program is not affected by [the Kraken] news. Staking on Coinbase continues to be available and staked assets continue to earn protocol rewards. What’s clear from [the] announcement is that Kraken was essentially offering a yield product. Coinbase’s staking services are fundamentally different and are not securities. For example, our customers’ rewards depend on the rewards paid by the protocol, and commissions we disclose. Rules making clear these distinctions would provide real clarity to consumers, investors, and the industry.”  Nevertheless, there’s plenty of speculation the SEC could be coming for all staking platforms.  Only a very small percentage of Coinbase’s revenue currently comes from its staking product, which means that the impact would be relatively low, said Needham’s John Todaro in a report on Friday. According to Coinbase itself, ""staking revenue was less than 3% of our revenue through Q3’22 after accounting for customer reward payouts.""  However, Todaro noted that staking has high potential for future growth and could potentially be a substantial revenue stream by the end of the year.  Todara pointed out that of roughly 20 million ether (ETH) in custody on Coinbase, only 2.1 million are currently being staked. He thinks staking revenue for the exchange in 2023 could top $400 million if the SEC doesn’t get in the way. And analysts at Coinbase wrote in a report that the shutdown of Kraken’s services will likely affect the “pace of staking growth going forward.”  The team at JPMorgan is somewhat in agreement with Coinbase’s Grewal, saying the SEC charges against Kraken seem to be against specific parts of that exchange’s service rather than proof-of-stake as a consensus mechanism.  “While Coinbase does not seem to see an immediate threat to its Earn program as a result of yesterday’s settlement, our sense is that the market believes yesterday’s SEC action is not a one-off event,” the JPMorgan analyst added. “Accordingly, the bigger question for Coinbase and its peers moving forward will be around what other products and services the agency may seek to regulate next, with near-term headline uncertainty spooking investors.”  UPDATE (Feb. 10, 19:22 UTC): Added reason for Coinbase stock's decline on Thursday.

42414480,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB7SC5,1676054516,"Polygon Exploring Use of ZK Technology for Main Chain, Co-Founder Bjelic Says","Polygon, an Ethereum scaling project, is exploring ways to bring “zero knowledge,” or ZK, technology – seen by many experts as a major advancement in cryptography’s use in blockchains – to its main chain.  The effort is in addition to Polygon’s ongoing and previously disclosed plans to release a “ZK rollup” – a type of layer 2 scaling system that aims to increase the speed of blockchain transactions and reduce their cost.  Mihailo Bjelic, Polygon’s co-founder, disclosed the exploratory work in an interview with CoinDesk, underscoring just how crucial ZK technology has become for the project's development road map. He said that some ZK-based enhancements could eventually be made to Polygon’s main proof-of-stake (POS) chain – a sidechain off Ethereum – as a way of improving transaction security.  By exploring how ZK technology can be integrated into Polygon’s mainchain, the blockchain is betting big that this scaling technique could drive its ecosystem.  “One of the things that we are experimenting with is upgrading the Polygon POS chain to become ZK-secure, so as to include the zkEVM into the Polygon POS chain itself,” Bjelic said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  The development is notable partly because Polygon has successfully attracted big corporate partners in recent years, lured by its fast and cheap transactions and marketing prowess. Meta Platforms announced in May that it will be supporting non-fungible tokens (NFT) from Polygon on Instagram, and investment-management giant Hamilton Lane opened the first of three ""tokenized"" funds on Polygon earlier this month.  Polygon's native MATIC token tumbled 70% last year in sync with the plunge in broader digital-asset markets. But the price has rebounded 70% already in 2023, or twice as much as the benchmark CoinDesk Market Index.  Polygon's ZK rollup, zkEVM  ZK rollups are a type of scaling system that processes transactions faster on the layer 2, or companion system, of a blockchain, then transporting the transaction data back to the mainnet blockchain – in this case Ethereum, which has been plagued at times in recent years with congestion and elevated fee rates. ZK rollups use “proofs” to show that a transaction is valid by only sharing a small amount of information about that transaction.  In October, Polygon released its zkEVM testnet, which deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its ZK rollup, meaning Ethereum developers won’t have to use new programming languages and can move over their smart contracts from the main blockchain without any hiccups. Polygon has not set a date for the release of its ZK rollup, other than to previously say it would happen in early 2023.  When released, the zkEVM will live on a separate chain, meaning that the Polygon POS chain will continue to be a sidechain. Sidechains are less secure than ZK rollups, since they don’t inherit the underlying same security from the main Ethereum blockchain.  “POS chain continues to exist and operate the way it does today. And the Polygon zkEVM will be a separate network,” Bjelic said. “We will have two networks running in parallel, with different value propositions, i.e., features and tradeoffs. Each application will be able to decide which level of security, scalability, and transaction fees they prefer, and basically choose the network accordingly.”  The difference between the two chains would be related to the level of security or the transaction throughput and fees that decentralized applications (dapps) would like to make use of.  The ZK rollup would store its transaction data on Ethereum, and completely derive its security from Ethereum, but the tradeoff is that the throughput is smaller, and transaction fees are more expensive. Crypto analysts have made the point that ZK technology can be computationally intensive, possibly even requiring dedicated “ZK acceleration hardware.”  If the Polygon POS becomes ZK-compatible, it would effectively become what’s known as a validium, which uses proofs like in ZK rollups to ensure that transactions aren’t spoofed with. Unlike a ZK rollup, it doesn’t store data on Ethereum, but off-chain on a separate network.  The validium on Polygon could allow for more transactions to be processed and at lower transaction fees, though it wouldn’t submit the transaction data to Ethereum, instead storing the data off-chain, which is considered less secure.  “This year is going to be very important for Polygon in terms of technology because we will be communicating several major tech milestones and upgrades,” Bjelic told CoinDesk.

In other words, it only has value if others agree that it has value. ""If you buy crypto-assets and the price goes to zero at some point, please don't be surprised and don't expect taxpayers to socialize your losses,"" he said at a Global Interdependence Center conference, ""Interdependence Digital Money, Decentralized Finance and the Puzzle of Crypto."" Waller said he doesn't care if people take on risky investments or engage in risky ventures, banks and other financial intermediaries, though ""must engage in any activity they do in a safe and sound manner."" ""I'm supportive of prudent innovation in the financial system, while at the same time concerned about banks engaging in activities that present a heightened risk of fraud and scams, legal uncertainties, and the prevalence of inaccurate and misleading financial disclosures,"" he said. For example, banks engaging in crypto-asset-related activities are required to meet ""know your customer"" and anti-money laundering rules. So far, there hasn't been significant spillover from crypto to other parts of the financial system. That's likely due to the ""relatively limited number of interconnections between the crypto ecosystem and the banking system,"" he said . 1:16 PM ET: Event concludes. 1:15 PM ET: While crypto assets are highly speculative, ""the blockchain technology is a fascinating idea."" The question: is Does blockchain have a use for outside of crypto?, he asked. ""I say let's find out,"" Waller said. 1:10 PM ET: Waller said a central bank digital currency may make sense in some other countries, but he doesn't see it as a value proposition in the U.S. Still, any decision on proceeding with a CBDC would need to come from Congress, he said. 12:53 PM ET: Decentralized developed as peer-to-peer trading of crypto, without an intermediary, Waller said. ""Original DeFi was a world of no trust, peer-to-peer trading."" The DeFi world is moving away from the true original intent, he said, as more intermediaries are get involved. Update at 12:48 PM ET: Waller didn't comment on the economy or monetary policy in the prepared speech. Q&A section of presentation has begun.

42414506,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB7T8S,1676050791,Tether's Attempt to Block CoinDesk's Request for Stablecoin Reserve Records Dismissed by New York Court,"A New York judge on Friday rejected an attempt by iFinex and related companies, which include cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin issuer Tether, to block CoinDesk's request for information about the financial reserves backing the USDT token.  New York Supreme Court Justice Laurence Love ruled that he would deny and dismiss the companies' petition to block CoinDesk's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request to the New York State Attorney General's (NYAG) office for documents. The NYAG's office investigated Tether and Bitfinex on allegations that USDT, the dollar-pegged stablecoin that Tether issues, was not sufficiently backed by reserves from mid-2019 to early 2021, settling charges with the company at the end of that period.  USDT is the world's largest stablecoin, currently worth about $68 billion, and serves as a key piece of infrastructure in the crypto ecosystem that facilitates the movement of money around the globe.  In June 2021, CoinDesk filed a FOIL request for some of the documents from that inquiry, specifically asking for documents about Tether's reserves. The stablecoin issuer petitioned the New York Supreme Court to block the release of these documents. CoinDesk joined the case to argue for releasing the documents in the public interest. Tether opposed CoinDesk's involvement.  Tether did not prove it would suffer a ""substantive competitive injury"" that would meet the FOIL rules' parameters, the judge wrote in his ruling Friday, adding that he reviewed materials submitted by the crypto companies and found ""absolutely no items that could be described as unpredictable or proprietary.""  ""The Court doubts that Petitioners could develop a more boilerplate protocol if they tried,"" the judge wrote.

42414489,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB7T39,1676050493,Uniswap Vote on BNB Deployment Ends With Silicon Valley’s A16Z on Losing Side,"Community members of Uniswap, the leading decentralized crypto exchange (DEX), voted to deploy to Binance’s BNB blockchain using the Wormhole bridge, the culmination of a behind-the-scenes political battle that ended with the big Silicon Valley venture-capital project backer Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) on the losing side.  This week’s vote by the Uniswap DAO – a decentralized autonomous organization that allows Uniswap (UNI) token-holders to weigh in on protocol changes – closed Friday with 66% in favor of deploying Uniswap onto BNB Chain, and 34% opposed.  The lead dissenter was a16z, Uniswap’s largest investor, which had pushed instead for one of its own portfolio companies, LayerZero, to be used as the cross-chain bridge. LayerZero lost a previous community poll to become Uniswap’s official Ethereum-to-BNB bridge service – a piece of infrastructure necessary to keep Uniswap’s governance process up and running on BNB Chain.  This week’s followup vote, which was open from Feb. 2-10, officially ratified Wormhole, a LayerZero competitor, as Uniswap’s partner. The vote turned contentious after a16z elected against it and raised issues with Wormhole’s security in a Uniswap community forum post. Separate allegations were made about deficiencies in LayerZero’s security.  “[W]e do not believe Wormhole offers the most secure or decentralized bridging option,” wrote Porter Smith, a partner at a16z Crypto, citing last year’s $326 million hack of the Wormhole platform as a key factor in the firm’s opinion. An a16z representative also told CoinDesk the firm took issue with the process the DAO used to assess different bridge options, suggesting the community re-do the vote after completing a more formal review of the bridge contenters.  A16z’s 15 million “no” votes did not ultimately block the BNB-deployment from passing, but they nonetheless raised questions in the broader crypto community around the venture firm’s influence within Uniswap’s governance system.  Read more: Contentious Uniswap Vote Highlights the Opaqueness of Decentralized Governance  Robert Leshner, the founder of crypto lending platform Compound, voted in favor of Uniswap’s BNB Chain deployment despite also being a LayerZero investor.  “I think these contentious votes show that there are genuine differences of opinion within the community,” he told CoinDesk TV on Friday. “I think its healthy for there to be debate. If things just get rubber-stamped or steamrolled, then it’s in the counter-interests of the community.”  Uniswap is racing to launch its new version (v)3 platform onto BNB Chain before April 1, when a business license expiry could leave room for copycat platforms to clone Uniswap’s v3 software to build competitors. The platform is aiming to avoid a replay of 2020’s vampire attacks, when the upstart SushiSwap DEX used a line-for-line copy of Uniswap’s open-source code to lure away many of its users.  “I think it’s possible that I would have voted differently if there was another five months to deploy this, but every delay in getting Uniswap deployed is jeopardizing its market position,” said Leshner.  Uniswap v3 is currently live on Ethereum and a handful of other blockchains, and it has over $1 billion in daily trading volume. It is the newest iteration of the Uniswap DEX protocol, which was the first platform to use the now-ubiquitous automated market maker model – a technology that allows people to swap between different cryptocurrencies without relying on a middleman.  When Uniswap arrives on BNB Chain – a popular blockchain built by the crypto exchange giant Binance – it will face competition from PancakeSwap, currently the chain’s largest DEX.

42411212,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCk3,1676045582,Stablecoins Are Not Worth the Risk,"For the crypto wealthy, hope springs eternal but the rest of us should be very skeptical. Even after the collapse of many crypto companies erased the industry’s credibility along with a lot of fake and real money, the Republican House of Representatives majority wants to dole out favors for stablecoin issuers, the supposedly durable crypto asset.  It’s not worth the risk.  Mark Hays is senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based economic rights coalition.  Stablecoins have provided little that’s new or useful, are not stable – some had shorter life spans than Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX – and have cost everyday people dearly. Any legislation addressing them should fully embrace existing policies meant to protect consumers. Or the U.S. Congress could simply support regulators – with additional resources, if needed – to do their job, using time-tested methods.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose price is pegged to a reference point, often the U.S. dollar, and are collateralized, often in opaque ways. Sometimes it’s a dollar or low-risk liquid assets like U.S. government bonds, other crypto assets or even a computer algorithm designed to maintain a coin’s value. Stablecoins aim to mitigate crypto’s infamous volatility and smooth trading.  In theory, stablecoins could be used widely for ordinary payments. But no stablecoins show signs of functioning at scale. High fees, slow processing speeds and other barriers make them expensive and inconvenient. Nor are they very stable. By some estimates, at least two dozen stablecoins have failed since their introduction – some quietly, and others loudly like Terra, whose disintegration may have contributed to the demise of FTX.  Read more: Stablecoin Issuer Paxos Is Being Investigated by New York Regulator  Regulators have repeatedly fined tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market share, for misleading consumers about the quality of their reserve assets, and the firm has yet to provide a full audit of its reserves. Tether, which issues USDT, also has deep ties to both the disgraced FTX and crypto giant Binance. Circle, the USDC stablecoin firm that poses as crypto’s white knight, keeps saying it will seek a bank charter to bolster its credibility but never seems to follow through. Perhaps the investigation of Circle by the Securities and Exchange Commission is complicating that plan? Paxos, another stablecoin issuer that aspires to respectability, is now facing a probe by New York authorities.  Stablecoins are the speculator’s “poker chips” used for the crypto casino, in the words of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. So, stablecoins look very much like Wall Street, contrary to the crypto mythologizing about a new kind of finance. When a stablecoin gets shaky, it comes unpegged and spurs a rush to redeem the coins before its value declines to nothing. It has happened already, and crypto speculators are angling for a repeat; they have built up a massive short position against Tether, betting on its failure.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  Regulators already have tools to deal with stablecoins. If stablecoins function as bank deposits, then their issuers should apply for bank charters, have deposit insurance, follow prudential standards, and be subject to supervision. Or regulators could keep these assets away from banking and payments entirely and oversee them as speculative instruments they are now by requiring registration, transparency about reserves and other measures that securities issuers already follow. The Department of Justice could also crank up enforcement of Glass-Steagall Act provisions that prohibit deposit-like instruments unless fully regulated under a banking supervision approach or a securities regulatory regime.  Legislative giveaways are the last thing the country needs.  Congress could play a constructive role here without legislation. Continued regulatory action that would force stablecoin issuers to declare their digital creations for what they are, not what they wish them to be. Happily, the White House appears to sympathize with this view; in a blog last month, it expressed skepticism toward stablecoins and noted the systemic risks posed by their widespread usage.  The legislative campaign on behalf of the crypto industry, which bought its way into the political process remarkably quickly, is taking shape in the new Congress.  Under its new chair, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the House Financial Services Committee will have a new subcommittee largely devoted to doing this industry’s bidding. A top McHenry aide is now cashing in as a lobbyist for Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital giant that has funded several stablecoin startups. Tether has hired a former Trump administration appointee’s PR firm.  There’s no sign a Republican-led committee might embrace regulations or legislation that bring stablecoin issuers into a sensible framework. Perhaps further crypto company meltdowns will change minds? With so many strikes against stablecoins, and with sensible alternatives measures available, legislative giveaways are the last thing anyone needs.",NEGATIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT | BNB,Mark Hays,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/10/stablecoins-are-not-worth-the-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba405fb557afbcd013a473832dfce6fe0aa48623-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412877,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qgW,1676044808,SEC Did Not Consult Industry Before Kraken Crypto Staking Charges: Commissioner Peirce,"PHILADELPHIA — The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not attempt to consult with the crypto industry before launching this week’s unregistered securities crackdown on staking-as-a-service, Commissioner Hester Peirce said Friday.  Speaking at a student conference at the University of Pennsylvania, Peirce said the top U.S. investments regulator’s lawsuit against Kraken crypto exchange was the latest example of regulation-by-enforcement in the digital assets space. On Thursday, Kraken paid $30 million and shut down its U.S. staking business after the SEC alleged it was violating federal securities law.  “We had not tried to sit down with people in the industry” to discuss staking, the process by which crypto holders delegate their tokens to validators in order to earn crypto rewards, Peirce said. She said the SEC has known about staking for a long time, and its decision to strike now was “arbitrary,” as was its targeting of Kraken’s staking business first.  Read more: Kraken Agreed to Shutter US Crypto-Staking Operations to Settle SEC Charges: Source  ""Yesterday’s decision basically said, ‘Let’s just shut it down.’ That can’t be the answer,"" the commissioner said.  Peirce's comments raise the prospect of SEC’s battle against Kraken’s staking turning into a wider war. Kraken is hardly the only U.S. entity that runs a staking business for U.S. customers. Publicly traded company Coinbase (COIN) also offers staking, and it has said that business remains online.  She took particular umbrage at the restrictive terms of Kraken’s settlement. It has vowed to never relaunch its staking business for U.S. customers, she said, meaning it can not even go through the motions of operating above board, in the SEC’s view, if it wanted to.  The SEC has taken an aggressive approach to oversight of the crypto industry under Chair Gary Gensler.

42410843,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1kz,1676044462,Are the Remaining Crypto Giants Staring Down the Barrel of the US Government’s Gun?,"The latest action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Kraken is probably only the first stirring of a U.S. government campaign to come for the major remaining crypto exchanges, according to industry lawyers, consultants and former regulators.  The San Francisco-based exchange inked a ground-shaking settlement with the SEC on Thursday, with Kraken agreeing to shutter its U.S. staking services and pay a $30 million fine amid agency accusations that the services amounted to a sale of securities. That enforcement action likely marks a beginning of similar cases putting big exchanges in the spotlight.  The chairman of the SEC has made plain his intent to come for the cryptocurrency titans, doing everything short of announcing a schedule of enforcement actions, and his counterpart at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is promising a big year. On the criminal side, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is unlikely to let other companies skate away from behaviors that warranted criminal charges in previous cases.  “We're in the early days of some major upheaval,” said Mick Mulvaney, a former acting White House chief of staff under former President Donald Trump, who is now advising a company in the digital-assets sector. “The industry is giving people that hate it a lot of ammunition.""  As Jaret Seiberg – an analyst with Cowen – put it: “We expect the SEC to rely on enforcement over the upcoming year to shape the crypto sector. We see the greatest threat to trading platforms, which we suspect the agency will contend are illegal exchanges.”  With the Kraken, Coinbase and Binance headlines, the industry is bracing itself.  When the Justice Department recently began preparing the ground for a major criminal announcement last month, crypto lobbyists and lawyers in Washington, D.C., thought prosecutors were going to announce a marquee name. When it turned out to be little-known, Hong Kong-based Bitzlato, industry professionals breathed a sigh of relief.  But the money-laundering case did mention that leading crypto platform Binance was one of the company’s major counterparties. Another of Bitzlato’s top counterparties, LocalBitcoins, announced it would shut down this week. One observer noted that prosecutors are usually hesitant to name other companies in legal actions, but they did this time.  Ongoing investigations  Binance and its executives have reportedly been in the Justice Department’s sights for potential criminal money-laundering charges. But it may draw SEC attention, too, because when the U.S. regulator went after its rival, FTX, the SEC named that exchange’s native token FTT a security, potentially meaning Binance’s BNB is similarly vulnerable.  Most recently, Binance admitted that it accidentally kept some of its own funds in the same wallet as user assets – the kind of commingling that often draws severe sanctions for regulated companies, even if the company discloses the breach itself.  The industry’s high-profile lapses over use of customer money – conjuring the specter of the collapse of MF Global for Washington’s regulatory community – has spurred a push to segregate crypto customers’ money as one of the main drives for lawmakers seeking to set up regulatory fences around crypto.  A lack of walls around investors’ crypto assets also sparked one of several run-ins another prominent exchange, Coinbase, has been having with the SEC.  A Coinbase statement created an uproar last year over how customer assets are maintained at the exchanges when the company disclosed investor money could be tied up in a hypothetical bankruptcy, and it accused SEC guidance for forcing it to make the statement. The company has also reportedly been dealing with an SEC investigation into a number of its business practices, including staking. As with Kraken, staking has been a significant service offered to Coinbase customers, though the company argued Thursday that Kraken was essentially offering a yield product while Coinbase isn’t.  “Coinbase’s staking services are fundamentally different and are not securities,” said Paul Grewal, chief legal officer, trying to head off the perception that the SEC is signaling that these common crypto services could be targeted at other companies.  Read More: Kraken to Shut US Crypto-Staking Service, Pay $30M Fine in SEC Settlement  But Coinbase’s most important dispute with the U.S. securities regulator may be the impasse over registering as an exchange. SEC Chair Gary Gensler never tires of telling the crypto industry that its exchanges must come in and register, because the “vast majority” of crypto tokens are securities, and exchanges like Coinbase that list them are breaking securities laws. Of course, those tokens are also unregistered, adding another layer of friction with the agency.  Coinbase has maintained that it would never allow securities on its platform, but the matter has been coming to a head. Last year, the SEC pursued an insider-trading case against a former Coinbase manager, and in its accusations identified nine tokens as securities, most of which traded at Coinbase. While the agency hasn’t yet gone after Coinbase with a direct enforcement action, it’s now on the record as flagging the trading of unregistered securities at the company and is on the hook for proving it in federal court.  Spokespeople for the DOJ and SEC declined to comment for this report. Representatives of Binance and Coinbase didn’t respond to requests for comment, and Kraken declined to comment, though it said of its settlement Thursday that it “neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s allegations.”  Crucial turn  If the government wages a legal war against the platforms for the way they do business – and not a reactive enforcement buzzsaw like the one that took down FTX – it could mark a crucial turn.  “The SEC has a number of options, and they're not going to be afraid to use them,” said Mark Hays, a senior policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform who supports the SEC putting tough limits on the industry. “It seems quite possible that a major platform could be subject to some of those things in the near future.”  The sector is already suffering through crypto winter and is reeling from a series of self-inflicted wounds that left it with a tattered reputation and a shortage of trusted institutions. While crypto purists take pride in the decentralization ethos they nurtured, the vast majority of people investing in digital assets prefer to hand over their assets to be handled by others. A new cage match with regulators could entangle the dwindling number of options.  “For an industry that's already seeing a lot of capital flying away from it, that's bound to have a major impact,” Hays said.  SEC chief Gensler has said the “runway is getting shorter” for the industry to satisfy compliance requirements, and he warned in a CNBC interview on Friday – after his agency moved against Kraken staking – that “other platforms should take note of this and seek to come into compliance.” At the CFTCm Chair Rostin Behnam said last week that this will be a “strong year of precedent-setting cases.”  Wait for Congress  There’s a race being run between the executive branch of the U.S. government – the Treasury Department, financial regulators and the Department of Justice – and federal lawmakers in the legislative. While Congress has the greater power to outline lasting rules for the industry, the likelihood that it’ll come up with crypto legislation before regulators make their moves is dwindling.  ""The risk is that Congress goes so slowly that the administration is able to do things that impact the basic fabric of the industry,” said Mulvaney, who served in the House of Representatives and also ran a regulatory agency before now advising Swiss startup Astra Protocol. “That is a valid concern, which is why those of us who are industry advocates hope that Congress moves quickly.""  Meanwhile, the inferno of FTX and some of the other crypto misdeeds are ""confirming some of people's darkest concerns about crypto and blockchain,"" he said, which further hinders the legislative process. However, he said it’s “not a capital offense” for the industry, and the current drama shouldn’t be terminal, because FTX was about people taking and misusing money, not failings in the technology.  Blaming the individuals instead of the innovations is a mantra catching on with Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who is now chairman of the House Financial Services Committee that will have an instrumental role in crypto legislation this year. He’s also building a case against Gensler as an instigator of the industry’s missteps.  “Gary Gensler’s regulation through enforcement isn’t protecting consumers,” McHenry said as his committee got to work last week. “Americans have lost billions of dollars in digital assets to bad actors on his watch.”  Gensler has never backed down from his simple claim that most of the industry is running afoul of securities laws, and most tokens meet the legal definitions of securities outlined in the so-called Howey Test. The industry, in turn, has steadily maintained that he’s asking them to sign up for a program that doesn’t exist.  No path  “The SEC has never said what a compliant crypto exchange would look like under a securities regulatory regime,” said TuongVy Le, who handles regulatory strategy at Bain Capital Crypto. “There’s just a lack of clarity there.”  Patrick Daugherty, a lawyer who once worked at the SEC but now represents crypto companies and exchanges, put it in more stark terms:  “There is no path available under current law for a crypto exchange to register with the SEC,” he said, citing a registered exchange’s requirements to maintain an audit trail, have only brokerages as members and trade only securities and nothing else. “There is no crypto exchange in existence that can comply.”  Daugherty, who works at Foley & Lardner in Chicago, said he doesn’t necessarily recommend his clients voluntarily go in and talk with the regulator, as Gensler often suggests. He said the agency never says yes to anything, and it sometimes uses what it learns in enforcement actions.  “I don’t think it’s the staff; I think it’s the chairman,” Daugherty said. “This is how Gensler chooses to do things""  But some crypto companies are negotiating settlements with the SEC, as Kraken did with this week’s action. That can be troubling, too, said Le, because the agency isn’t writing crypto rules; it’s steering the industry with its punishments.  Such deals are worked out in private negotiations with the companies, even though the outcomes may be expected to set industry precedent.  “The reason the rule-making process exists is so that these conversations are not all happening in back rooms somewhere,” Le said.  Though she said she can’t picture what a settlement looks like that breaks through the impasse of crypto platforms registering as exchanges, she hopes something is being worked out. Unlike many in the industry, she has an optimistic take on Gensler.  “I don’t think he wants to kill the whole industry,” she said.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/10/are-the-remaining-crypto-giants-staring-down-the-barrel-of-the-us-governments-gun,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff5dae99b58688078993b57721022b2c8e69436e-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410841,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1hg,1676037131,Ether Liquid Staking Platforms Will Benefit as SEC Actions Likely Fail to Deal DeFi's Knockout Blow,"Crypto exchange Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have settled over staking.  The regulated Kraken exchange has to pay a $30 million penalty and immediately cease its U.S. service. But, more importantly, staking continues in the United States. Staking refers to locking tokens for a set period of time to help support the operation of a blockchain. Liquid staking, on the other hand, issues a derivative token that represents the amount of locked tokens to user, allowing them to access decentralized finance (DeFi) services such as lending and borrowing.  The way Kraken offered staking was unique, which is why the exchange’s service was shuttered and the SEC didn’t go after Coinbase or make a move on decentralized liquid staking protocols.  As Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal explained in a statement: “What’s clear from today’s announcement is that Kraken was essentially offering a yield product. Coinbase’s staking services are fundamentally different and are not securities.”  On Coinbase, rewards paid out are based on the protocol and the exchange discloses its commissions, Grewal explained in a statement.  Lack of staking transparency affects Kraken  Central to the SEC’s statement is a lack of transparency on Kraken’s part. Yes, on-chain data shows that Kraken is one of the largest validators, operating a big staking pool. But the SEC seems to be concerned about fund flow: Is ether deposited into Kraken intended for staking really going to staking? Or is it being lent out?  Liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool wouldn’t have that same problem. One could track their ether from their wallet into the pool via a block explorer or other chain monitoring tools.  In the initial hours after the market learned about the SEC’s interest in going after staking, via a Brian Armstrong tweet, liquid staking tokens such as Lido’s LDO surged and surged again when Kraken’s U.S. staking shop closed its doors.  Some have argued these tokens surged because their decentralized nature would make them immune from American rules and mandate.  As crypto lawyer Preston Byrne pointed out in 2021 when analyzing the social network project BitClout, most decentralization is just theater.  There’s usually a server controlled by someone who pays the bills and has admin privileges. In an interview last year with CoinDesk, the co-founder of Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash said the protocol is autonomous and unstoppable. Yet, developers working on the protocol have been arrested on charges of facilitating money laundering.  A more reasonable explanation of the surge could come down to the SEC’s current ""Yellow Light"" towards staking. Staking as an investment strategy is not allowed, but staking as a technical service is.  As crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro tweeted: “Validation-as-a-service is not like an ‘earn’ program, not like taking capital into a business or fund. It’s a ministerial tech service.”  TVL gains remain muted  One thing that’s rather telling is that the total value locked of liquid staking protocols like Lido or Rocket Pool didn’t rise in the aftermath.  Since the start of the year, the total value locked in Lido has remained stable: It began the year at 4.9 million ether on Jan. 1, and is now around 5.19 million ether. Rocket Pool staked ether rose from around 472,000 to 608,000 during the same time period.  Meanwhile, LDO and RPL are up 13.2% and 17.4% respectively, a sign that staking is here to stay.",POSITIVE,LDO | RPL,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | LDO | RPL,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/10/ether-liquid-staking-platforms-will-benefit-as-sec-actions-likely-fail-to-deal-defis-knockout-blow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a4e5bf830d5c0005b5224f78ccd4de3a6bdbb92-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412892,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6quY,1676037010,SEC Chief Gensler Warns Crypto Firms to Comply With Rules After Kraken Shutters US Staking Program,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler is warning other platforms to ""take note"" of crypto exchange Kraken's move to halt its staking service in the country and cough up a $30 million fine.  ""Companies like Kraken can offer investment contracts and investment schemes, but they have to have full, fair and truthful disclosure. And this puts the investors who watch your program in a better position. That's our basic bargain. They were not complying with that basic law,"" Gensler said during a Friday appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""  When asked by show host Andrew Ross Sorkin how the enforcement action might apply to other yield-earning programs such as crypto exchange Coinbase's Earn program, Gensler said labels – whether a program is called ""lend,"" ""yield"" or ""earn"" – didn't matter as much as the underlying economics.  ""If somebody's taking their tokens and transferring it to that platform, the platform controls it and guess what happens if they go bankrupt? You stand in line at the bankruptcy court,"" Gensler said, taking aim at the string of bankruptcy cases in progress including that of crypto lender Celsius Network. A U.S. bankruptcy court judge ruled in January that any crypto deposited on the platform as part of its Earn program belonged to Celsius and not customers.  ""There's a saying in crypto that 'says not your keys, not your coins.' So those other platforms should take note of this and seek to come into compliance, do the proper disclosures and registration and the like,"" Gensler added.  Although the regulator has blocked crypto staking, which lets users lock their assets on platforms in exchange for a “reward” percentage over time, in the U.S. the firms offering those services may simply continue to do so from other jurisdictions, Sorkin noted to Gensler.  Gensler replied, “330 million Americans are our clients,” adding, “Kraken knew how to register, others know how to register, it's just a form on our website … And if they want to offer staking, we're neutral, come in [and] register because investors need that disclosure.”  An SEC official briefing reporters on Thursday said that a crypto company hoping to offer staking-as-a-service – as a registered securities offering under the regulator's purview – would have to first register as a securities platform before getting the agency's Division of Corporation Finance's approval on the product itself.  The SEC's enforcement action against Kraken has already invited criticism, even from within, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce calling it a ""paternalistic"" and ""lazy"" move.  ""Most concerning, though, is that our solution to a registration violation is to shut down entirely a program that has served people well,"" Peirce said.  Gensler said the regulator is using all available tools and is talking directly to market participants about compliance, and insisted that the regulator is ""technology neutral"" when asked if the SEC's goal is to try and keep crypto out of the mainstream financial system.  ""If this field has any chance of survival and success, it's time-tested rules and laws to protect the investing public disclosure for fair and truthful disclosure,"" Gensler said. ""Address conflicts and disaggregate these bundled businesses and don't have your hand in the customer's pocket using their funds or your own.""  Bankruptcy proceedings for collapsed crypto exchange FTX and U.S. fraud charges against its founder Sam Bankman-Fried allege the company had misappropriated customer funds.  When asked if a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) would allow investors to access the crypto via traditional exchange platform at market prices, Gensler said he won't say ""why"" but ""the path forward is well trodden.""  Large tech companies like Apple ""know how to register their offerings.""  ""It's time for this group to do so. The runway is getting awfully short. And we're here to try to protect the investing public,"" Gensler said.  The crypto market shed billions after news of the SEC's impending settlement with Kraken broke on Thursday.

The announcement coincided with the Friday launch of the startup’s ""Awesome Ajuna Avatars"" non-fungible token (NFT) game collection, which is inspired by the company's flagship game, BattleMogs.  The gaming platform previously raised $2 million in a February 2022 seed round led by Fundamental Labs. Other investors for that funding round included OKX Blockdream Ventures, Signum Capital and Animoca Brands - which investment in Ajuna's parent company BloGa Tech AG.  Ajuna offers a product suite that makes it possible for developers to use leading game development engines – Unreal and Unity – to create decentralized games, making it easier for both traditional developers and gamers to enter Web 3 gaming, according to a statement seen by CoinDesk on Friday. The game engines are run in off-chain, trusted execution environments (TEE) linked to the Polkadot blockchain to reduce latency, the company said.  Web3 gaming is an umbrella term to describe games that use cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFT) or blockchain technology to augment the user experience. The goal of these blockchain-based projects is to empower players and offer them more control over their digital identities and assets.  Read more: How to Level Up Your Knowledge of Web3 Gaming  The funding will help Ajuna add support for additional game engines, build out the TEEs and continue expanding on Polkadot, Ethereum and Polygon. Ajuna will also help support projects building and launching on its network, according to the company.  “We are thrilled to be leading this funding round into Ajuna. The platform empowers studios to incorporate immutable digital assets into their games, resulting in powerful new experiences for gamers,” said CMCC Global founding partner Charlie Morris.  Investing in Web3-related projects has gained traction this year, even as volume of investment in cryptocurrency companies plunged 91% in January from a year earlier, as reported by CoinDesk. The analysis showed that Web3 industry received the second most investments dollars, after Infrastructure projects, last month.  In fact, in a December interview with CoinDesk, David Pakman, managing partner and venture investing head at crypto-focused VC firm CoinFund, said he expects crypto investments to be continue to focus on areas including layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains, NFTs, gaming and the Web3 development stack that’s maturing enough to entice Web2 developers to make the jump.

42412894,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qvU,1676034576,DYdX DeFi Grants Renewal Proposal Spurs Polarized Community Discussion,"An ongoing proposal on decentralized exchange (DEX) platform dYdX that seeks the renewal of its decentralized finance (DeFi) grants program is seeing mixed community reactions.  The grants program aims to support the growth and development of the broader DeFi community that contributes to dYdX. Selected projects were provided with funding, resources and developer support and grants ranged from $10,000 to $100,000.  “Since the release of [version] 4 is currently scheduled for Q2 2023, we don’t think it makes much sense to launch dYdX grants proposal (DGP) 2.0 now,” developers wrote in the governance proposal. “Instead, as part of this proposal, we recommend using DGP v1.5’s remaining budget to continue operating the program until the timing is ready for DGP 2.0.""  “For now, due to conservative operations, the DGP still has plenty of funds to continue operating without needing a top-up from the community. As of this writing, the program has ~$2,700,000, which consists of ~$2,170,000 worth of DYDX and ~$530,000 worth of USDC,” developers said.  The renewal of the grants program is part of dYdX's ongoing efforts to support the growth and development of its popular trading protocol, which holds over $392 million in total locked value (TVL) as of Friday.  The proposal suggests making changes to the operational budget such as monthly compensation paid to trustees and grant leads, as well as reducing the overall number of multisigs from eight entities to just five.  Multisignature, commonly referred to as multisig, requires more than one signatory to authorize or sign transactions for any smart contract digitally.  So far, the program has funded 62 grants for a total of $2.1 million in funding in categories such as tooling, marketing and education, and community-led initiatives. It is open to projects of all sizes, from early-stage startups to established DeFi projects.  Divided community responses  The dYdX community had mixed opinions about the ongoing proposal. The community was mostly in favor of renewing the grant but flagged several limitations they had observed or experienced.  “Despite the successes that the program has had, I cannot support its continuation in its current form due to the severe lack of accountability and transparency,” wrote aluchard.eth, a community member.  “In my opinion, the grants team has added nothing but red tape to the process by unnecessarily restricting funding, haggling constantly with key team players, and attempting to replace team members that are performing to the required standard at the mid-late stages in the project,” they added, with the comments gained eight upvotes as of Friday.  Some members complained about the long wait times required to get a response from the team, as well as object to the “exaggerated salary” paid to Reverie, the grants lead at dYdX, who currently receives $70,000 a month in compensation.  Others members were more supportive, however.  “Our experience with the grants program has been largely a pleasant one,” wrote Max Holloway of Xenophon Labs, which received a grant. “We have been afforded the opportunity to work on projects that touch modules with high commercial impact, and we have generally been treated with respect and professionalism by the grants program.”",NEUTRAL,USDC | DYDX,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDC | DYDX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/10/dydx-defi-grants-renewal-proposal-spurs-polarized-community-discussion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d97fe6c631cbff5b963bc203ee4bb54cd4f85fd9-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC's official announcement confirmed a CoinDesk scoop from earlier in the day. The platforms offered the general public access to staking services since at least 2019. Governance tokens of the largest liquid staking protocols surged on the news, with LDO, the governance token of the largest liquid staking protocol Lido Finance with some $8.4 billion of staked ether (ETH) on the platform, jumping 10.4% in the hour after the SEC announcement.  Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) was a rare crypto in the green on Friday, gaining 7% as most other tokens were sizably lower. Hadera, often described as an alternative to blockchain which is able to quickly and cheaply process transactions, is now up 67% over the past month. The network announced earlier in the week that technology company Dell had joined its governing council to “help organizations explore distributed ledger technology.” The governing council already consisted of Google, IBM, LG and more.  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is investigating stablecoin issuer Paxos. The full scope of the probe is unclear and a NYDFS spokesperson said the agency could not comment on ongoing investigations. Paxos’ stablecoins include the Paxos dollar (USDP) and Binance USD (BUSD), a Binance-branded stablecoin offered through a white-label service. Paxos has been in the news recently over rumors that the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may ask it to withdraw its application for a full banking charter. Paxos has denied these rumors.

The 100 members of the team have been laid off, according to the report, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The company wants to prioritize shorter-term projects over those needing longer to generate meaningful revenue, the person said.  The cuts form part of Microsoft's broader plan to lay off 10,000 employees, about 4.5% of its workforce, announced last month.  Microsoft formed the Industrial Metaverse Core team in October to work with clients in health care, retail financial services and energy, among other industries, in building software interfaces that could be used to drive metaverse-related projects.  The metaverse is a conceptual world where the internet theoretically becomes an immersive virtual environment that can be used for work, play, socializing, and events. While major companies such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms (META) – the former Facebook that renamed itself in 2021 to reflect its aspirations – demonstrate enthusiasm for the metaverse, for the time being it is in its early stages of development and thus remains largely theoretical.

9181707,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577216-block-reasonably-priced-with-strong-potential?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1676028160,Block: Reasonably-Priced With Strong Potential,"Summary Square & Cash App are high-quality businesses on an individual level, driven by powerful cohort economics. Block’s long-term vision of an ‘Ecosystem of Ecosystems’ would be highly synergistic, provided management can execute. Based on my assumptions, Block’s fair value per share and my ‘Max Buy Price’ is near $74 representing a CAGR of 12% over the next 10 years. Investment Thesis Investor sentiment for Block ( SQ ) deteriorated throughout 2022, causing the stock to give up almost all gains from its Covid highs. In contrast to its price performance, Block's underlying businesses continued apace. With impressive cohort economics and expanding moats, Square and Cash App are the foundation for the company's vision to create an ecosystem connecting sellers and consumers. This integration of Square, Cash App, and Afterpay would be highly synergistic in my view but depends heavily upon execution. A new focus on profitable growth and a stock price near my estimate of fair value complement my long-term bullish investment thesis. Square Block's merchant business, Square, started with POS (point-of-sale) hardware but has since expanded to cover the vast majority of small-to-medium-sized business needs. This strategy has allowed Square to grow alongside and more effectively retain its customers. As customers' businesses grow, they tend to adopt more of Square's products, creating powerful cohort economics, revenue retention, and switching costs. Below is a chart of cohort ROIs dating back to 2012. A cohort is defined as the group of new customers from a specific quarter. ROI is measured here as cumulative cohort gross profit divided by the Sales & Marketing (S&M) expenses for the applicable period. Block Investor Day 2022 Square has historically been able to capture high rates of return on its S&M spend, with much of this gross profit recurring yearly. In addition, the payback period for the initial S&M spend usually occurs within 4 quarters. That means they recover the costs to acquire a cohort in under a year. With rapid payback periods and high long-term ROIs, Square merchants have tremendous customer lifetime value (CLV). Square's strategy of cross-selling to its merchants has also been effective in increasing CLV, with gross profit growing 3.5x as sellers adopt more products. Block Investor Day 2022 The switching costs inherent in this business model are clear as well. CEO Dorsey Explains : It also gave us resiliency. Sellers may hire us to do three or four jobs for them. If they aren't satisfied with one, they can fire us for that one, but they aren't firing our entire company. They may not use us for a loan, but will continue to use us for software, payments, register and CRM. It gives us time to address the issues for the service they fired, and perhaps in the future, they'll rehire us for that one too. Square's growth strategy going forward is centered around acquiring customers both internationally and up-market (larger merchants) and further developing its omnichannel offering (online, social, and in-person). The business has grown its share of international gross profit to 15% of total gross profit in Q3 of 2022, up from just 3% in 2015. Its international gross profit represented one of its fastest-growing categories as well, up 60% in 2021. Management estimates an international addressable market of $25B. With around $4B to $5B in company-wide gross profit, there is a sizable international runway for Square. Square stands to benefit from growing up-market as larger sellers tend to adopt more products, expanding the business's recurring gross profit and strengthening customer lock-in. They've already gained meaningful ground on this front, with mid-market sellers (>$500k annualized GPV) representing 40% of Q3 2022 GPV, up 22% YoY. The robust demand for omnichannel business software is evident, especially for smaller businesses, as it unlocks a wider customer base. Cash App Block's consumer finance business, Cash App, has grown to contribute roughly half of the company's total gross profit. Starting with peer-to-peer payments, Cash App quickly rose to the top of the heap, garnering massive brand awareness. Cash App has been the number 1 Finance app in the app store for 5 years, was the 8th most downloaded app in the US in 2021, and has around 80 million annual active users. Similar to Square, Cash App has demonstrated powerful cohort economics with payback periods under 12 months on customer acquisition spend and over 125% gross profit retention for each annual cohort in the last 4 years. Much of this growth and retention is driven by exploiting the app's network effects. Being one of the first P2P payment apps allowed Cash App to build its active user base quickly. With P2P payments, users pick the app their friends and family have and tend not to switch. With over 80 million annual actives, the focus is now on creating optionality for greater monetization of Cash App. New features in recent years like the Cash App Card, instant & direct deposits, and stock/crypto trading have been used to grow gross profit per user from $5 in 2016 to nearly $50 in 2021. Afterpay Synergies Block's long-term vision is the complete integration of its portfolio of seller-consumer businesses; an 'Ecosystem of Ecosystems'. Square and Cash App have a strong lock on their respective markets. One can imagine that the integration of a high-quality merchant business and a high-quality consumer business would create compelling synergies, which is exactly what Block aims to do via Afterpay. Afterpay, a leading buy-now-pay-later ('BNPL') company, was acquired by Block in early 2022. BNPL is a controversial business model but aims to add value by reinforcing consumer demand and driving greater sales on the merchant side, fitting nicely between Square and Cash App. Afterpay's synergies are fourfold. First, it has the potential to add over 140K active sellers and 20M active consumers (as of 2021) to Block's existing network. Second, it should drive increased sales and conversion (specifically omnichannel) for Square sellers. Third, it will strengthen the commerce features of Cash App, generating lead referrals and demand from users. Lastly, it unlocks advertising capabilities for Block as a whole. A complete integration would create a highly defensive business model through further enhanced network effects and switching costs. Additionally, the potential for transaction-based revenue would increase as money is kept within Block's ecosystem. Square sellers paying employees with Cash App, Cash App consumers purchasing from Square sellers, and other like-transactions could be highly monetizable. Risks & Uncertainty Integration of Block's three core businesses is attractive but depends heavily upon execution and continued efficacy. In the midst of a challenging economic environment, management highlighted their new focus on profitable growth in the company's Q3 2022 earnings call: Ultimately, we remain focused on balancing growth and profitability in this environment. We want to operate with efficiency and agility in 2023 and beyond with an increasing focus on not only top-line growth but also profitability across both adjusted EBITDA and profit metrics that factor in stock-based compensation, where we intend on driving leverage over time. They aim to do this mainly through reduced headcount and Sales & Marketing spend. This shift to profitability is positive for shareholders but lays more of a burden on management's capital allocation ability to effectively build out their 'Ecosystem of 'Ecosystems'. Integrating a sizable company like Afterpay is no easy feat and may require more capital than initially planned. Nonetheless, leadership has done well in fortifying Block's balance sheet with $5.4B in cash and a Debt-to-Equity of 33%. Another positive sign of management's allocation ability was purchasing Afterpay with all stock at a time when SQ stock was extremely expensive. The deal was announced in August of 2021 at a value of $29B. But by the time the deal closed in January of 2022, SQ stock had fallen and the deal was valued at $14B. The efficacy of Afterpay's integration also carries some uncertainty. The BNPL business model is relatively new and unproven long-term. It became popular during the extra-ordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic when many buyers were forced online and economic stimulus was in place. Peer stocks have also struggled since then, with names like Affirm ( AFRM ) falling over 70% in 2022. The upcoming Q4 and full fiscal year should give more insight into how the integration is progressing and if there are any early signs of synergies. Another risk is Block's exposure to bitcoin, as is evident by Block's YoY revenue growth of only 1.3% which was heavily impacted by poor bitcoin performance. Lastly, Block's merchant and consumer businesses are exposed to fluctuations in the business cycle. Elevated prices, rising rates, and wavering consumer demand hurt Block throughout 2022. An uncertain macroeconomic outlook could continue to weight on the company's near-term performance. Valuation Moving to valuation, I expect Block to grow revenues by 27% in FY23 tapering down to 8% in year 10 of my forecast, representing an annual clip of 12.5%. Revenue growth will be primarily driven by the continued penetration of Square and Cash App into their combined nearly $200B market for gross profit alone. Revenue should also be impacted as they realize synergies from the Afterpay integration, but I have left growth conservative and would be happy to see them beat my expectations. I expect gross margins to slowly expand to 35% in year 10 driven by Square and Cash App's strong cohort economics. I also see Block reducing SG&A margins over my forecast to 12% of revenues (currently 20%) and R&D margin from 12% to 8% of revenues as they focus on a more disciplined approach. This results in EBIT margins climbing to the mid-teens by 2032. I expect change in net working capital, depreciation & amortization, and capex to remain relatively consistent with historical numbers as a percentage of incremental revenue. My estimate of fair value per share for SQ based on these assumptions is $73.48 per share. Author Additionally, I calculated the expected 10-year annual return and my current 'Max Buy Price' for SQ using a Price/FCFE exit multiple in year 10 and a hurdle rate (required rate of return) of 12%. In other words, I am looking to buy SQ at most around $74 to receive a 12% annual return for the next 10 years. At Block's current price near $82, the 10-year annual rate of return is about 10.8%. I also included a sensitivity analysis showing the impact on the 'Max Buy Price' if my assumptions are changed. Author Author Summary In summary, Block's legacy businesses, Square and Cash App, are worth owning in and of themselves. If management is able to successfully integrate the two via Afterpay, the result would be an even more defensive business driving strong long-term returns on capital in my view. I will be monitoring their progress on this front and increase my conviction in tandem. Lastly, SQ's recent run-up in price to the $80s has taken shares out of my buy range. I will look to add more in the $70s but believe 10-11% annual returns are attractive and rate the company a current Buy.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577216-block-reasonably-priced-with-strong-potential?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9181707.jpeg

42412891,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qtc,1676023649,Arbitrum-Based Radiant Capital Targets Outsized Platform Profitability With V2 Launch,"Arbitrum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Radiant will soon release its version 2 (v2) as part of a broader plan that developers say would eventually help make Radiant the “most profitable” protocol in the sector.  DeFi products rely on smart contacts instead of middlemen to provide users with financial services, such as lending and borrowing. Protocols rely on user-sourced liquidity to generate rewards, fees and revenues for both the platform and users – similar to a traditional company but without relying on a single entity.  Radiant’s product will eventually allow users to deposit any major asset on any major blockchain and borrow various supported assets across other blockchains. This is unlike most current DeFi products, which allow users to deposit and borrow assets only on one blockchain.  Over time, a cross-chain money market could serve as a major source of liquidity for DeFi applications on other blockchains, attracting revenues, generating fees and rewarding users with RDNT tokens in return for providing liquidity.  Yields offered on Radiant currently range from 2.5% APY on dai (DAI) deposits to 3.48% on tether (USDT) deposits. The platform generates revenues from borrowing interest and loan fees and locks up nearly $300 million across stablecoins, bitcoin and ether.  Radiant has already generated $5 million in fees for users. New features for the v2 launch include emissions granted only to ""club members"" who add value to the protocol, collateral support for over 20 new tokens and a distribution of the product on five other blockchains.  Radiant has also proposed changes to its tokenomics in a now-concluded proposal, aimed at creating a more sustainable model for the long-term future of the protocol.  Token emissions to lenders and borrowers would now occur over a five-year period compared to the earlier two-year period, allowing more resources for the team to fully develop the product.  Technical documents also show Radiant is introducing bounties, a new form of utility whereby only users who add liquidity to the protocol can earn RDNT emissions. The protocol will have the ability to ""disqualify"" ineligible users for bounties and further decentralize actions taken on the protocol.  Some analysts say such changes can fuel Radiant’s growth and add value to the RDNT token over time.  “By introducing a revised tokenomics model that focuses on a virtuous flywheel for long-term RDNT stakers, Radiant v2 constitutes an effective iterative upgrade on RDNT v1,” pseudonymous crypto investor and researcher DeFi Maestro told CoinDesk, adding that the “flywheel encourages users to participate more actively in the protocol via rewards incentives.”  “Investors are able to generate two sources of revenue from locking and staking their RDNT in Balancer LPs. The dLPs (locked liquidity provider tokens) also qualify them to earn additional yield through lending secondary assets for example ETH and USDC,” DeFi Maestro said, adding that sustainable revenues would eventually become “a major selling point for investors.”  The v2 is scheduled for a Feb. 16 launch as of Friday, with BNB Chain listed as the first blockchain outside of Arbitrum that Radiant would deploy on.

42412895,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qxM,1676022429,Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Seeks to Raise $14M From Bitmain Mining Vouchers,"Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network is hoping to raise more than $14 million by selling discount vouchers for mining company Bitmain before they expire as it seeks to restore funds to creditors.  The deal includes coupons that offer buyers of mining rigs a 10%-30% discount on future purchases from Bitmain, the maker of the Antminer range, as well as the credits that accrue when purchasers pay by installment.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July as crypto winter set in, and is now rushing to agree a winding-up plan that could include setting up a recovery corporation that offers creditors liquid crypto. The voucher sale proposal follows a similar deal by bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific, which received approval from a judge in the Southern District of Texas on Feb. 1 to sell Bitmain coupons in an attempt to raise $1 million.  “Current market conditions and the time to expiration offer the Debtors the greatest likelihood of obtaining maximum value for the Bitmain Coupons and the Bitmain Credits,” said a legal filing made on behalf of Celsius on Thursday. “The market value of the Bitmain Coupons decline as their expiration dates near until they are worth nothing.”  Celsius’ vouchers have a combined face value of over $48 million. The company reckons it can sell the coupons for $7.4 million and credits for $7 million on secondary markets, according to a statement by interim CEO Christopher Ferraro. The company said it was in discussions with six potential buyers for the coupons, sourced via mining broker Bitooda, Bitmain and Celsius’ own contacts.  A hearing in the Celsius case is due Feb. 15 in the Southern District of New York.

Long trades, or bets on higher prices, took 90% of the $220 million in liquidations on crypto futures trading over the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) fell nearly 5%. Bitcoin and ether futures cumulatively saw $100 million in liquidations, while futures tracking dogecoin (DOGE), solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and aptos (APT) took on $4 million in liquidations apiece.  That's the highest level of liquidations since November for long traders, or those who hold the security directly. Crypto exchange Binance took over $95 million in liquidations, the most among counterparties, with OKX taking $47 million.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position owing to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is when they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Liquidations data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.  Kraken agreed to “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges it offered unregistered securities.",NEGATIVE,BTC | APT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | APT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/10/long-traders-bear-brunt-as-bitcoin-ether-slide-spurs-220m-in-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e61567760017dab7c353b3cf145595e263dfc0fb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412893,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qwQ,1675993380,First Mover Asia: Kraken Crypto Staking Settlement Bedevils Markets as Bitcoin Lingers Below $21.9K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin swung below $22K after crypto exchange Kraken agreed to sunset its crypto staking operations; altcoins fell, although liquid staking tokens were an exception.  Insights: Whales are sending bitcoin back to exchanges, while retail investors are removing the asset. What could the trend mean?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,036 −39.8 ▼ 3.7% Bitcoin (BTC) $21,827 −1143.2 ▼ 5.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,546 −108.9 ▼ 6.6% S&P 500  4,081.50 −36.4 ▼ 0.9% Gold  $1,860 −17.6 ▼ 0.9% Nikkei 225  27,584.35 −22.1 ▼ 0.1% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  A Kraken Settlement, Fresh Regulatory Concerns and a Crypto Decline  So much for $24,000. Or $23,000.  Over a 24-hour period that raised fresh concerns about the future of crypto regulation, bitcoin tumbled to $21,827, a more than 5% drop that sent the largest cryptocurrency to its lowest level in about two weeks. Much of the decline came after crypto exchange Kraken agreed to “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges it offered unregistered securities.  “Today’s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair and truthful disclosure and investor protection,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said of the settlement.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Brett Sifling, an investment adviser at wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki, highlighted the need for improved regulation to help ""crypto truly to go to the next level.""  ""Innovation has outpaced the legislation that our government has put forward,"" Sifling said. ""We need some blood, some sign of trust that our government is going to back us and that there isn't just going to be the Wild West out there with a bunch of criminals in the industry, because it ultimately hurts the common person.""  He added: ""If we want wide-scale adoption, we need to have these rules in place so that we can ultimately build and have confidence putting investments into the market and knowing that they're not gonna disappear one day when you wake up.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, behaved similarly, dropping from its previous support comfortably above $1,600 to about $1,546, a 6.6% decline from Wednesday same time, that was part of a wider market downswing. The drop-off after a five-week spike began after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted Wednesday that his firm had heard rumors the SEC wanted to ban retail investors from engaging in crypto staking, the income-generating technique at the core of running blockchains including Ethereum.  Most other cryptos spent the day in solidly negative territory, although liquidity staking tokens were exceptions as LDO, the governance token of Lido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol with some $8.4 billion of staked ether (ETH) on the platform, jumping 10.4% in an hour at one point. LDO was more recently up about 2%. LDO competitor Rocket Pool’s RPL and smaller liquid staking platform’s tokens such as Persistence’s pSTAKE and StaFi’s FIS all rose handsomely in the aftermath of the Kraken announcement.  Equity markets unaffected by the crypto news fell more gently with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, each dropping about 1%. Investors had sent stocks higher earlier in the day after an encouraging increase in weekly jobless claims suggested that the hot job market might finally be cooling and that the U.S. central bank's monetary aggressiveness was working to staunch inflation. Job figures have remained stubbornly positive for months even as other indicators have suggested an economic contraction that historically leads to lower prices.  Gerber Kawasaki's Sifling was cautiously optimistic about crypto's path ahead, noting that bitcoin had been trading in a narrow range for months. ""Crypto has had a great run this year. Inflation is decelerating. The macro factors are improving. But it's still really been range bound, since August. I wouldn't get too excited yet until we come out of this range.""

The trend comes even as on-chain activity shows that smaller investors are removing BTC from exchanges.  As coin movement from exchanges is generally bullish, while the opposite is bearish, one interpretation is that both larger and smaller investors are wrong about which way the market is headed with the former too downcast and the latter overly optimistic.  The other interpretation, however, is that whales are simply managing their downside risk because they have more to potentially lose. Regardless, many market observers will likely continue to eye the trend.

42393943,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc44z,1675993155,"Bitzlato Co-Founder Released After Arrest in Moscow, Pledges Relaunch of Seized Exchange","Anton Shkurenko, a co-founder of Russian crypto exchange Bitzlato shuttered by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in January, disputed money laundering allegations by U.S. and E.U. authorities.  Shkurenko spoke with CoinDesk after Russian media reported he had been arrested in Moscow on Monday. He said he had been stopped by the police for an ID check, and was released after a conversation. Though he declined to identify what unit of law enforcement detained him, he said he signed an obligation to appear when requested by investigators and received a no-detention warrant to avoid further arrests.  Police detained him because he is on the Interpol wanted list, Shkurenko said, but he is unaware of any active criminal cases involving him in Russia. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t be speaking to you now,” he said on a Zoom call, sitting against what looked like an apartment wall decorated with patterned wallpaper.  “I hope I convinced the prosecutor of my innocence,” he said, adding he cannot disclose details of an ongoing investigation. Bitzlato shut down last month following a cross-jurisdictional investigation by several U.S. and European agencies, which found connections between the then-little-known exchange and darknet marketplace Hydra.  Shkurenko said he is a “tech consultant” for Bitzlato, but apparently one with a lot of power: He used to be one of the key holders for the exchange’s crypto wallets. He allegedly handed control over those wallets to other members of the team, he told CoinDesk.  As for Bitzlato and the allegations it processed over $700 millions of illicit funds, according to authorities, Shkurenko said the exchange did everything to cut off criminals and “is not ashamed” of its work. The U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) formally labeled the exchange a “primary money-laundering concern,” a powerful measure often used to cut off a business from the global financial system.  Bitzlato, Shkurenko said, was only “a bulletin board” for crypto trades. In an earlier interview given to a Russian YouTube channel, Shkurenko said Bitzlato did not have any bank accounts and all of its revenue came in crypto.  Even before the January enforcement action, Bitzlato had begun migrating its infrastructure from Europe to Russia, and most of the users’ funds are now under control of the team, he said. Bitzlato is ready to relaunch and gradually refund users who lost money as a result of the law enforcement shutdown, according to Shkurenko.  See also: Binance Named as Counterparty in FinCEN Order Against Bitzlato  It won’t take a lot of effort, he said: “I could launch the exchange from my apartment. Two small servers are enough.”  Arrests around the world  Bitzlato, a Hong Kong-registered exchange with Russian founders, had been operating since 2016 and went down in January, when Department of Justice representatives working with FinCEN arrested founder Anatoly Legkodymov in Miami and charged him with unlicensed money transmitting.  Almost simultaneously, Europol arrested four more people allegedly connected to Bitzlato in Europe and seized a server hosting the exchange's hot wallet at a data center in France. As a result, the authorities confiscated 18 million euros worth of crypto – accounting for 35% of Bitzlato users’ funds, Shkurenko said. European authorities also froze over 100 accounts at other crypto exchanges linked to Bitzlato, bringing $32 million euros worth of assets under their custody.  The U.S. Department of Justice said Bitzlato's largest counterparty was the sanctioned and now defunct darknet marketplace Hydra. It also received over $15 million of ransomware proceeds, and had associations with a Russia-based Ponzi scheme “TheFiniko.” Europol said 46% of all the crypto that went through Bitzlato, worth roughly 1 billion euro, “had links to criminal activities.” Also according to Europol, 3,500 bitcoin addresses and over a 1,000 user details from Bitzlato systems “showed links with various criminal cases reported in Europol’s systems.”  In an interview to a Russian-language crypto YouTube channel Satoshkin Live on Jan. 31, Shkurenko identified the four people arrested in Europe in January as the former CEO Mikhail Lunev, marketing director Alexander Goncharenko, contractor Pavel Lerner and dev-ops engineer Konstantin (no family name). The first three are still in custody, while Konstantin was released on bail and is currently in Cyprus.  Legkodymov remains in custody in the U.S.  Dirty crypto  The DOJ and Europol said the flow of criminal money was a result of Bitzlato’s loose approach to KYC (know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) measures. Shkurenko claimed Bitzlato has been following E.U. protocols and using “AML services,” which would flag suspicious transactions and trigger an investigation at the company, since July 2021.  “How should I react when a person...gives me money, until there are criminal allegations against him?”  Shkurenko declined to name exactly what blockchain analytics products Bitzlato used, saying he did not wish to cause problems for the provider.  Shkurenko also claims Bitzlato always responded to requests from law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Asked if he remembers what came out of those interactions he said he did not check. In general, Bitzlato’s approach was to presume all users innocent until proven guilty, Shkurenko said.  “How should I react when a person standing in front of me gives me money, until there are criminal allegations against him?” he said. The answer for Bitzlato apparently was: do nothing.  At the same time, he said the team was proactive about catching potentially criminal use of the exchange and from time-to-time even browsed the Hydra darknet marketplace in search of Bitzlato users. When found, those accounts would be blocked, he said. On one occasion, Shkurenko recalled, a tech support employee walking to the office saw an ad for an illicit drug shop painted on a fence – it turned out to be a Bitzlato user, upon investigation. The exchange blocked the account, he said.  According to U.S. court documents in Legkodymov’s case, “although Bitzlato sometimes blocked or terminated users who had transacted with Hydra or were otherwise suspected of engaging in drug transactions, its employees sometimes helped users to carry out transactions with Hydra, and sometimes took no action either way.”  An old exchange  Legkodymov and Shkurenko were former coworkers at Russia’s government-owned communications provider Rostelecom, who quit to start other businesses. One effort, a joint crypto mining business named A-XBT, operated mining farms in Russia, China and Abkhazia (a breakaway region of Georgia with a disputed international status).  According to Russia’s company registry, A-XBT’s revenue in 2021 was a bit over $1 million. However, a year later, the company ceased operations after Russian law enforcement opened a criminal case against the owner of the data center in Siberia where A-XBT hosted its ASIC mining machines, Shkurenko said. After that, Shkurenko and Legkodymov decided the project did not justify their efforts, he added.  The idea to open a crypto exchange, in 2016, came from the experience of operating mining farms in different regions, Shkurenko said. The partners realized there was no convenient way to trade bitcoin available to them, so they created a Telegram chat bot called BTC Banker, which matched crypto sellers and buyers – later it became Bitzlato.  Now, Bitzlato has over 100 employees, Shkurenko said.  Bitzlato was not the first Russian exchange facing legal crackdown for allegedly lax KYC and AML procedures. In October 2021, OFAC sanctioned SUEX, a Moscow-based OTC that processed large amounts of crypto linked to scams, drug market and ransomware. Soon after that, the agency sanctioned Chatex, a Telegram-based crypto trading and wallet service linked to SUEX.  See also: Shuttered Crypto Exchange Bitzlato Says It Plans to Resume Operations  In April 2022, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Garantex, another exchange with Russian roots. All four exchanges – SUEX, Chatex, Garantex and Bitzlato – used Binance as a major liquidity source.
