20194076,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560583,1700002836,"Stunning Correlation Emerges Between XRP And XLM, What’s Going On?","On Monday, news quickly spread after a BlackRock XRP ETF filing popped up on the Delaware Corp. Commission website. The filing has since been claimed to be false. But the damage was already done as the token’s price surged quickly before reversing. One interesting development from this event though was a curious correlation that emerged between the XRP price and the XLM price at the time. While the news was localized to XRP, XLM had surged just as much, emerging with a stunning correlation between the two. XRP And XLM Correlation Balloons In the wake of the rumored BlackRock XRP ETF filing pumping the token’s price, one enthusiast has noticed a significant correlation between XRP and XLM. Crypto analyst and educator Blockchain Backer took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal what he terms as one of the “most bizarre” moves. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 8800% Ascent to $35 Cardano (ADA), Here’s When The chart clearly shows the XLM price surging just as the BlackRock news broke with a straight green candle. Likewise, when the news was debunked and the XRP price began to fall, so did the XLM price, in an eerily similar fashion. In another post, Blockchain Backer revealed that XLM had followed XRP’s move in the 2-second timeframe. A chart shared with this post showed XRP’s movement and XLM’s movement on the same chart and the moves happened at almost the same time, as shown below: Source: X “The fake news was literally XRP specific, and would impact XRP only, not XLM. If anything, you’d expect XLM sell off like the rest of the market. Instead, it mirrors. Why?” the analyst wondered. XLM price retraces after pump | Source: XLMUSD on Tradingview.com Running A Similar Race XRP and XLM have always seemed to run in the same circles and the correlation in their price movements has been a testament to that. One X user, in response to Blockchain Backer’s post, reasoned that the correlation was because both digital assets actually “share the same holders.” One crypto analyst who has also closely tied the performance of XLM to that of XRP is Crypto Bilbuwoo. One of their long-running analysis includes both digital assets which the analyst expects to move toward new all-time highs in the same fashion. Related Reading: Top 5 Meme Coins That Are Outperforming The Altcoin Rally In an October 15 post, Crypto Bilbuwoo posited that “The chart shows that 1.618 Fibonacci ratio(XLM: 6.5$, XRP: 26~33$) will be completed at the end of December.” The last time this happened was back in 2017 and the analyst expects a repeat of that trend, saying there would be a 6,500% surge for both assets. Despite this correlation, Blockchain Backer still finds Monday’s simultaneous pump strange as he believes “those same holders would have dumped XLM for XRP. Not fomo bought XLM on that news story.” However, as another X user explains, “Not if they believe XLM and XRP are brother and sister. There are some influencers peddling this for years. Doesn’t make logical sense but does with that narrative. XLM would be next!” Follow Best Owie on X (formerly Twitter) for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet… Featured image from Guarda Wallet, chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,XLM | XRP,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | XLM | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/correlation-xrp-and-xlm/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Big declines across the board prompted over $307 million in liquidations of leveraged crypto long positions – bets on higher prices – over the past 24 hours, data from CoinGlass shows. This was the largest amount of liquidated longs in a day since August 17, when bitcoin [BTC] plunged from above $28,000 to about $25,000 in the space of a few minutes.  Today's wipeout happened as BTC tumbled 4% to $35,000 despite a generally supportive environment for risk assets following a cooler-than-expected October inflation reading that sent stocks sharply higher and bond yields substantially lower. The decline was broad-based across crypto, including ether's [ETH] 6% fall to below $2,000.  Read more: Bitcoin Drops 4% to $35K Despite Soaring Tradfi Markets, But Analysts Remain Optimistic  Today's action stands in contrast to that of the past few weeks which have been notable for ""short squeezes"" as rising asset prices forced liquidations of money-losing leveraged bets on lower prices.  Liquidations happen when an exchange is forced to close a leveraged trading position due to the partial or total loss of the trader's margin, or money down. Cascading liquidations can exacerbate price volatility as traders cover their positions, flushing out excess leverage on the market.  The large amount of liquidations suggests that the sudden decline in prices caught most investors off-guard, with 88,667 traders getting flushed, CoinGlass shows. Bitcoin traders suffered the most liquidations at $133 million, followed by ETH traders with some $70 million.

20192259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560684,1699999218,"Bearish Divergence? Bitcoin Price Rises, But Network Growth Sends Warning Signals","The recent Bitcoin (BTC) price surge has ignited renewed interest and confidence among investors, leading many to believe that the BTC bull run is accelerating. According to trader and crypto analyst Adrian Zduńczyk, Bitcoin has reached a new 52-week closing high and has maintained a close above the previous high of $32,000 for three consecutive weeks. This sustained upward momentum indicates a strong bullish trend sentiment and signals the beginning of the third wave of the Bitcoin bull run. Analyst Highlights Key Trends Zduńczyk points out several dominant trends that contribute to the positive outlook for Bitcoin. The rising 200-week and 50-week moving averages (MAs) highlight the long-term uptrend strength, with key support levels at $28,800 and $26,600. Additionally, there is a growing correlation with the S&P 500, as evidenced by the 7-week correlation coefficient of 0.34. This alignment with traditional markets suggests that Bitcoin increasingly trades similarly to the Nasdaq. Fundamental drivers also play a significant role in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Traders eagerly anticipate the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the upcoming fourth halving event. Related Reading: AVAX Price Boost Could Be From This Department, But Its TVL Sings A Different Tune Furthermore, according to Zduńczyk, the historical pattern of previous halvings indicates that Bitcoin has rallied significantly after each halving and has never retraced to pre-halving prices. Examining the daily trend, Zduńczyk highlights the technical strength demonstrated by Bitcoin’s reliable breakout above $32,000. Breakouts often lead to new trend formations that persist over time. Despite occasional volatility, the 50-day average true range (ATR) trend and the 50-day relative strength index (RSI) momentum trend are rising, indicating ongoing positive momentum. Bitcoin’s future appears promising, supported by positive market trends, fundamental drivers, and technical indicators. However, warning signs cast doubt on Bitcoin’s favorable outlook, as renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out. Bitcoin Bullish Momentum At Risk? Martinez draws attention to the bearish divergence between Bitcoin’s price and network growth, indicating a potential lack of sustained momentum in the ongoing uptrend. The chart above shows a notable disparity between the exponential rise in Bitcoin’s price and the dramatic decline in new addresses over recent days. This bearish divergence raises concerns about the overall strength of the current uptrend. While Bitcoin’s value has experienced significant gains, the number of new addresses created has decreased significantly. Related Reading: BlackRock’s XRP ETF Filing, Everything You Need To Know According to Martinez, this bearish divergence between Bitcoin’s price and network growth serves as an on-chain sell signal that traders should be aware of. The slowdown in network growth despite the price surge suggests that the current upward momentum may not have enough strength to sustain. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $36,200, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. However, it is still up a substantial 4.6% over the past 7 days. It remains to be seen if a surge in new addresses will be able to support BTC’s bullish momentum and break the current consolidation phase. Alternatively, the cryptocurrency could retest support levels in the coming days.

20190467,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560612,1699995622,"Why $36,300 Is the Key For Bitcoin’s Next Big Bounce: Insights From Liquidity Map","The Bitcoin price returned to its sideways price action following a powerful surge into new yearly highs. The cryptocurrency seems poised for further gains if bulls can hold a critical level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Ready To Go ‘Supersonic’, Analyst Says As of this writing, BTC trades at $36,370, with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the number one crypto by market capitalization recorded a 5% gain, while the sentiment in the sector looks mixed, with BTC recording losses as Ethereum and Solana stayed strong in the same period. Bitcoin Likely To Bounce If This Scenario Plays Out According to a pseudonym analyst, the liquidity in the Bitcoin spot market, measured by a “Liquidity Map,” has been allocated to the downside. This metric gauges the amount of leverage in the BTC/USDT trading pair. The chart below shows that BTC is trading close to a huge liquidation cluster. Overleverage positions create these levels and are often tapped by big players to exploit the liquidity. BTC whales chase liquidity, moving prices towards the biggest pools of overleveraged positions. If the $36,300 gets tapped, the next level of interest is located to the upside between $36,961 and $37,700. The analyst stated: Big clusters at $36K and ~$37K. Would expect there to be quite some positions build up around that 37K region mainly as we chopped around it all day yesterday. Bears are back in control on the LTF (Low Timeframe) below $36.3K I’d say. BTC Hits Local Top? On the other hand, the Bitcoin price could trend sideways between $36,300 and the high of its current range. Additional data from crypto analytics firm Bitfinex Alpha indicates that historical data hints at bad news for optimistic traders. The firm advises caution for traders as the liquidity gap in the Bitcoin spot market increases. Per recent data, BTC Short-Term Holders Realized Price (STH RP) bought the cryptocurrency at an average price of $30,380, which could incentivize these investors to take profit at current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs: BlackRock Takes The Fight To SEC With New Filing This is the first time STH has had an opportunity to make a big profit on their BTC holdings since April 2022 and December 2022. Historically, a monthly change in STH RP exceeding $2,000 often signals local peaks, particularly post-recovery in bear markets, as seen in the chart below. Concurrently, a negative monthly shift in LTH RP usually implies long-term holders are offloading their Bitcoin. The convergence of a $2,000 increase in monthly STH RP and a decline in LTH RP suggests a high likelihood of a local peak in Bitcoin’s price.

42392074,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzklh,1699995611,"Bitcoin Drops 4% to $35K Despite Soaring Tradfi Markets, But Analysts Remain Optimistic","Crypto markets suffered one of their worst drubbings in weeks on Tuesday despite welcome inflation data for October.  Bitcoin [BTC] briefly dove to as low as $34,970 during afternoon hours from near $36,600 this morning after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October came in flat versus expectations for a slight rise. At press time, bitcoin was recently changing hands at $35,300, down 3.7% over the past 24 hours.  Ether [ETH] tumbled almost 6% over the same time frame, losing the $2,000 level it previously regained last week for the first time since July on BlackRock's spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing.  Large-cap altcoins such as dogecoin [DOGE], Polygon's [MATIC] and Tron's [TRON] native tokens endured 6%-7% declines over the day.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], a broad basket of almost 200 cryptos, declined 4.5%, underscoring the market-wide losses.  Is the bitcoin price rally over?  Traditional markets, meanwhile, were all in on the idea that the Federal Reserve is now finished with rate hikes and indeed could be cutting rates in the first half of 2024. Late in the session Tuesday, the Nasdaq was higher by 2.3% (and now ahead more than 10% in November) and the S&P 500 was up 1.8%.  The action in bond markets was even more dramatic, with the 10-year Treasury yield plunging 20 basis points to 4.44%. Just three weeks ago, panicky action had taken the yield above 5% for the first time in more than 16 years. The dollar followed suit, with the DXY Index falling by a whopping 1.55%.  Despite the rough session today for crypto, slower inflation and lower bond yields may support prices, investment management firm Grayscale said in a Tuesday report. (Grayscale and CoinDesk share the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.)  ""We believe the recovery in crypto valuations can continue if real interest rates peak and we continue to see progress toward spot ETF approvals in the US market,"" the report noted.  ""ETF speculation is front and center for now, but the store of value narrative still holds and will give the asset a resilient and increasing floor,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, noted in an email to CoinDesk. ""I very much doubt that [the recent sell-off] means the rally is done for now.""  Acheson opined that the decline is ""more likely to do with sellers locking in profits ahead of what could be another SEC spot ETF delay.""  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) deadline to approve, deny or delay Hashdex's and Franklin Templeton's spot bitcoin ETF filings are due this Friday and while there's been a surge of enthusiasm regarding what could soon be approvals, most expect more delays this week.

42392069,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzkM3,1699993417,Fake BlackRock XRP Filing Referred to Delaware Department of Justice,"Delaware's Department of Justice may be investigating a fake filing Monday that suggested asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) was prepping the launch of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The filing, which still appeared on the Delaware Department of State's Division of Corporations website as of 2:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, is largely identical to last week's legitimate paperwork from BlackRock regarding its iShares Ethereum Trust product. That filing appeared last week just hours before the company submitted an application to U.S regulators for a spot ether ETF.  The fake XRP filing in minutes sent the token higher by more than 10% before a BlackRock spokesperson told CoinDesk it was not attempting to launch such a fund.  A spokesperson for the Delaware Department of State told CoinDesk on Tuesday that the matter had been referred to the state's Department of Justice.  ""Our only comment is that this matter has been referred to the Delaware Department of Justice,"" the spokesperson said.  A spokesperson for the Department of Justice did not immediately return a request for comment.  Questions have risen about the level of difficulty for filing for a Trust under a false name and entity and the verification process behind it. According to the Delaware website, there are seven steps required to form a new business entity, all of which seem to be able to be done by filling out interactive PDF forms on the website.

But even after growing so much, crypto analysts think that the main event is only beginning, expecting the token to cross the $1 mark once more and make it above $1.5. MATIC Price Could Mount 76% Rally To $1.5 Crypto analyst Babenski has laid out a scenario where the MATIC price could rise back above $1.5. The token has seen investors eagerly await its return and it is expected to be glorious. As the analyst outlines, the Polygon native token is still facing a bit of a resistance but a breakout above the $0.9 would spark a surge. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals One Major Reason The XRP Price Will Do Well In The Bull Run The analyst explains that the price is being held back but is trying to break out of the A&V pattern. Even the fact that the altcoin is trying to break out of this pattern is bullish and a complete break could see it rise up and clear the coveted $1 level. Source: Tradingview.com Also, this breakout could see the price rise as high as 76%, as Babenski notes. Such a surge would bring MATIC above $1.5. If this happens, it will be the first time in almost a year that the MATIC price has crossed this level and could signal the start of another bull rally. Maintaining A Bullish Outlook In addition to Babenki, another crypto analyst has taken to TradingView to share their own bullish outlook on the MATIC price. This time around, Nathan at MyCryptoParadise presents their analysis with the fact that MATIC seems to have a well-executed rounding bottom pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says One Day Left Until XRP Price Blast-Off, What To Expect Then using the daily candle, the analyst predicts a potential to break out from its current supply area. “A successful breakout would pave the way for MATIC to probability advance toward our targeted supply area,” Nathan said. The outcome and the expected peak of this breakout, although not as high as Babenski’s forecast, also put the price above $1.1. Source: Tradingview.com However, it is not a completely smooth road for the MATIC price here. This is because the analyst says that if the altcoin comes across any difficulty in breaking the supply area, then it could trigger a downtrend. This would cause the price to dip and head toward demand at $0.69. “The undesirable scenario unfolds if, during the retesting at the demand of $0.69, MATIC struggles to sustain its position and breaches the demand area,” says Nathan. “In such a case, MATIC would revert to a bearish movement, potentially retracing to the robust support area.” MATIC recovers to $0.93 | Source: MATICUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from The Daily Hodl, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,MATIC | XRP,ALTCOIN | ICO | MATIC | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/matic-price-rocket-above-1-5/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42392088,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzjbt,1699991463,‘We're Not Asking for Special Treatment’: Coin Center on the Proposed IRS Broker Rules,"This interview is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week, presented by TaxBit. It was excerpted from The Node newsletter.  The so-called broker rule, laid out by the IRS in a tax reporting proposal has been at times called unconstitutional, unprecedented in scope and an existential threat for the cryptocurrency industry. Indeed, by expanding the definition of a broker — a well-defined term in the context of traditional finance, with some analogues in the digital asset industry — to just about anything that touches code in crypto, the proposed rule would likely be “overbroad.” The rule has been officially adopted, the IRS is holding back-to-back hearings on the proposal, and has extended the public comment period — over 120,000 responses have already been filed.  One of those public comments was filed by industry advocates at Coin Center, which argued the broker rule is not only impossible to comply with but also likely a violation of U.S. crypto users and developers’ civil liberties. CoinDesk reached out to Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh to discuss where the IRS’ proposal comes from, how to fight it and whether there are any silver linings to this existential crypto crisis.  What do you make of the thousands of comments submitted to the IRS?  Well, I mean, this important topic. For decades we've had certain types of third-party tax reporting where the person is obligated to do the reporting is in a position of trust (i.e. traditional securities brokers or other financial intermediaries), and this is the first time that, through rulemaking, the IRS would be extending third-party reporting obligations to people who don't have traditional financial customer relationships at all to software developers.  I think rightfully a lot of people are alarmed about that. Some people filing comments might see their business become non-viable. They were just publishing software tools, and now have to create a relationship with customers in order to report information about their customers even though they didn't have customers before.  See also: How the Crypto Industry Responded to the IRS  For Coin Center, this is a clear civil liberties issue. Our comment letter focuses on the unreasonable violation of people's privacy and unreasonable obligation on software developers to be forced to collect information and report it, which is a type of compelled speech.  A term that seems to be coming up again and again is unprecedented. I was wondering if there is anything like this in either U.S. tax law or global policy?  It is unprecedented. It's important to articulate this clearly to people who haven't followed the debate, which started two years ago when Congress first passed the relevant statute in the Infrastructure Act that triggered this rulemaking. Coin Center and other advocates have no issue with third-party tax reporting.  I've always said if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck. A typical digital asset brokerage, like Coinbase, has a bunch of contractual relationships under common law — the exchange is in a position of trust vis-à-vis its customers and its customers' assets. And so just like a typical securities broker, or broker dealer regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), it makes sense to obligate a digital asset broker dealer with the same reporting obligations of a traditional asset dealer.  We're not asking for special treatment. If anything, the IRS took too long to come up with common sense guidance for how obvious brokers in the crypto space like Coinbase should be obligated to report. The IRS already had the authority, they didn't need Congress to act.  And then Congress acted…  In early draft language of the Infrastructure Act, there was statutory text that specifically called out noncustodial and decentralized exchanges to report, leading to a big fight. They created terms for noncustodial or decentralized platforms that needed to be defined so people could understand their obligations under the law.  Further, decentralized exchanges exist, which are just software. There's no public policy justification for obligating software developers to collect information on their users. And indeed, the opposite. It's unconstitutional. It's a First Amendment compelled speech issue and it's a Fourth Amendment warrantless search and seizure issue.  During the original fight, the draft language was thrown out and replaced with a much narrower definition of broker which looks very similar to the definition of broker in the traditional financial services industry. There was even a colloquy on the floor of the Senate, where Senator Portman — who first introduced the problematic language — said we have no intention to cover people who are not brokers as traditionally understood.  In the context of the brokerage rule: the thing we're asking for is to just be left alone  And so we had this fight already. And we thought we won. And then the IRS comes out with this rulemaking that acts as if the original discussion draft language never got thrown out.  It almost seems like you're saying there's a version of this proposal that could be workable, but it may already be enshrined in U.S. law.  So that's right. The existing standard for who is a broker for third-party tax reporting obligations hinges on a few definitions in the existing tax code. The big ones being who is a customer and what does it mean to “effect” transactions on behalf of a customer.  If you look at the tax code, those definitions hinge on the notion of an agency-like relationship, wherein they act in a customer’s best interest when going into the market to effect transactions on their behalf. There's no reason I would say why you can't just apply that same agency standard to persons acting as agents of customers for buying and selling crypto rather than just securities.  Now when you have a software developer, or you know the developers of a decentralized exchange, those people write software tools. And in the usual case, they have no agency relationship with their users. They don't have customers in the traditional sense. And so I think it's inappropriate to apply the same kind of reporting to those kinds of people.  Could you explain why DeFi protocols cannot provide the information the IRS is asking for?  The long and short of it is there's two different ways to run a business in this space. You can run a business where you have a relationship with your users and there's terms-of–service or other legally-binding instruments that obligate you to act on behalf of your users. And the alternative is, you could be in the business of just writing software that people use on their own to manifest their desires in buying and selling and trading. There are some businesses somewhere in between, but as a general rule, there are businesses that only publish software.  In our comment letter, we compared it to the government wanting to know which books Americans are buying and reading. And so in order to find that out, rather than obligating booksellers to collect information (which would also be constitutionally dubious), we're going to force authors to have in person book signing events where they'll be able to meet their readers and report on their reading habits.  It’s an extremely overbroad and constitutionally dubious regime, because if you're just writing software you don't have a personal relationship with your users.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the metaphor explains the privacy concerns too, because readers have a right to not having their reading preferences reported on? Or is it more complicated?  I mean, that's a compelling argument in and of itself. But there’s Fourth Amendment concerns in that, going from first principles, third-party reporting is a form of mass surveillance. We struck this bargain many, many years ago in traditional financial services where [as a society] we decided corporations don't have absolute rights to privacy because corporations are regulated entities and we want to make sure they're not abusing their customers.  So we allow for a certain amount of searches of their records to ensure that the laws are being followed. And in many cases we allow for the search and surveillance of businesses without warrants, which is a process that can be abused.  However, obligating persons who are not financial intermediaries, persons who are not in a position of trust and persons who historically have had no regulatory apparatus — like the financial regulatory apparatus in the securities, commodities or money services businesses context — regulating those people or obligating those people rather to do third party reporting is a whole different kind of search and seizure regime.  It’s just manifestly unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, because it goes well beyond the bounds of any reasonable administrative search. It obligates these entities to collect information as a quote unquote part of their business, who would never be part of their business.  If you're in the business of designing smart contract software and publishing it to an address on the Ethereum blockchain, such that people can use that smart contract to trade assets, there's no part of your business, irrespective of how profitable your business is, no part of your business makes it logical or sensible for you to collect personal information on the people who use that smart contract.  A big part of the reason people want to use DeFi is because they've lost trust in the financial system. And forcing software developers to become the trusted entities that people are trying to escape is deeply anti-innovation, deeply bad for customer privacy and civil rights.  How does 6050i relate to the broker rule?  When the Infrastructure Act passed Congress, it created two big new tax reporting regimes with respect to crypto. The other one is this broker rule and the other was 60501, which I called “cash and coin reporting.” 6050i is the part of the tax code that says if you're a business and you are paid $10,000 or more in cash and coins, you need to collect the name, physical address and taxpayer ID of the person paying you and file a report to the IRS and FinCEN.  Coin Center objected to those reporting requirements because the same Fourth Amendment analysis we just went through. It's been found constitutional for banks to collect records about their bank customers, because they're in this business of being a financial institution and they get certain favors from the government by going into that business. They get to operate as part of the payment system and access to the Federal Reserve. They have to compy to better ensure the safety of their customers and prevent the use of their business for money laundering purposes or tax evasion purposes. The trade off is quite reasonable: some amount of surveillance and government control in exchange for the opportunity to run a highly lucrative business where customers trust you with their money.  Where there's not the same trade off, like when we're talking about ordinary small businesses, it’s a different calculus. Why would I forego my right to privacy because I've decided to buy something from a small business?  When Congress decided to amend the Infrastructure Act to make it apply to crypto transactions: Now we have a situation where it's going to happen a lot. People often get paid $10,000 or more in crypto. Earning a bitcoin block reward if you're a bitcoin miner, is in theory, a reportable transaction, but good luck coming up with whose name and physical address and social security number you're supposed to put on that form when you get paid by the Bitcoin network.  Coin Center filed suit, too?  We're fighting 6050i in the courts. We have a lawsuit we're a co-plaintiff, because we've received transactions of $10,000 or more as donations and we don't want to collect this information about our donors. We're allowed to have an anonymous group of members as an association. Once the government starts having lists of who's a member of which political association, the government starts targeting people. We think we'll have an earlier dismissal overturned at the Circuit Court, but will then have to go back to the District Court to litigate the [case on its] merits.  See also: Coin Center Sues US Treasury Over 'Unconstitutional' Tax Reporting Rule  There are supposedly issues with how the IRS will collect this information too?  There are actually a lot of issues with how the IRS will collect 6050i forms. Chief among them is that it is not allowed to send them to FinCEN, which is how it does traditional coin and cash reporting because of quirks in how the law got amended. Further, it may not be prepared to collect these forms next tax year, which is a whole separate mess.  As for the broker rule, it's going to lead to a massive amount of data. Even the IRS has admitted that it's going to double or even triple the number of reports it gets and have said its not prepared. Maybe its saying that because it wants to convince Congress to give them more money. That's fair. But I think they've sort of shown their own hand here that they are creating a new reporting obligation that is just inappropriate — it is just too much private data for any entity to really be able to handle responsibly.  Big databases get hacked. And this is going to be an insanely sensitive database because it's going to be a list including home addresses of people who have large amounts of crypto.  Will this list improve tax compliance?  I don't think so. Like if you really want to improve tax compliance, you should just make it easier for obvious crypto brokers like Coinbase to do third-party reporting, which is the thing that we've been asking the IRS to do for years. And instead of doing that, we're obligating tens or hundreds of thousands of people, like software developers, to start collecting information in a way that doesn't make any sense.  Is there an argument to make that the IRS thinking about bespoke rules at all for crypto is a positive development?  100%. Putting aside the data concerns, cybersecurity risks, civil liberties offenses. It in a sense is helping to clarify that brokers dealing in digital assets are otherwise just like a securities broker, except they're dealing in digital assets. That alone would be a huge win for American crypto policy and American tax policy, because Coinbase and Kraken and others have wanted this clarity for a long time.  Anything we missed?  There is also a First Amendment argument against the IRS rulemaking. To someone who's not a constitutional lawyer, it might seem a little strange but it's pretty straightforward. In a nutshell, any kind of mandatory disclosures is a type of compelled speech. We're free in this country to not have to worry about getting approval of the things we speak and not have a government bureau tell us that we have to say certain things.  Now, purely non-controversial, factual disclosures can be compelled from businesses without violating the First Amendment. Like in advertising, the government can force tobacco companies to say the Surgeon General has found that cigarettes cause cancer. What you can't do is force companies to express a viewpoint or express something not strictly factual.  And the interesting thing about a third-party reporting requirement for software developers (rather than traditional brokers), is that by taking down information on their customers that they ordinarily do not collect and reporting it, they're not just reporting noncontroversial facts at that point. Traditional brokers collect this information anyway, so reporting is noncontroversial.  You're also forcing them to write a whole bunch of software. Not only that, but it’s software with a viewpoint behind it: that all transactions should actually be intermediated by trusted entities who collect information on behalf of the government. Software developers in DeFi have the opposite viewpoint. They don't want this information. They don't have customers in the traditional sense, and they don't want to have customers. They want to build tools that respect users’ privacy.  And so, third-party tax reporting is compelled speech. It would be a compulsion on software developers to write code that goes against their deeply held political and social beliefs.  The Supreme Court has recently vindicated the rights of software developers even in the online context in a case involving 303 Creative LLC, where Colorado was going to obligate web developers to create websites for clients in the context of same sex marriage.  As a privacy advocate and crypto advocate and cypherpunk: Does the fact that we're talking about crypto legality at all a sign the game itself is lost?  The point you're making is very true. There’s a related topic: banking crypto, right. I have a lot of trouble coming up with principled policy arguments for why we should find a way to fix that. You don't have a right to a bank account as an American. Maybe you shouldn't have talked about getting rid of the banks for all this time! To me, if the only thing that allows this technology to work is your ability to connect your bank account to your bitcoin exchange, then this technology doesn't work. And so and so I'm with you there, like I'm not gonna go advocate for a constitutional right to bank Bitcoiners.

We're not asking for the government to give us a right to a bank account. We're just asking for our First and Fourth Amendment rights to be vindicated, such that the people who write our software for us aren't forced to spy on us.

The statement read: “Here’s the news you’ve all been waiting for – the Midnight Network devnet is now LIVE. We can’t wait to hear your feedback and see what the community will build on. Let’s go!” This announcement heralds the beginning of a new era for the Cardano ecosystem, introducing the Midnight Network, a privacy-centric blockchain designed to address growing concerns over digital privacy. The devnet’s launch is a strategic move, emphasizing IOG’s commitment to enhancing data protection in blockchain technology. A key highlight of this initiative is the selection of 100 ‘Midnight Pioneers,’ chosen to access the early alpha release of the blockchain. These pioneers are tasked with developing data protection applications on a private network, thereby playing a pivotal role in refining Midnight’s capabilities. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 8800% Ascent to $35 Cardano (ADA), Here’s When In their announcement, the Midnight team also emphasized community engagement, promising future events like live webinars, Q&A sessions, and additional opportunities for developers to access the devnet. They also highlighted future opportunities for a broader spectrum of developers to access the devnet, hinting at an expansion of the devnet once initial progress is made. Alongside the Midnight blockchain, a new token named DUST will be introduced. DUST is integral to the functioning of the Midnight network, and its role and utility are emerging as key topics of discussion in the cryptocurrency community. Several high-ranked Cardano community members recently teased the possibility of a DUST airdrop to ADA holders. Impact On Cardano (ADA) Price The crypto market often witnesses significant price movements in response to major developments such as new project launches or airdrops. For Cardano, the launch of the Midnight Network and the introduction of the DUST token could have a potential impact on ADA’s price. Historically, announcing airdrops has led to a substantial increase in demand for the original cryptocurrency. This is primarily because token holders receive new tokens for free, incentivizing investors to buy e.g., ADA, in hopes of qualifying for the airdrop. Additionally, such announcements generate substantial media buzz and attract new investors, temporarily boosting the cryptocurrency price. Related Reading: Cardano October Whale Frenzy – What Lies Ahead For November? This phenomenon was observed in several instances, for example, with the Flare Network’s airdrop to XRP holders, which led to a spike in XRP’s price as investors bought in to qualify for the free Spark tokens. Similarly, Uniswap’s UNI airdrop in September 2020 led to a significant surge in both the trading volume and price of UNI, as it garnered considerable attention and value in the market. In light of these precedents, the launch of the Midnight Network and the introduction of DUST could potentially trigger a similar effect on the Cardano price. While an official announcement on the airdrop and a snapshot date is still open, it could catalyze a new rally in Cardano’s price. At press time, ADA traded at $0.3665.

42392073,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzkqp,1699986600,"Delaware, We Need to Talk","Some sectors of the crypto industry were excited (and/or confused) by an apparent BlackRock XRP Trust filing in the state of Delaware, suggesting the massive asset manager may try to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) after applying to launch bitcoin and ether ETFs. But, this filing was ""false.""  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Trust, but verify  The narrative  BlackRock isn't filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Let's look at why that was a question that needed answering.  Why it matters  Part of the regulatory concerns around crypto is that it's easy to manipulate. A token pumping some 10% before dropping again within an hour due to a fake corporate entity filing may not ease those concerns.  Breaking it down  Late Monday afternoon, someone filed for a Delaware entity called the iShares XRP Trust, a statutory trust whose details were identical to the iShares Ethereum Trust, an entity whose filing came hours before Blackrock and Nasdaq revealed they were applying to launch and make available to the investing public an ethereum ETF.  XRP's price spiked for a hot second, according to CoinGecko, while Crypto Twitter tried to figure out if the application was real. As CoinDesk's Danny Nelson pointed out, XRP is currently the subject of active litigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, suggesting it may be a poor asset for an ETF.  Spoiler alert: It was not a real filing.  ""This is false,"" a BlackRock spokesperson told one of my CoinDesk colleagues.  The thing is, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. Longtime CoinDesk readers may recall that in 2021, someone filed to create a pair of Grayscale trust products for the nahmii and theta tokens. The filings were similar to legitimate Grayscale filings but were not filed by the company itself, and were seemingly intended to pump the tokens' prices (Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk's parent, Digital Currency Group).  Monday's XRP filing may be the result of a similar move. While the Delaware XRP filing was similar to the real iShares Ethereum Trust filing, it was different from the real iShares Bitcoin Trust entity record. The registered agent for the Bitcoin Trust was Wilmington Trust, National Association, while the Ethereum Trust's registered agent was BlackRock Managing Director Daniel Schwieger.  The Delaware Division of Corporations website does not share a whole lot more information than the name of a trust and the registered agent. It does not suggest whether records are screened prior to being posted or if the person submitting the records genuinely represents whatever company they claim to represent.  Members of the public can purchase further information, though interestingly, the website suggested that buying these records would not answer any of those questions.  ""If you are requesting the $20 detailed information option, this application will not return actual images of the documents on record. This application will return a page listing the 5 most recent filings, franchise tax assessment, total authorized shares if applicable and tax due. Officer and Director names and addresses are maintained on the images of the annual reports and are not available through this application,"" the filing said.  I clicked through anyway and discovered that I couldn't pay for the records using a credit card. Instead, I had to input my bank details for a direct ACH debit.  Since the notice on the prior page specified that hitting purchase wouldn't get me the actual records I sought, I chose not to go through with the buy.  Instead, I called the Delaware Division of Corporations and found out that I can place an order for the documents (using credit cards!) on a different page, but will be receiving them via mail.  It's unclear whether there is any way for someone to tell, based on just the immediately-public information available, if a filing is legitimate, which is perhaps why we've now seen this happen twice.

International Deal to Combat Crypto Tax Evasion to Start 2027 as 48 Countries Sign Up: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has added its crypto framework to its Common Reporting Standard, meaning some 48 different countries are now committed to a tax transparency standard for crypto to crack down on tax evasion.  Taxes  Last week, I wrote about the IRS’ proposed rulemaking to define a ""broker"" for the purposes of crypto tax reporting, and the industry's responses (in general) at the time. It turns out many of the 120,000 comments may have been generated with the assistance of a large language model tool.  The IRS held a public hearing on Monday to discuss the industry's concerns. The responses from the industry representatives were roughly the same as what people (or a so-called artificial intelligence) wrote, if perhaps a bit more on-topic. What was more interesting is that the IRS and Treasury Department officials on the call seemed receptive. While this is by no means definitive, questions about how the proposal would apply to decentralized finance entities, stablecoins and other issues suggest the regulators may be open to revising some of the wording in response to industry concerns.  These questions included how brokers might identify non-fungible tokens (which may or may not be financial in nature) and what issues DeFi platforms might have.  Still, it may take the IRS and Treasury Department some time to publish a revised version. Though more than 124,000 comments have been submitted, only around 44,000 have been posted. IRS staffers may still be working through the other 80,000.  This week  Monday  15:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EST) The IRS and Treasury Department held a hearing on their proposed broker rule.  Tuesday  15:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EST) The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing with federal bank regulators. Crypto may come up, but some lawmakers may be more focused on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  17:00 UTC (12:00 p.m. EST) Genesis will have a hearing in its ongoing bankruptcy case over its proposed disclosure. Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  Wednesday  14:30 UTC (9:30 a.m. EST) The House Financial Services Committee will get its turn with federal bank regulators.  19:00 UTC (2:00 p.m. EST) The House Financial Services Committee's crypto subcommittee will hold a hearing on crypto's role in illicit finance.

Significance of Crypto.com Recent License According to the announcement, Crypto.com Dubai’s entity acquired the coveted Virtual Assets Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). This marks a major step for the firm as it aims to extend its services worldwide. The recently acquired VASP license will enable the firm to completely satisfy selected conditions and localization requirements outlined by VARA. In addition, it will allow the firm to launch operations, upon receiving operational approval notice from the regulatory body. Related Reading: Crypto.com Granted VASP Registration By Spain’s Central Bank Furthermore, it will enable the firm to offer regulated virtual asset service activities in the country. These include exchange services, broker-dealer services, management and investment services, and lending and borrowing services. These services are accessible to retail and institutional users in the market through the Crypto.com Exchange and Crypto.com App. The announcement also saw the company highlighting Dubai as its regional hub for the Middle East and Africa. According to Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, Dubai is one of the top markets for creating effective regulation for the crypto space. “Dubai continues to show it is a leading market when designing effective regulation for the crypto space while still supporting adoption and innovation,” the CEO stated. Since VARA released its specialized regulations for virtual assets in February 2023, Crypto.com has been working to be among the first virtual asset exchanges to operationalize its VASP Licence. Finally, the firm’s aim has been realized. “It is an incredible honor to be one of the first crypto exchanges to be granted a Virtual Asset Service Provider Licence by VARA,” Kris stated. The VASP license is one of the notable licenses acquired by the company this year. In March, Crypto.com also acquired an MVP Preparatory Licence from the Dubai regulatory authority. Latest License Might Propel Cronos (CRO) Price Over the past weeks, Cronos (CRO) has been seen as one of the best-performing coins.

42392071,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzkWJ,1699983929,Lessons from New York for California’s New Crypto Licensing Regime,"California Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature on the Digital Financial Assets Law last month sent shock waves through the industry and proved the old adage that scandal leads to reform. The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the indictment of Sam Bankman-Fried, and crypto-associated bank instability (Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank), true or not, spurred politicians to act. Perception is reality.  Linda A. Lacewell is the former Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, which licenses and regulates financial services including cryptocurrency companies.  The California bill is expressly based on New York’s bitlicense regime, written in 2015 and overseen by the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS). The California bill puts the onus of filling in the details to California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), itself a newly expanded and reorganized entity.  Many lessons may be learned from the New York experience. We know DFPI and DFS have been conferring. So, what should DFPI be prepared to do, and what should industry expect? Here are some thoughts and strategies for DFPI to consider and industry to anticipate.  Virtual currency companies, like most financial services companies, have multiple stakeholders. Consumers, investors, and industry are the relevant stakeholders and each must be served and protected. Protecting the consumer also protects both investors and the company itself against the risk of theft, hacking, and criminal acts.  In this regard, protecting the company against intrusion and attack must be a high priority. For financial services, cybersecurity is a central concern. The biggest risk to business and government bar none is cyber threats. New York’s regulatory standard, written and enforced by DFS, is the national standard and a model for other state and federal regulators, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the Federal Trade Commission. Here, the goal is to guard against theft of assets, crippling of cyber infrastructure, and ransomware attacks.  Criminal misuse  Companies must also guard against criminal misuse of their products and services. Anti money laundering and transactions monitoring must be tackled through robust policies. However, a successful compliance program is not just about the paperwork. Policies should be tailored to the business and must be consistently deployed and enforced. A responsible company will invest in these protective mechanisms even though it diminishes profits.  The agency should expressly forbid the commingling of company and customer funds, and examiners should test this issue. This violation was at the root of the collapse of FTX and loss of customer assets.  Regulating an industry in full for the first time is heavy lifting  Before issuing licenses, the agency should fully understand the company that seeks to be regulated. Rigorous disclosure of true owners hiding behind the veil of LLCs and other corporate vehicles, as well as relevant finances, must be enforced so that the appropriate risks can be mitigated. Transparency is key.  The agency would do well to draft the regulations long before they are due. The agency will want to hit the ground running as the effective date approaches. At the outset, define terms and determine the scope of regulation. Vagueness is one of the biggest industry criticisms of the bill. The regulations will be contentious and will benefit from broad input from industry, consumer groups, and experts. Consider private and public conferences to air views before pen is put to paper. Let all sides share input. This helps build smart and effective regulations while building trust and transparency.  Consider having companies register with the agency before they apply for licensing. This way the agency will have the universe of potential applicants, the ability to anticipate the potential workload, and the ability to communicate with potential applicants as a group. This is a time-tested strategy for new regulation of any financial services industry.  Plan to hire or reassign sufficient resources with the right experience to process applications, especially because an applicant is allowed to operate pre-licensing under certain conditions. In New York, we created a new Innovation and Research Division to elevate virtual currency as a priority and attract high-level talent. We also reassigned examiners to help clear backlogs of licensing applications. We streamlined review of applications and provided written guidance to industry.  The bill allows DFPI to give reciprocity to bitlicenses and limited purpose trust company charters granted by DFS on or before January 1, 2023. Long term, it would be helpful to work out an arrangement where DFS also gives reciprocity to virtual currency licenses granted by DFPI. This would reduce the burden on companies having to seek multiple licenses involving the same due diligence and compliance regimes. Reciprocity should ultimately go both ways between California and New York, the two most stringent virtual currency regulators with the lion’s share of virtual currency companies.  Heavy lifting  Regulating an industry in full for the first time is heavy lifting. DFPI might consider doing it in phases so that progress is made as the new regime is rolled out. Since you will be essentially building the plane as you fly it, be flexible, and be prepared to tailor it along the way. In New York, we continued to innovate with coin listing guidance and a conditional licensing framework. This paid off in dividends. PayPal was the first to obtain a conditional license from DFS, partnering with Paxos Trust Company to allow PayPal customers to buy, sell, and hold certain cryptocurrencies.  There is much work to do and no time to waste. The California bill is law and its licensing requirements become effective July 1, 2025. DFPI has eighteen months to issue the regulations. But industry does not need to wait to see the regulations to start fortifying defenses against money laundering, sanctions violators, and cyber intrusions, and building robust consumer disclosures and protections. Given the New York model, there should be no surprises as to the guardrails that will apply, so get started building them now.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Linda Lacewell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/14/lessons-from-new-york-for-californias-new-crypto-licensing-regime,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/541164b0605e4559bbd74168feb86eeda996de40-1264x533.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20183375,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560582,1699981235,"BlackRock’s XRP ETF Filing, Everything You Need To Know","Since Monday, discussions around the mysterious BlackRock XRP ETF filing that appeared in Delaware have dominated the crypto space. The news of the filing was initially debunked by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, but recent developments have raised suspicions that the filing was actually made by BlackRock. BlackRock XRP ETF Could Be Filed By Anyone One interesting revelation that has come from the BlackRock XRP ETF debacle is the fact that pretty much anyone can make an ETF Trust. Pro-XRP attorney Jeremy Hogan revealed this on X (formerly Twitter), saying that anyone could actually spoof an “XRP ETF” Trust. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs: BlackRock Takes The Fight To SEC With New Filing Hogan explains that while the filing is real, it is fraudulent and could be cheaply made with just $500. Apparently, all that is needed for such a Trust to appear on the Delaware Corp. Commission website is to fill out two documents. These include the ‘State of Delaware Certificate of Trust’ and the ‘State of Delaware – Division of Corporations’ documents. Then once the $500 fee is paid, Hogan says the filing then gets “a ‘placeholder’ on the state website.” The attorney reasons that whoever did this may have tried to replicate what happened when BlackRock filed for an Ethereum spot ETF. “criminal saw what happened with the Eth trust filing, files the XRP trust “filing,” buys $100k xrp on leverage, sells at 74 cents, and pockets 2-3 million dollars.” On the other end of this, Hogan also reasons that maybe “Blackrock has clients who want exposure to XRP and have begun the process.” Details Of The ‘Fake’ ETF Filing Another attorney, Fred Rispoli, also took to X (formerly Twitter) to give their own two cents on the BlackRock XRP ETF situation. Rispoli confirmed what Hogan said about anyone being able to fake such a filing and having it listed on the site. But other than that, the attorney went into the details of the filing. The XRP Trust filing reportedly matches the BlackRock Ethereum ETF filing with the exception of the name being changed and the date of the filing being different. However, the XRP Trust has a different registered agent than the BlackRock Bitcoin Trust but shares the same one with the Ethereum Trust. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Crash Before Spot ETF Approvals Rispoli adds that only the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin filing is currently listed on the SEC’s Edgar site, which is where filings with the regulator are listed. There is no trace of an iShares Ethereum and XRP Trust. “However, the Bitcoin Delaware filing preceded the SEC Registration statement by 7 days (6/8/23, 6/15/23),” the attorney said. He also added that there were no trademarks filed by BlackRock for all its crypto trusts filed this year, including the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ones. However, this is not out of the ordinary since the asset manager does not trademark all of its products. Finally, Rispoli explains that even if the BlackRock XRP Trust filing were true, it wouldn’t be the first one. That actually goes to Grayscale, which ran an XRP Trust between 2018 and 2021. However, the asset manager discontinued this trust after the SEC sued Ripple over alleged securities violations. BlackRock rumors sends price surging | Source: XRPUSD On Tradingview.com XRP Trust Filing Still Up Even though Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas had said that an insider at BlackRock had denied that the asset manager filed the XRP Trust, the filing remained on the Delaware Corp. Commission website. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals One Major Reason The XRP Price Will Do Well In The Bull Run This raised skepticism among investors who began to speculate that maybe the asset manager may have made the filing after all. “If it was fake, it would’ve been delisted by now,” WhaleWire said on X.

Confused and stressed out, you take to the internet and quickly find someone online who calls himself a crypto tax expert.  “Due to increased demand,” the crypto tax expert’s website says, “we have stopped offering free tax consultations.”  Reluctantly, you pay $250 up front and schedule a 30 minute consultation.  You need to get this sorted out.  Why is my crypto tax bill so much higher?  Once on the phone, the expert explains that the 1099s you received likely reported the gross proceeds of your trades and transfers without a detailed account of the basis, essentially the amount you spent to acquire the crypto.  This discrepancy is a common issue that crypto investors face, resulting in over-reported income and inflated tax bills. The misleading 1099s are the result of broker reporting regulations put into place by the IRS and Treasury department back in 2023.  To resolve this, you're advised to compile a comprehensive transaction history across all of your wallets to calculate the actual gains or losses incurred. Once calculated, you need to reconcile the actual gains with what’s reported on your 1099s, a process that is not only time-consuming but also requires a specialized understanding of both crypto transactions and tax laws.  The expert is quick to let you know he can handle all of this burdensome reporting for you for a one time payment of $4,000.  “$4,000?!”  Your jaw hits the floor.  “People actually pay that?” you ask the expert.  With a smile on his face, the expert replies, “My firm will do 350 of these just this week!”  Read more: Miles Fuller - The Tax Implications of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Conviction  As you delve deeper into the maze of reconciling your trades, you start to see all of the cost basis gaps in your 1099s from when you moved crypto from exchanges to your self-custodied wallets. On many of your 1099s, simple transfers to your wallets were marked as proceeds, dramatically increasing your reported gains.  After two weeks of trying to reconcile and account for everything yourself, you come to the conclusion that you are in over your head.  You give the expert a call back and complete the $4,000 payment.  “Thank you!” says the tax expert. “We look forward to working with you again next year.”  Conclusion  While this is a fictitious story, it represents a reality that the crypto industry will soon face as a result of the square-peg-in-a-round-hole broker reporting regulations proposed by the U.S. Treasury.  Cryptocurrency technology is built on open protocols. Copy-pasting 1099 information reporting rules as they exist for equity brokers, as the proposed regulations say, simply doesn’t work due to this technological underpinning.  Any market participant can connect to the Bitcoin blockchain. Anyone can freely send bitcoins from a wallet they possess to any other wallet in the world. No matter what laws and regulations get passed, this fact remains true.  The rules coming from the Treasury, which are currently in a comment period, will not only increase compliance costs for brokers, but they will also have the unintended consequence of increasing compliance costs for everyday investors who must reconcile inaccurate 1099s with their transaction history each year.  Hopefully the IRS works collaboratively and thoughtfully with industry to make sure this doesn’t happen.

Given how knowledgeable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler is about Bitcoin [BTC], it's hard to come up with a logical reason for his standing in the way of a spot ETF, said ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood in a CNBC appearance.

And Gary Gensler knows this, she added, having taught a course in crypto and blockchain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) prior to being SEC Chair.  Riffing, then, on what the explanation might be for the SEC's continued rejections of spot ETF applications, Wood referred to ""speculation"" surrounding Gensler's desire to be Treasury Secretary.

42392070,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzkRB,1699979206,What the IRS Gets Wrong About DeFi and Crypto in Its Latest Tax Reporting Proposal,"This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week, presented by TaxBit. The following is edited testimony of Blockchain Association senior counsel Marisa Coppel during a hearing on the proposed broker rulemaking on Monday, Nov. 13.  On Monday, Nov. 13, the Blockchain Association submitted comment in response to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed rulemaking on reporting for digital asset transactions. The association's letter addresses issues related to centralized entities, some of which operate in a similar manner to traditional middlemen or intermediaries. They arguably fall within the definition of a broker.  In our letter, we suggest several modifications to the proposal as applied to centralized entities, including increasing the time to comply, reducing the breadth in reporting requirements and refraining from applying the regulations to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and stablecoins.  However, this proposal also impacts decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-custodial wallet software developers. The proposal is overly broad and exceeds the U.S. Treasury Department’s statutory authority by pulling in participants who are not intermediaries or middlemen. Additionally, the proposal does not comport with Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requirements and would lead to constitutional rights violations.  See also: How a New Tax Proposal From the IRS Could Impact DeFi | Tax Week  This proposal sweeps in parties whose only means of compliance would be to abandon the decentralized technology that makes them unique. This construction will drive all U.S.-based decentralized projects abroad or out of existence, full stop. Compliance with this proposal would require centralization where none exists.  It is also wholly unclear as to whether certain participants have a reporting requirement at all – the language is vague, which would further make compliance impossible. And make it far more challenging for the IRS to achieve its goal of increasing compliance with tax reporting.  The proposal’s definition of “broker” should be limited to centralized entities, who can collect such information. This is what Congress intended when it initially set forth the clarified definition two years ago. And this is how the tax code’s broker reporting rules have functioned historically.  While the Biden administration's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was under consideration, Congress proposed a broader formulation of the definition of “broker,” which explicitly included “any decentralized exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace.” But Congress ultimately rejected that language.  Fast-forward to now, in this proposal, the IRS seems to have improperly read that language back into the definition of a “broker” by creating cascading, expansive terms in a way that dramatically departs from the concept of a middleman and the rules applicable to traditional assets. In particular, the regulatory proposal significantly expands certain terms and revises the definition of “broker” beyond the statutory definition.  The proposal’s definition of a “digital asset middleman,” for instance, pulls in any person providing a “facilitative service” who would “be in a position to know the identity of a party that makes the sale and the nature of the transaction.” This includes those who provide a service that “directly or indirectly effectuates a sale of digital assets.”  The terms “indirectly” and “in a position to know” would likely include developers of both decentralized finance and non-custodial wallet software, who are incapable of complying with broker reporting rules. Both types of software merely allow users to either connect and transact with one another, or with a smart contract itself.  In fact, software for decentralized applications does not “effectuate” transactions like a broker. And developers of such software certainly do not have access to the information required for reporting.  But this proposal fails to recognize the value of both decentralized and non-custodial software. Decentralized technology eliminates the intermediary or the traditional middleman, who necessarily carries risk. These risks include cybersecurity and data breaches, the risk of holding so much sensitive data under one person’s control, fraud and mismanagement.  Further, when you look at transaction functionality, centralized data storage it is often slow, cumbersome and inefficient. And it is expensive.  DeFi, however, eliminates risks of failure under one point of control. It is more efficient and costs less for the user.  Similarly, non-custodial wallet software enables users to hold custody of their assets. These users are the only ones who have access to their assets, which reduces risk of abuse, fraud or insecurity of middlemen.  This proposal would destroy all of that value.  Given the impossible nature of compliance, these software developers will be forced to either shut down their projects, move outside the U.S. or so fundamentally change the nature of their projects that it eliminates the benefits of decentralized and non-custodial technology entirely.  Congress did not express an intent to destroy DeFi. These issues are so profound as to raise significant Constitutional, Administrative Procedure Act and statutory authority questions.  The APA requires a reviewing court to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction,” or “unsupported by substantial evidence.” The proposal, if finalized, would fail each requirement.  Given the impact on DeFi and non-custodial wallet software in the U.S., clear Congressional authorization is required before the Treasury would have authority to require such reporting. Treasury has also not supported the proposal with substantial evidence or quantifies the costs or the benefits, as required by the APA.  See also: The IRS Should Offer a Free Tax Reporting Tool to DeFi Users | Opinion  Nor does the proposal estimate the cost burden on Treasury to process billions of new filings. Further it is unlikely extending third-party tax reporting would help quantify or close the supposed “tax gap.” This is to say nothing of the several constitutional concerns that would likely lead a court to invalidate it.  Given these issues, we urge the Treasury to adopt in the finalized regulations a staged approach that focuses first on centralized trading platforms. Centralized trading platform reporting alone would achieve the IRS’s goal of improving tax compliance, especially given that the vast majority of trading volume occurs on centralized exchanges.  After that, we recommend the Treasury work with DeFi participants to find workable solutions that do not hinder the development of this technology that is already changing for the better the way our financial system functions.  The U.S. prides itself on fostering innovation and also protecting civil liberties. We hope that the Treasury considers how this proposal can keep those American values intact, rather than destroy them.

X1, expected to go live in the first quarter of 2024, will make use of Polygon's zero-knowledge technology, a type of cryptography that's become one of 2023's hottest trends in blockchain.  The announcement comes just as other major cryptocurrency exchanges have released or are pursuing their own layer 2 networks. Earlier this year, Coinbase rolled out its “Base” blockchain using Optimism’s OP Stack. Kraken is also reportedly looking into creating a layer 2 blockchain.  Polygon’s CDK is currently in the mix for consideration for Kraken’s layer 2, according to people familiar with the matter, but Polygon Labs Chief Executive Officer Mark Boiron said he doesn’t think the announcement about X1 – the result of a major deal with a big exchange competitor – would scuttle its prospects. “If anything, frankly, it should be more attractive, including to exchanges,” Boiron told CoinDesk in an interview.  “You can look at all these chains as being competitive, or you can look at them as kind of being one,"" Boiron said. ""I fundamentally believe that if we can have the biggest ecosystem of chains that are all interoperable, then everyone that is part of that ecosystem is going to win.”  With the X1 rollout, OKX engineers will become a core contributor to Polygon’s CDK, meaning that they will work on the project's codebase as it evolves.  According to the announcement, OKX’s native token, OKB, will be used for gas fees on the blockchain.  ""X1 will be a key pillar of our efforts to educate and bring our users on-chain and into the world of Web3,” OKX Chief Innovation Officer Jason Lau said in a press release. “This scalable and accessible network is perfect for developers, who can build on X1 to deliver user-friendly, world-class consumer Web3 applications, all while maintaining interoperability with other networks and ecosystems.”  Read more: Kraken Said to Seek Partner to Help Build It a Layer 2 Blockchain Network",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/14/cryptocurrency-exchange-okx-coming-out-with-layer-2-x1-built-on-polygon-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5821ace9ab7bd51d98eb01716b38248a2f6c8a70-400x225.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s the first-ever modular blockchain network, which basically means it’s a new kind of technology that’s changing how blockchains are created and used. At the time of writing, TIA was trading at $5.25, and registering an impressive 126% increase in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. However, the token sustained a 12.7% loss in the last 24 hours. Celestia’s unique method separates different parts of the blockchain process, making it easier to set up individual blockchains. This innovation has pushed Celestia to the forefront of the evolving world of blockchain technology. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Shines 40% Toward $60 As Whales Make Big Moves With a market cap exceeding $691 million, Celestia has quickly become one of the fastest-growing blockchains. The network, backed by OKX, recently launched its mainnet and issued an airdrop to over 190,000 people, despite having 610k eligible recipients. The price of Celestia TIA had a significant decline during the past two days, dropping from its top of $6 on Monday to a low of $4.21. However, the price rebounded on Tuesday morning. The current value of the token is nearing the significant halfway point to $5.50. According to Santiment’s data, the trading volume of TIA has demonstrated positive advancements from November 11th. As of the current moment, the trading volume stands at $751.37 million. This was a level of value that had not been approached since its initial introduction. Source: Santiment A significant level of trading volume serves as an indicator of heightened liquidity allocation towards a token, along with a corresponding level of market interest.

Cronos Unleashes 57% Weekend Explosion, Beating All In The Top 100 Crypto Ranking When examining the impact on price, an upward trend in volume, coupled with a concurrent rise in price, has the potential to reinforce the direction of price movement. TIAUSD trading at $5.16 on the 24-hour chart at TradingView.com On the flip side, Celestia’s online buzz has decreased significantly, dropping by 55.5% in the last day, according to data from Santiment. Despite this decline in social media chatter on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Reddit, Celestia remains prominently featured on CoinMarketCap. Source: Santiment This drop in social volume comes after the platform launched its mainnet on October 31, distributing TIA tokens to 580,000 eligible users through an airdrop. The TIA token has grown remarkably, rising by 154% from its starting price of roughly $2.1, or 135% over the last week, despite a decline in online discussions. The asset’s listing on Binance has added to its momentum, showcasing promising solutions for scalability that competitors like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have struggled to deliver to their users. Taking a conservative approach, it is possible that TIA may reach approximately $11 by the end of the year. This scenario postulates that the ongoing upward trend will soon come to an end, leading to a subsequent phase of correction. In an ideal scenario, a regression towards the $3.40 region might establish the foundation for a more significant upward movement, potentially attaining a value of $10 during the third wave and beyond $11 subsequent to a consolidation in the fourth wave.

The Toronto-based company's loss widened to C$53.6 million ($39 million) from C$23.8 million, while sales slumped to C$17 million from $31.7 million in the year-earlier period, according to a statement on its website. The number of bitcoin mined in the quarter tumbled to 330 from 982.  While some miners have posted better returns in 2023 as the BTC price has rallied this year, Hut 8 attributed the decline in part to issues encountered at its site in Drumheller, Alberta, where ""high energy input levels ... have been causing miners to fail."" Operations at the site are currently at only 27% the installed hash rate, Hut 8 said in its earnings statement.  Hut 8 added that the Bitcoin network's mining difficulty, the suspension of operations at its North Bay, Ontario facility after a dispute with its energy provider and the Ethereum network's migration away from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake mechanism were also factors in the decrease in output.

20179963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560574,1699974002,"Bitcoin Could Plunge To $30,200 If This Level Is Lost: Analyst","On-chain data suggests the next major Bitcoin support level could be at $30,200 if the level pointed out by this analyst is lost. Bitcoin Currently Has Support Levels At $36,400 And $34,300 In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed how the various support levels of BTC are looking like right now from an on-chain perspective. A level may be defined as support based on the amount of Bitcoin that was bought by the investors at said level. Generally, whenever the price declines to the cost basis of an investor, they might become more likely to show some kind of move. Since the holder had last been in a state of profit, they might tend to believe that the asset would rise again in the future, if the prevailing trend is bullish in the market. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Crash Before Spot ETF Approvals Thus, the investor could decide to buy more near their cost basis, thinking that it would turn out to be a profitable “dip” buy. Naturally, just a few traders showing this behavior won’t have any real effects on the price of the cryptocurrency. But if a large number of investors had bought around the same price level, the asset retesting at this level could produce a notable reaction in the market. Such buying that would emerge could provide support to the cryptocurrency. Now, to view these support levels, the analyst has cited the “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD) metric from Glassnode, which tells us about the amount of supply that was last acquired at each of the price levels that the asset has visited in its history. Looks like the current price levels are thick with coins | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the prices around $36,400 hold the cost basis of a notable amount of the supply. The asset has dipped under this mark during the past day, though, implying that the cryptocurrency may be beginning to lose this major support area. If the asset can’t reclaim this level, the next major support level would be present at $34,300. A decline towards this mark would suggest losses of more than 5% for the asset. This support level is thinner than the one the asset is retesting right now, however, meaning it’s possible that the level may not be able to stop the asset from declining even further. Related Reading: Chainlink Forms Sell Signal, Analyst Predicts Pullback To This Level Should this scenario play out, Bitcoin would next have support about 16% down from the current spot price of $30,200. From the chart, it’s visible that all of the price levels below this support area till $25,000 host the cost basis of a significant amount of investors, meaning that these levels should pose a potentially impenetrable wall for the asset. Thus, a decline to $30,200 is possible in the near term if the $34,300 level becomes lost, but it’s unlikely that Bitcoin would drop further than that. BTC Price Bitcoin had been hanging on at $37,000 recently, but it appears that the asset has finally slipped, as it’s now trading under $36,300.

20178246,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560539,1699970449,"Bitcoin Price Ready To Go ‘Supersonic’, Analyst Says","Popular crypto analyst Don Alt has joined the bandwagon of predictions pertaining to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Don Alt recently took to social media platform X to convey a strong bullish Bitcoin price sentiment, issuing a forecast that the cryptocurrency is on the verge of going supersonic to $60,000 in the coming months. Even a $100,000 price point is not out of the books, according to this analyst. The catalyst for this potential liftoff? The long-awaited approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. Bitcoin’s Supersonic Rally to $60,000 Don Alt is known for accurately predicting Bitcoin price points in the past and correctly pinpointed the crypto’s lowest price point in 2022. Now, Don Alt is of the notion that Bitcoin is poised for a massive price surge in the coming months that could send it soaring to $60,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says One Day Left Until XRP Price Blast-Off, What To Expect It’s no news that this recent rally is due to the excitement around the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the analyst thinks this rally will continue until a $60,000 price point. The digital currency is already up by 121% since the beginning of the year and has broken multiple yearly highs in the past month. The longer the SEC takes to approve the applications, the higher the rally will continue in anticipation. However, the analyst took a different line of thinking and considered the likelihood of a price decrease after the approval. Don Alt mentioned that the approval might turn into a “sell the news moment,” implying that there might be many more bears waiting to take advantage of the price jump to sell off than the market thinks. “Now, after the ETF gets approved, things might get a bit tricky. It could be a ‘sell-the-news’ moment, or maybe not. To be honest, I don’t know,” Don Alt said. This line of reasoning resonates with economist Peter Schiff, who warned that approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs might lead to a Bitcoin price decline. Schiff also believes that there could be a larger number of people sitting on their assets in anticipation of an opportunity to sell at a higher price. On-chain data shows that large investors have been selling off in light of profit-taking. Bitcoin whales and sharks have sold around 60,000 BTC, worth about $2.2 billion in the past week. Bitcoin Price To $100,000? Don Alt dismissed bearish sentiments, particularly those waiting for a Bitcoin pullback to $12,000. “BTC is more likely to go to $100,000 here than it is to go back to $12,000,” he said.

42392063,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzjh1,1699970418,Disney Does NFTs Again in Partnership With NBA Top Shot Makers Dapper Labs,"Disney, the iconic, century-old brand known almost as much for its pursuit of technical innovation as much as its continually expanding catalog of entertainment products, is taking another stab at digital collectable non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This time it’s through a partnership with Dapper Labs, the Vancouver-based blockchain firm with experience building successful, consumer-facing Web3 apps including NBA Top Shot.  And thus, on Tuesday Dapper unveiled a new brand, Disney Pinnacle. It's a mobile-based application with an ""early access, closed release"" for invited users opening at 9:00 A.M. (aka a waitlist to join a testing and feedback phase). An official launch will follow “soon thereafter” on the Apple App Store and then roll out for web browsers and the Google Play store, a Dapper spokesperson said in an email.  I spoke with Dapper Labs’ CEO Roham Gharegozlou and Vice President of business development and partnerships Ridhima Kahn to get a better sense of what could be Web3’s next big breakout app. Dapper has had a history of homeruns, beginning with one of the earliest (if not the first) NFT launches ever, CryptoKitties, which clogged Ethereum so bad NPR’s “Planet Money” covered the news.  Then, in time for the 2020-21 bull market, Dapper released NBA Top Shot in a tie-up with the National Basketball Association. Essentially just a platform for people to trade tokenized snapshots of NBA replay footage, Top Shots became one of the breakout apps of the NFT craze. Dapper quickly capitalized on the buzz and launched similar products involving other sports leagues, including the NFL.  See also: Vancouver: A Boutique Hub for Crypto Early Adopters  Disney Pinnacle seems to follow the same track. Users will be able to trade digital “pins,” modeled off of the popular physical collectible category, featuring Disney-related IP. I have neither tested the app nor seen anything on-chain about the tokens on offer, but have been told the platform will host intellectual property from Lucasfilm, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios. So picture Baby Yoda, Woody from “Toy Story” and Snow White as tradable assets.  “Digital collectibles that are based on maybe the most popular products ever … are a path to both adoption of [Web3 technology] as well as a way to show people what's possible,” Gharegozlou said in a video call. At a time when NFTs have not seen quite the bounce back as other crypto sectors or assets like bitcoin [BTC], the market does need a moment of rejuvenation.  It’s clear enough that many of the crypto-native attempts to create valuable IP tied to NFTs have had a rocky start. Some of the largest projects, at least in the cartoon animal “PFP [profile pic] space,” have reneged entirely on their Web3 promises. Rugs have been pulled, roadmaps abandoned and the projects with money in the treasury appear to be flailing.  See also: 95% of NFTs May Now Be Worthless, Report Suggests  It’s unclear whether NFTs will be used for ticketing in the mainstream, and major brands experimenting with nifty rewards points tokens — like Starbucks and Reddit (before it sunsetted the project) — have largely stood arms length from the term NFTs, preferring the more evocative: “digital collectible.”  That’s why Dapper’s latest project and first serious attempt to move beyond sports collectibles could be significant. It's telling in Dapper's promotional material and in the conversation with Gharegozlou and Kahn that the term NFT was being avoided, while an emphasis was placed on Disney Pinnacle's mass market appeal.  Disney has fans, likely billions of them, and Super Fans. Young and old alike, there are a lot of people interested in all things Disney, including its theme parks, backlog of films and merchandise (as seen by the company’s net income of around $1.41 billion in Q3 2023).  Using established brands with built-in, engaged user bases has worked in the past for Dapper, too. Top Shots, while trading has slowed significantly since 2022, has accrued lifetime volumes above $1 billion (DappRadar) — not bad for the digital version of trading cards. At its height, Dapper was valued at $7.6 billion with the company itself becoming an active investor across the NFT and metaverse vertices and launching a $750 million ecosystem fund for its bespoke Flow blockchain.  Further, Gharegozlou comes from a background building consumer startups. As CEO of venture studio Axiom Zen, he built several products including Apple’s App of the Year in 2015 called Timeline and some of the earliest games on top of Bitcoin as well as early AR/VR platforms like Google Glass and Magic Leap. Kahn, meanwhile, came to Dapper from A16Z, where she focused on consumer apps, a spokesperson said.  While some of the magic may be lost when translating physical experiences into digital (like holding a pin of Eeyore), the Disney Pinnacle pins do have their advantages as “investments,” Gharegozlou said. This includes the social aspects of collecting in general:  “To collect and trade pins, the feeling of going to Frontierland and Disneyland and meeting an absolute stranger who shares the fandom that you do for a particular IP or a style of pin and then having your first trade with them is one of the most exhilarating feelings,” Kahn said. (This is an experience she may have actually had; she went to Disneyland like 18 times since starting work with Disney.)  But these social experiences are magnified and multiplied by being online; in the same way a message board heightens the types of conversations you’d have with collectors at a comic book store. There’s just more chances to meet like-minded fans. Plus, there’s something no nonsense about digital collectables that clarifies the fact collecting anything is often an investment:  “You've made a decision, you've invested money that you've earned in purchasing this pin. So it requires a little bit more of an investment,” Khan said. Of course, that isn’t to say there cannot be an emotional or sentimental reason for buying a digital good, or that people cannot become attached to their digital possessions.  Which brings us to the question du jour: are NFTs securities? This was the only moment the affable Gharegozlou wore any amount of concern on his face during a video call. He punted on the question, essentially saying it's a nuanced issue. There’s “long standing laws and precedent that collectibles — whether it's art, trading cards or something else — are not securities, and that doesn't change because it's digital collectibles,” he said.  The company — which has not yet raised the ire of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S.’ top securities watchdog that has lately taken an interest in chasing down NFT firms — directed me towards an example of it “proactively engaging” with a Canadian regulator and a statement from the the Digital Chamber of Commerce spelling out the differences between “financial” and “commercial” NFTs.  “Dapper Labs does not comment on conversations with regulators,” a spokesperson added, in an email. The company recently lost a fairly major motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit filed against Dapper Labs and Gharegozlou, in New York, in which the judge noted the NBA Top Shot Moments in question likely qualify as ""investment contracts,” and therefore could fall under SEC purview.  However, it does appear Dapper Labs is taking steps to block unqualified users from accessing the Disney Pinnacle site. For instance, at launch Disney Pinnacles will only be open to users 18-years-old and up, while the URL supplied by Dapper appears to either be geoblocking New York State or the U.S. entirely.  See also: Dapper Labs Ruling Could Spell Trouble for Other Centralized NFT Projects  I asked about other restrictions around the apps, though did not hear about anything geographical, and should add the site wasn’t technically live when I was doing research for the article, which may impact findings. However, on Pinnacle promotional material it is noted: “Fans in Florida can now collect and trade dynamic pins in real time alongside other fans in California, France, India, Japan and elsewhere around the world,” though I am unsure if that just means for the waitlist. (Will update if Dapper gets back.)  The regulatory question only goes to show the hurdles that bad policies can impose on well-meaning companies. Dapper’s Kahn called this a “partnership” with Disney, one of the most influential companies in history, which has previous experience in Web3 — primarily via a marketplace called VeVe. It’s unlikely these assets will be highly financialized or end up with maxed out leverage on Blur, though they’re as tradable as other NFTs, I believe.  Throughout the call, Gharegozlou and Kahn highlighted how Dapper and Disney tried to keep the average Disney fan in mind when building an “interactive and immersive experience” that non-native crypto fans could use. In other words the user base is digitally-competent Disney fans.  To that end, payments can be made using credit cards, ACH [via your bank] and various cryptocurrencies including bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH], “without worrying about extra fees,” Dapper said. The sign-in experience also eschews the standard Web3 wallet portal with a Web2 option; Gharegozlou said you can sign in “as a Disney fan,” likely meaning using the company’s online credentialing system or an email.  There’s no official cap on the waitlist opening today, though the company is looking to keep it manageable. It's looking for “qualitative and quantitative feedback” to improve the app before it eventually, officially goes live.  Dapper, like the rest of crypto, has taken a hit over the past couple of years. It has had at least three rounds of layoffs since the market started to dip in 2022, and I have no idea the state of its portfolio investments. It’s still a sizable company (200 employees, 65% working on code) with a serious pedigree, which has also knocked out serious innovations in crypto accessibility and the tech running in the background (like account abstraction).  In talking with Gharegozlou and Kahn, it’s also clear they’re consummate professionals who know what to say and what to steer clear of. Avoid the deep technical concerns, because crypto shouldn’t be about the tech but about the experiences it provides. Avoid regulatory questions because at this point there’s no benefit to saying anything on the record. And don’t talk about the app much … probably because it’s unfinished.  All is well and good. The company, like its latest app, is a work in progress — and maybe a model for others.

Noble, introduced in March 2023, is an application-specific blockchain built within the Cosmos ecosystem.  CCTP allows users to migrate their USDC between blockchains on any CCTP-enabled chain. The supported chains currently are Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum and Optimism, according to a press release.  The infrastructure allows for simple onboarding for the likes of decentralized exchange dYdX, which recently launched its ""v4"" standalone chain using Cosmos technology – as well as the rest of the Cosmos [ATOM] ecosystem. DYdX [DYDX] said in a note to CoinDesk that its default setting for its chain uses USDC as collateral.  CCTP is currently available on a Noble test network and will launch on mainnet on November 28.  “What is important here is the sheer amount of USDC liquidity we expect to migrate to Cosmos using this novel non-custodial bridging mechanism,” said Jelena Djuric, CEO and co-founder of Noble. “DYdX is uniquely positioned to be the first power user of CCTP given its v3 product on Ethereum and the industry-leading trading volumes of billions of dollars per day it has achieved.”  There is currently 16 million USDC minted on Noble, and the overall issuance of USDC is 24 billion. CCTP supported chains hold a total of around 22.6 billion of USDC liquidity and dYdX holds over 1 billion on their chain on Ethereum.

The core rate rose just 0.2%, beating expectations for 0.3%.  Checking all the numbers, the CPI for October was unchanged versus economist forecasts for a rise of 0.1% and September's 0.4% gain. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was higher by 3.2% versus expectations for 3.3% and 3.7% in September.  The core CPI – which strips out food and energy costs – rose 0.2% in October against forecasts for 0.3% and September's 0.3%. On a year-over-year basis, core CPI was higher by 4.0% versus 4.1% expected and 4.1% in September.  The price of bitcoin [BTC] knee-jerked higher by nearly 1% in the minutes following the news to just shy of $36,700.  While headline CPI inflation has been receding for months, it has stayed above the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2% target. In addition, the core rate had stubbornly remained above 4% for several months running. Fed members have hinted that they're interested in perhaps one more rate hike before finally ending what's now a roughly 20-month monetary tightening cycle.  ""This is good news folks,"" wrote Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. He noted that core goods prices actually declined 0.2% in October. ""Expect more disinflation moving forward especially as shelter costs ease into mid-2024,"" he added.  Prior to this morning's report, traders were pricing in about an 86% chance the Fed would hold rates steady at its next meeting in mid-December, and there's roughly a 75% chance of a continued pause at the January meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Shortly after the data, the odds of a December pause rose to 99.5% and for a January pause to 95.6%.  Traditional markets are flying following the good inflation news, with Nasdaq 100 futures gaining 1.9% and S&P 500 futures higher by 1.4%.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Fnality, a fintech firm building tokenized versions of major currencies collateralized by cash held at central banks, has raised $95 million in Series B funding led by Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas. DTCC, Euroclear, Nomura and WisdomTree participated in the round, which also saw further commitment from a number of institutions that backed Fnality’s $63 million fundraise back in 2019: Banco Santander, BNY Mellon, Barclays, CIBC, Commerzbank, ING, Lloyds Banking Group, Nasdaq Ventures, State Street, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and UBS.  Traders invested in XRP futures lost some $7.26 million in the past 24 hours as prices moved wildly following false rumors of a BlackRock (BLK) exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing. XRP prices jumped to 73 cents from 65 cents in 25 minutes after a tweet that suggested the financial behemoth had filed for an XRP ETF in the U.S. state of Delaware. Some crypto news firms reported on the filing as fact, which also helped amplify prices. Blackrock (BLK) confirmed it is not attempting to launch an XRP ETF. Blackrock has previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. Prior to those SEC filings, were filings for a Delaware entity to act as the corporate vehicle for the product. Paperwork submitted Monday mimicked those forms, but was not in fact filed by the asset management giant.  A U.S. judge ordered the end of an automatic stay on proceedings between bankrupt crypto firms FTX and BlockFi, meaning the two can start negotiating a claims settlement. BlockFi, a lender, filed for bankruptcy in late November last year, in part because of the ripple effects of the sudden collapse of FTX earlier that month. That triggered the automatic stay, halting proceedings between the two. BlockFi had an estimated $355 million frozen on the crypto exchange's platform and was owed a further $671 million by FTX's sister company, Alameda Research.

Some analysis have singled out the resurgence of GameFi within the Avalanche ecosystem as a pivotal catalyst potentially fueling additional gains in AVAX. Specifically, on Monday, AVAX revisited the $20 threshold, marking a significant milestone as this price level hadn’t been seen since April 2023. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Shines 40% Toward $60 As Whales Make Big Moves The GameFi Surge On Avalanche: Unveiling Growth Potential The GameFi revival as a major growth catalyst suggests that the intersection of decentralized finance and gaming applications within the Avalanche network holds considerable promise. As the market absorbs this resurgence, questions naturally arise about the sustainability of the bullish momentum and the underlying factors contributing to the recent breakout in AVAX’s price. In light of these developments, a deeper analysis is warranted to understand the potential extent to which the bulls can propel this rally and the broader implications of the GameFi revival within the context of the Avalanche ecosystem. AVAX market cap currently at $6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com As optimism permeated the cryptocurrency sector, the prosperity of ecosystems experienced a widespread upswing across diverse networks. Avalanche (AVAX) seamlessly joined this trend, affirming its participation in the prevailing positive sentiment within the crypto space. This collective ascent underscored the buoyancy of various networks, including AVAX, as they navigated the evolving landscape of the digital asset market. Meanwhile, TraderJoe, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche network, has witnessed an impressive growth, marked by a significant surge in trading volume and fees collected over a specific period. Watching @TraderJoe_xyz as a dual play both on Avalanche and Arbitrum. – Trading volume +112% – Fees +146% – Supply-side fees rose to $138,000 – Trading Volume by chain: 74% Avalanche/ 25% Arbitrum Trader Joe enjoys the volume from both narratives. pic.twitter.com/0BkP3zzU7V — Emperor Osmo🧪 (@Flowslikeosmo) November 13, 2023 The trading volume experienced an increase of more than 100%, indicating a substantial uptick in user activity on the platform. Simultaneously, fees generated from trading activity soared by an impressive 146%, reaching a substantial sum of nearly $140,000. At the time of writing, AVAX was trading at $17.03, down 6.5% in the last 24 hours, and tallied a solid 32.4% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. This surge in supply-side fees underscores the increasing utilization of the TraderJoe platform within the Avalanche network. The distribution of trading activity reveals that a substantial majority, accounting for 74%, occurred on the Avalanche chain, emphasizing the platform’s popularity within the Avalanche network. The remaining 25% of trading took place on Arbitrum [ARB]. Avalanche Network Activity Tells A Different Story As this developed, another interesting aspect has been observed in the network: In the last quarter, activity on the Avalanche network experienced a downturn, witnessing a decline in both transaction volume and active addresses on the prominent “C-Chain” compared to the preceding quarter of 2023. Source: Nansen Data sourced from DeFi Llama indicates a nearly 30% slump in Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) during Q3, plummeting from $706 million to $512 million. Although there has been a subsequent 10% rebound in TVL to $564 million, daily transactions continue to linger at a lower figure, standing at 232,000. Source: Nansen AVAX Price In Peril? Nansen’s data reveals that daily active users reached a peak of 86,000 in Q3, showcasing a decrease from the previous quarter’s 117,000. The daily active transactions also saw a drop, ranging from 136,000 to 504,000, a significant shift from the previous range of 200,000 to 550,000. Notably, on October 15, this metric hit a low of 110,000. While these metrics don’t bode well for the immediate past, whether this decline imperils AVAX’s price trajectory remains a complex question. The broader market sentiment and the network’s adaptability to emerging trends, especially in the dynamic realm of decentralized finance, will likely play pivotal roles in determining the future of AVAX’s price.

But the euphoria seemingly hit a snag late Monday. Prominent blockchain sleuth @ZachXBT linked the deployer of GROK tokens to wallets that had previously issued projects that failed to take off after issuance.  “Not that people in this space will care but $GROK was created by a scammer,” @ZachXBT said. “Same exact X/Twitter account has been reused for at least one other scam.”  Screenshots posted on X by @ZachXBT showed the deployer had previously issued ANDY tokens and changed their usernames multiple times on the messaging application Telegram.  The finding sent GROK prices immediately spiraling. Some large token holders began selling amounts equivalent to $30,000, DEXTools data shows, driving prices down by at least 70%. Selling activity bumped token trading volumes to over $100 million, the data shows.  You’d expect the project to have died, but it didn’t. GROK community members quickly shoved off @ZachXBT’s findings as ‘FUD’ – an abbreviation of fear, uncertainty, dismissal; a term akin to an untoward attack on any project – and coaxed their online circles to instead buy even more of the tokens.  The developers, meanwhile, burned all of their token supply, valued at over $1.7 million at the time, by sending those holdings to a null address. This incited even more confidence among followers.  Online sentiment remains shaky, but the community chugs along. For some believers, GROK is possibly the “next shib,” – a reference to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) momentous rise from obscurity to a $35 billion capitalization between 2020 and 2022.

42409497,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIIk0,1699960842,"FTX Can Start Mediation, File Counterclaims in BlockFi Bankruptcy Case, Judge Rules","A U.S. judge ordered the end of an automatic stay on proceedings between bankrupt crypto firms FTX and BlockFi, meaning the two can start negotiating a claims settlement.  BlockFi, a lender, filed for bankruptcy in late November last year, in part because of the ripple effects of the sudden collapse of FTX earlier that month. That triggered the automatic stay, halting proceedings between the two. BlockFi had an estimated $355 million frozen on the crypto exchange's platform and was owed a further $671 million by FTX's sister company, Alameda Research.  The stay has been modified to allow FTX debtors to make ""arguments, defenses, counterclaims, setoffs, or otherwise ... with respect to the BlockFi claims in the FTX bankruptcy proceeding,"" according to a Nov. 13 court order by U.S. bankruptcy judge Michael Kaplan.  Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now bankrupt FTX, was found guilty on all seven counts of defrauding his customers and lenders at the start of this month following a five-week trial.  BlockFi CEO Zac Prince testified against Bankman-Fried as part of the trial, detailing how the firm was forced to declare bankruptcy when it did because of its involvement with FTX and Alameda, having lost ""a little over a billion dollars.""  In late September, BlockFi's creditors approved a bankruptcy restructuring plan that would, in theory, allow it to recover the assets lost to FTX as well as those it lost when crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed in the summer of 2022.

20173563,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560532,1699960804,Solana Price Regains Momentum As FTX Sell-Off Ends,"After a significant dip to $51.27, Solana (SOL) is currently witnessing a notable recovery in its market price, currently trading at $55.31 (up 7%). This upswing follows a period of intense volatility, with SOL reaching a peak of $63.80 last Saturday, marking an impressive 270% rally over 61 days, only to drop almost 20% subsequently. The FTX Factor In The Solana Price Movement FTX has probably been a significant influence on SOL’s price volatility. A report from Lookonchain, an on-chain analysis service, indicates that FTX’s liquidity in SOL has drastically diminished, with Solana worth only $185,000 remaining in their public addresses. “FTX deposited 250,000 SOL ($13.6 M) to Kraken 7 hours ago. Currently, FTX’s public addresses on Solana only have 3,408 SOL,” Lookonchain reported. FTX deposited 250K $SOL($13.6M) to #Kraken 7 hours ago. Currently, FTX’s public addresses on #Solana only have 3,408 $SOL ($185K) left.https://t.co/A4CyCXgVzS pic.twitter.com/4EVtrwoYyX — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 14, 2023 Crypto influencer MartyParty commented on the situation, criticizing FTX’s strategy of liquidating SOL holdings for creditor payments as “one of the most idiotic moves in crypto history.” According to his observations, FTX’s liquid SOL has been entirely offloaded to the market, marking an end to its influence on SOL’s price dynamics. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Shines 40% Toward $60 As Whales Make Big Moves Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bluntz pointed out that despite FTX’s consistent selling of SOL, ranging from 250,000 to 700,000 daily for the past three weeks, the price of SOL managed to stay resilient. He suggests that with the depletion of FTX’s unlocked tokens, a significant price surge for SOL could be imminent, “Once this seller is gone, I can only imagine how hard it’s gonna pump. Dont middle curve this.” The Remaining SOL Holdings Of FTX While FTX has sold 6.996 million SOL in the last few weeks, they are still sitting on a huge pile of Solana. Crypto Edgar provided an overview of FTX’s SOL holdings, highlighting that while the bulk of SOL transfers from FTX’s cold wallets have been completed, a substantial amount remains staked in various liquid stake solutions, potentially available for future sale. Related Reading: Solana Price Could Reach $1,000, Analyst Explains Why “The FTX cold wallets contain almost no more SOL but they still hold some amount of liquid SOL which is staked in liquid stake solutions Lido Finance, Marinade Finance and JPool. In total 1.25 million SOL is still locked but could easily be withdrawn and sold as well,” the analyst remarked. Moreover, it is important to note that FTX still holds 42.2 million SOL, worth $2.19 billion under lock-up. According to the SOL unlock schedule, each month sees the release of 618,400 SOL. This regular monthly unlocking accounts for about 1.1% of the entire SOL holdings of FTX. Notably, a significant event is scheduled for March 1, 2025, where 7.5 million SOL will be unlocked. In conclusion, although some influencers are celebrating the end of the FTX sell-off, this is not the full reality. While a large chunk of selling pressure may have been very well absorbed by the market in recent weeks, it is not close to an end. The FTX factor for the Solana price is still out there. Despite that the SOL price has shown tremendous strength in recent weeks, considering the massive selling pressure from FTX. At press time, SOL was trading at $55.31, making the 1,618 Fibonacci extension level at $57.85 once again the key resistance for the bulls.

42409503,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIJ3q,1699959974,Australia Updates Its Capital Gains Tax Guidance to Include Wrapped Tokens and DeFi,"Australia's tax authority has clarified its view that its capital gains tax on crypto products also extends to wrapped tokens or token interaction with decentralized lending protocols, according to an updated guidance.  Last year, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) warned cryptocurrency investors that capital gains and losses must be reported every time a digital asset, including non-fungible tokens (NFT), is sold. The latest update includes wrapped tokens or many “DeFi ""lending” and ""borrowing arrangements” or, in general, any time you transfer a crypto asset to an address that you don’t control.  “When you wrap or unwrap a crypto asset, you exchange one crypto asset for another and a CGT (Capital Gains Tax) event happens, the update said. “The capital proceeds for the CGT event equal the market value of the wrapped token at the time of the exchange.""  This includes liquidity pools and providers with a CGT event happening when you deposit or withdraw crypto assets from the liquidity pool, according to the guidance. A CGT event will also occur if a DeFi platform pays you rewards in the form of crypto assets.  The move could have a chilling impact on Australians using DeFi even though it is a non-binding tax office guidance representing that tax office's interpretation of the law, meaning it is not the same as a court decision or legislation. It has also garnered criticism from the nation's crypto industry with one lawyer saying this could also apply to transferring tokens to centralized exchanges.  “Being able to wrap tokens is a valuable and necessary cross-chain interoperability tool,” said Michael Bacina, Digital Assets lawyer at Piper Alderman Lawyers. “To have a purely technological function triggering a tax event and tax payable is not something users would expect when using crypto-assets.”  The tax is based on an individual’s marginal rate but the person is eligible for a 50% discount if they hold an asset for 12 months.  Australia’s Board of Taxation is scheduled to give its review on the tax treatment of digital assets, which will include comments on capital gains tax, to the government by Feb. 29, 2024.

MOON is the community token of the ""r/cryptocurrency"" subreddit.  “The Reddit admins will be renouncing the Moons contract, and it is expected to be complete by the end of this month. This action is permanent and once complete it will be impossible for any further changes to be made to the contract,” they added.  The moderators added that no new moon tokens will be created after the contract is migrated and renounced. Furthermore, Reddit admins will be burning all MOON held in a shared account called the “Community Tank,” which will lower the total supply from around 125 million to 83 million.  MOON price rose 140% in the past 24 hours, data shows, with trading volumes crossing $2.4 million. The tokens are actively traded on the crypto exchange Kraken and the decentralized exchange SushiSwap.  Meanwhile, u/CryptoMods said in the Tuesday post that they were planning a series of developments that could accrue value to MOON tokens in the coming months.  The team also said it will continue to develop bots and use the available API, a tool for data transfers, to improve the utility of Moons.  What Are Community Points?  Community Points was a blockchain-based internet points program designed to reward creators and developers. The program allowed users to earn and spend community points through native tokens like MOON.  Reddit shut down its roughly three-year-old blockchain-based Community Points program in early October, citing resources to maintain the effort were “too high to justify” and that an uncertain regulatory environment added to headwinds.  In the 24 hours following that move, prices of Moons (MOON), the native token of Reddit’s r/CryptoCurrency community, fell some 85% on the news, Bricks’ (BRICK), distributed as a reward for contributions in the r/Fortnite subreddit, dropped 67%, and Donut (DONUT), the token that represents the community points of the r/ethtrader subreddit, slumped 65%.

According to the filing with the SEC, approval of a Spot ETH ETP would represent a major win for the protection of U.S. investors in the crypto asset space. If approved, the iShares Ethereum Trust would allow regular investors to trade Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, as easily as stocks can be traded. BlackRock And NASDAQ Lobbies SEC To Allow Spot ETH ETFs BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently applied to the SEC to launch an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) linked to the spot price of Ethereum. BlackRock wasn’t the first investment company to make this type of application, as hedge fund Ark Invest already filed for a Spot Ethereum ETF in September. However, the news of BlackRock’s filing sent Ethereum surging more than 11% in less than 24 hours. As a result, ETH broke over the strong $2,000 resistance level for the first time in seven months. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals One Major Reason The XRP Price Will Do Well In The Bull Run BlackRock’s Spot ETF is called the “iShares Ethereum Trust” and is sponsored by Ishares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a subsidiary of Blackrock Inc. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, acts as the custodian for the Trust’s ether holdings, which are to be traded on the NASDAQ exchange. In its SEC filing, NASDAQ asked for a proposed rule change in order for it to list and trade shares of the ETF. According to the filing, US investors, for the most part, have lacked a US-regulated way to gain exposure to Ethereum investments. It also argues that most of the current methods are risky and subject to high trading fees and volatile discounts. For example, an investor who purchased the largest OTC ETH Fund in January 2021 and held the position at the end of 2022 would have had a 30% loss due to the change in the premium/discount, even if the price of ETH did not change. However, a spot ETH ETP like the proposed iShares Ethereum Trust ETF would better protect investors against the risk of losses through fraud and high premiums. “To this point, approval of a Spot ETH ETP would represent a major win for the protection of U.S. investors in the cryptoasset space,” the filing said. Potential Impact On Ethereum Price If The ETF Is Approved Despite spot crypto ETFs being available in other countries, including Germany, France, and Canada, the SEC has been hesitant to greenlight a crypto ETF in the US, and 12 Bitcoin spot ETFs are currently waiting for approval. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hard Crash Or Mega Pump: Why $31,000 Holds The Key A US Spot Ethereum ETF would significantly boost interest and confidence in Ethereum and ultimately drive the asset to new highs. The hype leading up to the approval may also push the asset to a new yearly high. ETH is up by more than 60% this year and has outperformed BTC in the past few days. It is currently trading at $2,060 and analysts believe a bullish cross over $2,150 would signal the end of the bear market for ETH.

These include registered investment advisers (RIAs), retirement funds and institutions that have historically not been able to access the asset class, Coinbase said.  There's more to the story than just new money accessing the sector, however.  ""The opportunity is potentially much greater than just enabling new capital to access the crypto market,"" as ETFs ""will ease the restrictions for large money managers and institutions to buy and hold bitcoin, which will improve liquidity and price discovery for all market participants,"" wrote David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase.  Additionally, having an investment vehicle that meets ""key regulatory and compliance requirements may also open the door to new products,"" which could multiply the existing crypto offerings for accredited investors and expand adoption, the note said.  Over the longer term this could add billions to the total crypto market cap, the report said, adding that ETFs are expected to lay the foundation for a ""more regulated environment, greater inclusion and a material growth in demand.""  Coinbase says the ETF story is bringing more focus to bitcoin at an opportune time, ""as the world has fewer safe haven alternatives amid a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions and increasing economic dysfunction.""  ""The U.S. Treasury bond market has been shaken up and the U.S. banking sector remains highly vulnerable,"" which makes bitcoin all the more attractive heading into 2024 as an ""alternative to the traditional financial system,"" the report added.

On-chain analysis tool PeckShield flagged that some FTX-labeled addresses had transferred 250,000 SOL, worth just over $13.5 million at the time, and $4 million in USDT stablecoins to crypto exchange Binance and trading firm Wintermute.  These wallets are controlled by a debtor group that is in charge of handling the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, including its multi-billion dollar asset holdings. Moving to exchanges may likely indicate a sale of those tokens on the open market.  SOL prices are down 7.5% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, underperforming an average of 0.6% in losses among cryptocurrencies tracked by the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).  Tuesday’s transfer comes a week after the group moved over $30 million worth of SOL to Binance and Kraken, another crypto exchange. Prices tumbled 5% amid the movement but recovered and rallied afterward.  SOL has risen some 150% in the past month and over 500% year-to-date on the back of long-term optimism for its blockchain technology and popularity among crypto circles.  Some said that part of the surge may also be attributed to the debtor group staking over $120 million of SOL tokens in a surprise move in October – dampening fears of an impending sell-off as the tokens were effectively locked out of circulation.  But the debtor group has sent mixed messages about what it plans to do with its sizable stake, estimated at over $1 billion, which was acquired by the Sam Bankman-Fried led exchange from 2020 to 2022.  So far, the bankrupt crypto exchange’s estate has moved north of $100 million in SOL to exchanges in a series of transactions that has apparently stressed an impressive rally.

20167781,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560526,1699948798,Interview: Elan Future’s CEO Jerome-Olivier Malo on Transforming the Energy Sector,"Elan Future is a project that is working towards achieving universal access to energy. Recently, we caught up with its CEO, Jerome-Olivier Malo and asked a few questions to gain some insights about him and the project. Elan – Unveiling the Vision Q: Let’s start with the present day. Could you share with our readers what Elan is and what inspired the creation of this innovative company? Elan Future is an uprising against the darkness that blankets millions of lives. Our battle is against the injustice of energy poverty and the passivity in facing the world’s dire energy crunch. We are here to flip the script on how energy is shared, saved, and savored. Enter Apollo — not your everyday generator, but a maverick of magnetic marvel that’s redefining efficiency. It’s our secret sauce in the quest for an electrified planet, a piece of tomorrow’s technology here to disrupt today’s energy norms. The spark for Elan? It was the world’s energy outcry that no one could ignore. As the globe grapples with an energy plight that hits both wallets and resources hard, we saw a beacon of hope in the form of Apollo, ready to lead the charge in this new energy revolution. Our ranks are filled with the best and bravest — physicists defying the status quo, Hydro-Québec engineers with electricity in their veins, financial wizards who see beyond the bottom line, and angel investors with their gaze fixed on a horizon lit by innovation. What inspired Elan’s inception was a cocktail of frustration and foresight — frustration at a world where energy is a privilege and foresight that sees it as a fundamental right. By welding our state-of-the-art tech with the bedrock of blockchain, we’re sparking a transparent energy uprising. Elan Future is here to ensure energy is not just consumed but embraced as a universal currency of progress. It’s not just about keeping the lights on; it’s about igniting a flame of change in every soul we touch. Inception and Community Impact Q: What was the spark that ignited the idea for Elan Future? How do you envision it making a positive impact on the community and beyond? The spark for Elan Future came from a profound place of need—a need that you can see in the eyes of the millions who live off the grid, and in the strained grids of our cities that barely keep up with our current demands. It struck me during a blackout; as I sat there in the dark, I realized that this was a daily reality for so many people. That moment of frustration lit the fire of creation for Elan. I envision Elan Future as a catalyst for change. With Apollo, we’re proposing a new way of life. It’s about creating a world where energy is not a luxury but a given. A world where communities can thrive, not just survive, because they have the power—literally—to do so. But the impact doesn’t stop at the light switch. We’re talking about empowering communities with the means to grow and sustain themselves. Energy drives education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Imagine schools that can light up young minds, hospitals that can save lives around the clock, and small businesses that can flourish. That’s the future Elan is dedicated to building. And on a larger scale, by bringing energy to areas that were previously in the dark, we’re sparking innovation on a global level. We’re contributing to the creation of a more balanced, more connected world, where the flow of energy is as natural and equitable as the flow of information is today The Journey Behind Elan Q: Jerome, you have an extensive background in various endeavors before Elan Future. Could you take our readers on a journey through your experiences and how they’ve led you to this point? Absolutely, it’s been quite the adventure, and every step has played a part in leading me to where I am today with Elan Future. My journey started in the tech industry, where I was fascinated by the power of technology to connect people and ideas. I spent years working with dynamic startups, where I learned that at the heart of any successful innovation lies a keen understanding of the human experience. From there, I ventured into the world of finance. I saw how economic systems could either enable growth or create barriers. This experience was eye-opening—it was about understanding risk, recognizing potential, and investing in ideas that could shape the future. But it was my time spent volunteering with non-profits that truly set the stage for Elan Future. I saw firsthand the challenges faced without reliable energy. Schools struggled to stay open after dark, medical clinics couldn’t preserve life-saving vaccines, and simple tasks were monumental without power. This patchwork of experiences brought clarity. The tech industry taught me about the power of innovation, finance showed me how to turn ideas into reality, and my time in the field revealed the critical need for sustainable energy solutions. The throughline was clear—energy was the key to unlocking potential on an individual and global scale. With Elan Future, I’ve taken this tapestry of experiences and weaved them into our mission. Every lesson learned, every success and setback, has been a stepping stone to this moment, where we have the opportunity to illuminate lives and empower communities on a scale that truly matters. Meet the Elan Team Q: The team behind a project is often critical to its success. Can you introduce us to the remarkable individuals who make up the Elan Future team and share their unique contributions? Success at Elan Future is truly a team sport, and we have an all-star lineup that’s hard to beat. Each individual’s expertise is not just a cog in the machine but a vital organ in the body of our mission—electrifying the future. Dr. Benoit Guay is our scientific maestro, a PhD in Applied Physics with a mind that’s as brilliant as it is unconventional. His groundbreaking work on the edges of physics—including mass reversals and magnetic susceptibility—puts us leagues ahead in the field of energy innovation. Benoit is the brain behind the science that powers Elan Future’s technology. Sylvain Roy, Esq, is the guardian of our intellectual arsenal. With a keen eye for technology monetization and a sharp mind for IP valuation, he navigates the complex waters of international law with the finesse of a seasoned captain. His lectures at the IP Business Academy and CEIPI at Université de Strasbourg are just a sliver of the prowess he brings to our legal strategy. Doryne Bourque is the heartbeat of our corporate social responsibility. Her positions on various boards demonstrate her leadership and commitment to sustainable development and responsible finance. Her passion for equitable resource distribution aligns perfectly with our mission, guiding Elan Future’s strategic decisions with a conscience. Last but not least, Denis Chartrand, eng, is the architect of our infrastructure. His experience at Hydro-Québec, where he was instrumental in developing strategies post-the 1998 ice storm, has given him unparalleled expertise in resilient and smart grid technology. Denis’s vision shapes the robust and innovative framework that allows our technology to thrive. Together, this dream team’s diverse skills and passions fuel Elan Future’s drive to bring sustainable, reliable energy to every corner of the globe. We’re more than just a company; we’re a collective force on a mission to electrify the future, and our team’s expertise is our powerhouse. Elan’s Milestones Q: Could you highlight some of the noteworthy breakthroughs and milestones that Elan Future has achieved so far? Our journey with the Apollo Generator is a testament to our commitment to innovation and transformative change. Filing several patents for Apollo was just the beginning. These patents are more than documents; they’re the blueprints for a future where access to energy is universal—a future we’re actively constructing. Launching our blockchain and introducing our own token was a bold move towards a vision where energy isn’t just consumed but is part of a transparent, equitable exchange. It’s about giving power back to the people—literally. We’ve given away millions in free tokens, not as a promotional stunt, but as a statement of our belief in a community-driven energy revolution. This token isn’t just a currency; it’s a new way of connecting people to their power, their community, their environment. The creation of Apollo and our other groundbreaking innovation, the Pathfinder, represent the pinnacle of our achievements. Every step we’ve taken at Elan Future is a step towards demystifying and democratizing energy. We are a movement powered by the courage to reimagine what’s possible, making the future accessible, one innovation at a time. A Glimpse of the Future Q: What’s on the horizon for Elan Future? Can you give us a sneak peek into any exciting announcements or developments that our readers should keep an eye out for in the near future? The future of Elan Future is filled with promise and innovation, including our exciting Cassiopée project. Cassiopée represents a harmonious blend of technology, design, and sustainability, where homes are sanctuaries that provide clean, renewable energy. We’re creating a community where energy is not just a resource but a way to improve living standards and alleviate poverty. We invite our readers to stay tuned for developments in both our energy innovations and the Cassiopée project, which are set to reshape the way we think about energy and sustainable living. Joining the Initiative Q: For our readers who are eager to get involved, how can they become part of the Elan Future initiative? What opportunities exist for them to contribute or participate? For readers eager to get involved with Elan Future, there are opportunities for collaboration and participation. We welcome discussions on future-focused initiatives, technological solutions, or strategic partnerships. Elan is about creating a community of like-minded visionaries who embrace innovation, sustainability, and collaboration to shape a better future. Reach out via twitter or discord to explore how you can contribute to our mission. Parting Thoughts Q: Is there anything else you’d like to share with our readers, perhaps a message, a call to action, or a vision that encapsulates Elan Future’s mission and ethos? As we stand at the crossroads of innovation and tradition, Elan Future beckons to a horizon brimming with promise. Our mission has always been clear: to illuminate every corner of the globe with accessible, sustainable energy. But this vision isn’t just ours to build—it’s a tapestry woven from the aspirations of every individual, community, and nation we touch. To the readers, our call to action is simple yet profound: join us. Engage with us. Be part of the energy revolution that moves beyond the constraints of the grid to a world where energy flows as freely as information does today. Every token we’ve shared, every patent we’ve filed, every innovation we’ve brought to life like Apollo and Pathfinder, is a step toward this boundless future. We invite you to imagine a planet where energy poverty is history, where clean power fuels not just our homes and devices, but also our dreams and opportunities. This is the future Elan Future is committed to—a future where we aren’t just passive consumers of energy, but active participants in a vibrant energy ecosystem. So, as we look to the future, let’s not just be spectators. Let’s be the architects of an electrified tomorrow.

The price is trading above $2,010 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,090 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2,100 resistance zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Remains In Uptrend After forming a base, Ethereum price made another attempt to clear the $2,100 resistance. However, ETH failed to gain bullish momentum and trimmed all gains, like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $2,050 level and the price spiked below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls were active above the $2,030 level. A low is formed near $2,031 and the price is now moving higher. Ethereum is now trading above $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,075 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,118 swing high to the $2,031 low. The next major resistance sits at $2,100. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,090 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A close above the trend line and $2,100 could send the price further higher toward the $2,150 zone. The next key resistance is near $2,220, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,300 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,450 level. Another Bearish Wave in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,100 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,030 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next key support is $2,000. A downside break below the $2,000 support might start a sharp decline. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,930 support zone in the near term.

The liquidations were fourth behind those of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Solana’s SOL futures, data shows.  XRP prices jumped to 73 cents from 65 cents in 25 minutes after a tweet that suggested financial behemoth BlackRock had filed for an XRP ETF in the U.S. state of Delaware. Reputed crypto news firms reported on the filing as fact, which also helped amplify prices.  However, the filing turned out to be fake: Someone had likely filed out an elaborate form using a BlackRock executive’s alias and effectively replicated an actual online filing. This caused prices to quickly tumble back to previous levels.  But leveraged traders had already piled on their traders by then. Data shows that over 75% of traders from the total XRP liquidations were longs, or bets on higher prices, meaning those traders placed nearly $5 million in orders in that short time span without confirming the authenticity of the filing.

The license has been granted to its Dubai entity, CRO DAX Middle East FZE, which received a minimal viable product (MVP) preparatory approval from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in March.  Receiving a full license involves three stages: a provisional permit, a preparatory license and an operating license. Crypto.com is now in the third stage of the process, but the company will need to satisfy localization requirements and conditions to commence operations.  The exchange will then get operational approval to provide “exchange services, broker-dealer services, management and investment services, and lending and borrowing services.” The Singapore-based exchange completed its licensing process in Singapore in June and has had regulatory victories in the Netherlands, U.K., France and Brazil. However, it has also suffered workforce cuts and difficulty maintaining fiat on-ramps during the recent banking crisis.  Dubai mandated crypto firms to obtain authorization and relevant licenses to operate in Feb. 2023. Laser Digital, the digital asset asset subsidiary of financial services giant Nomura, recently received an operating permit.  “It is an incredible honour to be one of the first crypto exchanges to be granted a Virtual Asset Service Provider Licence by VARA, and it further proves our company’s commitment to security and compliance,” said Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com.

20163941,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560514,1699940864,XRP Price Leaps 16% On Fake BlackRock ETF Filing: Details,"On late November 13, the XRP price experienced a significant surge, momentarily jumping by 16% following a purported exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing by BlackRock, which quickly turned out to be fake. The incident began when X (formerly Twitter) users shared a filing in Delaware suggesting that BlackRock, the global asset management giant, had registered the “iShares XRP Trust”. This action is typically a precursor to launching an ETF. Consequently, the XRP price soared to $0.75, a 16% increase, within just 25 minutes of the news breaking. However, the excitement was short-lived. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed the filing as fake after direct communication with BlackRock representatives. Balchunas indicated that the XRP trust had been falsely listed on the Delaware website using the name of Daniel Schwieger, a managing director at BlackRock. Related Reading: XRP Will Diverge Away From Price Speculation: Crypto Pundit In a X post, Balchunas stated, “This is false! Confirmed by BlackRock by me. Some whacko must have added using BlackRock executive name etc. Cmon man. Some ppl questioning whether BlackRock actually confirmed to me this is false. They did. A spokesperson confirmed. If that’s not enough and you are still raging, then please seek medical help.” Adding to this, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart remarked on the rapid price fluctuation: “Round trip to below where it was before the fake pump. […] That was a quick […] Whoever did this better have covered their tracks because the feds will be looking into them I suspect.” Seyffart also clarified that while the XRP trust filing was fake, the Ethereum ETF filing is legitimate and confirmed. Why The Odds Of A XRP ETF By BlackRock Were Slim Scott Johnson, finance lawyer at Davis Polk elucidated why the XRP ETF by BlackRock had little chance to be true: “Would represent an aggressive posture from Blackrock given there’s currently no clear path for XRP to get 19b-4 approval here without a CME futures market / SSA. Not to say it can’t be done, but would require forging a new path.” Related Reading: XRP Price Path To $1: Exploring Two Potential Outcomes From The $0.66 Resistance Level Jeremy Hogan, a renowned lawyer from the community, explained the simplicity of spoofing the formation of an ETF, highlighting its fraudulent nature and the ease of execution. Hogan elaborated that “it’s actually very easy and just costs $500. You only need to file two documents (attached), pay the money, and you get a ‘placeholder’ on the state website. ” He also speculated that the perpetrator could have potentially capitalized on the price surge. “Criminal saw what happened with the ETH trust filing, files the XRP trust ‘filing,’ buys $100k XRP on leverage, sells at 74 cents, and pockets 2-3 million dollars,” Hogan speculated.

20157816,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560508,1699927247,"Ethereum Bulls May Propel Price To $3,100, Analyst Suggests","Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has seen a significant price increase over the past month. The recent bullish rush in the crypto market, coupled with BlackRock’s involvement, has pushed ETH to its year-to-date high of $2,139. Ethereum Outshines Bitcoin And Altcoins According to market data provider Kaiko, ETH has outperformed BTC and many altcoins in recent weeks, signaling a shift in market dynamics. Kaiko’s report highlights how ETH struggled to gain momentum over the past year, despite successful upgrades such as The Merge in April. However, the sentiment around ETH changed dramatically when BlackRock filed for a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF), leading to a reversal in the ETH to Bitcoin (BTC) ratio. Related Reading: XRP Price Path To $1: Exploring Two Potential Outcomes From The $0.66 Resistance Level The impact on the market was substantial, with ETH prices surging above $2,000 for the first time since April. Additionally, daily spot trade volumes reached $7 billion, the highest level since the collapse of FTX. The ETH ETF narrative provided further impetus to the ongoing rally, amplified by improved global risk sentiment and declining US Treasury yields. The dominance of altcoin + ETH volume relative to BTC has risen to 60%, marking its highest level in over a year. During bull rallies, altcoin volume typically increases relative to BTC. This surge in demand has also led to rising leverage, as reflected in the recovery of ETH open interest to early August levels. Notably, BTC open interest has declined over the past month due to liquidations on Binance, resulting in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) outpacing Binance as the largest BTC futures market. Furthermore, ETH funding rates, a gauge of sentiment and bullish demand, have reached their highest levels in over a year, indicating a significant shift in sentiment. In November, both BTC and ETH 30-day volatility rose to 40% and 50% respectively, following a multi-year low of around 15% during the summer months. Crypto Expert Predicts ETH Breakout Renowned crypto expert Michael Van de Poppe believes that ETH is on the cusp of a significant breakthrough. According to Van de Poppe, if Ethereum manages to surpass the crucial $2,150 resistance level, it could signify the end of the bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Do $2.2 Billion Selloff, But BTC Hangs On At $37,000 Drawing a parallel with Bitcoin’s critical $30,000 barrier, Van de Poppe suggests that breaching this level could pave the way for a substantial rally, potentially propelling Ethereum towards the price range of $3,100 to $3,600. However, Ethereum has yet to touch the $2,150 resistance line, as it faces a pre-existing obstacle in the form of its yearly high of $2,139. This pivotal level has halted the cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum, acting as a formidable resistance. As a result, Ethereum has been consolidating within a narrow range between $2,050 and $2,100 for the past three days. The forthcoming days will reveal whether Ethereum can overcome its immediate resistance levels and establish a consolidated position above them. Alternatively, it may face a fate similar to Bitcoin, which failed to surpass the $31,000 level for over seven months before reaching its current trading price of $36,000.

The cryptocurrency market has been enjoying a robust rally since mid to late-October that has taken Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from $26k per coin to over $37k per coin with very little pullback. Much of this recent surge is likely from excitement surrounding the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States. This excitement has led to the NAV discount arbitrage in Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) grinding higher all year from a low of close to 50% to just over 10% now: Data by YCharts Unlike during Bitcoin's regional banking crisis-related price surge back in March, this time the rally is being observed more broadly and many of the alt coins like Solana ( SOL-USD ) and ChainLink ( LINK-USD ) have outperformed BTC over the last month or so. Data by YCharts One altcoin that hasn't yet doubled from September lows is Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). In this article, we'll revisit some of the indicators that I have historically liked for the native asset itself. And we'll get into what I currently think about the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( LTCN ). I'm Bullish Litecoin There is definitely some disagreement about longing Litecoin within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, but I've generally held the view that it's an underappreciated coin. LTC has been characterized as a ""dinosaur coin"" that doesn't solve a problem but I disagree. Structurally, it's very similar to Bitcoin. It utilizes a proof of work consensus mechanism that requires a network of decentralized miners for transaction validation. Hash Distribution (IntoTheBlock) The distribution of that mining hash power is very similar to that of Bitcoin. There are big players and there are smaller operators. However, at 29.9% of hash rate distribution in a single mining pool, Litecoin is actually less reliant on its top mining pool than Bitcoin is. And as far as proof of work chains go, Litecoin is the only one that has been a worthy competitor to Bitcoin from a daily active user standpoint over the last few years: Active Addresses (CoinMetrics) During times of high fees on the Bitcoin network like what we witnessed back in May , crypto users have looked to Litecoin as a complimentary network when transaction prices get too high. I'm of the view that transactions will ultimately have to stay higher than current levels for Bitcoin miners longer term for mining to remain an economically viable business as the block reward diminishes over time. 90 Day NVT (CoinMetrics) Finally from a pure valuation standpoint, Litecoin is cheaper than every other PoW payment cryptocurrency network outside of ZCash ( ZEC-USD ) based on the 90 day NVT ratio average. Where most of these coins have 90 day NVT ratios near or above 200, LTC is still below 100. This metric aims to assign a valuation multiple for each network that utilizes a coin's market cap and the amount of value that is transacted over the network over a rolling 90 day period. As has been the case for the better part of a year, LTC's NVT ratio has been well below that of Bitcoin, Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), and Dash ( DASH-USD ). LTCN Is Now Expensive Grayscale is the largest digital asset manager in the public markets with roughly $30 billion in AUM spread out over more than a dozen single asset funds. These funds have been one of the best ways to trade cryptocurrencies through a tax-advantaged investment account. The tradeoff for easy access to crypto exposure through a traditional brokerage has been high fees and occasionally even illiquidity. Each of these things have likely contributed to what can be wild swings in NAV premium/discount pricing. The fact that these trust shares have traded at a discount to net asset value over the last two years has been well covered by myself and other analysts on Seeking Alpha. The smaller funds have notoriously been extremely volatile. I covered this last year when Grayscale's Filecoin Investment Trust ( FILG ) traded at a nonsensical 175% premium to NAV. We're seeing this happening again in that fund and in Grayscale's Solana Trust ( GSOL ) - which is currently trading at a preposterous 880% premium and is almost certainly going to end badly for GSOL holders who are buying that fund today. LTCN NAV Premium Rate (CoinGlass) What we haven't seen in the last two years is the larger funds trading at premiums to NAV but we're starting to see that now. As of November 10th, LTCN shares trade at a 7% premium to NAV. This is after trading at a NAV discount as deep as 60% last December. At $109 million in AUM, LTCN is Grayscale's fourth largest single asset fund and it's the only fund in the top 4 that is trading at a premium. Furthermore, there are smaller Grayscale funds that still trade at a discount. I think there are two ways to look at this. On one hand, it seems as though traditional investors are attempting to front run a move in LTC that hasn't happened yet. On the other, a prudent investor who is bullish Litecoin might be wise to rotate out of LTCN and instead buy LTC through a crypto-IRA account like those offered by a company like iTrustCapital. Risks The main risk with holding any cryptocurrency is the perceived volatility against fiat currencies. These assets can whipsaw 30-40% in a very short amount of time and the lower you go down the crypto market cap rankings the more aggressive those swings can be. There is added risk with longing cryptocurrency trusts because they introduce counterparty risk to assets that are designed specifically to not require custodian counterparties. Given the amount of uncertainty regarding Grayscale's parent company Digital Currency Group, I think it's prudent to take proper precautions when getting exposure to Grayscale funds. Mainly, don't get overexposed. Related parties often own large percentages of the Grayscale shares outstanding and any forced liquidations from those related parties could depress NAV discounts if the market for the fund shares weakens. Summary I still really like Litecoin for many of the same reasons that I have laid out over the last 12 to 18 months. Functionally, it's a useful currency with a hard cap on supply and a robust user base compared to other proof of work blockchain networks. I largely view Litecoin as the silver to Bitcoin's gold. This has been a comparison that has been made for several years but I believe there is some credence to the idea. Litecoin has many of the same characteristics that make Bitcoin so valuable but the network can be utilized at a much cheaper cost to transact for the user. I think investors who want tax-advantaged ways to trade cryptocurrency proxies and derivatives would be wise to have both standard IRAs that support Grayscale fund trading and crypto-specific IRAs that offer trading in the underlying assets more directly. With this dual-account approach, investors can maintain desired exposure levels to digital assets while opportunistically buying and selling the Grayscale funds depending on the premium/discount rate. While I have traded the Grayscale Litecoin Trust shares many times in the past, it's not a fund that I currently hold because the NAV arbitrage has flipped to favor sellers. However, because I do think Litecoin itself has plenty of room to run higher, I'll rate LTCN a hold with the caveat that it will likely underperform the underlying asset from here due to the NAV premium.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4651357-bullish-litecoin-careful-chasing-grayscale-litecoin-trust?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20156227.jpeg

According to Kaiko’s data on November 12, not only is the ETH-BTC ratio shifting and reversing after extended periods of lower lows, but also there is a notable uptick in trading volume with funding rates in crypto derivative platforms shifting from negative to positive, suggesting increasing demand. Ethereum Breakout Above $2,000 As of writing on November 13, Ethereum is relatively firm and changing hands at around the $2,090 level. Despite the expected contraction in trading volume over the past couple of days following the rally on November 9, the uptrend remains in place. Related Reading: Chainlink Forms Sell Signal, Analyst Predicts Pullback To This Level So far, the immediate support level technical analysts are watching remain at $2,000, marking July 2023 highs. Conversely, the $2,100 zone, marking the April high, is a critical liquidation level that optimistic bulls must break for a buy trend continuation pattern. As it is, traders are optimistic. However, whether the uptrend will continue depends primarily on trader sentiment and if existing fundamental factors might spark more demand, lifting ETH to new 2023 highs. Thus far, even though the general ETH support base remains upbeat, the coin, unlike Bitcoin (BTC), is struggling to break key resistance levels recorded in H1 2023, which is a concern. ETHBTC Turning Bullish As Funding Rate Flips Positive On the positive side, looking at the ETHBTC candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the sharp reversal of ETH fortunes on November 9 could anchor the next leg up, signaling a new shift in a trend that favors Ethereum buyers. Looking at the ETHBTC formation, Bitcoin bulls have had the upper hand in 2023.

However, the sharp recovery on November 9 and the subsequent failure of BTC bulls to reverse losses suggest that ETH has the upper hand. Thus far, ETHBTC prices are trending inside the November 9 bullish engulfing bar at the back of light trading volumes, a net positive for bullish ETH holders. Following this surge, Kaiko notes that the funding rate of the ETHUSDT pair is positive, signaling increasing demand in the crypto derivatives scene. When funding rates turn positive from negative, it means “long” traders are paying “short” traders to keep their positions open. This development indicates that more traders are long ETH, expecting prices to rise in the sessions ahead.

The arrival of BlackRock and other asset managers in the crypto space will bring Wall Street control to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's rally in 2023 is driven by speculation and the potential approval of a spot ETF, but it does not indicate mainstream adoption. Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) has had a strong year with a gain of around 124% and crypto enthusiasts are cheering the impending arrival of BlackRock with spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Let’s look at the potential impact of the world’s largest asset manager in crypto. BlackRock’s entry ends the decentralization issue The reality of BlackRock’s entry into cryptocurrency is that it ends the idea of a decentralized world currency. In my opinion, BlackRock's filing of ETFs for Bitcoin, and now for Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ), make it a certainty that the Securities and Exchange Commission will give their blessing to a spot market-based ETF. I also believe that anyone who thinks the SEC will decline a spot offering really doesn't see how the corridors of power in Wall Street work. Larry Fink's asset management behemoth has spotted an opportunity and I don't believe Mr. Main Street will be the ultimate winner. First of all, if the Bitcoin enthusiasts are right about strong investor adoption then it simply means that the current whale-controlled speculative behavior in BTC gets handed over to Wall Street. In BlackRock's SEC filing for the BTC ETF, it said: ""All shares in the ETF will be fully backed by BTC and no new shares can be issued without delivery of the corresponding value of tokens. "" The more investors that buy shares in the spot ETF, the more BTC the asset manager needs to buy. Bitcoin fans then need to realize that if the cryptocurrency eventually meets their lofty price projections, Larry Fink's BlackRock OWNS Bitcoin. Bitcoin's rally in 2023 is purely speculative Bitcoin was beaten down in 2022 after a multitude of fallouts in the crypto universe that exposed the reality of the sector. While crypto enthusiasts tout it as a decentralized haven from the manipulation and greed of the current financial system, Terra's Do Kwon and the collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX empire exposed the dirty reality of a world that is just as greedy and lawless as anything we have seen from Wall Street. The 124% rally in BTC is being driven by speculation in a coin that is controlled by whale speculators. It is no coincidence that whale activity in BTC and other coins has hit six-month highs according to data from Santiment . There has been no change in mainstream adoption and investors are driving prices higher in a thin market based on the ETF applications and next year's Bitcoin halving. The halving is every four-year event that sees mining rewards and Bitcoin issuance cut in half, making the coin more scarce. In the 2024 halving, the mining reward will drop from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. The reality of the BTC halving is that it makes the coin more scarce, and that means more control for BlackRock. And when BlackRock gets its ETF approved, it is highly likely in my view that the other ETF giants , such as Vanguard and State Street, join the show with a spot ETF. This is not the arrival of Bitcoin, it is the end of Bitcoin, in my view. Bitcoin will never be the world's currency I believe BlackRock's arrival into Bitcoin is to bring Wall Street control to another commodity. BTC will never replace gold but can offer a digital alternative. BlackRock knows this and the idea that BTC will be a payment currency dominating the world's economy is wrong and I have said that for a long time. In October 2021, I wrote an article on Seeking Alpha that called the high in BTC at $61,000. In that article , I asked if Bitcoin was simply a trojan horse for investors to accept the coming Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The United Kingdom has been touting a "" digital pound "" and this week it also stepped up plans to regulate stablecoins in the country. The Bank of England, the UK central bank, has now said that the country's financial regulator will oversee stablecoins. The BOE will “rely on” the Financial Conduct Authority to regulate custodians. However, it left open the potential for imposing its own rules such as relating to Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements. Central banks will now regulate crypto exchanges and stablecoins, while Wall Street will control Bitcoin. I believe the world will not adopt Bitcoin because a digital version of their money, which is easier to own for the layman than storing BTC in cold and hot wallets , is coming. The Bank of England has already laid out how you will ""buy a cup of tea, pay the electrician, and order groceries online"" with your digital pounds. The head of the Bank of International Settlements ((BIS)), Augustin Carstens, said in a speech recently: ""Whether in wholesale form – as a type of digital central bank reserve – or retail form – as a digital banknote – it is increasingly clear.... that these new forms of money will sit at the core of the future financial system"". The Reserve Bank of India is set to roll out a CBDC in January next year. U.S. Treasury Secretary also stressed the need for crypto regulation and the potential for a CBDC at an IMF meeting last month. In the passing of the European Union's Markets in Cryptocurrency Assets (MiCa) bill, lawmakers have inserted scrutiny on transactions of over 1,000 euros. Digital money is easier to track and it allows governments to raise higher taxes by eliminating the cash-based gig economy. Decentralization is officially dead but many investors cannot seem to grasp the obvious path we are on. The outlook for the Bitcoin price Looking at Fibonacci levels on a price chart from the high in Bitcoin in November 2021, the current price has just edged above the 38% level at around $36,000. A 50% retracement would be at $42,500, so BTC is not breaking big ground in relation to the highs. The 2022 dump was ultimately going to lead to oversold low level and now it is retracing. There is no confirmation yet of a new bull market. Bitcoin Weekly Chart (TradingView) I trade BTC in the futures market and would be looking at those two levels as the bigger picture. The daily and weekly movements are noise and what analysts think of the U.S. dollar, treasury yields, and ETF filings is largely meaningless. This week the price looks set to test the support provided by the 38% level. With the rise in Bitcoin, we are also back to the 2021 era of ridiculous price projections. This week it was Arthur Hayes, founder of the BitMEX exchange, reiterating his stance that BTC can hit $1 million and Ethereum can rise over 4,000%. Fundstrat's Tom Lee made similar predictions in 2021 that BTC will hit $100,000 or more. From a sentiment point of view, we are not at the 2021 level where amateur investors were loading up credit cards to buy BTC. That may mean that the move has further legs. A possible run to the $42,500 resistance and blow-off top around $50k is possible. I would agree with Bloomberg that the SEC approval of a spot ETF in Bitcoin will happen by January 2024. The recent gains in BTC will start to attract new retail investors and the hype could continue with the BlackRock ETF and lead into the halving hype. As an investor in BTC, which I am not, I would hold BTC for this type of market behavior. But beyond that, I think retail investors are being sucked into another BTC high. BlackRock's entry is a win for speculators but the concept of a decentralized world currency has been destroyed. A big change in investor adoption of BlackRock's ETF means the asset manager will own a huge part of the coin supply. Vanguard and State Street may follow and that brings a very big liquidity problem to the cryptocurrency sector. We are on a path to CBDCs and investors touting the arrival of a spot ETF fail to grasp that the smart money would have piled into BTC via all available avenues if they saw it becoming the future. They didn't do that and they won't do it now when BlackRock wants to charge them high ETF charges to hold an asset that is supposedly decentralized and free of third-party involvement.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4651344-bitcoin-blackrock-and-the-end-of-decentralization?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20154843.jpeg

According to recent reports, Grok zoomed to a staggering $160 million market cap within just eight days of its release. However, reports of alleged scam involvement have overshadowed the token’s rapid ascent. GROK Meteoric Rise Marred By Scammer Accusations Grok token prices have soared, doubling within the past 24 hours alone, extending a week-long rally that has seen an astonishing 13,000% increase. The token boasts an impressive 11,000 holders and has witnessed a trading volume of over $60 million over the past 24 hours, according to data from DEXTools. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Shines 40% Toward $60 As Whales Make Big Moves However, ZachXBT, a self-proclaimed crypto detective, has raised concerns about the legitimacy of Grok, stating that the token was created by a scammer. ZachXBT has stated that the same X/Twitter account associated with Grok has been linked to at least one other fraudulent scheme. ZachXBT stated: Not that people in this space will care but GROKERC20 GROK was created by a scammer. Same exact X/Twitter account has been reused for at least one other scam. X/Twitter ID: 1690060301465714692 Satoshi Flipper, another prominent crypto trader on X, echoed this sentiment, labeling Grok as an “effing scam” and emphasizing that Elon Musk did not authorize the token’s launch. Satoshi Flipper said: This is Grok. $1.9M liquidity and a $137M market cap? What an effing scam. Not only that, it’s completely fraudulent to trade this knowing Elon Musk, the owner of Grok, did not authorize these devs to launch a token. Imagine touching this toxic trash. Experts from Arkham Intelligence also weighed in, reporting that an on-chain trader sold a significant amount of GROK at nearly 40% slippage, reinforcing the scam allegations made by ZachXBT. The controversy surrounding Grok has raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community. Critics argue that the token’s market cap, coupled with the lack of authorization from Elon Musk, raises red flags. Impressive Turnaround The token’s market cap has undergone a retracement, now at $108 million, down from its previous value of $160 million. Additionally, the token exhibits a liquidity of $1.83 million. Despite experiencing a substantial slippage of 48%, with its price dropping as low as $0.0056000, the token has remarkably recuperated and is now trading at $0.0108452. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Price Fueled By Increase In Whale Activity It is yet to be determined whether further reports will surface to shed light on the individuals behind the token’s creation and their objectives, potentially exposing the risk of a rug pull within the cryptocurrency industry.

As of the time of writing, the Grok official account on X has not made any statements regarding these allegations.
