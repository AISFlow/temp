42379318,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SK9,1489783224,Report: Chinese Regulators Discuss Draft Rules With Bitcoin Exchanges,"China's bitcoin exchanges may soon be required to implement new and potentially onerous processes to ensure know-your-customer (KYC) verifications.  According to a report by Caixin, the People's Bank of China has issued a discussion paper to domestic exchanges on which it is seeking comment for proposed requirements. The procedures are part of a broader effort by the central bank to standardize policies at exchanges and stamp out money laundering and other financial crimes.  According to the report, the document details both a standardization of anti-money laundering (AML) policies and the establishment of a customer identification system.  First-time users, the report indicates, will need on-site certification in order to deposit funds. Prospective users will then be required present identification at the time of registration. For customers doing ¥50,000 (over $7,200) in volume or more, a remote video certification will be required for identity authentication.  The paper also stipulates that there must be senior management personnel responsible for AML procedures, including reporting questionable transactions.  The new rumors come in the wake of the PBoC's January decision to intervene in the domestic bitcoin market amid what was then a period of heavy market volatility.  Since that time, the interactions have seen bitcoin exchanges implement a number of new policies, ending margin trading and freezing withdrawals for digital currencies.  At press time, withdrawals were still frozen across domestic exchanges.

The Zcash Foundation will now be endowed with 273,000 zcash, worth more than $13m at press time. As part of the network's rules, 10% of the cryptocurrency's mining rewards are automatically awarded to stakeholders.  As such, Zerocoin Electric Coin Company CEO and project co-founder Zooko Wilcox expects to donate half of his ""founders reward"" to the entity.  Wilcox told CoinDesk:  ""In the long run, it is necessary for there to be an independent, inclusive, non-profit body to steward the technology in the interests of all.""  One focal point for the organization will be to steer open-source development of the anonymous cryptocurrency, known for its innovative use of zk-SNARKS, a technology that shields senders, receivers and balances of each address, data that is public on most other cryptocurrencies.  Most recently, zcash announced the new stage in the project's technical roadmap.  Another goal will be to ""promote a healthy and diverse zcash community,"" according to the announcement.  The four-person board of directors includes chair and president Andrew Miller, associate director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3), and Matthew Green, assistant professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University.  Wilcox described it as marking a transition in the governance of the cryptocurrency since Zcash Company will no longer be the only entity working on its development.  ""This is a shift of power in the zcash ecosystem, because I have no power over the Zcash Foundation,"" he concluded.

42379316,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SIt,1489766502,Bitcoin Exchanges Unveil Hard Fork Contingency Plan,"A group of nearly 20 exchanges has released contingency plans in the event that the bitcoin network splits in two, creating two competing currencies.  The exchanges are now planning to list Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) as they would an alternative cryptocurrency, according to the statement. BU is an alternate implementation of the bitcoin software that seeks to expand the block size in an effort to scale the network's capacity.  According to the statement – backed by Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTCC, Bitso, Bitsquare, Bitonic, Bitbank, Coinfloor, Coincheck, itBit, QuadrigaCX, Bitt, Bittrex, Kraken, Ripio, ShapeShift, The Rock Trading and Zaif – the exchanges would list the BU asset under the BTU or XBU tickers in the event of a network split, which they collectively say ""may be inevitable"".  Other exchanges, though not listed as signatories, are said to be planning similar steps but have not signed on to this particular statement.  The strategy’s emergence comes amid escalating tension among those advocating for different scaling directions, and signals that some are taking the prospect of a network split seriously. It also follows statements from some in the exchange sector that preparations for such an outcome are being made.  The exchanges have positioned the policy choices as practical rather than political in nature. To the group, the strategy provides a means to organize a steady-handed market transition, one in which two currencies emerge that share twin transaction histories – and in which bitcoin holders are suddenly in possession of twice the amount of coins they had before.  The exchanges said:  ""As exchanges, we have a responsibility to maintain orderly markets that trade continuously 24/7/365. It is incumbent upon us to support a coherent, orderly and industry-wide approach to preparing for and responding to a contentious hard fork. In the case of a bitcoin hard fork, we cannot suspend operations and wait for a winner to emerge.""  Call for replay protection  Yet the statement reveals that the signatories aren’t ready to immediately start listing BU as a tradable asset, should it be created.  A major concern among the signatories is the risk of transaction replays, or instances in which a transaction broadcast on one blockchain might be included on a second one unintentionally. This situation played out in the wake of the ethereum network split last year.  According to the statement, exchanges want to see BU account for this risk ahead of any hard fork.  ""However, none of the undersigned can list BTU unless we can run both [blockchains] independently without incident. Consequently, we insist that the Bitcoin Unlimited community (or any other consensus breaking implementation) build in strong two-way replay protection,"" the group said. ""Failure to do so will impede our ability to preserve BTU for customers and will either delay or outright preclude the listing of BTU.""  The exchanges also solicited input from stakeholders as they put contingency plans in motion.  ""We welcome any and all assistance that the development community may offer in reducing the risk inherent with such a pivotal moment in bitcoin's history,"" according to the statement.

42399673,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP5O,1489752933,Ethereum's Price Surge is Sparking Institutional Investor Interest,"With the recent surge in the price of ether, institutional investors have started taking a greater interest in the cryptocurrency, OTC trading experts have told CoinDesk.  Ether, the token that powers the smart contract-focused blockchain platform ethereum, has seen its price climb roughly 150% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap, reaching above $40 in a historic first for the asset.  In response, analysts have offered varying explanations when explaining this sharp price increase, with some pointing to an overall rally in digital currencies and others asserting that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is encountering noticeable tailwinds as a result of bitcoin’s recent struggles.  Martin Garcia, vice president for Genesis Global Trading, weighed in on how ether's sharp rally has helped spark the interest of institutions.  He told CoinDesk:  ""As the market cap has increased in recent weeks, we've finally started to see institutional investor interest pick up in ethereum, something we hadn't really seen before.""  Garcia noted that price action has occurred on both sides of the trade, with some investors seeking to short the fast-moving market as well.  Yet, Garcia was not alone in expressing this sentiment.  Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, offered similar input, stating that his firm, which places large trades for both high net-worth individuals and institutions, has been trading ether ""quite a bit"".  The cryptocurrency has proved to be quite popular as of late, he told CoinDesk.  ""We do get a lot of calls for ethereum now. I would say about 30% of the phone calls we got this week were for ethereum,"" Yeh explained.  Garcia also spoke to the digital currency's rising popularity, emphasizing that historically, his firm's institutional interest has involved bitcoin. However, his clients' recent interest in ether has served as a contrast.  One consequence of this cryptocurrency's growing popularity is that ether is ""probably one of the more liquid spot trades on the market"", Yeh told CoinDesk.  This heightened liquidity is just one more positive sign for ether, whose market capitalization recently surpassed $4bn for the first time ever.

42399671,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP3Q,1489748415,The Trump Administration is Buying Into Blockchain Tech,"High-level US regulators and officials spoke out in favor of expanding the adoption of blockchain technology across government and the private sector at the DC Blockchain Summit, held this week in the nation’s capital.  There, representatives from the Trump administration, Congress and executive branch agencies acknowledged the potential of blockchain, and called for further development at the technology’s intersection with public policy. Specifically, they highlighted the technology's potential to streamline bureaucracy, empower consumers and drive economic growth.  Notably, Mark Calabria, chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, made an unscheduled presentation Wednesday to tell the gathering that the administration of the president is encouraged by developments in blockchain technology.  He said there's an enthusiasm to see what possible applications exist in government, finance and elsewhere, particularly as the Treasury Department conducts a full review of the financial system.  Calabria told the gathering:  ""We are approaching this with an open mind. We recognize that we're not necessarily the innovators, but what we can do is get out of the way and figure out where the government stops you from being innovative.""  Calabria also iterated that the president's team wants to listen and learn from the blockchain community, as well as do what it can to lay the groundwork for further development.  Civic benefits  Elsewhere, the co-chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus addressed the conference and asserted that they are keen to get a stronger grasp on how the technology can be deployed in the public sector.  ""We're very interested in helping to facilitate the deployment of blockchain technology in federal agencies and across the government,"" said co-chair Jared Polis, a Democrat from Colorado.  He added:  ""Our role is to prod government agencies to look at more efficient ways of doing things.""  David Schweikert, the Republican co-chair from Arizona, emphasized that one of the caucus's main goals is to keep policymakers informed of the technology's transformative potential, and act as an emissary between government, industry and academia.  ""How do those of us who do policy not leap ahead and screw up what we don’t know is coming tomorrow? Sometimes those of us who get elected are arrogant sometimes in what we think we know,"" Schweikert said.  He continued:  ""How do we help our brothers and sisters in Congress understand this isn’t just about cryptocurrency? There's an incredible world out there that's so much bigger.""  Unifying issue  Polis added that despite the heated partisan climate in Congress, he's optimistic that blockchain could transcend partisan divides.  ""The utopian aspect of people being in control of their own information has broad appeal to both the left and the right,"" he said.  Debbie Bucci, an IT architect at the Department of Health and Human Services, also spoke of her efforts to push for blockchain exploration within her department. Last year, her department issued its first-ever call for white papers on how blockchain technology could be applied in a healthcare setting, and earlier this month it held a blockchain hackathon.  Bucci suggested that her team's interest in blockchain has created a softened position within the rest of HHS.  ""We made a concerted effort to really get a better understanding about what blockchain is and what it isn't,"" she said. ""Because we gave some level setting of what it is, even within my own agency they recognize the name, they recognize the term blockchain.""  Public and private  Yet, there was an acknowledgement that the private sector has a role to play in the government's adoption as well.  David Treat, managing director of financial services at Accenture, reckoned that the public sector openness to blockchain was not just political grandstanding, but evidence of an ongoing shift inside what are traditionally conservative, risk-averse entities.  Treat said:  ""It was a completely different dynamic of not being reactive and not being, 'Tell me what you did, and let's opine on whether that was good or OK.' It was actually, 'We see this thing on the horizon, we know it has relevance - can you teach us?'""  Blockchain advocates say that adoption of the tech by the government will help normalize it for use in other sectors, and there's evidence that process is taking place.  The DC Blockchain Summit, in its second year, drew more than 450 developers, attorneys and consultants from 20 different countries, according to conference organizers.

42399672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyP4P,1489741246,4 Ways Blockchain Can Disrupt Civic Traditions,"Peter Loop is associate vice president and principal technology architect at Infosys, a next-generation IT services provider.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Loop discusses his company's big-picture vision for the non-monetary applications of blockchain technology.  Blockchain's ability to ensure trust and transparency in financial transactions and to establish smart contracts is well understood.  But its true potential goes well beyond the merely transactional. Because of its unique ability to secure trust between parties that don’t know, or even trust, one another, blockchain tech could be used to tackle some of the trickiest and most stubborn issues that exist in every society.  In fact, if designed well, blockchain could serve as a medium for civic participation in the 21st century, and as a mechanism of protection within fundamental democratic institutions by reducing corruption and fraud.  It’s possible that the public sector could be one of blockchain’s biggest beneficiaries.  Here are four potential opportunities in which blockchain could improve public processes:  Digital identities  Not everyone will agree a 'digital identity' is necessary or desirable.  Nonetheless, blockchain tech can prove a useful tool for the public sector by operating as a reliable means of identification.  Any modifications to a blockchain must conform to specific rules. Nodes, which are spread across the network, confirm these rules were met and that the two parties to the transaction can proceed. Once the transaction is complete, the public ledger is permanently updated with the transaction's record incorporated through a hash – an unmodifiable string of data.  Applying this technology as a form of digital identification, while simple in theory, is a complex task. The best solution is to marry a person's digital ID with biometric data. By linking this ID with a unique trait, such as an iris scan, one can confirm if a digital ID corresponds to a person’s hashed biometric information. There can be no two nodes with the same biometric information.  This could simplify a number of dealings between the citizen and institutions.  Personal data such as driver's license information and medical records could be easily and securely shared. With blockchain, the more transactions using the information, the more secure it becomes.  Let’s say a student wants to transfer his or her transcripts to a graduate school. Normally, this would require the student’s undergrad college and the graduate school to communicate and share data through a complicated backend system.  With a blockchain, the student need only share his or her hashed information – the personal information generated during undergraduate college – for approval. The graduate school can then approve or deny candidacy based on the first school’s data and criteria.  Doing so also adds another block to the chain, improving the chain's trustworthiness.  Taxes  Blockchain can also help cut down tax evasion and misallocation of tax funds, and radically transform tax transparency.  For example, smart contracts can ensure tax funds are only transferred after a detailed and approved grant is issued. The blockchain could also lock up tax funds so they're only spent on what they’re allocated for.  Any transactions would be immediately verified and documented.  This benefits both the taxpayer and the tax collector: collectors can easily use the public ledger to confirm if a citizen (partially anonymized) has paid their taxes, while qualifying taxpayers can ensure only they receive their tax returns.  Not only would this drastically reduce instances of tax fraud, it would allow government auditors to monitor transactions and ensure collected taxes are allocated and spent appropriately.  Elections  Election fraud could be nearly eliminated by blockchain, simply because it removes the opportunity commit fraud in the first place. For this, we can again thank the fundamental nature of blockchain.  With a blockchain-based voting system in place, all a voter needs to do is cast their digital ballot. As 'blocks', the voter's choices will go directly to their preferred candidate’s digital ledger, which would grow as a result.  The candidate with the larger blockchain with verified votes wins. There is no intermediary and the information needed to verify the authenticity of the voter is incorporated into the chain.  This removes almost any opportunity for a human to tamper with the voting system.  Political donations  Finally, there's the always thorny issue of money in politics.  Political funding has always inspired debate, and there seems to be no single system that will satisfy all citizens, political parties or candidates. Blockchain technology won't end that. It could, however, provide clarity into political donations from a wide network of people – no matter how small the donation.  When regulations exist that require limits on funding by a single individual or organization, loopholes may still be abused, such as donating in smaller amounts repeatedly.  The blockchain could put an end to this in a peer-to-peer network, as it contains all the information relevant to a donation, no matter the amount. Everyone is clearly identified and all transactions appear on the ledger. This system could be augmented with smart contracts prohibiting certain organizations or people from issuing donations after a pre-determined limit is reached.  Potential issues  There is, however, a caveat to these theoretical scenarios: following a token through the blockchain once it's traded is not yet possible due to blockchain's use of cryptographic hashes. Developing a method to track traded data over blockchains is an area of opportunity for those in the community – and a necessary requirement for some of the above scenarios.  To be certain, there is no such thing as a fool-proof system. Any implementation of blockchain in any of these settings will need thorough vetting. They will still need to be monitored for abuse, and weaknesses in their design will need to be addressed as they pop up.  But these potential shortcomings are dwarfed by the potential for blockchain to improve how these processes currently function.

42399688,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyPK9,1489712433,"Bitcoin Price Support Weakens in Dip Below $1,200","After several days of rangebound trading, bitcoin's price took a tumble today.  The digital currency's price fell to as little as $1,132.45 by 21:00 UTC, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data shows. This daily low represented a more than 10% decline from bitcoin's opening price of $1,259.60.  This sharp drop – which represents the largest intraday loss since the SEC shot down the proposed Winklevoss bitcoin ETF on 10th March – contrasts sharply with bitcoin's behavior over the last several sessions, when it fluctuated between $1,225 and $1,260.  After moving within that reasonably tight range since the start of trading on Monday, bitcoin's price experienced a notable increase in volatility during today's session, falling through the crucial $1,200 level at 19:00 UTC and then dropping through $1,150 at 21:00 UTC. Following this significant, downward movement, the digital currency recovered somewhat, reaching $1,171.47 at the time of report.  The day's sharp declines took place amid high trading volume.  Market participants traded roughly 48,000, 30,000 and 18,000 through exchanges Bitfinex, Kraken and Coinbase in the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC, compared to daily averages of approximately 33,700, 19,000 and 12,000 over the last seven days, Bitcoinity figures reveal.  Both today's sharp drop – and the rangebound trading that was present in recent sessions – have occurred as bitcoin continued to face ongoing technical challenges. The scaling debate, in particular, has been drawing significant attention, as industry insiders have been unable to develop a consensus after two years of ongoing debate.  As a result, the perceived need for a hard fork (or the creation of two separate bitcoin blockchains and tokens) has grown.  While such an event could create far larger blocks with significantly greater capacity, market experts have warned it could also reduce prices notably.
