42402666,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyae,1551908702,Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on JPM Coin: Other Banks Won't Use It,"Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of San Francisco blockchain startup Ripple, gave JP Morgan Chase qualified praise Wednesday for creating its own stablecoin, before dismissing the product's likelihood of adoption by other banks and questioning its usefulness.  During a fireside chat at the Chamber of Digital Commerce's D.C. Blockchain Summit in Washington, Garlinghouse said he thinks it's ""great"" to have major financial players like JP Morgan ""leaning in.""  But, he quickly added:  ""That’s the only nice thing I’m going to say about this.""  Indeed, Garlinghouse, whose company has been courting financial institutions to use its distributed ledger technology (DLT) for payments – including products that utilize the cryptocurrency XRP – promptly cast doubt on the prospects for the recently announced JPM Coin.  At another conference last week, Garlinghouse recalled, ""This guy from Morgan Stanley was interviewing me, I said ‘So, is Morgan Stanley going to use the JPM Coin?’ And he said ‘probably not.’ So, well is Citi going to use the JPM Coin? Is BBVA? Is PNC? And the answer is no.""  Hence, he suggested, a bank creating its own stablecoin risks recreating the very problems that DLT is supposed to solve.  ""So, does that mean we’re going to have all these different coins? Are we back to where we are with lack of interoperability? I don’t get it.""  Garlinghouse even started to sound like a blockchain industry critics when he wondered aloud what the point would be of tokenizing fiat currency when it remains on the books of a single entity.  ""If you give them a dollar for deposits, they’ll give you a JPM Coin that you can then move within the JPM ledger. Wait a minute, just use the dollar!"" he said. ""I don’t understand. If you’re just moving within the JPM ledger, and it has to be dollar-to-dollar, one-to-one backing, I don't understand what problem that solves.""  He wrapped up his comments about the subject on a diplomatic note, however, concluding:  ""Now, back to my first answer, if it solves the first [problem] of JPM leaning into crypto, yay. That’s all I got.""

42402676,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyjV,1551897002,UNICEF Explores Blockchain to Improve Internet for 'Every School' in Kyrgyzstan,"Children’s non-profit organization UNICEF is in talks with the government of Kyrgyzstan to leverage blockchain technology to provide Internet access to every school in the country.  “We are at the early stages of exploring a blockchain-based solution for the Project Connect initiative in Kyrgyzstan where the government is working with UNICEF and the private sector to connect every school in the country to the Internet and provide access to information and opportunity to all young people,” Munir Mammadzade, deputy representative for UNICEF Kyrgyzstan, told CoinDesk this week.  As part of a broader, ongoing initiative called Project Connect, UNICEF aims to engage over 1,500 local schools in Kyrgyzstan and explore the use of a blockchain-based solution for improving and monitoring Internet connectivity levels.  At present, Project Connect has already mapped Internet connectivity levels for over 150,000 schools across the globe. Of these, 1,560 schools are based in Kyrgyzstan – for which close to half are identified as having either no Internet connectivity or simply no data on the matter.  All this work is happening on “an accelerated, crazy crypto timeline,” according to lead personnel of UNICEF Ventures Chris Fabian, who told CoinDesk that “the blockchain piece” of Project Connect would come over the course of the present year.  “Right now, we’re still at a very early modular stage, doing the mapping, getting the connectivity piece and figuring out the accounting,” said Fabian.  Fabian explained:  “You can easily see where the blockchain layers would come in … If you want to pay as a donor – government or company – for a whole section of the country to come online, wouldn’t you rather do that in a way that is authentic and real and accountable as opposed to just sending money somewhere and hoping two years later that something happens?”  Fabian said blockchain could also help “improve the monitoring of the quality of Internet in schools and other vital facilities,” emphasizing that the potential for distributed ledger technology “as accounting, management and monitoring” was, in his opinion, multi-faceted.  A sneak preview  Giving a sneak preview of some of the blockchain tools that could be used to help facilitate UNICEF’s plans, Fabian pointed to two blockchain startups that recently received $100,000 each from the UNICEF Innovation Fund last December.  The first, called Utopixar, is a Tunisian startup building a blockchain platform that “enables communities to issue, distribute, and exchange their own impact tokens,” as stated in a blog post from December.  These impact tokens would be gifted to individuals and groups addressing social and environmental challenges in the community (such as Internet connectivity) that can, later on, be redeemed in the form of currency or discount vouchers.  The other startup called W3Engineers is a Bangladesh-based web application development and consulting firm that according to Fabian is “specifically looking at how to parcel out a gigabyte.”  In other words, the team is looking at how to dynamically allow individuals and businesses to purchase and sell units of digital information, which would be particularly relevant to the process of pricing the costs of internet connectivity as it relates to Project Connect.  “As with all of our blockchain work, we are working through prototypes, failures and learnings,” said Fabian.  Just last year, UNICEF launched a charitable donations website that mines cryptocurrencies to raise funds for vulnerable children worldwide. The initiative currently reports close to 28,000 donors.

42402670,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyea,1551891623,ConsenSys-Backed Civil Tries Again on Newsroom Token Launch,"ConsenSys-backed media startup Civil finally launched its CVL token today after months of delay.  Many independent newsroom employees and Civil Media partners will now receive the token compensation packages they were promised in 2018, Civil Media CEO Matthew Iles told CoinDesk.  All the earnings from this ongoing token sale will go to the nonprofit Civil Foundation, led by former NPR CEO Vivian Schiller. Participants from nearly 100 newsrooms joined the CVL community and Schiller took the helm of community growth last summer, thanks in part to additional token grants and fiat funding for the foundation from ConsenSys, the venture studio bankrolled by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin.  Civil Media also launched a membership program today with perks such as tickets to quarterly events, an exclusive newsletter and forum access where members can interact directly with journalists at participating news organizations.  All newsrooms are welcome to join as long as they own CVL and abide by the Civil Constitution of journalism ethics. Civil Media’s token curated registry is meant to allow stakeholders to challenge (or expel) unethical content creators or upvote trustworthy news sources.  Speaking to the distinction between the relatively new foundation, tasked with overseeing governance, and the Civil Media startup now providing software-as-a-service to both news outlets and readers, Iles said:  “It’s absolutely our intention to start generating revenue as a for-profit company this year.”  This may prove to be a daunting task for a notoriously cash-strapped media industry. However, Iles is confident his 17-person startup can sell services to these newsrooms through partnerships with organizations such as the Associated Press.  “Tipping and revenue generating tools are on the roadmap coming soon after this launch,” Iles said, adding his startup is focused giving token holders the ability to own their own data and content platform.  Based on user feedback from the previous attempt at launch, Civil members can now donate to the foundation with a credit card and aren’t required to own CVL to access content. For token holders, these members will have a crypto wallet associated with their subscription account in order to provide opportunities for monetizing audience data and insights.  “Wherever you are on the web, we can kind of follow you with that Web3 injection,” Iles said, referring to the ConsenSys vision of blockchain use cases applied to standard web traffic monitoring procedures.  “As long as [readers] are in control of [their online identity] and aware that this newsroom is in good standing, we think that’s going to lead to some pretty cool outcomes,” he added.  Crypto tipping  So far, the CVL token is being used for membership – not payments on the network.  In the meantime, Popula founder Maria Bustillos put her fiat Civil grant to work by hiring an independent developer and designer to enable ether tipping using ConsenSys’ in-browser MetaMask crypto wallet on Popula’s WordPress site.  The first week this feature went live, on Feb. 14, Bustillos told CoinDesk several dozen readers used the tipping feature.  “You can tip as little as a few cents and there’s no limit to how much,” she said, declining to specify how much value those tips contained or how much the original ConsenSys grant to Popula was worth.  Popula’s freelance designer, Matt McVickar, told CoinDesk the crypto tips feature was still under development and is “certainly not ready for wider adoption yet.”  Many critics remain skeptical regarding how CVL might add value to journalism business models. However, while Bustillos said it’s “really hard to say” how CVL plays into to her business model, she is still hopeful this asset could provide utility for newsrooms.  “It will have network effects. Where people reading one publication will be naturally led to another,” Bustillos said. “We’re all kind of guinea pigs in this great experiment. So we’re going to try it and see.”  Early days  Until these experiments come to fruition, newsrooms like Popula generally rely on a combination of fiat subscriptions and crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter to stay afloat.  Bustillos expressed gratitude at not needing to turn a profit in the short-term due to faith in Lubin’s backing and broader industry efforts to help establish compliant guidelines for token projects.  According to Bustillos, regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 dampened enthusiasm for CVL even though these tokens were designed for business usage and not investment. (The original CVL sale was canceled in October 2018 due to lack of buyer interest.)  Regardless of regulations for niche tokens like CVL, Bustillos said newsrooms won’t be able to rely on cryptocurrency as a core pillar of their business models for the near future.  “We don’t expect to make any money on the tipping, at least not for a very, very long time,” Bustillos said. “But it’s a key dimension of what we think the future of journalism should look like.”  Image of Civil staffers via Nick Himmel",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/03/06/consensys-backed-civil-tries-again-on-newsroom-token-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95008cddaed8854452fe94d9b75da6da133877fd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For the initiative, the ECCB late last month inked a deal with Barbados-based fintech firm Bitt to help conduct the pilot, with other technical support from Pinaka Consulting.  This CBDC pilot will involve a ""securely minted and issued"" digital version of the Eastern Caribbean dollar (XCD) and will be distributed for use by financial institutions across the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), according to an announcement from Bitt.  The stablecoin, DXCD, is intended for use in financial transactions between consumers and merchants and peer-to-peer transactions such as sending money to friends or family within the ECCU. Funds will be able to be sent using devices such as smartphones.  The governor of the ECCB, Timothy N. J. Antoine, stressed that the pilot is not an ""academic exercise.""  He explained:  ""Not only will the digital EC Dollar be the world’s first digital legal tender currency to be issued by a central bank on blockchain but this pilot is also a live CBDC deployment with a view to an eventual phased public rollout.""  The pilot comes as part of the ECCB’s strategic plan for 2017-2021, which aims to reduce the use of cash in the union by 50 per cent, as well as bring more stability to the financial sector and boost development of ECCU member countries, Antoine said.  ""It would be a game-changer for the way we do business,” he added.  The pilot is launching this month and, after roughly 12 months of development and testing, will be followed by rollout and implementation in pilot countries for about six months.

Joining the effort to see if distributed ledger technology (DLT) can help make shareholder voting more simple and efficient are Deutsche Bank, DBS, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, as well as securities software provider SLIB.  As in many areas of finance, shareholder voting on corporate decisions is made ""cumbersome"" by the current ""time-consuming and resource intensive"" paper-based process, SWIFT explained.  Explaining why DLT has the potential to help solve the issue, the firm said:  ""Proxy voting, in particular, frequently results in error-prone and complex manual processes, which the industry can avoid by fostering greater transparency and automation.""  The proof-of-concept (PoC) trial sets out to test a DLT voting solution involving issuers and a central securities depository (CSD), with data managed over a permissioned private blockchain. The partners will also examine the viability of hybrid solutions that merge financial messaging standard ISO 20022 with DLT to boost interoperability and ""avoid market fragmentation,"" the announcement states.  Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank will act as as participants for the effort, while DBS and SGX will act as both participants and issuers. It's not clear from the announcement which CSD will be assisting the PoC.  SWIFT will host the trial in its sandbox testing environment, while the partners will use the SWIFT network and their existing SWIFT infrastructure and interfaces as they test the technologies.  As further aspect of the trial will examine SWIFT’s capacity to host applications in its sandbox and to reuse its security and interface stack for other purposes.  Soh Ee Fong, group head of Securities and Fiduciary Services at DBS, said:  “An innovative and seamless e-Voting platform in this industry is long overdue and DBS is pleased to join SWIFT in the PoC as both issuer and participant. ... With this solution, shareholder meetings will not be the same again.”  Back in 2017, SWIFT assisted a consortium backed by a group of CSDs on plans to develop a similar distributed ledger proxy voting system. That project also aimed to adhere to the ISO 20022 standard in an effort to ensure that the voting system could be applied across a wide range of services.

The firm announced Tuesday that the wallet solution combines an app and the VaultTel Intellichip card to store cryptocurrency private keys on mobile devices, using biometric authentication and ""military grade"" encryption to keep the funds safe.  The card can be placed in the SIM card slot of dual-SIM Android mobile phones, or can be used with a dongle accessory on iPhones, VaultTel said.  The biometric authentication feature ensures that only the phone's owner can transfer funds from the wallet, VaultTel explains on its website. ""More than that, no spy screen recorder or Trojan can record what is happening on your hardware wallet, as it's a not using your laptop or system resources,"" the firm adds.  The wallet is available for pre-order with two options: an Android package at a cost of £75 ($98) and an iOS package at £100 ($131), the website indicates.  The Intellichip uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) 512 to securely store data and also has optional features such as being able to restrict wallet access to a particular device and ""geolock,"" which constrains access to a particular geographic area.  VaultTel further said that it has implemented the latest bitcoin standards for the product, including Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 39 for mnemonic seeds and BIP44, which allows for HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets. Users can back up their wallets on other VaultTel cards.  The product has now launched for the U.S. market and is expected to be made available ""immediately"" in European countries through VaultTel’s U.K. subsidiary.  The use case for securely storing cryptocurrencies on mobile phones is fast taking off, with a flurry of launches occurring in recent months.  Samsung's upcoming flagship device, the Galaxy S10, is to feature a hardware enclave within the phone that is aimed to protect wallets on the device from hacking. Sirin Labs' blockchain phone also features a built-in hardware wallet.  However, none so far have taken the form factor that would fit a device's SIM slot.

42430232,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpu5h,1551873622,"Argentinian Government to Invest in Blockchain Projects Backed by Binance Labs, LatamEx","The government of Argentina is set to invest in early-stage blockchain startups backed by the venture arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance.  The country’s Ministry of Production and Labour announced Wednesday that it will match investments of up to $50,000 into every Argentinian blockchain project that receives funding from Binance Labs via the second season of its incubator program, and LatamEX Founders Lab.  The ministry plans to invest in up to 10 blockchain projects each year for a period of four years, and will make the investments through Founder Labs, a local blockchain accelerator.  ‘‘Latin America presents one of the most attractive markets for blockchain adoption and real use cases and Argentina is leading the way by serving as the market-opening gateway,’’ said Pablo Orlando, founder and CEO of LatamEx and Founders Lab.  The co-investment contract was signed after Binance Labs selected Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, as one of the hubs for its season two of the incubator program, according to the announcement.  Ella Zhang, head of Binance Labs, said in the statement:  “We are very excited to support blockchain projects, entrepreneurs and developers through our Buenos Aires chapter, to advise and mentor them, to find product-market fit, and provide them with in-time access to global blockchain technology development to solve local problems.”  While the bear crypto market has hit firms in other regions, CoinDesk recently reported that blockchain and crypto projects in Argentina are booming, thanks to a history of banks restricting customer access and an inflation rate that hit 47 percent in 2018.  “The sector is growing, it’s growing very well. It’s providing a lot of jobs. People are using these technologies for real survival needs and finding themselves in a better world than if they had to trust the government,"" Santiago Siri, founder of blockchain startup Democracy Earth Foundation and investor in several Argentinian crypto startups, told CoinDesk at the time.  With Argentina plagued by currency crises, the government needs to develop “a stability-seeking strategy that partly includes bitcoin,” wrote Michael J. Casey, chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, last September.  Edit: Added comment from Pablo Orlando.

42430244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpuLh,1551870025,Bitcoin Eyes $4K After Erasing Monday's Price Losses,"View  Bitcoin has erased losses seen on Monday with a strong bounce from the bullish 5-week moving average (MA) support of $3,703. That has raised the odds of a rally to the psychological hurdle of $4,000.  A bull flag breakout on the hourly chart also shows scope for a rise to $4,040 (target as per the measured move method). The bullish case would weaken if the flag breakout ends up trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market.  A UTC close below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low) would put the bears back in the driver's seat. That looks unlikely, as the quick recovery from key MA support has bolstered the bullish bias signaled by both the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27 and the weekly chart indicators.  With bitcoin's (BTC) quick reversal of the losses seen on Monday, the technical charts are again pointing to a rally to $4,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to a high of $3,877 yesterday, before seeing a UTC close at $3,844, according to Bitstamp data. The 3.9 percent gain engulfed the 2.4 percent drop registered on Monday.  The bounce from the 5-week moving average (MA) support at $3,703 has reinforced the bullish view put forward by the ascending indicator. The average is also bullishly holding above the 10-week MA for the first time since August 2008, as discussed yesterday.  Further, BTC’s persistent defense of the 100-day MA line, seen below $3,700, in the last nine days has weakened the high-volume bearish outside reversal witnessed on Feb. 24.  So, the doors look open for BTC to revisit $4,000 – more so, as the hourly chart is showing a bullish continuation pattern. As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,840, representing a 3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  Bitcoin’s strong bounce from the 100-day MA support line on the daily chart has strengthened the bullish signal of the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27.  Prices could soon rise above $3,897 – the high of the doji candle with long upper shadow created on Feb. 28. That would further raise the odds of a rally to the psychological hurdle of $4,000.  The 100-day moving average (MA) is also now flatlined (has shed bearish bias), which adds credence to the long-term bearish exhaustion signaled by the longer duration indicators.  Hourly chart  A bull flag breakout seen in the above chart indicates that the rally from lows below $3,700 has resumed and could yield a rally to $4,040 (target as per the measured move method).  Supporting that bullish case is a relative strength index (RSI) of 67.00.  A failed breakout is possible, though, which would take the shine off the bounce from key support at $3,700 and weaken the immediate bullish case.  That said, a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if prices find acceptance under $3,658 (low of the long-tailed doji on the daily chart).

42430229,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMptzh,1551866440,New Security Token Exchange ABE Wants to Bring Back Small-Cap IPOs,"A new security token trading venue is coming out of stealth mode with a novel strategy to help small U.S. companies go public with a minimal compliance burden.  Announced Wednesday, ABE Global plans to launch sometime this summer and aims to list over 100 tokens by the end of the year. Two of its three founders are Wall Street veterans who built trading businesses and sold them to well-known institutions.  One of them, CEO John Pigott, founded a fixed-income marketplace called ValuBond, later known as BondPoint and now a part of Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The other, ABE's COO, Joel Blom, was part of the founding team of the online brokerage Thinkorswim, which was eventually bought by TD Ameritrade.  Along with Roderick Psaila, the CEO of Maltese lender AgriBank, they started ABE in 2016, but the company has been flying under the radar until now. Last August it completed a $3 million funding round with investors including Distributed Global, Galaxy Digital and Gumi Ventures.  “We’ll be doing the next institutional round probably in the next two months,” CEO Pigott told CoinDesk. “But we’ve got plenty of capital for what we’re going to do in the next year or two.”  But what stands out about ABE is the way it intends to make tokenized securities available to a broad swath of buyers.  While the initial coin offerings (ICOs) of the 2017 boom marketed their tokens to the public without even telling regulators what they were up to, and security token offerings (STOs) have limited their audience to accredited investors and notified the SEC they were conducting registration-exempt offerings, ABE is trying a third way.  If it works, it could reopen a type of fundraising largely closed to small companies since the dot-com crash of the early 2000s.  Global reach  According to ABE's founders, the main advantage of the new Atlanta-based exchange will be its network of branches in different jurisdictions, the key one being Malta. “The regulators there have shown interest in supporting the new technology, they have educated themselves and they are really sophisticated about it,” Blom told CoinDesk.  The Maltese subsidiary is now in the process of obtaining an exchange license that will allow it to list various assets, including tokens, stocks, bonds and “most legacy financial instruments,” supporting trading 24 hours a day, Pigott said.  Other branches, ABE Americas and ABE Asia, will offer the tokens listed in Malta in the form of depositary receipts (DRs). A financial instrument dating at least as far back as the 1920s, DRs allow investors in one country to trade the stocks of companies listed in another. For example, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) trade on the NYSE.  In this case, each token issuer will conduct an initial public offering (IPO) on ABE Europe, where the tokens will be listed as equity. But once wrapped in depositary receipts, they can also be traded on ABE’s marketplaces in other jurisdictions. “This enables token issuers to access current brokerage accounts with no change in custody, settlements and account holdings,” said Pigott.  In the U.S., the ADRs will trade on ABE Americas, an alternative trading system (ATS) subject to lighter regulation than national securities exchanges — the company has applied for an ATS license from the SEC, Pigott said. Likewise, ABE Asia will hold licenses “similar to the ATS authorization”: a recognized market operator in Singapore, an ATS in Hong Kong, and a proprietary trading system in Tokyo.  It's an unorthodox use of ADRs, to say the least.  ""It is conceivable that a digital security could be listed on a non-U.S. exchange and follow this route and it's really a logical step in the evolution of our financing systems towards digital securities,"" Margaret N. Rosenfeld, a partner at the K&L Gates law firm, told CoinDesk. ""This would require the ADR facilities to agree to the deposit and new forms of depositary contracts with elements specific to digital securities, as well as the exchanges and the SEC to sign off on this. Very interesting legal puzzles involved, but all doable. It would be exciting to work on something like this.""  However, she noted that ADRs are an instrument that only non-U.S. companies can use.  Pigott acknowledged ABE is planning to use ADRs ""in an innovative way"" which nobody has tried before. However, he insisted it is legal in the U.S.  In any case, the ADR issuers will need to file a particular form with the SEC, so if the regulator has objections to the idea, it will become clear at the stage of filing. Even if it won't fly with the SEC, ABE's depositary receipts will be available in Europe and Asia, Pigott added.  Bringing small-caps back  If all goes according to plan, ABE will enable U.S. firms to raise capital on public markets at a much lower cost.  While the average IPO cost, according to PwC, in 2017 was more than $4.2 million in various fees, at ABE it will be between $200,000 and $500,000, depending on the size of the STO, the startup says.  One type of firm ABE will court is owners of real estate looking to fractionalize and sell shares in their properties.  “It offers a very clear departure from the era of ICOs, and it appeals to one of the global advantages of tokens,” Pigott told CoinDesk. “For example, there are a lot of Singapore investors that would like to hold the U.S. real estate, and a lot of American investors that would buy real estate in Singapore.""  The other focus of the new trading platform will be so-called small-cap companies (those with a market capitalization of between $300 million and $2 billion). Many of them are growing very fast, Pigott said, and until the 1990s, 400 to 800 of those companies would launch IPOs every year, but after 2000, when new, stricter regulations came in place, “that market got crushed by 95% and has never recovered.”  “As a consequence, you have these unicorns financed by venture capital firms and never have a $100-200 million dollar round for a private company, and it’s very odd,” Pigott said. “What we ended up with now is only accredited investors can access these companies.”  Calling American small-cap companies “one of the best wealth creation vehicles the world have ever seen,” he believes the new asset class of tokenized securities can re-open the broad world of investments to this segment of the U.S. population, with an ultimate goal “to connect the token economy with the global investment economy.”  While ABE will be entering an increasingly crowded STO field, including the already launched security token trading platforms tZERO and OpenFinance, the founders are not discouraged, with Blom concluding:  “It’s not a good idea if you don’t see other people pursuing it.”  Image of Joel Blom and John Pigott at the DC Blockchain Summit (second and third to the right) by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/06/new-security-token-exchange-abe-wants-to-bring-back-small-cap-ipos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64ae396a75f6b23768069070457aa37a7373112c-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SIX Group announced Tuesday that trading for the Amun Ethereum ETP started on March 5 under the ticker symbol AETH. The product carries an annual management fee of 2.5 percent and is backed by Switzerland-based firm Amun AG.  ETPs are a type of financial instruments with an underlying asset such as commodity or cryptocurrency that are traded on stock exchanges in a similar way to shares.  The Amun Ethereum ETP is now the third cryptocurrency-based ETP to be listed on SIX exchange. Late last month, the exchange started trading for Amun Bitcoin ETP under the ticker symbol ABTC.  And, last November, the stock exchange listed the Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP under the ticker symbol HODL which tracks the top 5 crypto assets in terms of market capitalization and liquidity. It currently comprises bitcoin, ether, XRP, bitcoin cash and litecoin.  The firm claims on its website that the basket ETP is up 1,113 percent since its launch.  Amun’s base prospectus for cryptocurrency-based ETPs issued last November states that the crypto ETP products do not qualify as a collective investment scheme under the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes (CISA). As such, the products are ""neither governed by the CISA nor supervised or approved by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA,"" it adds, and therefore do not provide the investor protections provided under the CISA.  SIX Group also recently announced plans to launch a blockchain platform to speed up trading of stocks and bonds later this year.

42430224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMptph,1551842147,Coinbase Says It Never Shared 'Personally Identifiable' Customer Data,"UPDATE (March 6, 23:47 UTC): This article has been updated with additional comments from Coinbase clarifying how the exchange shares data with third-party analytics firms.    ———————        Coinbase is taking steps to clarify statements made in the wake of its controversial acquisition of blockchain analytics firm Neutrino, a startup subsequently linked to Hacking Team, a group that aided governments known for human rights abuses.  Specifically, Christine Sandler, Coinbase’s director of institutional sales, justified the Neutrino acquisition during an interview with Cheddar last Friday by saying the exchange’s previous analytics provider was ""selling client data to outside sources."" Coinbase now says Sandler misspoke.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk Tuesday that the exchange “never shared our customers’ personally identifiable information with any third-party blockchain analysis vendors.”  Although Coinbase declined to specify which former partner Sandler was referencing or what type of data was being commercialized in ways it objected to, it’s important to note that blockchain analytics companies sell aggregate wallet data (without names or identifying personal information) as their core proprietary product.  The standard norm across the industry is for analytics providers to collect anonymous transaction data and commercialize access to that information for customers seeking to investigate suspicious activity.  For example, Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin explained to CoinDesk that firms often receive wallet and transaction information without names or other account information and use it to help customers across the ecosystem identify bad actors. He said they do not receive personal customer data and never sell data to external companies.  The competing analytics firm Elliptic confirmed in a blog post that it worked with Coinbase and wasn’t provided with “any personally identifiable information about their users.” It did provide other exchanges and clients with addresses and transactions associated with financial crimes, according to the blog post.  Although, the question of whether Coinbase would adopt a similar model, or look to other ways to monetize user data after its acquisition of Neutrino, was arguably ambiguous.  During an interview in February, Coinbase’s director of engineering and product, Varun Srinivasan, said the Neutrino team would continue serving external customers, turning other companies’ transaction data into a proprietary Coinbase offering.  A Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday that, as a part of its know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) programs, the exchange will ""continue to work with [blockchain analytics companies] that share our values,"" adding:  ""While we will always do what’s necessary to remain compliant in the regions in which we operate, we will not share broad sets of transaction and address information with vendors if it is beyond their immediate scope of work.""  The statements follow Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's blog post Monday in which he said that the company intends to “transition” out Neutrino employees associated with Hacking Team. However, at press time, this appears to have done little to quell user concerns.  Speaking to the widespread backlash over the news, former Coinbase user Eduardo Hernández, CEO of the investment startup Cryptico, told CoinDesk: “The lack of transparency is terrifying.”  User flight  While it's unclear how many users have left the exchange, Hernández is one out of five former Coinbase users who told CoinDesk they closed their account after the Neutrino acquisition.  He said Armstrong’s blog post lacked accountability since the post emphasized the Hacking Team co-founders have “no current affiliation” with the controversial software provider.  Another former Coinbase user, who goes by his Twitter handle @Lowbtc, told CoinDesk he is concerned about his personal data because Coinbase has a track record of allegedly failing to punish misbehaving employees, referring to an ongoing lawsuit in California that claims exchange employees engaged in insider trading.  Fortune  reported an internal investigation of the alleged insider trading at Coinbase concluded without any repercussions because two law firms contracted by the company found no wrongdoing took place.  Speaking to that broader context, @Lowbtc, who opened his Coinbase account in 2013 and closed it promptly after the Neutrino acquisition, said:  “On top of the ethical failure, I also consider this a massive security risk, letting those people have access to customer data. It's really frightening to think who has gained access to Coinbase customer data over the years.”  Image of Brian Armstrong via TechCrunch",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/06/coinbase-says-it-never-shared-personally-identifiable-customer-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87364cf0cc5f1ae2ac0587b49b0d3ed6557df1e9-2048x1366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430239,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpuHh,1551832821,People Are Paying Bitcoin to Send Weird and Wild Messages Into Space,"You're not sure where it will end up exactly or who will actually read it. But you type up a message, pay a couple of cents in bitcoin and click the ""send"" button. Your message zips through space – yes, space – then is broadcast out of a satellite, blanketing the world.  The result? A cosmic ""message in a bottle"" that's become the latest novelty in the bitcoin technical community.  It's all possible with the help of Blockstream satellite, an eccentric project released over a year ago with the goal of making bitcoin accessible for people without internet access. Sending messages has gotten easier since then, with the launch of spacebit.live, a simple website that allows users to pay a small fee (the default of which is 3 cents in testnet bitcoin) to send a message via those satellites across the world.  So far, the results make an interesting study.  One message features a journal of some unknown person's whimsical thoughts about life and bitcoin. ""So here I am, left my job, I have some money to keep me up and I'm building my first raspberry pi lightning node, and broadcasting messages from satellites. Still feels surreal at times,"" the diary reads, as retrieved by Twitter user ""Grubles,"" a Blockstream satellite user who frequently tweets about the technology.  ""Still hard to grasp the fact, that I'm blanketing a big part of the Earth with my message, on demand, instantly. I wonder, does anybody [read this message]?"" the same person wrote the next day.  ""Love you,"" they wrote on day 4.  What might be more surprising than the content, though, is the number of messages.  ""Yo that's crazy AF,"" reads a message from another unknown user. Someone else sent a poem dedicated to the lightning network, and another sent an encrypted ""rare pepe,"" a limited edition card featuring the politically inflammatory frog meme.  Another user sent a note filled with gibberish with the handle of a popular Twitter user who left the social media site, ""Dandarkpill,"" tagged at the end.  ""Back when I can find the light,"" the cryptic message reads, implying Dandarkpill is planning to come back some day and chose to communicate this by satellite.  ""We can't be sure if it was him or if the message was broadcast from the 'memecave' but we remain hopeful that this is a signal to say he is fine and will return one day,"" pseudonymous Spacebit.live creator ""MediumSqueeze"" told CoinDesk, calling them one of ""our fallen soldiers.""  Space equipment for all  If Blockstream's website is any indication, users are sending a lot of messages using the system, and more messages could soon be on their way. Today, the technology is testnet, but MediumSqueeze hopes it'll move to bitcoin's live network soon, meaning it will be used with real bitcoin.  Either way, the way it works is pretty neat.  In December, Blockstream released an update to its software. One of the lesser-known features is that with its new application programming interface (API) people could use their satellites to send messages.  To send a message, users pay a fee in lightning, the new payment network now being built on top of bitcoin. The platform is still experimental, but people have been eager to use it anyway. The fee should correspond to how much data the message contains. An image, for example, might require more data, and thus might be more expensive than if you broadcast just a sentence.  ""Blockstream made available an API which takes a message and returns a lightning network invoice, upon receipt of the invoice the message is sent to the satellite teleport then the payload is broadcast to the satellite array,"" MediumSqueeze explains.  While spacebit.live and the Blockstream API make it pretty easy to send a message, a user needs a satellite receiver (for now) to retrieve them.  In theory, anyone could run a satellite. It costs about $100 to buy the necessary equipment.  Long-time Bitcoin Core contributor and former Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell, for example, posted photos of his satellite receiver setup to Bitcoin Talk, giving other users tips on putting it together.  But, why?  So, what's the point? Is it just a novelty or is there actually a reason to use bitcoin to send messages through space? It's perhaps a bit of both.  ""Right now, it's just for fun,"" MediumSqueeze told CoinDesk.  But some developers think the technology opens up new avenues. Bitcoin podcast host Ansel Lindner sees it as having potential for whistleblowers, people who expose the unethical actions of governments or corporations to the rest of the world. That's because they can use it to broadcast anonymous messages that can't be censored, which he doesn't think is possible any other way.  ""It could be used anonymously to broadcast a message to the world. It can't be stopped by a mainstream media outlet, Internet Service Provider (ISP) or government, "" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Posting it on a third party site like social media is censorable, even with an anonymous account. Your own website would be less so, but they can find you more easily. Encrypted message/email or whatever would be censorable by going after a few people. Broadcasting it globally would be very hard to stop.""  Still, others see it as a way to continue to further voice bitcoin's ethos.  ""This kind of network is not for posting WhatsApp messages, this is strictly 21st-century cypherpunk,"" MediumSqueeze said, referencing a group of technologists from the 1990s who advocated for the use of cryptography to bring about political change.  So far, this seems to be the most well-developed application as the unknown diarist from our introductory section would go on to prove with his fifth message.  ""Without bitcoin I wouldn't have too much faith for the future,"" it reads, adding:  ""I think I will tell this tale for my grandkids one day. Maybe in a post-civilization wasteland, but still.""
