42383529,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBSd,1585689192,"Bitcoin Ends Q1 Down 10%, Outperforming Equities in Coronavirus Crisis","Bitcoin ended the first quarter of 2020 down from the start of the year, but not as badly as the record-setting losses suffered by global equities.       On a 24-hour basis, bitcoin (BTC) was in the green less than a percent Tuesday afternoon Eastern time and ether (ETH) was up slightly as well. The performance of other cryptocurrencies was mixed.      Notable assets on CoinDesk’s big board include decred (DCR) up 3 percent, XRP (XRP) in the green 2 percent and cardano (ADA) gaining 1 percent. Assets in the red included dash (DASH) slipping 1 percent and bitcoin SV (BSV) in the red 1 percent. All price changes are in the past 24 hours as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET) on March 31.      In the traditional markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed down slightly, less than a percent. Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day up 1.3 percent. In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day down 1.6 percent.      But for the full quarter, the Nikkei 225 was down 20 percent, the worst three-month showing for the Tokyo-based index since 2008. The FTSE lost 14 percent for the period, its second-worst quarterly performance ever, beating only the fourth quarter of 1987. The S&P 500 was in the red 18 percent to close out Q1 2020, its worst quarter since 1938.      Cryptocurrencies operate 24/7 and don't have quarters for closing the books. However, bitcoin, the market bellwether, was down just 10 percent for 2020’s first three months.    Semi-correlated?    Despite its relative resilience, bitcoin still has been trending downward over the course of the first quarter along with traditional markets, undermining the narrative that it is a “non-correlated” asset.      “I think correlation across assets is still quite high, a telltale sign of when macro matters more than micro,” said Vishal Shah, founder of Alpha5, a new derivatives exchange backed by large crypto funds.      See also: Bitcoin’s Recent Recovery Won’t Salvage a Terrible Month for Prices      Indeed, the current period of turbulence isn’t the first time bitcoin has behaved similarly to mainstream financial investments.      “The lack of correlation to equities was a bit premature to announce. We had periods of high correlation, for example, in 2018, when bitcoin fell along with equities in December of that year,” said Siddhartha Jha, a former Wall Street analyst now working on blockchain-focused startup Arbol.      On the other hand, he said, “we have had other periods of higher correlation to gold,” more befitting bitcoin’s aspirations as a hedge against inflation.      Since 00:00 UTC Tuesday, bitcoin has been trading in a tight range of $6,300-$6,500.      “BitMEX open interest remains low, but Coinbase is reporting great inbound activity. None of the typical signs for a crypto bull-run are there,” Shah said, referring to major derivatives and spot exchanges, respectively.      March has produced the lowest level of outstanding positions on BitMEX in 18 months, although the derivatives exchange’s volume has seen gains the past four days prior to leveling off Monday.      Gold dropped over 2 percent Tuesday as of 20:30 UTC, breaking out of its consolidation pattern on heavy selling volume March 31.    The road ahead    While the coronavirus outbreak has dealt a heavy blow to the world economy, analysts are unsure how long it will take for growth to resume.      ""Recessions typically unfold over a longer period of time - at least two consecutive quarters,” said Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director of multi-asset platform eToro.      For the time being expect bitcoin’s role to keep switching for traders - it all depends on how other markets perform, experts say.      See also: Crypto Markets Can Never Close, and That’s a Good Thing      “The novel-tech part of bitcoin leads to correlation with Nasdaq, especially as many of the investors have overlaps,” said Arbol’s Jha. “Other times it will go with gold. But if equity markets are crashing, that correlation is going to show up very fast.”      How the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar holds up given massive doses of stimulus from Washington is something else analysts are watching keenly.      “The economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic has been instant and the impact is unprecedented,” added eToro’s Hirsch. “There is a growing consensus that due to the Fed announcing unlimited QE, investors could soon be looking to BTC as an inflation hedge against a depreciating dollar.“",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/31/bitcoin-ends-q1-down-10-outperforming-equities-in-coronavirus-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ead03b4b6d6f59f791ee6d107700d92655eea77-1460x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBRN,1585689028,"Bitcoin All-Time High in 2020? Chances Are Only 4%, Options Market Signals","While many analysts are predicting a bitcoin (BTC) bull run, the options market sees a very low probability of the cryptocurrency hitting a new record high by December.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $6,450 – down over 200 percent from the record high of $20,000 set in December 2017.      The options market shows just a 4 percent chance of bitcoin crossing above $20,000 before year’s end, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives analytics firm Skew.       In fact, the odds of prices moving into five digits by the end of December are also quite low, options market levels indicate.       The probability of bitcoin ending the year above $10,000 is 16 percent while the odds of prices challenging the June 2019 high of $13,880 by December are 8 to 10 percent, the data shows.       Options are derivative contracts that give buyers a right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specific price (known as the strike price) on or before the specified date. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy, while the purchaser of the put option has the right to sell.       The probabilities are calculated with the help of the Black-Scholes formula, which is based on key metrics including call options’ prices, strike prices, the price of the underlying asset, the ""risk-free"" interest rate on investments such as U.S. Treasurys and the options’ time of maturity.     Bullish expectations    Many analysts are confident the various monetary and fiscal measures recently announced by central banks and governments across the globe to counter the coronavirus-led downturn would bode well for bitcoin.       “The cryptocurrency can make a run toward all-time highs as the macro backdrop is quite bullish with trillions of dollars of liquidity scheduled to enter into the system,” said Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data.       The amount of fiscal stimulus announced by 22 countries over the last two weeks or so is equivalent to 75 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), according to JPMorgan. Meanwhile, central banks from New Zealand to Canada have slashed rates to zero. The U.S. Federal Reserve announced an open-ended asset purchase program last Monday.       “This money printing and lowering of rates might actually turn out to be a driver for more interest in bitcoin as a hedge against fiat,” said Luuk Strijers, CCO at the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit.       So far, however, the cryptocurrency has struggled to decouple from the equity markets. In fact, it ended last week on a flat note at $5,870 despite the U.S. Senate’s decision to approve the record $2 trillion fiscal stimulus, later approved by the House and signed into law by President Donald Trump.       “Cryptocurrency will continue to correlate to that of stock markets through the second quarter and the path to resurrection might only come by early third quarter,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO of the exchange CoinSwitch.co.       However, Singhal said the downside may be limited in the near term as the cryptocurrency is seen as a hedge to the massive inflation-boosting policies adopted by governments.       See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained       Bitcoin is often touted as such a hedge because its supply is fixed and the pace of supply expansion is reduced by 50 percent every four years via a process called a mining reward halving.     Odds of post-halving rally    Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving in May, following which the number of bitcoins (BTC) entering circulation every 10 minutes (known as block subsidies) will drop by half, to 6.25 from 12.5.       “Historically, reward halving has led to monumental economic growth for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO of the bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot.       Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, said he expects the halving event to create upward pressure on bitcoin’s price over the coming two months.       “Investors will take up positions in anticipation of rapid appreciation post-halving,” offering an additional boost to market valuation of BTC, said Dibb.       However, again, the prospects of a pre- and post-halving rally are quite low, according to the options market data.       chart2      While the probability of bitcoin holding above $6,000 until the end of April is above 50 percent, the odds of prices crossing into five figures is just 4 percent, options data suggests. It’s worth noting that bitcoin was trading near $10,500 just six weeks ago.      The probability that bitcoin will find acceptance above $10,000 by the end of June is 12 percent, the data indicates. At the end of September, the probability climbs to 16 percent.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/31/bitcoin-all-time-high-in-2020-chances-are-only-4-options-market-signals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8cff1abe1f3f7b53d5fdd4726c843d55da7034c-1200x792.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Monday, the Silicon Valley bitcoin startup Lightning Labs announced a new standards proposal that makes it easier for companies to automate small bitcoin (BTC) payments, like ongoing subscriptions.      “We are using this product for our Loop service, it’s already in production,” Lightning Labs engineer Oliver Gugger said of the standards proposal called LSAT. “It’s not all the way there. We’ve just proposed the protocol.”      LSAT, an open-source feature, is already being used to serve real customers by the startup Tieron, which offers time-stamping services. Gugger acknowledged this and said he hopes Lightning Labs will help establish an industry-standard across different services, from client-facing options like crypto paywalls to backend functions like recordkeeping.      Read more: Grasping Lightning: Mapping the Key Players in Bitcoin’s Next Phase      “We lead by example and hope all these different, fragmented protocols that are already out there can become compatible with each other,” Gugger said, emphasizing such standards could ease the way for companies outside the space looking to accept bitcoin payments. The question of what types of services Lightning Labs would enable is still unclear, due in part to the fact current demand is primarily research at crypto startups.    Seeking users    It remains to be seen how, or if, demand will manifest. It’s already possible to integrate crypto payment processing into an established publishing platform in a proprietary way.      Tieron engineer Buck Perley made a related open-source Lightning tool with LSAT, Boltwall. This could theoretically be used to create a bitcoin paywall for content. But no one has asked for this use case yet, Perley said. Instead, most of Tieron’s clients ask for the startup’s time-stamping product, Chainpoint, which utilizes the Lightning functionality.      “You couldn’t really say Chainpoint is a customer, but there was demand for this kind of tool. And Boltwall made it easier for us to implement an LSAT/Lightning-enabled paywall,” Perley said. “I also have a personal belief that the subscription model so many platforms are trying to fall back on is not sustainable in the long run. Having a couple dozen subscriptions across many different kinds of content distribution platforms just feels problematic to me.”      Read more: Lightning Labs Raises $10M Series A to Be the ‘Visa’ of Bitcoin      There are free software tools and paid services available for any site that wants to accept bitcoin for digital content, which the Lightning Network experiment Yalls has been for more than two years. Yet so far only a few outlets, such as Forbes, are experimenting with cryptocurrency payments.      CoinDesk itself experimented with crypto tips nearly four years ago. Currently, there are 47,025 publishers that can indirectly receive Brave’s Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), according to unofficial data site BATGrowth. The Brave option is by far the widely used to date. Still, for CoinDesk at least, it’s attracted a mere pittance.      As of January 2020, CoinDesk readers have contributed 19,213 in BAT tips, currently worth less than $3,000, according to CoinDesk Managing Director Jacob Donnelly. It should be noted that CoinDesk hasn't completed the steps with Uphold (Brave’s wallet provider) to verify corporate identity, he said, so these funds are not under CoinDesk's control.    Experimental paywalls    Although they remain niche, a handful of adjacent projects are experimenting with crypto-powered paywalls without LSAT.      Forbes, for example, accepts ether (ETH) for an ad-free reader experience, utilizing subscription services from the crypto startup Unlock. Independent reporter Camila Russo also uses Unlock to accept dai stablecoin payments for her newsletter about Ethereum. Russo said “hundreds” of subscribers, roughly 40 percent of her paid readership, use this option. Even among Ethereum fans, most prefer to pay with a credit or debit card.      “I’m still using Substack to publish my content,” Russo said. “[Unlock] doesn’t provide the actual infrastructure to publish the content, so the value proposition with Substack and Patreon is a little different for now.”      So far, experiments for crypto payments like the ConsenSys spoke Civil aren’t sustainable based on subscriptions alone. (Civil CEO Matthew Iles said the startup isn’t ready yet to publish results from their experiments.) Other crypto payment tools have struggled to garner buy-in from the media industry itself.      Read more: ConsenSys-Backed Civil Tries Again on Newsroom Token Launch      For example, the anonymous European engineer behind MicroPay said he took the Lightning tool offline for compliance reasons after just one day. It would download content from behind a paywall and send a PDF in exchange for a few cents worth of bitcoin to the engineer’s personal node. Now he’s exploring ways to get outlets to use it to address the audience demand to “read two to three articles max a month” without registering for a full subscription and submitting personal information.      “MicroPay can be used for other things as well, not just paywalls,” he said. “Any service which asks for micropayments can go through.”    Early days    The reason such tools haven’t found product-market fit yet is all about getting the outlets onboard.      As Unlock CEO Julien Genestoux said, outlets want readers’ emails and personal details because they want to send newsletters, sell tickets to events and find other ways to engage with audiences.      “I just want to say the [crypto] wallet in my browser is my identity,” Genestoux said. “Think of a paywall as a membership. … When I transfer [the Unlock non-fungible token] to someone, now they’re a member. I’m not anymore.”      That type of fluid membership is difficult for traditional outlets to monetize. Plus, offering outlets a tool to accept currencies that few people actually want to spend hasn’t inspired much enthusiasm from publishers. Some publishers are also concerned about any extra compliance hurdles accepting crypto might cause, Genestoux said.      On the other hand, niche publishers such as Hard Times CEO Matt Saincome are curious about currency-agnostic options. His online satire outlet uses Coil, an in-browser app made by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas. Users can load up their Coil accounts with a few dollars worth of credit, using cryptocurrency or credit cards, then read Hard Times content without ads and eventually gain access to exclusive content.      Read more: Ripple to Give Away 1 Billion XRP in Massive Bid to Fund Online Content      “I’m actually changing the direction of my business to be more geared towards it,” Saincome said. “It’s great because I don’t have to disrupt my ad revenue in order to try this. … Even if they [users] are paying in XRP, I can get U.S. dollars.”      Saincome said Coil isn’t a significant revenue stream yet, but he expects that to change as cryptocurrency gains more mainstream adoption.      “I wish I was a YouTuber right when YouTube was starting. That’s how I feel about Coil,” he said.      On the other hand, some crypto fans are striking out on their own rather than looking to serve publishers.      For example, BSV-focused developer Brad Jasper has roughly 100 user accounts on his closed beta blogging platform that went live in January, Bit.sv. He said at least 1,000 more crypto fans are on the waiting list. Although Bit.sv only pays creators in BSV, the platform can accept bitcoin, litecoin (LTC) or ether as well.      “Imagine if you could move banks with just a few clicks. That’s what it will look like to move between these providers,” Jasper said, explaining how content creators could become more independent with blockchain platforms instead of sites like Tumblr or Medium. “I think the venture capital [media model] is dead.”",NEUTRAL,BAT | BTC | ETH,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/31/bitcoins-lightning-becomes-latest-protocol-to-court-publishers-with-micropayments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8d9b6776bb03ddae3e3a153570b52d0347ced62-1500x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBNb,1585679104,Remote Working Proves Unexpected Hero as Half of US Economy Shifts to Home Offices,"As economists scramble to assess the devastating impact of the coronavirus, they’re homing in on an unexpected hero that’s mitigating the damage in the U.S.: remote working.      With offices across the country closed and people stuck in their homes, many professional workers have accomplished a not-seamless but ultimately successful transition to online workplaces — allowing those in crucial industry sectors including professional and business services to continue doing their jobs.      The output is helping to protect U.S. government tax revenue from a total collapse, at a time when expenses are expanding; lawmakers in Washington just approved a $2 trillion plan to provide financial assistance to households and businesses.      The rapid shift means a significant portion of the economy — roughly half, at least, based on a CoinDesk analysis — might be able to continue unabated even if many households remain under voluntary or mandatory lockdowns for at least six more weeks, as Microsoft-founder-turned-philanthropist Bill Gates has suggested might be needed.      Using these technologies is likely to get smoother with practice, of course. In the meantime, many office-workers-turned-home-workers will eventually gain confidence they’re still doing their jobs so they can continue to receive their paychecks.      “It is amazing how we, as a country, seem to have really stepped up and have been able to do our jobs, for the most part, under these extreme conditions,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at Standard & Poor’s. “There’s a pretty significant chunk of people who, before the coronavirus, worked at their desks in an office. Now it's just transplanted to working at home.”      To those who believe in a digital future in which decentralization makes systems more resilient, the crisis has expedited the inevitable.      “People are talking about how this is going to be the fourth industrial revolution with different technologies changing fundamentally how we work,” said Jennifer Christie, the head of people at social media giant Twitter and maestro behind its near-overnight shift to a distributed workforce in early March.      Christie pointed to the pandemic’s global reach. “I can’t imagine it doesn’t have an impact on organizational structures and norms,” she said.      See also: Crypto Firms Tout Dispersed Workforce as Coronavirus Contingency Plan    By the numbers    The U.S. economy is facing such hardships that weekly jobless claims shot up to a record 3.3 million last week and the Federal Reserve pledged to inject an estimated $4 trillion into the global financial system to keep markets from unraveling — roughly equivalent to the total amount of money created on the central bank’s balance sheet since its founding in 1913. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimated last week that layoffs in the second quarter of 2020 could reach 47 million.      The pain is expected to hit workers on the low end of the wage spectrum the hardest, from restaurant employees, taxi drivers and musicians to barbers, flight attendants and oilpatch roughnecks whose livelihoods have been upended by a sudden drop-off in demand. Macy’s, the largest U.S. department-store chain, said Monday it would furlough 125,000 employees after a plunge in sales.      But based on an analysis by CoinDesk, some 48 percent of the $17.8 trillion of U.S. national income in 2019 came from industries where many jobs could conceivably be done remotely. (National income, or the value of all goods and services produced by U.S. businesses and individuals, is similar to gross domestic product, or GDP.) Those include finance, insurance, real estate, rental, leasing, information and professional and business services, using the categories provided by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. They also include government services.      Not included are industries where a physical presence is typically required, such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, landscaping, mining, utilities, construction, manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation and warehousing. There’s also arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services. But even many functions within those industries, such as administrative support and online music production, could be done by employees working online.      Also not included are educational services, health care and social assistance, collectively representing some $1.84 trillion of economic output last year, or 10 percent of national income. Many of those essential workers are still doing their jobs.      University of Chicago economists wrote in a separate study published March 27 that some 34 percent of jobs, representing 44 percent of all wages, could plausibly be performed at home.      ""The share of jobs that could be performed at home is an important input to predicting the economy’s performance during this or subsequent periods of social distancing,"" the researchers wrote.    The new normal    News reports over the past week have been filled with the harrowing accounts of dedicated hospital workers in New York and elsewhere rushing to save lives despite a lack of ventilators, masks and other crucial gear.      Less salient are the heroic efforts of public and private school systems to establish online instruction with little more than two weeks’ notice — led by homebound teachers and administrators.      Initially set up as a temporary backstop to keep kids on task, remote learning could prove pivotal to finishing the academic year if homebound measures remain in place through late May or June. Teachers aren’t in their classrooms, but they’re still doing their jobs, collecting well-deserved paychecks.      Without remote working, “it could have been a lot worse,” says Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at the forecasting firm TS Lombard. The availability of the Internet, certainly not something that existed at the time of the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, “does create the avenue more readily for people to work from home and engage with their coworkers.”      Crucial to this transition, of course, is that Internet networks are proving robust enough to handle the shift in traffic from office buildings to home networks. And previously niche technological applications like Zoom scaled up in a matter of weeks into household words or even verbs, as: “Lemme Slack you that link.”    A boom for Zoom    The companies behind America’s remote-work explosion are seeing surges in the number of those using their products.      For Zoom, the videoconferencing software developer-turned touchstone of stay-at-home communications, it's been more like a tsunami.      A spokesperson for San Jose-based Zoom said executives didn’t have time for an interview because they were so focused on technical-support issues. (The New York Times reported on Monday the New York Attorney General’s office wrote a letter to Zoom executives asking what security measures they have put in place to handle the sudden increase in traffic, and to detect hackers. According to the paper, the letter referred to Zoom as an “essential and valuable communications platform.”)      Slack, a group instant-messaging service that many companies use as a virtual office, notched a record 12.5 million simultaneously connected users on March 24, representing a 25 percent increase in just two weeks, CEO Stuart Butterfield wrote in a blog post.    We’re all ‘decentralized’ now    Twitter’s 4,900 employees comprise a tiny but telling sliver of Slack’s massive user jump.      They had already been using the platform before COVID-19 shut the office lights. But when CEO Jack Dorsey declared on March 2 the company would go remote, Slack became the primary workspace, a virtual office – even a creative outlet.      Christie, the HR chief, said it helped Twitter preserve the “water cooler” camaraderie found in offices of old.      Workplace decentralization isn’t new to the digital-asset industry, with its blockchain computer networks and interconnected, round-the-clock, private marketplaces for trading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), in some cases powered by automated computer code. Many crypto-industry startups were already based out of coworking spaces like WeWork; those employees just brought their laptops home.      But even the startups might not have predicted everyone else could shift over so quickly.      ""You're seeing a lot of people discover a useful tooling that's been around for a very long time,"" said Corey Petty, chief security officer for the decentralized messaging platform Status, whose 61 employees already worked remotely. ""Those that aren't willing to change drastically are going to fail.""      Jake Yocom-Piatt, project lead at Decred, a cryptocurrency project, says he’s been working remotely since 2013. He’s based in Chicago while the company’s 60 or so employees and contractors are spread out in far-flung locales from Michigan to Texas and Australia to Europe. There’s no home office.      Given that the internet evolved partly from the U.S. military’s drive for a communications network that could survive a nuclear war, it’s not surprising the Web is still standing, he said.      “But when you’re talking about the quality of software, it can vary massively,” Yocom-Piatt said. “It appears that Zoom and Slack and a handful of these other players are better-built projects than you might have otherwise expected. If you would have asked me beforehand, how would it do if it experienced a 10-fold increase, I would have answered that it would have had problems.”      At Status, the remote workers chat via Slack, Discord, Status, Zoom and Google Meet, working across time zones and borders with the same tools newly dispersed companies now depend on, Petty said.      Businesses that survive this crisis ""will come out with a new fresh vision of what it means to have an organization and run it,"" he predicted. Further innovations in remote-working tech will help people realize ""that you do not have to operate traditionally to be successful in a business.      ""I'm really looking forward to that because a part of our goal is to help people realize that you can have meaningful real relationships with people and communities in a distributed way,"" Petty said. ""People have just been opposed to getting over that barrier of initially trying and this is forcing everyone to do it.""    No going back    Old-line businesses like the New York Stock Exchange continue to open and close on time even after its historic trading floors closed last week. TV anchors and newspaper reporters and editors put out updates 24-7 — from their homes.      Remote working also might help to soften the blow on consumer confidence, a crucial psychological metric that economists survey regularly to gauge the climate for retail spending.      For workers, logging on from home every morning might provide the jolt of normality needed to keep them optimistic, said Bovino. She talked to CoinDesk by phone from her apartment in New York, where her husband is also working from home and her 4-year-old son is doing preschool online. That’s in between the tortured moments of anxiety and empathy when she peers out the window and sees ambulances plying the empty streets below, sometimes stopping at nearby buildings.      “There could be a change in sentiment, and a positive change in sentiment among these workers who are pioneers in this new digital work-from-home landscape,” Bovino said. “There's going to be a feeling of pride that they were able to overcome these hurdles and were able to get that memo out to their internal team or publish that report on some sector, or something of interest for their firm.”      Blitz says he expects the coronavirus to accelerate major changes in the economy, and in the way people work. Once the virus’ peak passes, will people want to immediately go back to crowded office buildings and tedious, exhaust-choked commutes? Or spend so much money on gasoline or public transportation?      Now that more bosses have experienced online working, they might be more willing to entertain work-from-home arrangements for productive employees — or even push to eliminate the office as a way of cutting costs. Candidates for new roles might be eligible no matter where they live; some U.S. employers might hire more remote workers abroad.      Many people will eventually want to go back to offices, Blitz predicts, if only to avoid the myriad distractions of working at home including the noise from the neighbors’ lawnmowers and leaf blowers. But on a macro basis, society and the economy are likely to change drastically. The coronavirus could accelerate decades-in-the-making technological trends that were already in the works.      “So much of the economy is still done the old way,” Blitz said. “But the chances of us going back 100 percent to the way we were before is probably not likely.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,"Bradley Keoun, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/31/remote-working-proves-unexpected-hero-as-half-of-us-economy-shifts-to-home-offices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87a124e9820423aedbc156188edb117d70eaeac8-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBDX,1585677603,IoT App Nodle Moves From Stellar Blockchain to Polkadot,"Another blockchain project is heading to the Polkadot Network.      Launched in 2017, Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform Nodle announced it is switching from the Stellar blockchain to Parity Technologies’ Substrate network, according to a blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk. Substrate lets teams customize their own blockchains; Nodle’s is called Arcadia.      Nodle provides “last mile” support for IoT devices through connections to smartphones. The network claims to have had recently been averaging roughly 1 million daily microtransactions over the Stellar blockchain.      The protocol joins security token platform Polymath as the second network in recent months to ditch an incumbent blockchain for Polkadot. Polymath left the Ethereum blockchain due to governance concerns, the firm said last November.      In the same vein, Nodle said Stellar does not have the blockchain functions needed to deliver on promises from the startup’s white paper.      “We really like Stellar, but it definitely became clear when we crossed over a million microtransactions that we needed to build our own blockchain,” Nodle spokesperson Daren McKelvey told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      Nodle blockchain architect Eliott Teissonniere said Nodle found Substrate to be more “modular” for future development, a nod to Polkadot’s intent to create a governance-friendly (and interoperable) blockchain network.      “It’s also a self-amending ledger, which means that the network can upgrade itself, add new features, or deploy bug-fixes in a matter of minutes, all without having to fork it,” the Nodle blog states.      Notably, Nodle hinted at a future bridge between Stellar and Arcadia, and therefore Substrate, via a “future upgrade.” The interoperability project between the two blockchains would be the first of many, the team indicated.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | WALLET,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/31/iot-app-nodle-moves-from-stellar-blockchain-to-polkadot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd6641e72c2259f2f211cba252858e5cffdb7377-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383520,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBEn,1585674612,Ex-State Street Blockchain Team Drops DLT From New Data-Privacy Startup,"A group of former State Street blockchain builders are now launching their own company – but with distributed ledgers playing only a minor role.      Data privacy-focused Manetu, helmed by former State Street global chief technology architect Moiz Kohari, goes live early next month and just closed a $3.5 million seed funding round led by Nic Carter’s blockchain-focused Castle Island Ventures.      “We could have retrofitted Hyperledger or any other blockchain project to do the management of consumers' personally identifiable information, but it would have just added so much unnecessary burden on the platform that we felt that wasn't necessary,” Kohari, the firm’s CEO, said.      See also: Nic Carter: ‘If You’re Not Radicalized, You’re Not Paying Attention’      The Manetu team is not short on blockchain know-how, with its mix of ex-State Street DLT builders and Hyperledger maintainers: the CTO is Greg Haskins, former State Street senior vice president; Conor Allen, Manetu’s head of product, was previously State Street’s SVP of enterprise data; and chief scientist Binh Nguyen was managing director at the Boston-based custodian.      But when it comes to defining the best way to manage personally identifiable information (PII), Manetu is light on blockchain, opting for an agile blend of machine-learning algorithms and an encrypted “self-service portal” that’s connected to “target systems” like Oracle and Salesforce, where sensitive data is being maintained.    Privacy puzzles    The team is looking to tackle business challenges spurred by a slew of tough data privacy rules, such as Europe’s General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Manetu is designed to ease the headache these strictures can cause for any firms that hold personal data about customers (Manetu said it is currently testing with a large U.S. bank).      “Privacy acts are being introduced across the planet: Canada, Australia, Japan,” said Kohari. “Any consumer can request what data a service provider holds on them and also request to edit that data, and revoke certain parts or all of that data.”      See also: Remote Working Proves Unexpected Hero as Half of US Economy Shifts to Home Offices      The existing big players in data privacy compliance mostly came out of the consulting space and have designed rather cumbersome solutions, Kohari said. Typically, this involves consumers filling out a request form that goes to a global privacy officer which is routed to individual business units and then back again.      “It’s a highly manual process and very onerous for the organization. On average, about 20 hours is spent on each request,” he said. “That might be manageable for 100 or so requests a month, but it simply does not scale going forward.”      The only part of Manetu’s system where an actual blockchain is useful is its “regulatory data vault,” which maintains certain data and allows it to be shared with regulators.      “The regulatory vault part of the solution is leveraging blockchain, but we didn’t need it for the core of the business,” said Kohari.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/31/ex-state-street-blockchain-team-drops-dlt-from-new-data-privacy-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1aea7de397e7dbf991f6603dc39e8441d990ebe-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBQ7,1585674199,Letter from the Philippines: Life During Coronavirus,"Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.      About a week ago, my boyfriend and I stood in the kitchen and had a discussion about where we would hide a wad of cash if we were to drain our local bank account. The bookshelf was too obvious. Under the mattress was too cliché. I suggested a Ziplock bag in the freezer and he made a joke about freezing our assets. I followed with one about cold storage.      While working in crypto often implies a predisposition for this kind of anti-establishment rhetoric, this is not the kind of conversation I ever thought I’d have in my lifetime. But in the Philippines, where we live, cash is still very much king. Not more than 4 percent of all financial transactions take place online, with that figure as low as 1 percent in provincial areas. Some digital payments services – such as GCash, PayMaya and crypto-enabled Coins.ph – have demonstrated great traction with the banked and unbanked alike, but they are still a long way from mass adoption.      See also: Noelle Acheson - How I’m Coping With Spain’s Coronavirus Lockdown      So, during a crisis, there is little substitute for cold hard cash. And it seems I’m not the only one a tad concerned. After President Rodrigo Duterte announced a one-month enhanced community quarantine, the CEO of Coins.ph took proactive measures to advance all employee salaries for March, citing some doubt the retail banking system could continue without disruption.      It’s two weeks since that happened and everything here is shut down. All land, sea and air travel is restricted. All public transport is suspended, including Grab (our version of Uber or Lyft). All classes are suspended. The shopping malls are closed, only supermarkets and pharmacies remain open. Restaurants can do takeout but no dine-in. Only one person per household is allowed out at a time and you have to carry a slip from your local elected official to prove where you live. Police patrol the streets and armed military personnel guard the vehicle checkpoints.      This isn’t the end of the world for we execs who are busy pimping our home office spaces and enjoying new WFH novelties, like wearing pajama pants to online meetings, taking daily arvo naps and gorging on quarantine treats piled high in our cupboards. It’s the less-privileged workers who are left wondering how they’re going to feed their families.      In a country where nearly one in five still live below the poverty line, the ability to pay up, cash out and stock up is a luxury reserved for a few. Small businesses account for nearly 98 percent of local firms in the Philippines and 35 percent of the workforce is in informal employment, so there are millions upon millions of people who earn their income in the sari-sari stores, barber shops and beauty salons. It’s the restaurant wait staff. The trike and jeepney drivers. The street food vendors who deliver your afternoon fishball fix or your late-night balut snack.      The majority of these people live day to day with little to no savings to cushion the blow of a sharp and unexpected economic downturn. As such, there are concerns we will see a spike in crime, as desperate people resort to desperate measures. Word on the street is that our local supermarket was held up last Friday morning – and since they’ve been slammed by panic-buyers, I’m not surprised that an opportunist would make a run for those bulging cash registers – but I couldn’t find a media report to confirm it.    Who we trust – and how readily we decide to accept their advice – is.. deeply subjective.    There are other reports of looting circulating on social media, but the Philippine National Police say they are all fake news, and, in fact, crime rates have gone down since everyone is staying at home. Perhaps it really is fake news. Or maybe the police are suppressing information in an attempt to curb the growing levels of public anxiety. Or maybe they don’t want to give people ideas. Or maybe it’s a little bit of column A, B and C.      As we settle deeper into quarantine life, and the voices of nervous community folk get louder and louder, it’s getting harder to separate the legitimate information from the fear-mongering nonsense… Eat more bananas if you don’t want to catch the coronavirus. Stock up on alcohol because a liquor ban is coming. Look up to the sky at midnight because that’s when the planes are going to fly over and spray us all with pesticides.      Just last week, the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs tweeted that “all previously issued Philippine visas to foreign nationals are deemed cancelled.” This sent me (and apparently plenty of others) into a tailspin, thinking I was about to be kicked out of the country I’ve called home for nearly two years! But when I double-checked the details with my embassy and the Bureau of Immigration, they said there would be no impact on foreigners already in the country. It was only applicable to new entrants. I was fine to stay.      With tensions at an all-time high, and so much information flying at us from every angle, every second of the day, it’s as easy to misinterpret information as it is to miscommunicate it. I used to think I was pretty good at separating fact from fiction. But over the last couple weeks, I’ve become less sure. Who we trust – and how readily we decide to accept their advice – is a deeply subjective phenomenon that shapes the way we respond to the world around us. And during times of calamity, when everything is turned on its head, we may find ourselves rethinking our earlier methods of deduction.      See also: Callon-Butler - Coronavirus Is a Catalyst for Work-From-Home Tech      Case in point: I’d previously scoffed at the idea of flying pesticides. But then, a friend of mine (who lives nearby me) posted these photos on Facebook of an unidentified person who came around her neighborhood – unannounced – and sprayed all the houses with something that smelled like bleach.      Then, this week, the local mayor stepped it up a notch again, sending a misting truck to drive around the city on a disinfectant blitz, spraying all public roads and thoroughfares as a preventative measure to stop the spread of COVID-19.      Much to my dismay, there was also plenty of truth behind the rumor about a ban on booze. Last week, when I went downstairs to buy some milk at the convenience store (thankfully, the one at the bottom of our building is still open), I found the sales staff removing all the liquor bottles from the shelves and packing them into boxes. I asked if I could buy some and a staffer said, “Sorry ma’am, we can’t sell alcohol anymore.”      Sure enough, my town is now dry. I can’t even get any grog tacked onto a home delivery food order. Which wouldn’t be much good to me anyway, if all the ATMs turned up empty. I’d struggle to buy anything at all because the vast majority of food vendors and delivery drivers outside Metro Manila are cash only. Crypto would be awesome in this situation (especially since twice as many Filipinos have smartphones than they do bank accounts). But I haven’t yet met any provincial locals willing to accept it. In the meantime, I’m wondering what will be the tipping point when suddenly I’m making a beeline for the ATM, and, as the fake news says, stocking up on bananas.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/31/letter-from-the-philippines-life-during-coronavirus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cca09a84532958398dbecc3985619c5fd694fa20-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBHJ,1585665424,Ex-Royal Mint Team Now Provides $1M Cover for All Civic Crypto Wallets,"UPDATE (April 1, 09:20 UTC): The article has been updated to reflect corrected information sent to CoinDesk from Coincover after publication. Specifically, the changes include that the product is a deposit guarantee, not loss insurance.      A new cryptocurrency wallet deposit guarantee product from Coincover offers better protection than many existing custodial solutions, the firm says.      The Cardiff, U.K.-based risk management provider, underwritten by Lloyd's of London, announced Tuesday that its new deposit guarantee product would provide Civic wallet users with up to $1 million in cover. It is assigned automatically when a user registers for a Civic wallet and requires no further steps to qualify.      The firm said this is the first hot-wallet deposit guarantee offering to date that offers $1 million in protection.      Coincover told CoinDesk the policy provides the same sort of guarantee found with credit cards and bank accounts. It also offers a different type than many existing custodial solutions, such as BitGo or Gemini, according to Sharon Henley, Coincover's head of marketing.      The deposit guarantee is different from the theft cover Coincover first announced in early March. One of the key differences with their deposit guarantee, according to Henley, is that each user is covered individually at up to a million dollars.      That means Coincover's guarantee can actually, sometimes, cover for more than some of the large insurance policies taken out by custodial solutions. Henley told CoinDesk the product ""can be standalone or supplemental to the insurance that BitGo [a custodial solution] provides their customers at the cold storage level.""      ""Having funds insured offline as well as the option to purchase insurance for online holdings when trading and transacting is what we feel is the most comprehensive and safest way for businesses and customers to have holistic protection of their funds,"" she said.      See also: Watch Civic’s CEO Talk About His New Cross-Border Payment System      ""This is the first [example] where essentially an entire platform is guaranteeing the funds of their customers,"" Henley said. More than 150,000 customers have already signed up for the Civic wallet, which is currently in private beta.      “We believe that everyone needs access to a neutral, trustworthy place to store their digital currency, especially in this extraordinary new financial climate,"" said Vinny Lingham, Civic's CEO and co-founder. ""People are looking to move their digital currency so that they have more control and reliable, easy restoration if they ever lose access to their funds.”      See also: Winklevoss-Led Gemini Exchange Now Has Its Own Insurance Company      The Coincover team spent three years when they were working for the British Royal Mint's gold-on-the-blockchain initiative – which was put on ice in late 2018. After they left to form Coincover in mid-2018, it took an additional 18 months of ""convincing the insurers what essentially the true risk profiles were,"" Henley added.

42383500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w8wd,1585659600,"Crypto Holders Still Face Issues Reporting Tax Liabilities, Survey of CPAs Finds","Crypto-literate public accountants are concerned their clients might face Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits in the U.S. and penalties for underpaying taxes on their crypto holdings, a new survey finds.      Cryptocurrency accounting service provider Blox and tax software developer Sovos conducted a survey of roughly 45 Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) familiar with crypto, finding the majority believe their clients might face penalties for misreporting their tax liabilities from their holdings of assets like bitcoin (BTC). Indeed, many of these respondents believe their clients and other crypto holders likely owe back taxes.      ""Crypto clients are still alarmingly unaware of how to handle crypto reporting and tax liabilities,"" the report generated by the companies said.      According to the survey, the respondents overwhelmingly believe the U.S. will have the most stringent crackdown on crypto taxes over the next year, followed by China. Zero percent of respondents expect Russia to have the toughest crackdown on crypto taxes.    Known unknowns    Part of the issue for taxpayers might be that these individuals still aren't sure how to file their taxes. Calculating cost-basis has long been an issue for individuals in the space, and Blox CEO and co-founder Alon Muroch told CoinDesk that many payers might not know if they even have the data they need to properly report their holdings.      ""A lot of the software providers out there [didn't] realize the gap in data, and they simply offered the cost basis calculation without actually verifying the data itself. So, obviously, don't you put the incomplete data or the wrong data into a [first-in first-out or last-in first-out] calculation, you'll get different results every time,"" Muroch said.      Some of this stems from a record-keeping issue, said Sharon Yip, founder and president of Crypto Tax Advisors. Yip is one of the CPAs who responded to the survey.      ""Taxpayers don't really keep very good records, so when you start transferring costs all over the place, it's almost impossible to keep track of everything correctly. It's going to be very difficult to ask exchanges to issue some kind of tax report and and and make it accurate because they just don't have enough data,"" Yip said.      If an individual is conducting transactions exclusively on a single exchange, that might make it easier. Otherwise, exchanges will be unable to provide cost-basis information for other platforms, Yip said.      According to Wendy Walker, a tax withholding and information reporting expert at Sovos, this lack of access to complete data is actually the largest issue facing crypto investors right now from a tax perspective.      ""There's a lot of spreadsheets, there's a lot of manual transactions going on and that, of course, is not making anyone feel confident about the returns they're filing,"" she said.      This was an issue raised during a summit held by the IRS earlier this month.    Other issues    Adding to the confusion is the fact that taxpayers might file one of several forms, Walker said. She noted the IRS sent warning letters to crypto investors last year, advising them to use a specific form, form 8949, which they would only be able to use if the exchanges on which they conducted transactions sent a 1099-B form.      ""The problem is that if they didn't use a 1099-B, then what's happening is when they returned, they were receiving a penalty notice from the IRS because the claims that they put on the 8949 couldn't be substantiated,"" Walker said.      It may help to consult with a professional prior to conducting a single trade, Muroch said.      The survey was sent to 137 CPAs that the companies believe are familiar with crypto. For comparison, the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy found there were more than 650,000 registered CPAs overall in the U.S., though this number excluded three states for which it did not have data.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/31/crypto-holders-still-face-issues-reporting-tax-liabilities-survey-of-cpas-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f028a889cacc3d9b4a8d14ae3da1f34769572061-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383509,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w96h,1585654256,Bitcoin's Recent Recovery Won't Salvage a Terrible Month for Prices,"While bitcoin (BTC) has climbed sharply from recent lows below $4,000, it's still on track to end March with a double-digit price loss.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $6,440, representing nearly a 68 percent rise from the low of $3,867 registered on March 13. Even so, prices are still down 24 percent on a month-to-date basis.      If that loss is held through Tuesday's close (00:00 UTC), it would be the biggest monthly percentage decline since November 2018. Back then, the cryptocurrency had tanked by 37 percent, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      It's also the second straight month in the red for bitcoin after an 8.5 percent decline in February.      The cryptocurrency has registered double-digit losses in just two months out of the last 13. Meanwhile, the bulls have managed to produce gains of over 10 percent in five months over the same period.    Why the drop?    Bitcoin, often touted as a safe haven asset, dropped sharply in March despite the coronavirus-led risk aversion in the traditional markets. That's likely because investors used the cryptocurrency as a source of liquidity.      When panic sets in the financial markets, investors tend to liquidate assets and hold cash, preferably the U.S. dollar, which is the global reserve currency.      Hence, it's not surprising the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, has gained nearly 7 percent this month, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. Gold, too, is reporting a month-to-date gain of over 6 percent.    Looking forward    There is general consensus in the market that bitcoin will regain poise in the second quarter, courtesy of U.S. monetary policies.      While the Fed has recently announced an unlimited easing program that will boost supply, bitcoin is set to undergo its miner's reward halving in May. The process will reduce the daily issuance, or supply, of coins by 50 percent.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      ""Bitcoin is going to experience its third block halving in Q2. We're weeks away from an event that has, historically, led to monumental economic growth for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" Brandon Mintz, CEO of the bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot, told CoinDesk.      Meanwhile, Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, believes buying dips and accumulating is the way to trade in the second quarter, because bitcoin has historically performed well in the months following the halving.      Some analysts expect the massive monetary and fiscal lifelines launched by the central banks and governments across the globe to strengthen bitcoin's appeal as an inflation hedge and a haven asset.      ""The insanity that's guiding today's public markets is making bitcoin seem quite civilized in comparison, and while short term confidence in Bitcoin was shaken, its long-term fundamentals as an asset class have been strengthened by the speed and quantum of its recovery,"" said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital.      ""I'm looking forward to continued volatility and the possibility of another move down below $6,000 but ultimately recovery and return to $8,000-$9,000 levels in the second quarter,"" Chu added.      Confidence seems to have returned to the bitcoin market, as indicated by the notable drop in exchange deposits over the last 2.5 weeks. The slowdown in inflows to exchanges suggests there are now fewer sellers looking to offload their holdings into the rising market.      The derivatives market, however, is biased bearish. For instance, the futures market is in ""backwardation"" – a condition where the futures price of a commodity is lower than the spot price today.      ""Backwardation in the futures market indicates that traders are expecting a price to decline slightly over the coming months,"" Luuk Strijers, COO of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, told CoinDesk.      See also: Crypto Markets Can Never Close, and That’s a Good Thing      Strijers added that miners are also generating selling pressure right now, with bytetree.com data showing they are selling more bitcoin than they produce, and are not awaiting the upcoming halving.      However, ByteTree's founder and chairman, Charles Morris, believes that's a bullish sign. After all, miners wouldn't hit their own profitability by selling into a market that lacks the strength to absorb the extra supply and fuel a price crash.    What the charts say    From a technical analysis standpoint, the monthly close is pivotal.      Bitcoin turned lower from $10,500 in February, establishing a second bearish lower high (marked by arrows) on the monthly chart.      The pattern would gain credence if prices settle under the December low of $6,425 on Tuesday's close. That would boost the probability of a re-test of the 50-month average support at $5,200.      On the higher side, a convincing move above $7,000 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal on the weekly chart, as discussed Monday.

42383507,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w95R,1585648800,"'MLB Champions' Downplays ETH, Aims for Mass Market in New Game Reboot","The game once known as MLB Crypto is getting a facelift by reducing its dependency on its underlying blockchain, Ethereum.      Announced Tuesday, MLB Champions introduced a slew of new features while cutting the game’s in-app minting process for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The update introduces a range of gameplay options but also adds more steps for creating unique digital items that can be traded outside of the game itself. Namely, the new version of the game moves the “minting” system off the mobile app to the MLB Champions website, according to the startup.      Randy Saaf, CEO of Lucid Sight, the company behind the game, said the team will be launching an in-app marketplace with its own token in the near future. It will not accept ether (ETH) because of censorship concerns on app marketplaces.      Saaf said MLB Champions is one of the few blockchain-based games on Google Play due to a near shadowban of decentralized applications (dapps).      “Crypto gaming is struggling right now,” Saaf said in a phone interview. “This is pretty new technology.”      Instead, the app will move almost entirely to a custom-built “digital scarcity engine” to create artificial ownership limits in the game.      The team built a MongoDB database that fit Lucid Sight’s focus as a gaming business, Saaf said. Lucid Sight also has limited-ownership items for purchase in other games such as its space title, Crypto Space Commander.      “The whole point of Scarcity Engine is to cover up the complexity of blockchain. If it looks like it isn’t blockchain, they have done a good job,” Lucid Sight investor Jonathan Sweig told CoinDesk in a private message.    Digitally scarce sports    That’s not to say digital scarcity as a concept hasn’t held up well for the startup.      Rather, incorporating Ethereum as the game’s base layer proved too complex for onboarding new users, Saaf said. Fellow NFT startup Dapper Labs recently expressed similar sentiments with Ethereum and opted to move to a custom blockchain instead.      For example, the old version of MLB Champions required users to download the app, go through an exchange to purchase ether (ETH) and move ETH into the game via MetaMask. The average user just wants to open his phone and play ball, Saaf said.      Lucid Sight is not waiting around for scaling solutions to Ethereum’s slow transaction speeds either, he said. Moreover, other crypto platforms offer faster transactions but still face questions regarding censorship from tech giants like Google or Apple.    Adoption    “We all want massive adoption here. I think the way we do that is to add crypto in the game, but not for the sake of crypto,” Saaf said.      The team decided a middle path – mixing traditional databases and blockchain together – was the best approach given the current gaming market.      “Your average consumer needs a free-to-play version and it needs to be mobile-first,” Saaf said.      See also: Tezos Co-Founder Turns to Gaming With ‘Hearthstone’ Competitor      At the same time, players still have access to the Ethereum market itself, which has seen MLB Champions items that increase the odds of winning fetching tidy sums on third-party markets such as OpenSea.      “[MLB Champions] is a rare blockchain game that is accessible for the mass audience on mobile devices while still providing benefits of digital ownership on Ethereum,"" Lucid Sight co-founder Octavio Herrera said in an email. “Users will be able to play MLB Champions on their mobile phones and users who wish to can mint their MLBC Figures as NFTs on Ethereum and transact with others in our Marketplace or using other marketplaces that support NFTs.”      Right now you can bid on players such as the Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts or 2017 MLB MVP Jose Altuve for 0.25 ETH, or about $35.      Lucid Sight announced a $6 million Series B in April 2019 from the likes of Salem Partners, Galaxy EOS VC Fund, Digital Currency Group, Breakaway Growth, Frontier Venture Capital and Animoca Brands.

42383508,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w94B,1585641600,"Crypto Markets Can Never Close, and That's a Good Thing","Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s director of research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and are not investment advice.      The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.      Shuttered shops. Empty streets. Scant traffic. The world’s financial centers are increasingly looking like ghost cities. The world’s financial markets, on the other hand, are a frenzy of activity as dealers and traders try to ride the wild swings each headline and sentiment shift brings.      Yet, even though almost all trading is electronic these days, conducted behind sanitary screens, there is talk of shutting down markets for health reasons. The health in question is not just that of the traders and support staff involved.      Wild seesawing as we have been seeing this month in both traditional and crypto markets destroy wealth more often than they create it. At times the destruction can be truly threatening – at time of writing, the S&P 500 has lost over $3 trillion in value so far this month. And, as we saw in 2008, market losses can trigger a widespread economic meltdown that impacts upon the lives of people who had no idea they were inadvertent market participants.      It takes on a new meaning, however, when the threat is more than economic. As most of us retreat to safety (with a huge shout-out of appreciation for those who can’t), markets need to keep running.    Much is uncertain about the environment and the outlook of the crisis we are going through. One thing is sure, though: we have not seen the last of wild swings.    Yet, sending market makers to work from home is not as simple as it sounds. Regulations require certain levels of supervision, time stamping, data privacy procedures and voice recording that cannot be replicated in a home office. And market surveillance and audits are not quite as reliable via a saturated home Wi-Fi. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA have issued no-action relief notices exempting market operators from these rules while the pandemic lasts, but the full functioning of markets will not be “business as usual.” Market makers that are out of their comfort zone, either because of unstable infrastructure or unclear rules, may have less appetite to offer liquidity.    Preventive measures    So for the health and safety of people and prices, should markets close?      Some notable financial influencers have argued in favor of doing so. CNBC’s Jim Cramer believes that closing until the virus peaks would stop company valuations from collapsing unnecessarily. Tech entrepreneur Max Levchin argues doing so would allow everyone to focus on staying safe without the distraction of collapsing 401(k)s. Even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has confirmed there have been talks about reducing opening hours.      Bloomberg’s John Authers, one of the more insightful and sober economists I follow, presents the case for closure as a data issue: There’s not much point in letting markets absorb and trade on data when the data that matters (the spread of the virus and its economic impact) is incomplete and unreliable.      Less drastic but similar measures are being implemented already. Several countries, including France, Italy, Spain and South Korea, have instituted full or partial short-selling bans. Some support the move as an acceptable compromise to more stringent measures. Others point out that banning short selling distorts price discovery and limits investors’ hedging opportunities. A 2012 paper by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed stocks subject to short-selling restrictions performed worse than those not so restricted.      See also: While Some Hoard Dollar Bills, Others Envision Germy Cash’s Quick Demise      What’s more, almost all traditional markets have an in-built closure mechanism anyway in the form of circuit breakers. In the U.S., for instance, if a market falls more than 7 percent before 3:25 p.m. Eastern time, trading is halted for 15 minutes; a fall of 20 percent will halt trading for the rest of the day. Since implementation in 1987, the circuit breakers have only been triggered five times in the U.S.: once in 1997, and four times so far this month.  These circuit breakers give traders a chance to gather their wits and strategize rather than just try to catch the proverbial falling knife. They are seen as a breather that restores common sense and that might help panic sellers to see the error of their ways.    Keep them open    Fortunately, none of the arguments for full closure are as yet being seriously considered. The closure of the world’s principal trading venues would suspend price discovery, which is a fundamental mechanism of trade beyond stocks and bonds. And the blow to investor confidence in liquid markets from a prolonged shutdown would be severe and long-lasting.      But even more urgently, many investors will most likely need to sell shares or bonds for cash over the coming weeks to cover living expenses.      Also, market closures would not necessarily stop trading from happening – it would just move off-exchange to unregulated “back rooms” with no investor protection. As with nature, markets always find a way.      Even the concept of temporary circuit breakers is criticized as a market distortion. To mitigate the damage from technology glitches, fine, but why shouldn’t prices plummet in response to new information if they reflect investors’ opinions (however mistaken) on fair value?      What’s more, circuit breakers do have an ideological bias – notice there are no market-wide circuit breakers when markets move up, even though rapidly ascending indices can also encourage traders and investors to take foolish positions.    Business as usual    And then we have the crypto markets.      These never close. Ever. Crypto assets can be traded 24/7. Even if one exchange is down (which often happens), there is another one somewhere that can pick up the action.      Even if it were agreed that temporary closure is a good idea, there is no central authority to enforce that. Even if all the large exchanges agreed (work with me here), there would be many smaller exchanges happy to help traders express their market opinions. Heck, you don’t even need an exchange to sell your crypto assets – you and I could agree to trade via email if we wanted.      See also: How Central Banks Could Use Digital Cash to Deliver Universal Basic Income      Investors in crypto assets, especially those who believe in the true purpose of markets, must take some comfort from the knowledge there is no way their intentions could be thwarted by a centralized decision.      Proposals have been made to introduce circuit breakers in crypto, arguing that the steep drop of over 15 percent in the space of 30 minutes on three different occasions on March 12-13 limits the usefulness of the technology. Some insist it is enough to scare many investors away. Others point out that were it not for an inadvertent circuit breaker in the form of a technical halt to trading on leading derivatives exchange BitMEX, allegedly due to a DDOS attack, the imbalance of bids vs. positions to liquidate on the platform could have pushed bitcoin’s price down to $0.      While the desire to protect the market is understandable, it flies against the very essence of crypto assets – they are decentralized stores of value that can be transferred from one party to another without going through a centralized authority.      An effective circuit breaker plan would require total centralization. First, who makes that decision? Consensus among all trading platforms? Not likely, especially as any holdout would reap rewards as trading flowed its way.      Second, when would the circuit breakers be triggered? Who decides that? Again, a consensus is unlikely, as is efficient implementation. Who would be responsible for making sure that all platforms complied? How would this be enforced?    The bigger question    This is a fascinating conversation for market nerds like me, as it gets to the root of what markets are for. Are they for allocating resources and messaging value? Or are they for protecting capital and preserving wealth? Are they there to crowdsource opinions as to economic outlook? Or are they there to boost investing confidence?      Much is uncertain about the environment and the outlook of the crisis we are going through. One thing is sure, though: we have not seen the last of wild swings. The temptation of many to use markets as a political tool in troubled times will run up against those that understand that markets are about more than making money.      See also: How Bitcoin’s Price Slump Is Changing the Geography of Mining      Those working in crypto markets are well aware of this. They have no central authority to manipulate their platforms to influence investors – in that sense, the market is “free.” Yet, with freedom comes risk.      In the case of crypto markets, that risk has the form of disjointed oversight, sometimes lax security, relatively low investor assurances and occasional volatile swings with enough ferocity to make even crypto enthusiasts occasionally wonder if total centralization of rules isn’t such a bad idea after all. Mercifully, those bruised lapses in focus tend to be fleeting.      As with much about the current crisis, deep questions about what we want from crypto markets are being asked.

42383492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w8np,1585634400,Mt. Gox Deadline Extended Again After Creditors Criticize Refund Proposal,"The submission deadline for the Mt. Gox rehabilitation plan has been pushed back again after a draft proposed last week was met with opposition from numerous creditors.      In the plan, proposed to Mt. Gox creditors at a March 25 meeting, rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi said he would, if authorized by the court, sell off some of the recovered cryptocurrencies in order to settle prioritized fiat currency claims.      Creditors would have the option of receiving reimbursement in bitcoin (BTC), but the rehabilitation proposal says it was possible there would be an ""insufficient amount"" to settle all claims. As the trustee has ruled out making any additional purchases of bitcoin, some creditors would likely receive part of their claim in fiat currency, the plan said.      See also: Investor Fortress Raises Buyout Offer for Mt. Gox Creditor Claims by 71%      But Kobayashi's proposal received significant pushback from creditors, not least because most creditors want to be reimbursed in bitcoin.      Alex Ortega, managing principal of Iverson Capital Group, the first company to buy Mt. Gox creditor claims in 2016, told CoinDesk that many creditors were dissatisfied with the rehabilitation plan and felt the trustee should not be allowed to sell recovered bitcoin in order to settle fiat currency claims first.      ""[M]ost of these creditors are generally bitcoin specialties themselves who want to remain in the market; so to sell off BTC and pay them in fiat not only locks them into a price at exit and caps their potential upside but also would lead to a sell-off in the market, which, as happened in 2018, can get messy,"" Ortega said.      Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014 after hackers stole 850,000 bitcoins from its servers. What now comprises the Mt. Gox estate was originally 200,000 bitcoins found in an old-format wallet shortly after the exchange collapsed.      At last count, the Mt. Gox estate held approximately 141,600 bitcoin (~$900 million) and 142,800 bitcoin cash (BCH) (~$31.2 million). Kobayashi sold off as much as $400 million worth of recovered bitcoin in early 2018 on the open market, plunging many cryptocurrencies down.      See also: $2 Billion Lost in Mt. Gox Bitcoin Hack Can Be Recovered, Lawyer Claims      Following the meeting, the Tokyo District Court granted a request Friday for a deadline extension from Kobayashi. In a statement Monday, Kobayashi said he needed time to address some ""matters that require closer examination.""
