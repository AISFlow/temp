42378610,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inkt,1455660233,Gemalto Sees Two Waves of Blockchain Adoption Forming,"Cryptography, mobile, machine-to-machine, payments – while those in the blockchain community may associate such terminology with use cases for the emerging technology, they are all already components of Gemalto’s business strategy.  The digital security giant earned €2.4bn in annual revenue in 2014 on the strength of its two main offerings – embedded software and products, and platforms and services – both of which serve its broader mandate of facilitating trusted exchange in a digital environment.  Given this background, it may be no surprise that Gemalto is looking to leverage its success with government, telecommunications and retail clients to explore applications for its services in the burgeoning blockchain space, recently partnering with Symbiont, a blockchain startup that seeks to advance capital markets applications of the technology.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Gemalto vice president of business strategy Mark Yakabuski called the partnership with Symbiont the company’s ""first step"" in learning how to potentially incorporate blockchain products or services within its portfolio.  Further, Yakabuski sought to portray Gemalto’s existing hardware and APIs as flexible in terms of possible integration, given that its hardware security module (HSMs) manage, process and store cryptographic keys not dissimilar from those used in today’s blockchain networks.  Though the company is still in exploratory stages, Yakabuski said he sees two potential markets for the technology, stating:  ""We believe that the first generation of blockchain is going to be driven by the financial services industry. The second generation, we believe the blockchain has the ability to be adopted within the Internet of Things.""  Gemalto, Yakabuski said, sees the company making a ""strategic thrust"" to leverage its existing expertise to generate new business opportunities around these use cases, should they develop as expected.  Notably, he said Gemalto already provides technology to select bitcoin exchanges, which he said use its HSMs for cryptographic security. Though Yakabuski declined to name the firms, New York-based Gemini has previously indicated it engaged with SafeNet, which was later purchased by Gemalto, about using its HSM technology as part of its key storage.  Still, Yakabuski stressed the flexibility and synergy between blockchain use cases and its technology as the main impetus for the deal.  ""[Our tech] can adopt to new use cases, and we’re doing what we’ve done across financial industries, which is protecting identities and the transactions they perform,"" he said.  Private or permissioned  Yakabuski indicated that Gemalto is so far intrigued by the possible applications, though it sees certain uses, like smart or programmable contracts, as offering the biggest opportunities.  Yet Yakabuski was critical of the approach of the ""anonymous"" nature of the bitcoin blockchain, suggesting Gemalto sees more value in opportunities in applying its tech to private or permissioned-based ledger systems in which the institution operating the blockchain has control over the nodes that process transactions.  ""We are obviously leaning toward where we see partnership opportunities for participating in private and permissioned based ledgers,"" he said, adding:  ""[Our partners are] looking for the level of assurance we provide on our products, and that leads us to believe that these ledgers are going to be adopted by those institutions.""  Yakabuski indicated that he sees the bitcoin blockchain as conflicting with this goal given that, as a public ledger, it does not feature restrictions on who participate in the operation of the network.  Further, he lauded the approach being taken by Symbiont, which is seeking to create a blockchain that includes support for smart contracts.  Fresh off a $1.25m seed round last year, Symbiont is currently focused on use cases in the corporate bond, loan, private placements, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and crowdfunding markets.  Mutual partnership  As for its work with Symbiont, Yakabuski was keen to stress that this was an agreement he believes will benefit Gemalto given that its clients have been asking about its work in the blockchain industry.  Yakabuski sees its HSM product appealing to companies that are seeking to secure blockchain networks, given that the technology overlaps with what he considers to be the company’s core competencies.  ""We have a history with our payment cards, our payment chips and key management systems. We have a long and very good history with payment transactions,"" he said.  He went on to suggest that, in Gemalto’s view, the market for security solutions around blockchain technology is not yet sophisticated, and that, as a result, today’s early players are moving with caution.  He went on to suggest that he believes Gemalto could compete against other blockchain security providers such as BitGo and Gem, stating:  ""From what I’ve seen, security within the bitcoin and blockchain solutions is certainly in its infancy and there’s a lot of room for growth and improvement.""  Early conversations  Still, the company hasn’t yet made the leap to formally courting the market.  Yakabuski said that a major source of interest for Gemalto’s clients is understanding how best to deploy blockchain networks, indicating that they are unsure of whether to deploy the technology in data centers and in private or public clouds.  ""Right now, I would say that the majority of conversations I’ve had with potential adopters of blockchain, they’re looking at enterprise, where they would deploy a blockchain footprint within their own data centers,"" he remarked.  The comments come at a time when Microsoft, for example, has already launched a testing environment on its Azure service that allows enterprises and financial institutions to create blockchain networks in its cloud environment.  While such questions remain unanswered for Gemalto and its clients, for now, Yakabuski said he believes the market is about to heat up, and that there’s room for the company to compete for new business in the industry.  Yakabuski concluded:  ""We believe that the solutions built on blockchain will expand quite rapidly, and we want to be a leading security option for our customers as that expands.""

42378596,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inS1,1455646627,ItBit Hires Former SocGen Exec to Lead London Initiatives,"New York-based bitcoin exchange itBit has hired a securities services and technology veteran to head operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The hire of Jason Nabi comes as the exchange opens a new office in London. Prior to itBit, Nabi worked for major European bank Société Générale as its global business lead for post-trade services.  Nabi started his career as a dealer on the London Stock Exchange, and has held senior positions at IBM Global Services, Bloomberg and BNP Paribas Securities Services.  He said in a statement:  ""The industry is at a turning point with distributed ledger technology, and I believe that itBit is the best-positioned firm to be a leader in this area with its Bankchain offering.""  There’s been a push from entrepreneurs and traditional financial services players in London to better understand and take advantage of blockchain technology. In November, a consortium of banks, exchanges and clearing houses, including the London Stock Exchange, UBS and CME Group formed a working body to explore how blockchain could be used for settlement.  As an advisor to the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Working Group, as the consortium is called, Nabi will likely help bridge the gap between the startup blockchain tech company, itBit and the traditional financial services industry.  With its clearing and settlement network, Bankchain, itBit plans on extending blockchain technology to existing markets, for starters trading on the London gold market, according to the Financial Times. And there’s momentum already with the London Bullion Market Association recently calling for proposals for an electronic hub where trades can be logged.

42378603,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inc5,1455645545,"No, Forking Bitcoin Won't Land You in Legal Hot Water","A few days ago, I awoke to a collection of frantic emails, Slacks, Telegrams and tweets, all asking me the same question: ""Can I go to jail for supporting the wrong version of bitcoin?""  The fear, uncertainty and doubt wrapped up in this question were palpable.  Do software developers contributing code to blockchain projects need to lawyer up? Could those contributions subject them to money services business (MSB) regulations under US law? Are we going to see developers go to jail for failing to get the proper licenses?  These were just some of the questions I received, and the answer to all of them is: of course not.  This article does not concern the Bitcoin Classic vs Bitcoin Core debate. It doesn't advocate for the operational or philosophical merits of any particular approach.  It does, however, mean to address the recent concerns over developer contributions to and support of particular versions of free and open-source software.  The scaling issue is a technological issue, not a legal one.  Are software developers regulated under the money services laws?  Of course not. There is no legal authority for the claim that contributions to a decentralized virtual currency software project create liability under the money services laws in any US jurisdiction.  You can read here about the kinds of things that might actually bring you under those laws. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the federal regulator of such matters, has spoken directly on this issue.  It said  that mere software development can't be money transmission:  ""The production and distribution of software, in and of itself, does not constitute acceptance and transmission of value, even if the purpose of the software is to facilitate the sale of virtual currency.""  FinCEN isn't alone in proactively clarifying its position on this matter. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which famously published the world’s first digital currency-specific licensing framework, expressly exempts software developers from its regulations.  Suggesting that FinCEN or state regulators intend to burden software developers with the yoke of financial services regulation is misleading.  Are 'creators' of digital currency software systems regulated?  Of course not.  This idea, though – that the creators of the wrong version of bitcoin are risking jail time – had to come from somewhere. Administrators of certain virtual currency systems might be regulated, but only under some fairly specific circumstances.  Administrators of a digital currency system are only regulated MSBs if they can both (i) issue and (ii) redeem that currency. That is to say, if you can put the currency into circulation and also remove it from circulation you could be an MSB.  So liability under the money services laws has nothing to do with being a ""creator"", it has to do with being an administrator.  That’s why operators of centralized systems are often MSBs, but operators of decentralized systems are not.  The BitLicense framework incorporates a similar exemption, and steers quite clear of any use of the ""creator"" concept.  Could miners risk liability for mining a particular chain?  Of course not. Civil liability typically requires some duty to another person.  Criminal liability typically requires some culpable mental state, like knowingly or recklessly doing an act.  Yet, some of the most important characteristics of bitcoin transaction processing are, in no particular order, that network validators (the miners) typically:  Aren't parties to the transaction  Aren’t required for the transaction to occur (some other miner will mine the block if one doesn't)  Don't have contracts with the parties to the transaction  Don't know the details of the transactions they are processing.  Simply mining a block containing a transaction does not create a duty to any of the parties to a transaction, let alone a duty that arose because of the chain that was mined or the software that miner chooses to run on its machines.  The parties' expectations of how their transactions will be mined would probably not be upset by any particular miner mining a different chain (whether shorter or longer), nor would the parties’ expectations give rise to any ""duty to mine” on the part of any particular miner.  Without knowledge – or reason to know – of the transaction details, criminal liability is difficult to contemplate.  So, what is the proper role of the law in the bitcoin scaling debate? Dispute resolution, perhaps. Mediation. De-escalation. Besides those limited cases, though, I’m not sure it has one.

42378605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7infr,1455638124,Mizuho to Develop Blockchain Tech for Internal Recordkeeping,"Mizuho Financial has announced it is seeking to develop a blockchain application for internal recordkeeping.  The move, according to Mizuho, marks the ""beginning of a strategic program"" that will find the Japan-based financial services firm working with IT consulting firm Cognizant to leverage the technology to cut costs and improve its internal processes.  As part of the deal, Cognizant will develop the blockchain solution, with the goal of enabling companies within the Mizuho group to sign and exchange sensitive documents with greater security and transparency. The project will initially focus on connecting offices in New York and Tokyo, though the company has subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Americas.  Toshitsugu Okabe, deputy president and executive officer of Mizuho Financial Group, said in a statement:  ""We are pleased to be among the early adopters of blockchain technology in Japan to make our processes and workflows faster and more efficient.”  The announcement is notable given the past issues the Japanese bank has experienced in connection with the industry.  For example, Mizuho previously operated as a banker partner for now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, which famously lost millions in customer funds in 2014, ensnaring the firm in subsequent, and still ongoing lawsuits.

42378612,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inof,1455618651,7 Asian Banks Investigating Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech,"UPDATE (17th February 15:40 GMT): Added detail on SBI Group's recent investment announcements.  _____  Until recently, there was a noticeable lack of interest in bitcoin and the blockchain among the financial institutions of Asia. In fact, banks there were more likely to be issuing warnings about digital currencies than getting involved in any related activity.  It was the fall of Mt Gox in Japan and the Chinese central bank's crackdown on bitcoin exchanges, events that both took place in 2014, that resulted in early barriers among financial institutions in those nations.  However, the recent upsurge in the popularity of blockchain technology in the global finance sector seems to have at least somewhat laid those concerns to rest. Now, the region's banking sector is showing the same growing enthusiasm for the tech's disruptive potential in banking that can be seen in Europe and North America.  Evidence of this sea change can be seen in the number of large financial institutions in China, Japan and Korea that have recently moved to launch or support initiatives involving blockchain and digital currency, and develop proofs of concept around forward-looking applications of the technology.  In this article, we look at which banks are engaging with the technology in the region.  Japan's largest bank develops its own cryptocurrency  At the start of this month, Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) revealed that it has developed its own digital currency nicknamed ""MUFG coin"" as part of its research into blockchain and distributed ledger technology.  The initiative was set up to replicate the peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange and mobile-wallet functionality that bitcoin provides, but without relying on its distributed network of miners.  MUFG began the project in the autumn of 2015, with the aim of decreasing the costs of managing financial transactions, particularly in the case of P2P transfers and remittances.  The country's largest bank, MUFG ranked eighth among the world's largest banks in total assets by Relbanks.com.  Major Korean bank kicks off blockchain remittance project  South Korea's KB Kookmin Bank announced just this week that it is developing a blockchain solution for international remittances with the aim of offering ""safer and faster"" money transmission services.  The initiative, which is being carried out in partnership with local bitcoin startup Coinplug, is built on the premise of eliminating intermediary services involved in international SWIFT bank transfers, with an eye to offer cheaper consumer-facing services as a result.  A bank spokesperson remarked at the time:  ""Blockchain technology is a new trend and we are trying to adopt this technology in a low level of data integrity platform. We are planning to escalate our services further to provide more secure and comfortable financial services for our customers.""  Kookmin has also announced plans to develop a blockchain-based ""overseas fund transfer and data storage service"" that can be used for verification when opening online bank accounts.  KB Kookmin Bank is the largest subsidiary of KP Financial group, which according to its 2014 annual report earned KRW 1.4tn ($1.16bn) in revenue from more than 30 million customers.  Singapore bank gets in on the blockchain action  As 2015 drew to a close, news emerged of a blockchain partnership between Singapore's DBS Bank and multinational banking firm Standard Chartered.  With the aim of creating a distributed ledger project for trade finance, officials at both firms told Bloomberg that they have completed initial testing for the idea, and that they are seeking to collaborate with other firms on the initiative over the course of 2016.  While details are sketchy, DBS and Standard Chartered are considering various distributed ledger technologies to achieve project goals.  Furthermore, both banks have reportedly been investigating applications for the technology since as early as May of this year, according to a blog post by R3CEV co-founder Todd McDonald.  DBS Bank is Southeast Asia's largest bank, reporting $319b in total assets as of September 2015.  Japanese firms team up for blockchain banking project  In December, Japan's SBI Sumishin Net Bank announced that it is developing a proof-of-concept aimed at exploring blockchain-based banking services in conjunction with Nomura Research Institute (NRI), the research arm of Nomura Holdings.  While details on the initiative are scarce, NRI said it will seek to ""examine business scenarios"" with the goal of preparing a prototype for SBI Sumishin.  However, it is known that Dragonfly Fintech Pte, a blockchain firm, will assist in the project's development.  In statements, NRI senior management director Minoru Yokote cited the project as an example of how the organization is seeking to embrace distributed financial technologies.  Yokote said:  ""NRI is committed to examining technical challenges of blockchain and suggesting ways to apply this technology to the banking industry.""  SBI Investment also announced on 29th January that it has agreed to invest $5m in Payward, the parent company of the Kraken bitcoin exchange.  On the same day, SBI announced a second agreement to invest an undisclosed amount in distributed ledger tech startup Ripple and to establish a joint venture company with the firm that will operate in Asia.  An investment in Japanese exchange bitFlyer may also be on the cards according to the groups Q3 financial results for the last financial year.  SBI Sumishin  is a recent joint venture between Japan’s largest trust bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, and SBI Holdings.  Founded in 1965, NRI is Japan's oldest private think tank, offering consulting services and provides IT solutions for various industries, including finance.  China's central bank considers issuing digital currency  Last month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country's central bank, suggested it is considering the launch of its own digital currency, which may or may not use blockchain technology.  The PBoC revealed in a 20th January release that it had held a meeting discussing the possibility, which had included central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan and deputy governor Fan Yifei, as well as a group of ""relevant research institutions, major financial institutions and advisory bodies of experts"".  The central bank also received input from Citibank and Deloitte, as it weighed up how to issue the digital currency.  Notably, the central bank put together a team dedicated to digital currency research in 2014 – the work of which played into the Beijing meeting.  Japanese bank jons R3 blockchain consortium  Late last year, the R3CEV consortium announced that yet more institutions had joined its roster of 25 banks (now over 40) that were working with the group to investigate and develop use cases for distributed ledger technology.  One of those institutions was Japan's Mizuho Bank, which notably has a long track record of engaging with the bitcoin industry, having served as a banking partner for bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. Indeed, Mizuho is currently embroiled in ongoing lawsuits related to that ill-fated partnership.  Mizuho joined R3 in October, indication in statements that the bank saw the potential for ""improved banking service in every aspect"".  ""Distributed ledger technologies might become the next disruptive technology that has the potential to innovate everyday banking activities,"" Toshitsugu Okabe, deputy president & executive officer for the bank's Incubation Project Team, said at the time  South Korean bank invests in blockchain firm  Blockchain remittance startup Streami closed a $2m seed funding round last December that notably included among its backers Shinhan Bank, one of South Korea's largest financial services providers. The bank committed roughly $427,000 to the funding round.    By targeting the Asian remittance market from South Korea to China, Streami seeks to help people bypass illegal money transmission services in the area.    Shinhan Bank is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. Historically it was the first bank in Korea, established under the name Hanseong Bank in 1897.
