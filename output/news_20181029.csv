42429852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wbh,1540850575,Planting Bitcoin  Part Three: Soil,"Dan Held is the founder of crypto portfolio service Picks & Shovels. He previously founded data service ZeroBlock, which sold to Blockchain, and served as VP of product at ChangeTip.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      In my last article, ""Seasons,"" I covered the precise moment in which Satoshi planted Bitcoin, the 2008 Financial Crisis. In this article, I cover the Cypherpunks or the ""Soil"" in which he planted the Bitcoin seed giving it the best chance for success.    (I've paired this song to ""Soil"" because I think it fits the feel of the piece and adds additional depth. If you enjoy listening to this, please follow my playlist on Spotify.)            Cypherpunks  Sending the Bitcoin white paper to the cryptography mailing list on October 31, 2008 was the obvious choice.  This was the right group to gather feedback from, the right channel to engage with. The list was predominately populated by the Cypherpunks* who were activists advocating widespread use of strong cryptography, as a route to social and political change.  *""Cypherpunks"" is a play on the word 'cipher' or 'cypher', for encryption; and cyberpunk a genre of sci-fi.  The group was originally comprised of Eric Hughes, Tim May and John Gilmore. At first, the meetings were in-person meetings in the San Francisco Bay Area, but they decided to expand the group via the cryptographer mailing list which would allow them to reach other Cypherpunks.  The mailing list was a place to exchange ideas freely through the use of encryption methods, such as PGP, to ensure complete privacy. The basic ideas behind this movement can be found in the Cypherpunk manifesto written by Eric Hughes in 1993. The key principle which underpins the manifesto is the importance of privacy and finality in transactions — PetriB  ""Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system."" — A Cypherpunk's Manifesto  We want the ability to ensure that others cannot use the information in the history of our transactions against us. For example: a purchase indicating that someone is wealthy, an embarrassing purchase, or one that would make you subject to spam or harassment. We do not want our financial purchase to haunt us further down the road. We want an endpoint beyond which we do not have to worry about further contingencies.  In the world of payments, this is closely related to the concept of ""finality"" — ideally we want to be able to state with certainty that at some point the payment has been made, the debt has been cleared, and the funds are secure. But recent developments have increased the ability for more powerful parties to clawback funds (via trusted third parties, legal funds, etc).  We hope that existing laws would provide protection against these difficulties. However, we can remove that moral hazard by not having to trust third parties or more powerful adversaries which can revert transactions solely based on their capabilities. This is what the Cypherpunks were fighting for with cryptography.  They were the ""Men of words,"" or anti-establishment intellectuals that laid the foundation for individuals like Satoshi to come along.  ""The words of anti-establishment intellectuals sow the seeds for revolution. They present ideas and sometimes discredit the establishment, paving the way for a charismatic leader to package their thinking into a movement."" — Tony Sheng          Elliot Alderson, the ""Cypherpunk"" in the fictional show ""Mr. Robot."" He joins a group that aims to destroy all debt records by encrypting the financial data of the largest conglomerate in the world, E Corp.            The first attempts at making an anonymous transacting system were made by Cypherpunks on that cryptographer mailing list, including:  Adam Back, the inventor of hashcash, the proof-of-work (PoW) system used by several anti-spam systems. A similar PoW system is used in bitcoin  Nick Szabo, designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called ""bit gold."" Bit gold was never implemented, but has been called ""a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture""  Wei Dai, who published ""b-money"", an ""anonymous, distributed electronic cash system""  Hal Finny, who created the first reusable proof of work system before Bitcoin (And in January 2009 he became Bitcoin network's first transaction recipient). He was also a developer of the secure communication method known as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)  David Chaum, founded DigiCash (1989) as a form of centralized ""electronic money"" that deployed the same kinds of cryptographic protocols — public key cryptography — that support the nature of bitcoin transactions. It is often called ""Chaumian eCash.""  Satoshi cites many of these Cypherpunks in the Bitcoin whitepaper and references their influence on Bitcoin's development in public statements made post code launch.  ""Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Dai's b-money proposal… and Nick Szabo's Bitgold proposal"" — Satoshi Nakamoto  In fact, Satoshi thought he was late to cryptocurrency! While the Cypherpunks had attempted many times to genetically code a species of money that would survive, none had been successful.  ""A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system."" — Satoshi Nakamoto  He had written the white paper to fit his target audience, the Cypherpunks. That's why he uses the words ""electronic cash,"" ""proof-of-work,"" etc. which was previously used terminology in the other Cypherpunk white papers. He uses an e-commerce example to make it easier for everyone to comprehend.  He's crafting a narrative that will resonate with the Cypherpunks, to get them interested and involved. Bitcoin was the holy grail — it had solved the problem of finality and provided a small measure of privacy. The source code implementation was his product spec.  ""The functional details are not covered in the paper, but the sourcecode is coming soon."" — Satoshi Nakamoto  The following things not described in the whitepaper, but are included in the source code: 21M hard cap, 10 minute blocks, 1 MB block caps. Those were incredibly important components of Bitcoin. The whitepaper was merely a teaser.  ""If the Bitcoin Whitepaper is the Declaration of Independence, the Source Code is the Constitution."" — Pierre Rochard  In true Cypherpunk fashion, the publication of Satoshi's white paper (October 2008) was quickly followed by code release in January 2009. The notion that good ideas need to be implemented, not just discussed, is very much part of the culture of the mailing list.  ""Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide…We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down."" — A Cypherpunk's Manifesto  Importantly, Satoshi didn't pre-mine any Bitcoins. Satoshi gave the Cypherpunks a two month heads up before mining the Genesis block. To prove fairness, he included a proof of no premine timestamp in the Genesis Block of the Bitcoin blockchain.  It carried a strong political message. What he was trying to accomplish was clear — they were building a new financial system. Bitcoin wasn't merely digital cash, it was an alternative to banks.  ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"" — Genesis Block  Part 4… ""Gardening""  In Part 4, I will cover Satoshi's involvement with the early software development and community or his ""Gardening"" of bitcoin.

42429858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wnh,1540846860,Ethereum's Biggest Enterprise Group Is Releasing New Software Specs,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has released its latest round of specifications – the next steps to harmonizing the way large companies use private versions of the second-largest blockchain.  Announced Monday at Devcon4, the annual ethereum developer conference, EEA (the largest blockchain consortium, with 500 members) released its Client Specification Version 2, which lays out a certification process to ensure ethereum coders are following common standards.  In addition, the EEA released the Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification Version 0.5, a way for data to be diverted from the blockchain to some off-ledger trusted environment, or piped in from external sources known as oracles via a standard application programming interface (API).  The ultimate goal of these incremental alignments, said EEA executive director Ron Resnick, is to establish the foundations for the type of seamless development work that happens in ecosystems such as Android.  ""The way I view interoperability is from the best practices of other markets like telecoms,"" Resnick told CoinDesk. ""If I buy a phone in one country and a SIM card in another, I know they are going to work together.""  And Client Spec V2 creates the equivalent of a sticker on the box that says the SIM card works with the phone. EEA is a registered trademark, which means that for a tech vendor to call its code solution EEA-interoperable it will first have to go through third-party certificate testing, which will be starting in Q1 2020, added Resnick.  As well as within the ethereum community, EEA Client Specification V2 will also help drive the recently announced tie-up with another enterprise blockchain consortium, the Hyperledger project.  ""If a Hyperledger developer now modifies his solution so that it conforms to the EEA spec and gets it certified, we will see interoperability there too,"" Resnick said.  And it's a two way street. As part of the release of Hyperledger's Fabric 1.3, its blockchain now supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode smart contracts.  Privacy and performance  The other new spec, the EEA Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification V 0.5, removes certain computation services for jobs that would take too long to run on-chain. This might include heavyweight privacy tech like zero-knowledge proofs or multi-party computation.  Much of this work was done by a Trusted Execution Task Force (comprising close to 90 members) within the EEA. For example, Intel has been specifying how cryptographic operations should be performed in a secure enclave like the chip maker's software guard extensions (SGX).  ""Trusted compute is a fundamental technology to take enterprise blockchain use to the next level, and the specification's Trusted Compute APIs make it easier,"" Tom Willis, director at Intel's Open Source Technology Center, said in a statement.  The off-chain spec also covers oracle services (porting external information into smart contracts) provided by the likes of blockchain oracle service Oraclize or Thomson Reuters' BlockONE IQ.  Resnick said the off-chain trusted compute spec killed two birds with one stone, enhancing performance and privacy.  ""What's more, enterprises can choose whichever trusted compute methods work best for their use case, whether it is for supply chains, banks, retail, or other large enterprise-based ecosystems,"" he said.  Devcon discussions will also explore how the EEA hopes to contribute and potentially add value to the public blockchain community through the ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) process.  ""Potential approaches include encouraging EEA members to contribute to specific EIPs, and describing mandatory client requirements in terms of specific EIPs where appropriate,"" Conor Svensson, CEO of startup blk.io and the EEA Technical Standards Working Group chair, told CoinDesk.

42429864,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wvh,1540841128,UK Government Says It Will Update Crypto Tax Guidance By Early Next Year,"UK officials have outlined a range of regulatory steps around cryptoassets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in a new report.  The UK government's ""Cryptoasset Taskforce,"" first announced this past March, published its final report on Monday, finding that the technology that makes up cryptocurrencies can be used to benefit the financial services sector, as well as other industries.  As such, the HM Treasury, Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England – the three groups that constitute the task force – will ""encourage responsible development of legitimate DLT and cryptoasset-related activity in the UK.""  The report notes elsewhere:  ""While the authorities' immediate priority is to mitigate the risks associated with the current generation of cryptoassets, the Taskforce considers that other applications of DLT have the potential to deliver significant benefits in both financial services and other sectors. The authorities do not believe there are regulatory barriers to further adoption of DLT.""  ""However, the technology requires further development before it could be used at scale and before these opportunities could be realized,"" it added.  Among the concrete actions to take place in the coming months is updated guidance for would-be crypto-taxpayers. The report says while the subject is outside of the scope of the Taskforce's report, ""HM Treasury is working closely with HM Revenue and Customs to consider the tax issues raised by cryptoassets.""  ""Current guidance on the tax treatment of cryptoassets is set out on HMRC's website. HMRC will further update their guidance by early 2019, drawing on the Taskforce's work,"" the report notes.  The UK is also looking to take steps that would formalize rules around initial coin offerings that take place in the country.  ""The government will issue a consultation in early 2019 to further explore with the industry whether there are examples of such cryptoassets on the UK market and, if so, whether an extension of the regulatory perimeter is required,"" the report states.  More steps outlined  The report contends that the government will also ""take action to mitigate the risks that cryptoassets pose to consumers and market integrity,"" as well as prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activity, while also monitoring for any threats to financial stability.  The report states that cryptocurrency use in criminal circles ""remains low,"" though the risk for their use in activities such as money laundering appears to be increasing. Of greater concern, perhaps, is the risk to consumers due to potential losses and the risk to market integrity that could arise from market manipulation.  In its conclusion, the report also calls for clarification of a regulatory framework around security tokens, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and financial instruments which reference cryptocurrencies and tokens listed on exchanges.  Other recommendations include more cooperation with international authorities on such issues and further steps to make consumers aware of the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.  The task force will continue to meet ""every six months to consider developments and review the UK's approach,"" the document noted.

Activated on schedule at block 419,200, Sapling has long been planned as an upgrade aimed at making the network faster, lighter and more secure.  On Sunday, the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company's Elise Hadmon wrote that ""Sapling activation, occurring on the momentous occasion of the currency's second birthday, brings us one step closer to widespread adoption of an open, permissionless and private payment system.""  The company anticipates that transactions will take 90 percent less time and require 97 percent less memory to occur as a result. That being said, the overall zcash ecosystem will still need some time to add new addresses, Hadmon wrote.  Hadmon added that users cannot yet transfer funds from old shielded addresses to the new version without showing amounts, writing:  ""This allows us to audit the monetary base of ZEC held in shielded addresses. We are developing a tool to automate the migration of funds in a way that allows users to minimize the impact on their privacy. We recommend that users wait for the release of this tool, if feasible.""  No timeline was presented for when this tool may be released.  Following the upgrade's implementation, network data indicates that zcash's hashrate briefly fell to 1.5 GH/s, lower than it has been in nearly three weeks. By press time, however, it had returned to roughly 2 GH/s.  Zcash's hashrate has been fluctuating between just under 1.5 GH/s and 2 GH/s for more than a month now.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Sarhangi joined Ripple this month after departing his role leading Google's director of messaging product management and partnerships – a post held since September 2015.  With previous experience at notable firms including Vodafone and Deloitte, Sarhangi joined Google when it acquired a startup he'd founded in 2015 called Jibe Mobile. Jibe Mobile was a provider of rich communications services (RCS), an alternative to traditional SMS messaging that provides enhanced features.  Sarhangi will now lead the efforts to develop Ripple's global payments network RippleNet, according to a Reuters report.  The term RippleNet covers the firm's several blockchain-based payments products, which are aimed to provide near real-time settlement to banks and other financial institutions. While most clients do not use the XRP cryptocurrency that Ripple has had a significant role in developing, it was announced in October that several clients are now using the token.  The news marks the second hire from an internet giant by Ripple in recent months.

StarkWare, the company that developed the zk-STARKS privacy feature, is now working to commercialize the tech, according to a blog post on the funding round. Zk-starks operate by compressing large amounts of data into small proofs (starks) and using zero-knowledge proofs to keep the information private.  StarkWare wants to allow public blockchain networks to add similar privacy to their own protocols. And indeed, co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson previously told CoinDesk that there was ""plenty of interest"" in the technology.  Privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash already offers a similar zero-knowledge proof system to its users.  In Monday's blog post, StarkWare noted that Intel Capital, Sequoia, Atomico, DCVC, Wing, ConsenSys, Coinbase Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Collaborative Fund, Scalar Capital and Semantic Ventures backed the startup for the first time, with Pantera, Floodgate and Naval Ravikant adding to previous investments.  As part of the funding round, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang will join StarkWare's board of directors.  The post also noted that StarkWare's equity round is the first funding project led by Paradigm.

IT giant Fujitsu announced in a press release Monday that it has been chosen as an ""application development vendor"" for the field trial that will use a custom digital currency to attempt to achieve low-cost transfer of small-scale transactions using real-time gross settlement. The test is aimed to gauge aspects of the tech such as performance, security and real-world viability.  The nine banks involved in the effort comprise a consortium called the Japanese Banks' Payment Clearing Network (or Zengin - net) and include Mizuho Bank and MUFG Bank.  Specifically, Fujitsu will build and provide the new trial platform using blockchain technology and will also utilize a peer-to-peer money transfer platform it developed in 2017 alongside three Japanese banks. That trial encompassed a cloud-based blockchain platform for sending funds between individuals, as well as a smartphone app.  Among its various explorations of blockchain, Fujitsu also partnered in September with the Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) to provide a platform built with Hyperledger Fabric that banks within the group's ranks could use to test various business use cases for the tech.  It further launched a ""ready-to-go"" blockchain consultancy service in July that it claimed can deliver a minimum viable product in just five days.

42429862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wth,1540814450,Institutions Are Coming for Your Crypto,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The term ""institutional crypto"" sounds like an oxymoron. There's something quite ironic about financial institutions adopting a renegade technology that was designed to do away with them.  Yet a string of developments this past month suggests that – to put it bluntly – the institutions are coming for your crypto.  Whether this is something to be alarmed, excited or bemused by, depends on what you want out of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Do you want fully independent control over your assets, a more efficient and inclusive global economy, or just to get insanely rich?  What is clear is that, for a time at least, there will be an awkward and increasingly intensified clash of cultures between the pinstripes of Wall Street and the hodlers of crypto land.  And while an influx of institutional money may at some point drive up crypto prices, that clash portends more uncertainty and volatility for at least a while longer.  Institutional-grade custody  An important development came with the news two weeks ago that Fidelity will offer a digital asset trading service. The sixth-biggest fund manager in the world announced a project catering specifically to the trading demands of large institutional investors in which, most importantly, they will provide services such as ""institutional-grade custody.""  For believers in the ""be your own bank"" philosophy of bitcoin, the very idea of third-party custody is contradictory to the ""trustless"" ideals of cryptocurrency's origins.  But this was inevitable. If corporations – banks, hedge funds and brokerages, first, then non-financial enterprises, second – are to participate in the crypto economy, the legal, compliance, insurance and risk management demands they live under almost require that they pass off the risk of holding such assets to outside custodians.  And let's face it, an increasing amount of the world's crypto holdings is in the custody of third-party operators, whether it's with custodial wallet providers such as Coinbase or at centralized crypto exchanges that comingle customer assets with those of others.  A key difference is that these kinds of services are now being developed for hedge funds and other professional investment firms by more heavily regulated firms such as Fidelity. Custodial banks such as State Street and Northern Trust are also working on delivering similar services.  At the same time, a number of providers that started as crypto companies have earned regulatory status as qualified custodians, allowing them to also go after compliance-sensitive institutional investors as clients. These include BitGo, which received a charter from the South Dakota Division of Banking in September and Coinbase, which only last week received a similar qualification from the New York Department of Financial Services.  Meanwhile, the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, is preparing to launch Bakkt, a new bitcoin futures trading service – likely in December, the company said last week. The key difference with the futures contracts that were launched late last year by both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, is that Bakkt's will be for physical delivery rather than merely a cash-based settlement. That will, in turn, require custodial and other services.  Goodbye ICO, hello STO  This race to serve institutions comes as the mania for initial coin offerings, or ICOs, has waned on account of the dramatic downturn in the prices of tokens attached to decentralized applications. That was in turn mostly due to a regulatory pushback from the Securities and Exchange Commission, after commissioners argued that most, if not all, ICOs were in breach of securities registration rules.  Now, a new buzzword is emerging in the ICO's place: the ""STO.""  This is the idea of a security token offering. In many respects, it is far less revolutionary than an ICO. Most ICOs purport to be selling ""utility tokens"" whose governance structure includes a unique cryptoeconomic model for rewarding and incentivizing certain behavior within decentralized networks. STOs, by contrast, are a crypto-based version of more traditional assets such as bonds or equity.  Still, R3, the distributed ledger technology consortium founded by large banks, is already calling security tokens the ""third blockchain revolution.""  It's perhaps a little ironic that a group founded by Wall Street firms, which scoffed at the absurd hype in the ICO market last year, is now using language that could also be deemed hyperbolic. Still, it's true that STOs could have a big impact, especially in terms of smart contracts helping to more efficiently manage cap tables and, potentially, bypass underwriters in a more direct issuer-to-investor model.  To be clear, though, the impact will mostly be felt by traditional investment firms and other accredited investors who participate in primary securities markets. It might make it cheaper to raise capital and open up new models for doing so with institutional investors.  But it's not really about democratizing finance, as the ICO phenomenon, with its direct reach into retail markets, was purported to be.  Institutional framework, non-institutional model  There's a pattern to all this: new custodial and trading services being offered by large, regulated entities, all in preparation for an expected influx of new securities that use smart contracts and blockchain technology to manage transfers of more traditional assets. All are aimed squarely at the expected arrival of institutional investors into the crypto world.  Holders of bitcoin, ether and other crypto assets that might now receive a flood of incoming orders from these deep-pocketed investors sometimes salivate at this idea – essentially because they expect prices to rise.  That might be the case, but this is not going to be a smooth ride.  One reason is that, for all the efforts to jam the square peg of cryptocurrencies into the round hole of regulated, intermediary-managed capital markets, there is a fundamental contradiction that won't be easy to reconcile.  Wall Street types like to talk about crypto as a new asset class, one to add next to stocks, bonds and commodities in their clients' portfolios. But for the time being at least, while early-adopting retail players of varying size still dominate the crypto community, this ""asset class,"" if it can be called that, is going to behave in a very different way from others.  That's because, for now at least, when you buy bitcoin, ether or other pure cryptocurrencies, you're not just buying a piece of real estate or a claim on a company's equity, you're buying into an idea.  And that idea, one that's supported by a very motivated, enthusiastic—if not always rational – community, supports a paradigm that would see these very same intermediating institutions removed from the economy.  I feel Wall Street analysts are going to have a hard time grappling with that contradiction. There will be a lot of surprises. And surprises create volatility.

42429865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wzh,1540810845,Bitcoin Could End October With 2018's First Year-Over-Year Decline,"With prices trading sideways around $6,400 for the 10th day straight, bitcoin (BTC) risks reporting a yearly loss for its 10th birthday.  The leading cryptocurrency, which turns a decade old this Wednesday, has been flatlined below $6,500 since Oct. 19 and is showing no signs of life with volatility readings at multi-month lows.  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,414, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) – up 4.46 percent on a yearly basis.  Because BTC was trading above $6,400 on Oct. 31, 2017, annual performance would turn negative if the lateral trading continues for another 48 hours.  Further, the year-on-year losses would deepen if the cryptocurrency fails to pick up a bid next month, as, in November 2017, prices witnessed a sharp rally to levels above $8,000 on speculation that the launch of the first BTC futures would open the doors for the world's yield-hungry institutional investors.  Both Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) did launch futures contract in December. However, the institutional money is still largely waiting at the gates – a situation that may change if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves BTC exchange-traded funds in the coming months.  BTC topped out around $20,000 in December 2017 but has dropped significantly this year. However, many believe the cryptocurrency has charted a bottom at around $6,000 in the last four months, although a bullish reversal is seen only above the September high of $7,400.

In a deal signed last Thursday, the firm took a majority ownership stake in the exchange. Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič will retain a minority ownership stake and continue running the startup's operations. The terms of the deal, including the sale price, were not disclosed.  Bitstamp backer Pantera Capital will also retain a 6 percent ownership stake in the exchange, according to statements, and Bitstamp will continue to operate independently.  NXMH's parent company, NXC, also owns the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit. NXC owns Nexon, a maker of popular games for both desktop and mobile platforms. Public filings released earlier this year had linked NXC and Bitstamp.  Bitstamp's customers will not see any immediate change in services, Kodrič told CoinDesk. The exchange has an existing roadmap for improvement, which it intends to stick to for the time being. During negotiations with NXMH, the investment firm essentially agreed with Bitstamp's goals, he said.  ""We realized very early on that our outlook for the crypto industry is very much aligned with them,"" he explained. ""They've given us a lot of confidence that our execution will proceed … They understand the industry.""  NXMH and Bitstamp will continue to work to ""bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto,"" a goal that Bitstamp has been working toward for several years already, Kodrič said.  He added:  ""Unlike some of our competitors who take more of a lax approach, we want to [set standards] … We've already taken the regulatory framework seriously starting back in 2014, we started doing [know-your-customer] before it was an industry standard. All of it comes down to us viewing crypto as being a spark of everyday life.""  In a statement, NXMH investment manager Hendrik Ghys said, ""Bitstamp is one of the oldest and most-respected cryptocurrency exchanges and we see positive growth potential as the industry continues to evolve ... We acquired Bitstamp because we see it as a strategic, long-term investment.""  Looking ahead  According to the companies, Bitstamp will focus on improving user experience, customer service, trading functions and other operations, as well as maintaining a secure trading environment.  Speaking to concerns about issues withdrawing funds, Kodrič noted that a number of corresponding banks began freezing or examining cryptocurrency-related transactions over the past few months, and mitigating customer impact is ""a continuous process.""  Similarly, the exchange is working to prevent its order books from displaying large amounts of volatility, he said.  Earlier this month, a number of Reddit users commented on rapid bitcoin price fluctuations on the exchange, noting that the cryptocurrency's price changed by as much as 28 percent over a few minutes.  Preventing this sort of issue in the future is ""on the top priority list,"" Kodrič said. He explained that ""there was a one client where its trading algorithm made some irrational choices and effectively triggered a couple of large orders on the market, which was later frozen.""  ""It was a mistake [by] the client, that cost them some money. As a part of some of the changes on the road map ... specifically tied to technical improvements, we'll [fix this],"" he said.

The group's crypto asset segment, which reflects the Coincheck business, brought in revenue of 315 million yen, about $2.8 million, between July and September. Notably, that number represents a 66 percent decline compared to the previous quarter, during which Coincheck made about $8.4 million in revenue.  Although the costs for the past three months in the crypto segment have been reduced, Monex said the consequence of the hack led to an increased loss, which went up from $2.3 million in Q2 to $5.25 million (588 million Japanese yen) between July and September.  ""Since the service suspension in January 2018, Coincheck only allowed existing customers to sell their cryptocurrency,"" the report states.  In total, the group has made losses of about $7.5 million since its acquisition of the cryptocurrency exchange.  Back in January, hackers stole some $520 million worth of cryptocurrencies from Coincheck, which led to on-site inspections by regulators and a block on accepting new customers. Monex Group later acquired the platform in April in a $33.5 million deal.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, Coincheck has about $4 million in trading volume on the platform over the past 24 hours.  With about 1.7 million users, Monex Group said Coincheck is currently working on building more complex and secure internal control and security measures in its bid to become a licensed exchange in Japan.

42402103,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OVs,1540800019,The Race to Replace Tether (In 3 Charts),"The crypto market has a dominant stablecoin, make no mistake.  Tether, which aims to keep its token (called tether or USDT) at parity with the U.S. dollar by backing each token with $1 in bank deposits, accounts for the vast majority of the stablecoin market by total value, exchange volume and other metrics.  But the market has begun to show signs of anxiety around tether, centering on the firm's access to banking services and its claims to have fully collateralized the outstanding tether supply.  The token has not traded at $1 with any consistency since early October. It hit a low of $0.85 on one market on Oct. 15, and while the exchange rate has largely recovered, it still lags below target, trading at $0.99 Sunday, according to CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, several rival stablecoins have arrived on the market, including – just since September – Circle's USD Coin (USDC), the Paxos Standard Token (PAX) and the Gemini Dollar (GUSD). Older rivals include TrustToken's TrueUSD (TUSD) and Maker's Dai (DAI).  As one might expect in such a perfect storm, tether has begun to lose some market share to these competitors in the week and a half since it broke the buck, data analyzed by CoinDesk shows. Yet while TUSD and USDC have made the biggest inroads, the data shows no clear winner at this stage, and tether remains firmly on top.  All these coins are vying for a critical role in the crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins, in theory, allow traders to move money between exchanges quickly – without having to rely on access to traditional banking. They also allow traders to move their funds into a less risky asset during times of heightened volatility, without having to withdraw funds from an exchange.  Below we dive into the data.  Market capitalization  There are several ways to measure market share for stablecoins, none of them perfect indicators. One is simply by looking at the market capitalization, which, when the asset is supposed to trade 1-for-1 with fiat, should be about the same as the overall supply.  ""Tether has definitely lost market share in terms of the supply of USD allocated to different stablecoins,"" Nic Carter, creator of the blockchain data site Coinmetrics, told CoinDesk. TUSD and USDC, he added, have been ""the major beneficiaries.""  Indeed, according to Coinmetrics data analyzed by CoinDesk, tether's market capitalization as a share of the broader stablecoin market has steadily declined, with most of that decline coming from a reduction in tether supply (a token's market capitalization is equal to its price multiplied by its total supply).  ""Prior to the run,"" Carter said, referring to a period in mid-October when tether's exchange rate dipped below $0.93 according to CoinMarketCap, ""tether consisted of about 94 percent of the total supply in stablecoins; that collapsed to 83 percent after the run.""  But it's important not to overstate the competitive implications of that collapse. The primary reason for this shift is that Bitfinex – a cryptocurrency exchange that shares executives and owners with Tether – has sent 780 million USDT to a company-controlled wallet known as the Tether Treasury since Oct. 14.  This process, which the company (controversially) refers to as ""redemption,"" removes tokens from the supply and therefore reduces the market capitalization, which has fallen to around $1.9 billion from a peak of nearly $2.8 billion in September.  Hence, reductions in tether's supply haven't benefited rival stablecoins as much as might be assumed, Carter noted. ""It looks like some USDT that were redeemed did not, in fact, flow into other competitors, but simply exited to BTC or fiat.""  Volume  Another way to gauge stablecoin market share is to look at what's happening at cryptocurrency exchanges.  Unsurprisingly, during and shortly after the ""run,"" a number of exchanges – including OKEx and Huobi – rushed to list alternatives to tether.  Yet Coinmetrics' data shows only a slight increase in trading volume for tether alternatives over the course of October, and from a tiny base (note that the vertical axis ranges from 96 percent to 100 percent, and tether remains clearly dominant by this metric):  ""Exchange volume is small for alternatives because traders aren't really accustomed to them yet,"" said Carter, adding ""tether still is considered a useful (albeit risky) coin for traders to get fiat-denominated risk. It just has the accumulated financial infrastructure.""  But there's one more metric to consider: the volume of transactions on the blockchains for these stablecoins.  By this yard stick, tether alternatives have made more headway. Compared to modest on-exchange volumes, total on-chain transaction volumes were considerably higher for non-tether stablecoins throughout the month, and they appear to have increased after tether broke the buck:  All told, tether is still dominant, but competition from its many rivals is heating up.  According to Carter, however, ""it's still too early to say which competitor is best positioned to win long term.""

42402099,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OSv,1540785828,"In Korea's Ruling Party, A Lawmaker Commits to Ending the ICO Ban","This article originally appeared in CoinDesk Korea, a partnership with The Hankyoreh.      Opting to take the view ICOs are a form of fraud, speculation or gambling, the Korean government initiated a ban on the investment vehicle last September, one that sparked a strong backlash from domestic blockchain startups.  Still, some Korean lawmakers from the opposition party have piggybacked on these concerns and are advocating for the legalization of ICOs. In a situation where the incumbent government is struggling with economic issues, including a decline in employment and skyrocketing housing prices, it's perhaps natural the opposition party would rally behind an emerging technology to try to establish an innovative image for itself.  However, Min Byung-doo is one member of the ruling Minjoo Party who has spoken out in favor of ICOs through a query submitted to the government, an unusual step for a prominent figure in the ruling party in that it doesn't square with the government or Blue House line.  But not only is Min a leading figure, he is the Chairman of the National Policy Committee, considered the first hurdle to clear for those hoping to enact legislation on ICOs or cryptocurrency exchanges.  In an interview with CoinDesk Korea, Min expressed his thoughts on ICOs, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain industry, and their outlook in South Korea.  CoinDesk Korea: Why do you think ICOs should be permitted?  Min Byung-doo: There are some positive aspects to the regulations implemented by the government over the past year. A lot of the bubbles have burst and people have realized that this is not a market they should be recklessly rushing into. The laws have served as a big preventive injection, so even if the regulations on ICOs and exchanges were repealed, I don't think people would be jumping into these markets without careful consideration. I think the vaccine has succeeded, and it's now time to open up the market.  A number of countries including Switzerland, Malta, Estonia and Singapore have recently tried to bring ICOs within the boundaries of existing institutional frameworks, as well as France, who recently passed a new law. It seems that many countries have started focusing on the potential of ICOs.  Over the last two years, the total funds raised through ICOs were far higher than the figures for venture capital or angel investment. The trend is changing. All around the world, people are applying for blockchain-related patents and trying to come up with new business models. They believe that a new coin will emerge that takes things to the next level, and we have no reason to stand in the way of that possibility.  Anyone can found a unicorn (a company valued at more than $1 billion) or decacorn (a company valued at more than $10 billion) by making use of public blockchains. A dominating platform will eventually emerge in this market, and Korea shouldn't miss out on that opportunity.  The problem is that even though this opportunity exists, the government is still blocking ICOs on the grounds that they could lead to 'fraud, speculation or money laundering.'  CoinDesk Korea: The Office for Government Policy Coordination (OGPC) is expected to release the government's official position on ICOs in November, but Financial Services Commission head Choi Jong-gu remains opposed to ICOs.  Min Byung-doo: The OGPC and FSC reached agreement in a special consultative meeting, and both have a negative view of ICOs. It seems that the government is satisfied with the regulatory measures they put in place between last October and January, and believes that regulating is their duty.  Whether the government releases a new set of regulations on ICOs (in November) or not, they will need to listen to a wide range opinions from the industry and justify their decision with some solid evidence. And if Korea's blockchain industry fails to develop because of this, the government should be held accountable.  CoinDesk Korea: Some bills on blockchain have already been submitted to the National Assembly.  Min Byung-doo: Some of those bills are close to an outright ban on ICOs, while others are wholeheartedly devoted to promoting them. People have vastly different views on this issue. I think we are quickly running out of time.  Once the National Assembly's regular session finishes, lawmakers will start looking towards next year's general election and getting ready to campaign. The fact that the National Assembly is ignoring the desperate messages being sent by the industry is a big problem.  CoinDesk Korea: If the chairman of the National Policy Committee is in favor of ICOs, does that increase the chances that the committee will pass a law on this issue?  Min Byung-doo: Personally, I am strongly committed to this, and I hope that other lawmakers will bring their own expertise to the table and approach this issue with a strong sense of commitment as well. The FSC seems to be having a difficult time. The NPC is the committee in charge of this issue, so when I am speaking out in favor of ICOs and several dozen lawmakers have also made their voices heard through a series of debates, it places a lot of pressure on the government.  The government seems to feel a heavy burden when it comes to enacting laws or guidelines. I think they are afraid that enacting a law might come across as a tacit endorsement of crypto assets.  If you want to legislate, there is no need to enact a series of detailed provisions. You just need to focus on three key areas: the basic nature of the assets involved, duties and oversight. How should regulation differ depending on the nature of the asset? How can the government crack down on problems such as fraud, speculation and money laundering? How can regulations be used to guarantee the security of exchanges? How will white papers be verified? Will analysts be required to release regular reports? Which authority should be in charge of oversight? The only thing regulation needs to do is answer these questions.  An NPC-level public hearing or special meeting is expected to be held in November. The goal of this meeting is to hear what legal, financial and software experts have to say. Laws and guidelines should be as minimal as possible, but the deliberation prior to implementing such measures needs to be thorough and in-depth.  Accordingly, the National Assembly is planning to collate their views and urge the government to take action, whether that be through laws or guidelines.  CoinDesk Korea: Doesn't the FSC or the Blue House hold the key when it comes to this issue?  Min Byung-doo: At present, the OGPC is the control tower that manages task forces on cryptocurrencies across all government departments. I am aware that some officials at the Blue House are also closely following this issue. It would be great if the president could just make a decision on this, but that is far from easy.  CoinDesk Korea: Bitcoin was created in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, while blockchain is rooted in the philosophy of decentralization. Isn't it only natural that the government takes a negative view of such technology?  Min Byung-doo: I don't think that cryptocurrencies would be able to avoid financial oversight. I don't think that's the case. I think the future brought about by decentralization or disintermediation would be bad at all.  Some governments may take a very passive stance while other countries will adopt a more active approach. But if some governments are actively trying to promote blockchain technology and this leads to the creation of globally dominant platforms like Amazon or Alipay, then will passive governments be able to stand in their way? If they can't do anything in response, they will end up being colonized economically. Governments need to take action to ensure that they don't get left behind in this competition.  CoinDesk Korea: What do you think of the 'special blockchain zones' being proposed by local governments such as Jeju?  Min Byung-doo: From the government's perspective, there is no difference between permitting ICOs in special designated zones and allowing them across the whole country. Once the government has passed laws or guidelines, it will be possible for special zones to explore suitable models for development, but right now it is difficult to envision such a zone being granted special permission in advance.

42402092,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OL3,1540778466,Taiwanese Lawmaker Proposes New Business Category for Crypto Startups,"Taiwan's ""Crypto Congressman"" continued his push for more modernized regulation around the tech by proposing new rules for token sales.  On Friday, Taiwanese legislator Jason Hsu published a list of policy recommendations aimed at aiding cryptocurrency startups, including one that would see the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) create a new business category, as well as a new legal framework for security tokens.  Hsu also called for the Taiwanese legislature's Finance Committee to issue guidelines for initial coin offerings (ICOs) with a focus on consumer protection. His proposal comes just days after the nation's financial regulator announced it would set up ICO regulations within the next eight months.  The Taipei Times reported last week that Financial Supervisory Commission chairman Wellington Koo has told the committee that ""national standards"" for how ICOs should be conducted would be completed by June of next year.  He announced that these standards would likely outline how tokens may be classified as securities, but notably added that cryptocurrencies being used to purchase goods or act in a manner unrelated to securities offering would not fall under the new regulations.  Hsu's proposed framework would go further, requiring the MOEA to develop new consumer protection and taxation guidelines, according to Friday's press release.  He also suggested a specific proposal for security token offerings (STOs) based on the French Commercial Growth and Transformation Act and the U.S. Howey Test. If signed into law, his proposal would clarify which token sales would fall under the nation's Securities and Exchange Act. STOs could also fall under equity crowd-funding rules and related laws, Hsu's release noted.
