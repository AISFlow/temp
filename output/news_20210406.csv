42386431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuZZ,1617746621,"Q1 2021: Institutional Growth Slows Down, Retail Ramps Up","The ""Quarterly Review 2021"" by CoinDesk Research looks at driving trends in crypto markets, focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi and more.      While the industry growth of Q4 2020 was driven largely by institutional participation in the asset markets and infrastructure, Q1 2021 told a more nuanced story. Activity from institutional investors seems to be slowing down but they are still key, and several of the quarter’s milestones point to that continuing for the next few months at least. However, certain metrics show that interest from retail investors and traders is picking up, bringing in new flows and investment patterns.      Let’s look at some of the details:    Market milestones    First, bitcoin’s market cap crossed $1 trillion in Q1. This is significant in that many institutional investors will not even consider an asset group until it is of sufficient size to merit the attention, and $1 trillion is a strong psychological level. So, institutional investors are more likely to dedicate resources to investigating and learning about bitcoin than they were in 2020.    Exchange volumes tell a story    They’re not doing so en masse just yet, though. The surge in trading volume from exchanges the institutions would typically use (LMAX Digital, Coinbase and others) trailed off in Q1, with declines across most.    Open interest growth points to increasing leverage    BTC futures trading volumes was more or less flat in Q1, with occasional spikes. Open interest, however, continued to grow, pointing to increasing leverage which can be taken as a sign of increasing trading (rather than investing) activity.    CME overtaken    It can also be seen in the shifting ranking of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in terms of open interest (OI). In January, it reached position #1, with the highest OI in the market. Its OI has continued to grow, but more retail-focused exchanges with higher leverage such as Binance and Bybit have since accelerated and overtaken it.    Spot vs. futures volumes    Another metric backing this up is the ratio of spot to futures volumes. Institutional and long-term investors tend to favor spot exchanges, so when this ratio starts to decline, it can be taken as another point of evidence that traders are starting to account for more market activity.    Transaction growth trails off    Moving to on-chain data, the Q4 surge in transaction count and total value transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain trailed off in Q1, hinting at greater holding behavior. The growth in average transaction size in USD leveled off, even in the face of continued price increases, indicating more small-holder participation.    Small investors pick up activity    The increased participation of small investors can also be seen in the growth in bitcoin addresses. The number of non-zero addresses continued to soar in Q1, while those holding over 1,000 BTC fell, showing that the bulk of the growth was from small holdings. The number of active addresses (those sending and/or receiving in any given day) held relatively constant over the quarter, hinting that most of the new entrants are buying to hold.    Velocity continues to slow    The tendency to hold bitcoin rather than trade or transact is also seen in the resumed decline of bitcoin’s velocity, defined as the trailing 12-month transaction volume divided by the current supply.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/06/q1-2021-institutional-growth-slows-down-retail-ramps-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df19fb64c0904c3afde83a4800bbcc74e0d0b85f-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386413,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuEB,1617746117,Japan’s BitFlyer Has a New President – Again,"Tokyo-headquartered global cryptocurrency firm bitFlyer has a new president – for the third time in two years.      According to an announcement, the new president, Goldman Sachs alum Kuniyoshi Hayashi, replaced outgoing President Kimihiro Mine on March 30.      bitFlyer is the leading digital assets exchange in Japan, with over 2.5 million users worldwide. IT is licensed in Japan, the U.S. and the European Union.      The firm first replaced its co-founder and president, Yuzo Kano, with Yoshio Hirako in January 2019. Five months later, Hirako was replaced by Mine.      In addition to Hayashi's appointment, bitFlyer also introduced two new members to the board of directors: Masaaki Seki was named director while Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer at bitFlyer USA, became the first non-Japanese director of the global firm.      This latest change in management signaled instability within the firm, prompting Asian business publication Nikkei to observe that bitFlyer was wandering off course.      But Edgerton told CoinDesk the latest company reshuffle was part of bitFlyer’s larger strategy to go global, and that the timing for the changes was not random.      “In Japan, the fiscal year ends at the end of March. Whenever we make changes, it tends to be at this time. ... So the timing’s actually normal for us and discussions have been going on for quite a while internally,” Edgerton said.      According to Edgerton, bitFlyer founder Kano stepped away in 2019 so the firm could quickly respond to the regulatory changes taking place in Japan’s crypto space.      The country’s financial authority FSA doubled down on regulations for crypto exchanges in 2018 after Japanese digital assets exchange Coincheck suffered the largest cryptocurrency hack in history, confirming that around $533 million was stolen from the exchange. Soon after the incident, the FSA temporarily suspended two crypto exchanges (including Coincheck) and expanded the team that handled exchange licensing.      “The Japanese government started going to different cryptocurrency companies, basically telling them, ‘OK, you guys need to be more like traditional finance companies, and you need to have this type of structure and regulations and controls in place.’ So we had to make a change to do that,” Edgerton said referring to the management shuffle in 2019.      But now that the firm is licensed and fully compliant with local regulations, bitFlyer is looking to focus on expanding its global influence, Edgerton says. He added that bitFlyer’s hyperfocus on the Japanese market has created a strong crypto payments system in the country that can be used as a model elsewhere.      “You can go into a bookstore in Japan and get loyalty points linked to your bitFlyer account and crypto. You can also go into electronic stores and buy electronics using crypto in Japan. So these types of real-world use cases that are not really tied to trading, per se, are things we also want to roll out to the rest of the world,” Edgerton said.      The new president, Hayashi, a University of Tokyo graduate who worked at Goldman Sachs Japan, has “international experience,” according to Edgerton, which he says is a key point. He said his own addition to the board of directors (as the first non-Japanese executive) signals how serious bitFlyer is about establishing itself as a global entity.      Although Kano – also a University of Tokyo and Goldman Sachs alum – is no longer president of the firm, he remains chief executive officer of bitFlyer USA and chairman of the European branch of the company.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/06/japans-bitflyer-has-a-new-president-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49d042850d035db1d3d1ba0c97a5fc9c5bf170c8-1500x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuTH,1617743982,"Crypto Won't Be Money Until IRS Accepts It for Taxes, Top Forex Strategist Says","Just because bitcoin has quintupled in value over the past few months, that doesn’t mean the U.S. dollar is about to get knocked off its perch as the world’s leading currency, according to a top foreign exchange analyst.      For one thing, central banks around the globe own roughly $3.1 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury debt that is denominated in greenbacks, and so have little incentive to let the dollar lose power to a cryptocurrency, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.      “What stands behind [the U.S. dollar] is something that the crypto space has not yet innovated and that is that central banks hold their dollars in Treasury bonds – not just in dollars but they have these Treasury bonds behind them,” Chandler said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show Tuesday.      Chandler, whose storied career included stints as the top FX strategist at such leading financial institutions as Mellon Bank, HSBC and Brown Brothers Harriman, said his view is in line with those of regulators. He noted that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently remarked that he sees cryptocurrencies as a potential substitute for gold.      But as a replacement for the dollar? Not so much.      “It doesn't look like it's really money,” said Chandler, “meaning, a means of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.”      However, he said there’s one way he could change his mind.      “For me, the smell test of all this will be when tax officials, when the [U.S. Internal Revenue Service] says, ‘Yes, you can pay your taxes in crypto.’ Taxes seem to be the origin of money in many ways,” said Chandler. “When the IRS or some other major tax authorities say you can pay your taxes in crypto, then I’ll believe it's money.”    Cyclical, not secular    While Chandler doesn’t classify himself as a dollar bull, he doesn’t see it losing its top spot, notwithstanding a recent weakening in exchange rates against foreign currencies.      “We're having a correction,” he said. “The third big dollar rally since the Bretton Woods [Agreement of 1944] is over, but I think you can have a cyclical decline of the dollar without it changing its fundamental position in the world economy.”      Although central banks in countries such as China may be looking at digitizing their currencies, not much would threaten the greenback’s position, according to Chandler.      On the one hand, “a digital central bank currency increases what we call ‘the C3’: command, control and communication,” he said. “It allows the Chinese government to better monitor the flows of money. ... It will help curb tax evasion, for example. It will help curb the underground economy, which in some countries is very substantial. At the same time, it will help bank people who are not banked yet.”      However, “I'm still not convinced that because you can have a digital chip on your cell phone that really only works in the Chinese system, that can take your digital RMB and buy something, like in the United States, or buy or settle or even trade with"" a digital yuan, he said. “It's possible at some point in the future, but it doesn't seem likely anytime soon.”      Thus, Chandler said he’s “not sure how much of a race this is or how urgent it is. It doesn't look like Fed officials, while they are studying it, I don't see them wanting to necessarily be the first mover.”      Nonetheless, “I think also there'll be a two-pronged system, at least the way the U.S. and Western Europe are conceiving it, where you'd have the digital currency not really disintermediating banks. They'll strengthen banks.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/06/crypto-wont-be-money-until-irs-accepts-it-for-taxes-top-forex-strategist-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6036a452976e53d651692b84a7ccb5cf7645d31e-1780x1179.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Slipping 1.31% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $57,421.85-$59,484.20 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades below its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.  Bitcoin's futures premium creeps back up  Recently, bitcoin’s price movements have been less exciting than the triple- and sometimes quadruple-digit-percentage gains witnessed in alternative cryptocurrencies, or “altcoins.”  The No. 1 cryptocurrency has traded in a narrow range between $56,552 and $60,102 over the past week, while ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has climbed more than 20% to a new all-time high over $2,100.  But in the past couple of weeks, traders in bitcoin derivative markets have been ratcheting up their bets on future gains.  The annualized futures premium rate – a gauge of bullish bets – has averaged 22% to 25% on retail-focused derivatives exchanges like FTX, BitMEX, Deribit and Binance. That compares with about 13% on the Chicago-based CME exchange, which tends to be more focused on institutional investors.  An increased futures premium – the spread between futures prices and spot-market prices – indicates that more retail traders are looking at upside exposure of the market despite bitcoin’s relatively flat performance lately.  “Traders are expecting higher prices and taking on long positions,” Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk.  But with the increasing bullishness comes a higher risk of a snapback: The bitcoin market experienced a total $27.5 billion worth of long position liquidation during the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the huge amount of leverage in the markets built up as the largest cryptocurrency rallied into the new year, as noted by Arcane Research in its weekly newsletter on April 6.  “It is always concerning when these futures premiums climb too high, indicating an overly confident and leveraged market,” according to Arcane. “This usually leads to rounds of liquidations and sharp pullbacks, so traders should consider de-risking in this current environment.”  Ether and altcoins  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,114.60 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 0.44% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,045.40-$2,151.25 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.  Ether and other altcoins continue to outperform bitcoin. The No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization has traded above $2,000 since it claimed a new all-time high a day ago.  Ether’s latest rally “follows Visa’s announcement that transactions can be settled using USD coin (USDC), a stablecoin powered by the Ethereum blockchain,” Simon Peters, crypto analyst at eToro, wrote in an email.  “Meanwhile, large volumes of ether are increasingly being locked into [decentralized finance] projects and the ETH 2.0 deposit contract,” Peters added. “This reduces the supply in circulation while announcements like Visa’s increase demand, thereby pushing prices higher.”  As of April 6, more than 10 million ether are locked in decentralized finance, up from about 7 million 90 days ago, according to DeFi Pulse:  At the same time, blockchain data site Glassnode shows that nearly 4 million ether has staked on Eth 2.0:  Other digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly higher Tuesday.

All those users helped Coinbase rake in $1.8 billion over the quarter, driving a net income of approximately $730 million to $800 million, according to a new filing that comes ahead of the company's Nasdaq listing next week.      All the numbers point to a business riding high as interest in cryptocurrency tracks upward with the price of bitcoin, ether and other leading assets.      For example:    Active users on Coinbase jumped from 2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 6.1 million in the first quarter of 2021.  Verified users – or the total number of people with Coinbase accounts – increased from 43 million at the end of 2020 to 56 million at the end of Q1 2021.  Trading volumes topped $335 billion in Q1. For all of 2020, trading volume was $193 billion.  Total assets on Coinbase's platform increased from $90 billion to $223 billion, nearly a 150% increase quarter-over-quarter.    Showing how solidly Coinbase has cemented itself at the center of the current bull run, some $122 billion of those assets were from institutions.    Read more: On Coinbase’s First Earnings Call, Here’s What Analysts Are Listening For    On the retail side, the company will be adding more assets and giving people more access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said during Tuesday's earnings call.      On the institutional side, the company will continue to build out its prime brokerage offering and use its Bison Trails acquisition to create what Armstrong called the ""Amazon Web Services for crypto.""      The exchange also gave three financial scenarios for the rest of 2021.      In a ""high"" performance scenario, Coinbase would average 7 million monthly users if the crypto market capitalization grows throughout the rest of the year. In a ""mid"" scenario, the exchange would average 5.5 million monthly users if the market capitalization is flat. In a ""low"" scenario, the exchange would average 4 million if the market turns into something like the 2018 bear market.      ""For the last two years we've seen average net revenue per [monthly transacting user] range between $34 and $45 per month,"" Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas said on the call. Haas said she expects the average net revenue per user to reach new records in 2021.      Coinbase's new cohort of stock analysts were particularly keen on user metrics, as CoinDesk reported earlier today.      ""The first quarter more than doubled monthly users sequentially and revenue followed three times higher than the previous quarter,"" James Friedman, senior fintech research analyst at Susquehanna International Group, told CoinDesk after Coinbase's earnings call, adding:    ""How do you have users doubling and growth three times that?

The lengthy report alleges that of the roughly $375 million the mining machine manufacturer raised from investors since going public in June 2020, some $103 million went toward “bond purchases linked to its U.S. underwriter.”      Shares of Ebang were down over 15% on the news.      The report also claims the company “directed $21 million to repay related-party loans to Ebang Chairman/CEO Dong Hu’s relative.” Additionally, the report says the mining machine business is faltering, only producing 6,000 machines in the first half of 2020.

42386429,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuS1,1617739804,"Topps, Going Public at $1.3B Valuation, Charts NFT Future","Trading card company Topps is poised to take non-fungible tokens (NFT) to Wall Street as a publicly traded firm via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Mudrick Capital.      The 80-year-old company, in which Mudrick led a $250 million investment at a $1.3 billion valuation, has long sold baseball cards and other physical collectibles. On Tuesday its new investor, Jason Mudrick, said he’s betting on the digital front through the buzzy market for NFTs.      Topps plans on chasing that upside aggressively. Closing its deal during a booming market for crypto collectibles, it told investors in a Tuesday presentation the company will reinvest in blockchain and NFTs as a “growth accelerator.”      The card company anticipates pushing more content through the blockchain pipeline, expanding NFT distribution across marketplace partners like Wax and OpenSea and integrating NFTs into more collector experiences through 2021.      “Digital currently represents 6% of Topps’ revenue,” said Joel Belfer, a financial analyst at Guggenheim who writes about sports card markets for industry newsletter Mint Condition. “It’s not a big part of their business, but I think Mudrick is going to try to accelerate their digital offering.”      Topps reported $567 million in total sales during 2020. For context, Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot steamrolled through over $500 million in NFT sales in its first 10 months.    Baby steps  Topps began carving a niche in the early innings of the NFT craze through a Garbage Pail Kidshttps://play.toppsapps.com/app/gpk-blockchain partnership with the Wax platform. That tie-up continues: Last week it dropped a ""Godzilla""-themed NFT card pack on Wax that generated at least $500,000 in revenue within hours.    Mudrick told Institutional Investor he wants Topps to monetize the secondary market for NFTs. Because NFTs have no physical form they can, theoretically, be restricted to private blockchain platforms where their movement is restricted and their secondary sales essentially taxed.      Dapper Labs follows this model – it takes a 5% cut of each moment sale – though other leading marketplaces exist on the fee-heavy wilds of the Ethereum blockchain, competing for block space with major lending markets.    Market conditions    Back in meatspace, collectors, some perhaps angry at their mothers for ditching the card-stuffed shoebox they claim was worth millions, have poured six-figure sums into throwback cards during the coronavirus pandemic.      Bringing a blockchain-sanctioned secondary market to digital collectibles could position Topps to take on a major new revenue stream. Dapper Labs recently raised $305 million from splashy investors to seize the moment.      Read more: Michael Jordan Joins $305M Investment in Firm Behind NBA Top Shot      Topps’ top brass told investors the company has been investing in digital for more than a decade, in part through pre-NFT digital collectible platforms like Major League Baseball-licensed Topps BUNT. It is unclear how popular that walled-garden project is among baseball fans. (Blockchain data sites like Evaluate.market lay bare the value of NBA Top Shot moments in real-time.)      Topps’ foray into blockchain and NFTs is barely a year old, however.      “Ending up as a leader in this area will still require quite a bit of vigilance and investment, but we like our head start,” Topps Executive Chairman Andy Redman said during the presentation. He said the blockchain initiatives pairs well with the company’s efforts in e-commerce, “further cementing our position in the sports ecosystem of the future.”      But Belfer, the card analyst, said Topps won’t be able to simply carry its existing physical collectible licenses with major leagues like MLB or the National Football League into the digital world. The company will likely have to broker new digital-specific business deals, as Dapper Labs did with the National Basketball Association.      That could be an expensive proposition, he said.

The prior week had seen the fund flows dry up to about $21 million, the lowest since October, as sideways trading action in bitcoin (BTC) and other digital-asset markets failed to inspire buyers.      The latest week's tally wrapped up a record quarter for crypto fund flows, at $4.5 billion, some 11% higher than in the final quarter of 2020, according to CoinShares.      That pace represented a slowdown from the prior quarter's growth of 240%, potentially indicating waning interest or indecision among digital asset investors – or maybe just the difficulty of increasing off a bigger base. CoinShares cautioned against drawing conclusions.    “It is not indicative of a slowing trend, as quarterly growth rates tend to be highly varied,” wrote CoinShares.  Bitcoin products garnered the majority of last week's inflows, around $83 million, versus about $20 million for Ethereum products.  “Assets under management (AUM) for both active and passive digital asset investment products are now at an all-time high of $59 billion.”  Active investment managers (strategies that adjust portfolio weightings based on market conditions rather than following an index) make up a decreasing amount of total AUM, to 1.5% of total AUM during the first quarter versus 3.6% in Q4 2020.

42386417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuGh,1617737892,Chinese Lottery Firm Furthers Crypto Pivot by Buying Bitcoin Miner Maker for $100M,"Chinese online lottery company 500.com (NYSE: WBAI) has acquired Bee Computing, a Hong Kong-registered maker of bitcoin mining machines, for $100 million, according to a filing Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      500.com, which changed its name to BIT Mining Limited in March, has been quietly shifting its focus from its struggling online lottery business to bitcoin mining over the last four years. The company accelerated that transition late last year amid bitcoin’s historic bull run, making it one of many publicly traded companies trying to profit for bitcoin's rising price.      It is now one of the few large-scale companies in the crypto-mining business after acquiring the third-largest mining pool, BTC.com, and three mining farms under its Loto Interactive unit. The company is venturing into the business of making mining machines with the latest deal, which comes at a time when mining companies are in short supply of those machines.      BIT Mining said Bee Computing has worked with MTK, which is the largest chip designer in Asia, to make a seven-nanometer chip for bitcoin mining. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will supply the chips, according to Yufei Jiang, CEO of Bee Computing.      Read more: Bitcoin Hashrate Surpasses All-Time High as Even 2014 ASICs Stay Profitable      Jiang said Bee Computing has received backing from some of the most influential companies in the semiconductor industry. MTK invested $9.5 million in a Series B round, and Taiwan-based ASE Group, which is the leading semiconductor assembly and test company, invested $3 million in the same round.      Bee Computing’s current miner model’s performance is similar to Bitmain’s T17, which tends to have higher energy consumption than Bitmain’s S17 but is less powerful than Bitmain’s latest model S19.      Jiang said Bee Computing's research and development slowed down during the bear market a few years ago but the company can pick up the pace with new capital from BIT Mining.      BIT Mining is set to invest $30 million in Bee Computing’s research to develop better 7-nm chips for bitcoin mining and higher quality miners for ether and litecoin. Jiang said the company would be able to test new chips by October.      Crypto miners use the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which is an integrated circuit chip, to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The 7-nm figure refers to the size of the transistor. The smaller the component is, the more you can fit into a piece of silicon and the more powerful the mining machine becomes, making the chip one of the most sought-after components for any major bitcoin miner maker.      To put that into context, leading crypto mining machine maker Bitmain’s latest model uses 7-nm chips. Designing stable and high-performance chips for mining machines is very costly and challenging even for some big players in the semiconductor industry, according to Jiang.      While Bitmain is studying new models that use 5-nm chips, it may prove to be difficult to manufacture these because TSMC would make most of the chips for car makers or cellphone companies such as Apple.      Bee Computing produces much less annually than Bitmain does, because of the fixed number of 7-nm chips TSMC allocates to each maker of mining equipement. In the near future, Bee Computing plans to provide all the new mining machines to BIT Mining until it has a surplus to sell.      Read more: Oil and Gas Miner Teams With Canadian Tech Firm for Green Bitcoin Mining    BIT Mining had disclosedhttps://xueqiu.com/4200002996/176325535?sharetime=2 that it purchased $8.5 million worth of mining machines in February from Bee Computing.    According to the purchase agreement, BIT Mining will pay Bee Computing $35 million in stock by the end of the second quarter this year and send the other $65 million worth of stock after the acquired company manages to produce a certain number of 7nm ASIC bitcoin mining machines as well as make higher performance bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin mining machines.      BIT Mining officially announced its strategic shift to bitcoin mining in December. In February, the company bought the crypto mining mining pool business, BTC.com, from Bitdeer Technologies, which was majority owned by Bitmain’s former chief executive Jihan Wu. It has purchased at least $14 million in mining machines in an all-equity deal.      Combined with the existing mining pool services provided by BIT Mining’s subsidiary Loto Interactive, the company would be one of the largest mining pools in the world, according to data from BTC.com.      Loto Interactive has three big data centers in the crypto mining hub Sichuan province in central China because of Sichuan's rich hydropower in the summer. Loto Interactive previously only provided venues and maintenance services, rather than buying mining machines and profiting from mining cryptocurrencies. The company has started running its own miners early this year.      If a company only operates a mining site for miners to make a profit, it does not have much exposure to crypto’s prices, It would face more price-related risks and could stand to profit more if it starts to buy mining machines and run them in its own mining sites.

42386420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuHx,1617736193,"On Coinbase’s First Earnings Call, Here’s What Analysts Are Listening For","Coinbase is getting ready for the spotlight.      The cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco (but not) is voluntarily reporting its first-quarter earnings Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. ET ahead of a much-anticipated public listing on Nasdaq slated for April 14.      In advance of the COIN ticker going live, analysts are eager to discover Coinbase’s user growth numbers over the past quarter.      “We need to know what [its] assumption is about monthly active users and revenue per user,” James Friedman, senior fintech research analyst at Susquehanna International Group, told CoinDesk. “The bears will argue that this is a trading company ... there are only 80 million stock brokerage accounts in the U.S. and 20% of those people trade less than once a year.”    Read more: Coinbase’s COIN Stock to Go Live on Nasdaq April 14    The fourth quarter of 2020 was the first time Coinbase had as many active monthly users (2.8 million) as it did in the first quarter of 2018 (2.7 million), said Friedman. As of the close of 2020, the exchange touted 43 million registered users.      Because the bulk of the company’s transactional revenue comes from retail users, the most relevant financial metric to look out for will be how many verified users have made the jump to being monthly transacting users – users who have an account versus those that are trading regularly.    The Coinbase-bitcoin connection    Coinbase noted several times in its prospectus that the company’s growth correlated with the price of bitcoin. According to CoinDesk Research, bitcoin had a 100% return in Q1 2020 and a market capitalization that surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in its history.      “We’re hoping to get a better picture of how bitcoin’s price is correlated to user growth,” Arca research analyst Alex Woodard said.      With only 1,100 staffers at Coinbase, the firm’s margins are wide, even with Arca modeling a 50% increase in general administration/customer service costs in the first quarter.      “We’re [still] seeing an operating margin of 75%,” said Arca COO Michael Dershewitz.    Beyond retail    One issue where the exchange has been tight-lipped is on future projections for the spread between institutional trading versus retail trading, Arca’s Woodard added.      Coinbase will likely address its growth in prime brokerage and other subscription services that can serve the exchange in a bear market and how it plans to grow its international customer base, which is small compared to its U.S. user count.      On the institutional side, Coinbase has confirmed that it serves MicroStrategy and One River – with others clients such as Tesla and hedge fund giant Paul Tudor Jones dribbling out in press reports.    Read more: Coinbase and Bakkt Are Behind Paul Tudor Jones’ Bitcoin Bets, SEC Documents Show    Beyond Coinbase’s first-quarter earnings call, analysts will also struggle to determine what will drive the price of the Coinbase stock when it does list, Friedman said.      If a bitcoin exchange-traded fund is not approved by the time it lists, Coinbase’s stock could be seen as a proxy bitcoin ETF – similar to MicroStrategy’s stock. Therefore, the price of COIN stock could be decoupled from the business’ fundamentals.      “If looking for synthetic exposure to bitcoin, it will probably be the purest play to do it outside of [Grayscale Bitcoin Trust],” Woodward said. “This is a much purer bet on crypto than a MicroStrategy.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/06/on-coinbases-first-earnings-call-heres-what-analysts-are-listening-for,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4e78a1daadff82381303fcedd0e1c84d61e68c6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuQl,1617736170,Bitcoin Hashrate Surpasses All-Time High as Even 2014 ASICs Stay Profitable,"Bitcoin’s hashrate – a way to measure the total power consumption and mining output of the network – has topped a new all-time high.      The current mean hashrate of the Bitcoin network is 179.4 exahashes per second, according to data from Coin Metrics.      Ethan Vera, the CTO of North American mining firm Luxor, told CoinDesk the all-time high comes during a scramble for the semiconductor chips that power ASICs, along with a scramble for the machines themselves.      “The run up in bitcoin price paired with a shortage on ASIC chips has caused mining economics to turn favorably to miners, with many miners running at 85%+ mining margins,” he said.      “Miners are trying to get their hands on every machine possible, and even ASICs launched in 2014 are profitable. All of Luxor’s clients have all of their rigs plugged in and hashing including their oldest machines. There is little to no idle hashrate out there.”      Building on Vera’s comments, the all-time high is partly driven by previously backordered ASIC shipments finally reaching their North American buyers. Bitcoin’s mining industry has enjoyed surging growth over the past year, as big players continue to finance bulk orders of ASIC miners to the tune of the tens of thousands of units.

42386433,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuX3,1617734937,Bitcoin Analysts Say 'Kimchi Premium' Isn't Distress Signal It Once Was,"A popular bitcoin market indicator known as the “kimchi premium” is signaling a retail frenzy in South Korea historically observed when prices are peaking.      But this time might be different, analysts say – possibly the result of the dramatic growth and maturation witnessed in cryptocurrency markets over the past few years.      The kimchi premium represents the difference between bitcoin's price on South Korean exchanges and the going rate on other global trading venues. The reasons for the discrepancy are complicated, but they ultimately stem from trading limitations unique to the country’s exchanges and the existence of domestic capital controls.      Historically, spikes in the Korean premium have taken the wind out of the bull runs, according to data tweeted by Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde. The metric peaked at 47% in January 2018 and 63% in May 2017, just prior to market corrections, but it has also marked tops at minor price peaks at 6.5% in November 2018 and 8.5% in June 2019.      Lately, the premium has risen to 18%, the highest since February 2018, according to data source CryptoQuant.      And although bitcoin prices have doubled this year, the Korean spread shows no signs of peaking yet. It's impossible to say whether the premium is about to reach a top, or if will continue increasing. Besides, South Korea is no longer the crypto heavyweight it was during the last major market cycle in 2017-2018.      ""The Korean market contributed to 7.9% of the worldwide crypto trading volume in 2017,"" Ki-Young Ju, CEO of the South Korea-based CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “Now it accounts for less than 2%.""      ""Hence, an eventual collapse of the premium is unlikely to have a significant impact on the broader market,"" Ju said.      Bitcoin fell over 49% in one month after the kimchi premium peaked on Jan. 8, 2018, and remained in a bear market till the end of the year. The cryptocurrency suffered notable price drops following peak premiums observed in mid-November 2018 and at the end of January 2019.      And while the previous crypto fever in South Korea was primarily fueled by investors belonging to the age group of 20 to 30, the latest frenzy has seen equal participation from Koreans in their 40s and 50s, as discussed last month by The Diplomat, a magazine covering politics, society and culture in the Indo-Pacific region.      ""Through cryptocurrency and stock market transactions, South Koreans – young and old – are actively seeking to secure steady streams of passive income,"" The Diplomat reported. ""Increasingly, after COVID-19, both of these age groups seem to be alarmed by fears of monetary inflation followed by the government's stimulus packages, skyrocketing real estate prices, and stagnating wages in the extremely competitive job market.”      So the latest uptick in interest in cryptocurrencies in South Korea might be more sustainable, not just speculative, fervor.      Still, a minor pullback cannot be ruled out.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $58,000, down 2% on the day. Prices have been restricted to a narrow range of $55,000 to $60,000 since the end of March.    What is Kimchi premium?    Executing a classic arbitrage strategy by buying bitcoin on western exchanges and selling the same on Korean exchanges at a relatively higher price is quite challenging.      That's because the Korean market is served by local exchanges that provide Korean won (KRW) fiat trading pairs, and local users do not trade cryptocurrencies using tether (USDT) or BTC most of the time, as per Binance Research.      Therefore, a Korean wanting to ""arb"" the premium has to first buy a token with KRW that could be exchanged for USDT or other stablecoin, which then would be used to purchase bitcoin on a non-U.S. exchange. The tedious process doesn't stop here. The bitcoin will have to be transferred back to Korean exchanges for liquidation.      Also read: Coinbase and Bakkt Are Behind Paul Tudor Jones’ Bitcoin Bets, SEC Documents Show      ""The relatively long transaction confirmation time, without hedging, leaves the arbitrageur exposed to price fluctuations during the transfer,"" Binance research said in a Telegram message.      Arbing the premium at currency prices looks even more challenging if we consider the country's capital controls. ""Ordinary investors in Korea are allowed to wire up to $50,000 to other countries per year,"" CryptoQuant's Ju said, adding that regulations prohibit Korean crypto exchanges from accepting overseas clients.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/06/bitcoin-analysts-say-kimchi-premium-isnt-distress-signal-it-once-was,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/699a4bd03732eb14f96697ab603751993ec69d3b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike has been an adviser to the project since 2018.      The goal of MOB, which is based on Stellar blockchain technology, is to be able to work efficiently on mobile devices while also protecting users' privacy. The launch on Signal has long been rumored, dating back to when Facebook announced plans to launch its libra stablecoin in early 2019.      MOB stands out from a pack of messenger-native crypto coins because it has actually launched. Telegram’s TON was nuked by U.S. regulators; Facebook’s libra (now diem) remains in a state of near-completion.      At this time, the MOB payment feature will only be available to users in the U.K., and only on iOS and Android. Desktop support is not included.      ""I'm terrified for Signal,"" Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University who sits on the Zcash Foundation board, told Wired, adding:    ""Signal as an encrypted messaging product is really valuable. Speaking solely as a person who is really into encrypted messaging, it terrifies me that they're going to take this really clean story of an encrypted messenger and mix it up with the nightmare of laws and regulations and vulnerability that is cryptocurrency.""

42386428,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuUX,1617729648,"Several Stellar Nodes Go Offline, Team Says Network ‘Still Functioning’ Though Some Transactions Fail","Update: As of April 7, 2021, 18:28 UTC, according to the Stellar website, SDF horizon service has been restored and the SDF validators have been brought back online.      Some of the nodes used to validate transactions on the Stellar Lumens blockchain went offline Tuesday, reportedly leading exchanges to halt withdrawals as certain transactions failed even as others got through.      Anton Cashchin, a managing partner at U.K.-based CEX exchange, sounded the alarm when he tweeted that “several validators” went offline, leading Binance, Bitfinex and Bitstamp to halt withdrawals.      Cashchin claimed the outage disrupted transactions and exchange withdrawals, though Stellar issued a statement that “the Stellar network is still online, and transactions are continuing to be processed.”      “Around 1:00 a.m. PDT, the Stellar Development Foundation's validator nodes and the SDF's public Horizon API instance went offline … SDF's engineering team is working to determine the cause and to resolve the issue, in addition to working with all Tier 1 validators on the network,” Stellar’s blog reads.      According to public data at block explorer Stellar Expert, the network is still processing transactions, though not at a normal rate. A block validated around the time nodes fell off the network showed more than half of the submitted transactions as failed, but the network appears to have recovered as newly processed blocks indicate no failed transactions      Stellarbeat takes the pulse of the network’s node count. At press time, the website showed that more than half of Stellar’s usually active nodes are currently down.      At 6:59 a.m. ET, Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino tweeted that XLM withdrawals were paused.      Stellar’s team responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment with its official statement. It clarified that XLM transactions are being processed and the network is still up.      Nevertheless, XLM, the coin that underpins the Stellar network, fell from $0.58 to $0.51 on the news.      Notably, Coinbase is reportedly using XLM as part of its rewards debit card, which offers either 1% back on bitcoin or 4% in XLM, according to the Wall Street Journal.

42386421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuLj,1617729460,Blockchain Consultant Pleads Guilty to Extortion Charge,"Michael Hlady, an associate at blockchain consulting firm Alchemist, pleaded guilty on Monday to conspiring to extort a startup company for millions of dollars in the cryptocurrency ether. He now faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine.      According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Hlady, who also goes by the name “Michael Peters,” appeared in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., and pleaded guilty before U.S. Chief District Court Judge Margo Brodie.      Hlady and his co-conspirator, Steven Nerayoff, an early supporter of the Ethereum project and former adviser to Overstock’s tZero, allegedly issued threats to company executives, including threatening to destroy the startup if it did not agree to demands for additional funds and company tokens.      In 2019, both Nerayoff and Hlady were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In contrast to Hlady’s plea, Nerayoff has entered a plea of “not guilty” to extortion charges and is awaiting trial.      The victim company was a mobile-based startup that issued ether as loyalty rewards for generating user traffic to its clients’ products and to raise capital. The firm had planned to conduct an initial coin offering (ICO) in November 2017.      Nerayoff’s firm was tapped to advise the startup in July 2017. According to the DOJ, he began demanding larger than contractually agreed-upon ethereum payouts for his help with the company’s ICO that coming autumn.      On March 28, 2018, Hlady sent a text message to a company executive stating, in part, “I promise I will destroy your community” if the startup did not comply with the demands.      See also: Ether Price Jumps to All-Time High Near $2,100      The company under threat transferred 10,000 ETH to Nerayoff.      Commenting on the case, acting U.S. Attorney Mark Lesko said both Nerayoff and Hlady “used strong-arm tactics to shake down a startup company of cryptocurrency” and thanked the FBI for its work on the case.      “This office and its law enforcement partners are committed to protecting businesses from extortion in whatever manner it is perpetrated,” Lesko said.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/06/blockchain-consultant-pleads-guilty-to-extortion-charge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acecf4c74165da525d12245ce54f07ead543a850-1920x1061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386400,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSqAZ,1617725996,Google's Win for Open Source,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Google over Oracle in a major copyright battle about the “fair use” of code. The ruling is widely seen as a boon to the open-source software movement and may have implications for the cryptocurrency industry. After all, most crypto projects aren’t protected by copyright.      The backstory: When developing the Android operating system, Google ported over 11,000 lines of code from Java SE, a programming environment now owned by Oracle but built by Sun Microsystems. It wanted to ensure interoperability between the platforms. Oracle argued that re-using portions of its API, a sort of bridge between two types of code, was copyright infringement.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Why it matters: The court’s decision upholds a longstanding Silicon Valley tradition: coding by appropriation. Programmers steal and modify, copy and paste is ubiquitous – and not just in crypto. Developers can now rest easy knowing they can take codified ideas and tinker with them to build something new (transforming the code to iterate is key to fair-use doctrine).      Recently, a popular decentralized exchange issued its latest software version under a “business source license,” to prevent rival projects from replicating its code base wholesale. That sort of development isn’t uncommon in crypto: Binance Smart Chain is essentially a remodeling of Ethereum, as is the JPMorgan-incubated Quorum blockchain now owned by ConsenSys.      That’s just par for the course. There’s a direct line from Xerox to Apple’s Macintosh to Microsoft Windows, with each iteration lifting good ideas from its predecessor. The new ruling won’t allow reproduction of entire operating systems or smartphone designs (unless they’re already open source), but clarifies that certain bits of code – even when proprietary – have a utilitarian function, and, in some sense, belong to the world.      Protocol Labs, the open-source shop behind Filecoin and IPFS, submitted a “friend of the court” brief on behalf of Google. “The TL;DR [of the Supreme Court decision] is any time you are using an UI or API duplication, it's basically always going to be fair use,” Marta Belcher, a technology lawyer and outside counsel for Protocol Labs, said over Zoom. The actual decision went far beyond what Belcher had anticipated.      See also: Alex Treece - The Intangible Reasons Ethereum and Bitcoin Lead      “Google reimplemented a user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the 6-2 majority. Oracle, of course, balked at the decision, saying it is anti-competitive. ""The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater,"" a rep said in a statement.      There are still lingering questions. For one, the court didn’t rule on whether APIs could be copyrighted, but argued from the position as though Oracle’s copyright was in place.      “That's what's so interesting about this case. It used to be that fair use, or figuring out what is fair use, was a question for the jury, meaning, it was never clear,” Belcher said. “What happened here, that no one expected, is the Supreme Court found fair use as a matter of law. You don't need a jury to decide whether reimplementing an interface is fair use, bringing most development out of the realm of squishy, wishy‑washy uncertainty. That type of clarity – bright, clear lines – is really important for the open source space.”      Protocol Labs is commonly viewed as an antagonist to Big Tech. I asked Belcher if she thought it was odd rooting for Google in this instance. She replied:      “Often civil liberties groups root for a plaintiff who was very unsavory or who has done unsavory things because a case, if it gets to the point of a decision, could have bad effects on a lot of good actors.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/06/googles-win-for-open-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79d253deb145909dc88c475b219f609464a297bf-2400x1725.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the agreement, Fortress will invest $15 million in mining equipment through Great American Mining in the hopes of capturing 180 peta hashes a second (PH/s) in four months (Fortress currently produces roughly 20 PH/s).      “I believe the future of bitcoin mining will need to be environmentally conscious, seeking out stranded energy sources and repurposing waste and emitted gases to productively secure the Bitcoin blockchain, and that both investors as well as the bitcoin mining community will place a premium on companies who pursue this kind of forward-thinking activity,” Fortress Chairman Roy Sebag said in a press release.      ""Our board felt that Great American Mining had the best operational team, and a practical solution in place, which lined up with our own vision for the future of Bitcoin mining,"" Fortress CEO Aydin Kilic told CoinDesk.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  In search of a 'green' bitcoin    Discussion over bitcoin’s energy consumption has resurfaced during the current market cycle, with some saying new U.S. institutional investors will want “green” bitcoin that isn’t mined in sanctioned countries or China.      Still, those worried about the energy that bitcoin consumes don’t always consider that 35%-76% of bitcoin energy appetite is fed by renewables, and almost all of these power sources lie outside major population centers where the power is “stranded” and couldn’t otherwise be used.      Great American Mining supplies oil and gas producers with mining rigs that convert otherwise flared or vented natural gas into hashpower.      If all the stranded gas in the U.S. were used for mining, then “all of the vented/flared gas in the U.S. converted to electrical power would yield approximately 7.4 GW (gigawatts), which in turn represents about 50-70% of the total power converted by the Bitcoin network currently,” the press release states.      The venture comes at a time when bitcoin miners (especially in the U.S.) are receiving new shipments of hardware to rev up their hashrates. Marathon Patent Group, for example, plans to roll out more than 100,000 ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) by February 2022.

42386411,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSqN9,1617721723,The Real Trouble With Cross-Border Payments,"No, moving money internationally cannot be as easy and fast as sending an email. Cross-border payments are usually costlier and slower than national payments not because of technological limitations, but essentially because of politics.      When it comes to technology, many central banks and commercial banks take part in real-time payments networks that work smoothly. Even in the U.S., which tends to be conservative in payments initiatives, real-time payments have become more widespread since late 2019. FedNow, to be launched by the Federal Reserve in 2023, should push the adoption of instant payments forward.      At the international level, SWIFT, a provider of messaging services used by banks when processing cross-border payments, has also been working to improve funds transfer efficiency. The technology for faster payments exists and is already in use across the world. If, however, you or your company had to send money abroad recently, you know the process is far from being completed at the click of a button.    Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a central bank lawyer and researcher.    If technology isn’t the problem, what then? Sovereignty is to blame. With rare exceptions, having control over money is as important for a sovereign as having military might: the powers of the purse and the sword. Most countries thus choose to have their own sovereign money, issued by a local authority and holding the irrevocable power to discharge any debt inside the sovereign territory – the legal tender status.      Some countries, like Brazil, will go one step further and make it illegal to use any currency other than the sovereign one in national transactions. But even in countries where legal tender rules allow private parties to agree on their preferred form of payment, like the U.S., practicality will favor the official money. When most prices are denominated in a currency, like the euro, making payments in yens can be not only inconvenient but impossible.      An immediate solution to these problems would be to have a supranational currency for cross-border payments. Like bitcoin, for example. Bitcoin has no issuer, so it is not connected to a jurisdiction and has its own unit of account, without any reference to or backing by a sovereign currency. A bitcoin in a Japanese wallet can be transferred to a Brazilian wallet and then to an American wallet seamlessly and in no time.    With rare exceptions, having control over money is as important for a sovereign as having military might.    Do you think any country is ready to accept a supranational currency for international transactions, even if not bitcoin? Also, if we can find an international organization prepared to create a global digital currency and a couple of countries willing to use it, how could we convince the major economies, which also issue the most used currencies internationally, to play along?      The diversity of sovereign currencies and the preference, legal or practical, for the official currency in each sovereign territory are the fundamental reasons behind the perceived inefficiency of cross-border payments.      Every international payment requires at least the conversion of one sovereign currency into another, which inevitably comes with different intermediaries and multiple regulatory requirements, from anti-money laundering and know your customer rules to capital controls.      In fact, most international payments, no matter if you’re using a bank or a fintech company, will require two or more currency conversions because the dollar and an American bank will be called to facilitate the transaction. And the greater the number of currency conversions, the higher the costs involved and the slower the process.      The figure below shows what happens when a Brazilian company (IB) has to pay a Korean manufacturer (EK) for imported goods. Brazilian reais would be useless for the Korean seller, which needs wons to pay its employees and suppliers in Korea. The Brazilian importer, on the other hand, won’t find wons in Brazil, not even with the biggest local banks. The only way to make the international payment work is to engage in a foreign-exchange transaction.      See also: Marcelo Prates - Central Banks Had to Up Their Money Game This Year      The Brazilian importer will have to ask his local bank (B1) to convert reais from its checking account into wons that can be delivered to the Korean manufacturer. As monetary transactions between Brazil and Korea are infrequent, the Brazilian bank won’t have relations with a Korean bank but will probably have a correspondent bank in the U.S. that could help.      So, the Brazilian bank will receive reais from the Brazilian importer, withdraw dollars from its prefunded account ($) with the American correspondent bank (B2), and ask it to take care of sending the withdrawn amount to South Korea.      If the correspondent bank in the U.S. doesn’t have relations with any Korean bank either, it’ll have to find another American bank that does. The U.S. correspondent bank will then transfer the dollars it received from the Brazilian bank to another American bank (B3), which will finally be able to order the payment by withdrawing wons from its prefunded account ($) with a Korean correspondent bank (B4).      With some luck, the South Korean manufacturer will have a checking account with the receiving bank and will be able to avoid one more transfer, from the Korean correspondent bank to its preferred bank in Korea (B5).      So, a single payment between Brazil and Korea may end up involving two currency conversions, four bank transfers, and five banking institutions in three different countries. And I didn’t even mention that some banks in this process may need to buy foreign currency from their central bank to replenish the balance of the account they keep with the foreign correspondent bank.      Technology may help expedite these transactions, especially if payments systems in all the participating countries operate 24/7 in real-time or central bank digital currencies (CBDC) finally come on the scene. Reducing the transaction and opportunity costs associated with cross-border payments will be harder because we have 180 currencies circulating in the world, each of them subject to a host of local rules and regulations.      As a multi-government commitment to use a common currency for international transactions doesn’t seem feasible anytime soon, cross-border payments will continue to be costly, slow, and inefficient. Until a privately-issued cryptocurrency not backed by sovereign currencies gains traction – perhaps a StarbucksCoin or a MacCoin. Then it will be too late for governments to react.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marcelo M.

42386394,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSq4H,1617721200,New Privacy Coin Iron Fish Launches Testnet With $5.3M in Funding,"A new coin has begun swimming in the privacy coin pool. Iron Fish ($IRON), which protects transactions using zk-SNARKs, is launching its public testnet today, the culmination of nearly two years of building. Anyone can now run and mine a full Iron Fish node.      With $5.3 million in funding behind it from the likes of Electric Capital, Slow Capital, Juan Benet and Balaji S. Srinivasan, Iron Fish is betting there is still a demand for privacy coins in a crowded market.      An allusion to the power of cryptography to protect and defend, the name Iron Fish comes from the U.S. Navajo Code Talkers who, in World War II, used it as a codename for a submarine.      “Iron Fish is a new privacy-focused cryptocurrency where every transaction is private, using the strongest privacy mechanism known today based on zero-knowledge proofs,” Elena Nadolinski, CEO of Iron Fish, told CoinDesk exclusively in an email. “As we continue to add features, Iron Fish will become a shielded layer for many assets, even ones on different chains, and provide a platform for true digital cash (via fully private stablecoins).”    Zero-knowledge proofs    Iron Fish uses zk-SNARKs, a type of zero-knowledge proof. A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique used to prove and verify a statement without revealing the underlying data. Essentially, zk-SNARKs shield Iron Fish users’ balances and user identities.      “In Iron Fish, zero-knowledge proofs allow you to make a transaction without revealing your balance, or the recipient, or even who you are — instead, there’s a cryptographic proof accompanying an encrypted transaction that simply proves you have enough funds to cover it,” said Nadolinski. “In contrast, Bitcoin or Ethereum transactions are a permanent ledger of all your transactions in plaintext.”      Iron Fish also uses the Sapling protocol, developed by Zcash, for constructing and verifying shielded transactions in the context of a blockchain.      “I believe that over the next few years, zk-SNARKs and privacy technologies will unlock previously inconceivable design spaces,” said Jill Carlson, a principal at Slow Ventures. “Elena has a pragmatic vision for how to get there. Iron Fish promises to fill the digital cash void that crypto has so long promised to us.”      Nadolinski said she wants developers, cryptographers and crypto enthusiasts to come join the Iron Fish discourse. This is in part why Iron Fish uses a modern, easily extensible codebase to whichg anyone can contribute, according to Nadolinski. Iron Fish uses Rust coding language for the cryptographic aspects and Typescript for everything else.      “Iron Fish makes it easy for developers to work with zero-knowledge in crypto,” said former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan. “This is no small feat and due to Elena’s engineering prowess and that of her team.”    Why now?    There are already large privacy coin projects on the cryptocurrency scene, such as Monero and Zcash, as well as improvements being actively developed to make Bitcoin more private.      Nadolinski said despite there being a huge demand for privacy, no privacy coin has “won” yet.      In a blog post announcing the Iron Fish testnet launch, she notes that in 2021 alone, the private messaging app Signal saw installs skyrocket after Whatsapp announced changes to its terms of service around data use. Encrypted email service ProtonMail saw a threefold rise in usage and privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo’s growth has “become exponential.”      A page on the Iron Fish website compares its privacy features to other cryptocurrencies like zcash, grin and bitcoin.      “Existing privacy coins all have drawbacks on privacy, accessibility or both,” said Nadolinksi. “Iron Fish does not compromise on privacy, while [being] fully focused on making it accessible/easy to use and expanding it to support multiple assets and bridges to other chains, and provide a platform for true digital cash.”    Privacy coin delistings    Iron Fish also enters the scene amid a rash of privacy coins being delisted, but Nadolinski remains unconcerned.      “We're bringing the same expectations around financial privacy that you have in the analogous world to crypto,” she said. “Regulatory concern with privacy coins arises from the myth that law enforcement won't be able to catch bad actors. But just like in the real world when law enforcement would go acquire records when a suspicion of a crime occurs (e.g. acquire bank records for an organization or individual), so can law enforcement go to an exchange or other crypto-issuing body and acquire ‘view keys’ for an account (which Iron FIsh supports).”    Read more: Privacy Coin Advocates Persevere Amid Multiple Crypto Exchange Delistings    These “view keys” give the holder read-only access to all activity associated with that particular account. Iron Fish (and other privacy coins) also support encrypted memo fields facilitating compliance with the FATF rule (Travel Rule) for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) by allowing them to keep a record of information for the reason behind transfers.      Nadolinski stresses that, compared to other cryptocurrencies, privacy coins give users an experience more similar to the one they would have in the real world when it comes to privacy expectations.      “Privacy coins have a bad case of bad marketing, that they are something nefarious and only to be used for illegal activity, but that's not true,” she said. “Take doors on houses or passwords for bank accounts, both of which are precautions most people take even though they might say they have nothing to hide.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | ZEC,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/06/new-privacy-coin-iron-fish-launches-testnet-with-53m-in-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9023d94d935208bf012c5801baa4eced13bec82-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386406,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSqI7,1617715800,State of Crypto: The IRS Sets Its Sights on Circle,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is once again gearing up to collect customer data from crypto exchanges. Will this be different from the last time?    You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Full Circle  The narrative    Stop me if you’ve heard this before: The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants information from a crypto exchange about its customers, particularly those who may have a) transacted large sums of crypto and b) may not have reported taxes on these transactions.    Why it matters    The IRS is now looking for information on former Poloniex and Circle customers who transacted over $20,000 in crypto between 2016 and 2020, according to a U.S. Department of Justice press release published Thursday. The tax collector filed a “John Doe” summons, meaning it doesn’t yet know the names of the individuals it’s looking for. The press release explained that this might be because “taxpayers may be using [cryptocurrencies] to hide taxable income from the IRS” due to the pseudonymous nature of crypto.    Breaking it down    This isn’t new. This is pretty much exactly how the IRS sought Coinbase customer names back in 2016. Coinbase fought the summons at the time, and was able to secure a partial victory: While the IRS wanted information for up to 500,000 customers, the exchange ultimately only sent information on about 13,000. Last week’s summons shows the agency is widening its net.      In other words, according to a statement by IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig:    “Tools like the John Doe summons authorized today send the clear message to U.S. taxpayers that the IRS is working to ensure that they are fully compliant in their use of virtual currency. The John Doe summons is a step to enable the IRS to uncover those who are failing to properly report their virtual currency transactions. We will enforce the law where we find systemic noncompliance or fraud.”    The IRS and the Department of Justice Tax Division are also reportedly looking at Kraken, though a spokesperson tells me, “Kraken has not received a summons for client records” yet. According to public court records, Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero, of the Northern District of California, has some concerns about the scope of the summons. He’s ordered the U.S. government to explain how its summons meets legal requirements to be “narrowly tailored.”      This all feels like the IRS is just expanding its ongoing efforts to collect taxes from crypto users. Last year it put out a call for contractors to help it sort through crypto user records. The recent bull run means there’s likely to be an influx of people reporting gains (or not reporting, hence the IRS summons).      The next steps will be critical: After the IRS received Coinbase customer information, it sent letters to the exchange’s users warning they may have inaccurately reported their tax obligations to the agency and should refile or risk being audited. The IRS’ “Taxpayer Advocate Service” later said these letters may have violated taxpayer rights, pointing to the fact that not every recipient of a letter was under audit.      James Harper of the American Enterprise Institute later sued the IRS on allegations that it violated his constitutional rights (the case was dismissed last month).      More important: Exchanges spent months or years figuring out how to report customer tax obligations to try and prevent their customers from getting similar letters those Coinbase customers received. We’re getting pretty close to finding out what the impact of those efforts.      The real question to me is, will the IRS get to a point where it introduces a de minimis exemption for small transactions?    Regulation by enforcement    Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued LBRY over its 2016 token sale. LBRY, a decentralized publishing platform, says the suit doesn’t reflect efforts it made to be legally compliant, and has kicked off a public relations campaign arguing that the SEC suit might be a threat to all crypto projects in the U.S. if it succeeds.      It’s not wholly clear to me whether that’s true. What is true, however, is that the SEC has filed a number of enforcement actions without publishing specific guidance for companies to use (there was the token guidance it published in 2019, though many industry insiders said it was less than the “plain English” roadmap they’d hoped for).      Jenny Vatrenko, a commercial litigator, said the suit was consistent with the SEC’s previous actions, noting that the LBRY action could be compared to the Ripple lawsuit in that both companies continued selling tokens to retail consumers well after the alleged initial sale began.      “One interesting thing [about LBRY’s response is] they worked with the SEC and tried to get the SEC’s advice to comply with the securities laws and the SEC said ‘we can’t give you that kind of advice but we can tell you that your conduct is illegal,’” she said.      Grant Gulovsen, a private practice attorney, said the case could have broad implications.      “A lot of us in the legal community who advise crypto startups have been watching as the SEC enforcement actions have broadened their scope from the 'easy cases' to ones that impact virtually every project. I think you’d be hard-pressed to find many crypto startups that could satisfy the standard now articulated by the SEC in the LBRY case,” he said.      Still, the SEC has said that projects with questions or concerns should reach out to its FinHub division.      Both Vatrenko and Gulovsen said one detail that stood out about the LBRY case is the company doesn’t seem to have acted maliciously, setting it apart from many other cases the SEC has prosecuted.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    The big news from last week is Michael Mosier, the previous deputy director at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and who’s currently at the U.S. Treasury Department as a counselor to Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo, will become Acting Director of FinCEN on April 9. Current Director Kenneth Blanco, who has helmed the agency since 2017, announced his intention to step down from the role last Friday. Prior to his government role, Mosier was at Chainalysis. In other words, a pretty significant government agency is about to be run by someone with clear experience and understanding of the crypto sector. (Fun fact: Before he was at Chainalysis, Mosier was at … FinCEN.)      I’m also adding to the table based on reader feedback: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), effectively one of the major federal banking regulators that provides deposit insurance to national banks, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which I’ve written about before, are now on the list. Rohit Chopra, currently a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, has been nominated to run the CFPB. The FDIC seems less likely to see a new head; the current chair is Jelena McWilliams, whose term expires in 2023. That being said, the FDIC Board of Directors has a vacancy, and two spots are filled by acting agency directors (Acting Comptroller Blake Paulson and Acting CFPB Director Dave Uejio).    Elsewhere:  S. Korea’s Crypto Rules Might Only Help the ‘Big 4’ Exchanges: South Korea’s regulations might not be designed to ban crypto or kill exchanges, but in effect they might result in a handful of exchanges becoming powerful incumbents, writes CoinDesk Korea Global Editor Felix Im. New registration and bank requirements might mean that only the largest and best-established crypto trading firms will be able to succeed, as banks might be hesitant to work with smaller or newer exchanges.  Digital Yuan Won’t Give China ‘First-Mover Advantage’ With CBDCs, BIS Chief Says: Agustín Carstens, general manager at the Bank for International Settlements, said in a speech last week that rhetoric about a nation (i.e., China) launching a sovereign digital currency wouldn’t necessarily secure a geopolitical advantage over another nation (i.e. the U.S.) when it comes to global reserve currency status.  Abkhazia Bans Bitcoin Mining Shortly After Legalizing It: Abkhazia, a small autonomous region that’s either an independent nation (if you ask Russia and a handful of other countries) or a part of Georgia (if you ask Georgia) has extended a ban on crypto mining due to an ongoing energy crisis. Electricity is cheap in the region, but the infrastructure doesn’t meet the non-crypto demand, let alone the demand crypto miners have.  Grayscale Says It’s ‘100% Committed to Converting GBTC Into an ETF’: Grayscale (a subsidiary of CoinDesk’s parent firm, Digital Currency Group) said it plans to convert its GBTC trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This isn’t a surprise, I think. Grayscale published a host of job postings for ETF specialists last month, so it makes sense that the company wants to get in on the ETF race. What it does mean is that GBTC shareholders would get to escape the GBTC six-month lockup period and 2% annual management fee, according to my colleague Nathan DiCamillo.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Wired) Terrorist groups are using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to raise or transfer funds, reports Rachel Rose O’Leary in Wired UK (Rachel-Rose is also a CoinDesk alum). This is something we’ve seen government officials in the U.S. talk about (a lot) in recent months, so it’s good to get a sense of the scope here.  (Reuters) While major firms like Tesla are now adding bitcoin to their balance sheets or letting customers buy goods using the cryptocurrency, insurance companies remain at arm’s length, Reuters reports. Demand for insurers in the digital asset space is growing though, particularly over the last few months.

42386402,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSq9J,1617714382,Sotheby's Plans Its First NFT Auction With Artist Pak and Nifty Gateway,"Top auction house Sotheby’s, established in 1744 in London, has announced its first auction of non-fungible token (NFT)-based digital artworks, created by anonymous artist Pak, that “scrutinizes our understanding of value.”      Sotheby’s announced Monday “The Fungible” Collection by Pak will be taking place April 12-14 on Nifty Gateway, an NFT marketplace owned by Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers.      The creator of Archillect, an AI built to discover and share stimulating visual media, Pak has been active in digital art for over two decades. In December Pak was the first to earn $1 million for NFT art.      The auction house said the sale of Pak’s “Fungible Cubes” will be available at the starting price of $500 and collectors will be able to purchase as many cubes as they wish. The buyers of the fungible cubes will receive an NFT containing Pak’s artwork.      The collection up for auction includes individual NFTs, each representing sets of A Cube (1), Five Cubes (5), Ten Cubes (10), Twenty Cubes (20), Fifty Cubes (50), Hundred Cubes (100), Five Hundred Cubes (500), Thousand Cubes (1,000).      NFTs have fast become a craze with millions of dollars being spent on rare or desirable digital artworks. Last month, a piece of digital artwork or NFT by crypto artist Beeple was sold for a record $69.3 million by Sotheby’s rival auction house Christie’s.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    In March, Sotheby’s CEO Charles Stewart told CNBC NFTs have “staying power."" The auction house decided to hold its first NFT art sale with Pak because it wanted to work with one of ""the most established artists"" in the space.      Pak’s The Fungible Collection will “challenge us to rethink what we know about digital art and ownership,” and “scrutinizes our understanding of value,” said Sotheby’s.    People may be able to right click save as a ""jpeg"" but how would they save as a digital performance?Pak    “I see this collection as the first digitally native mindset of works that's presented to the traditional art world through a global auction house,” said Pak in a statement released by Sotheby’s.      “With this kind of a scale, I expect it to play a major cultural role in telling the narrative of the digital world to the traditional world in terms of the medium definition and value creation. People may be able to right click save as a 'jpeg' but how would they save as a digital performance?”      For artists, it has been a challenging time, with many unable to resume activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, NFTs have seen growth by creating opportunities for struggling artists and their fans.      NFTs are cryptographic assets that can have variable features. They have been used to represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from art to collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers.

Olta Andoni has joined the Miami-based startup as chief legal officer, the company announced Tuesday. She is employee No. 5 at Nifty's, which last month said it had raised pre-seed funding from Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin and a pseudonymous NFT investor known as 0xb1, along with a host of venture capital firms. (The size of the round was not disclosed.)      In her new role, Andoni will be navigating uncharted waters, given the novel and complex legal questions posed by NFTs in areas such as consumer protection, sanctions, money laundering, copyright and IP, securities, tax and counterfeiting law.      Roughly the digital equivalent of an autographed baseball card – valued for its uniqueness despite an abundance of similar items – these blockchain collectibles have been selling at auctions for as much as eight figures in dollar terms this year, propelled by the star power of artists and celebrities.      Andoni practiced IP law in the U.S. for six years, according to her LinkedIn bio. She then headed the blockchain practice at the Ziliak Law firm in the Chicago area for a year and for the last year worked as a fintech and IP attorney at Zlatkin Wong LLP.      “Olta has been a visible advocate for developing the NFT and broader blockchain universe in a responsible and durable way,” said Jeff Marsilio, CEO and co-founder of Nifty’s, in a statement.

42386389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSpzF,1617714000,Paxos Trumpets Same-Day Shares Settlement Using Blockchain,"New York State-regulated Paxos Trust Company has used blockchain technology to achieve same-day settlement for a selection of U.S. equity trades, with the help of Credit Suisse and Instinet.      The trades occurred on March 4, at 11 a.m. ET and 3 p.m. ET and were settled at 4:30 p.m. ET, demonstrating the platform’s ability to enable same-day settlement for trades conducted throughout the day, the companies said. (In the legacy system, settlement can only occur the same day if trades are completed before 11 a.m. ET.)      This seemingly nerdy enterprise blockchain pilot looks much more important in light of the recent share-trading fiasco involving the Wall Street Bets movement, which saw trading platform Robinhood fall foul of the arcane infrastructure used to settle U.S. equities.      For a couple of years now, Paxos, Credit Suisse and Instinet have been advancing simplified settlement of trades using a blockchain. (Paxos Settlement Service is built using a homespun variant of Ethereum code.) Back in February 2020, the three firms claimed to have done the first live blockchain-based settlement of U.S. equities – although Patrick Byrne’s tZERO project had previously carried out a blockchain-based settlement of shares in Overstock.    Read more: Paxos, Credit Suisse Claim First Blockchain-Based Settlement of US Equities    The Paxos settlement platform operates under “No-Action Relief” from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – basically when the regulator accepts a commonsense approach to something which is not technically legal. Paxos will apply for full clearing-agency registration with the SEC, and hopes to secure registration in 2021, it said.      “Settlement in U.S. equities is opaque and laden with unnecessary delays, capital costs and expenses,” said Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla in a statement, adding:    “We are working hard to improve settlement for the benefit of all market participants. An upgraded settlement system can create safer, fairer and more open capital markets that foster innovation. Modern technology makes the risks of the current system obsolete while also enabling greater trading liquidity with greater ownership transparency.”    The Paxos permissioned blockchain system is interoperable with the legacy clearing system and can facilitate settlement on any time cycle, Cascarilla said. Paxos also intends to run multilateral netting processes in real-time to ensure fast and transparent net settlement of transactions.      “We’re excited to stress test same-day cycles on Paxos, because our long-term goal is to always offer our clients more choices, advanced technologies, and greater efficiencies in both their settlement processes as well as time horizons,” Luke Mauro, global head of operations at Instinet, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/06/paxos-trumpets-same-day-shares-settlement-using-blockchain,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42386391,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSq0V,1617712628,"XRP Rises Above $1 for First Time Since March 2018, Despite SEC Shadow","A rally divorced from reality. A reader might not be blamed for thinking that, after looking at the payment-focused cryptocurrency XRP's rally to a three-year high above $1 in the face of lingering regulatory concern.      There's more to it, according to some observers. The token might be getting price support from the XRP community, popularly known as the XRP Army, CoinDesk's Ben Powers said during a panel discussion on CoinDesk TV Monday.      In December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a case against Ripple Inc., which uses XRP in its payments network, for raising $1.3 billion by selling the token in unregistered securities offerings. While there is no closure yet, the cryptocurrency has climbed to the highest level since March 2018, having erased December's decline from roughly to $0.60 to $0.20 in recent weeks.      The token's price is still well off its January 2018 all-time high of $3.30, based on pricing from the cryptocurrency data provider Messari.      ""They are still purchasing, they are still trading,"" Powers said, referring to XRP's devoted community. It goes back to the ""tribalism of crypto. You know, like people have their camps, and they rep them hard.""      Many feared the cryptocurrency would miss the 2021 crypto bull run because of the shadow of the SEC probe. That pessimism likely stemmed from observers being overly U.S.-centric.      ""The SEC can take action, but these are currencies that go beyond just the reach of the U.S.,"" Powers said.      Several major western crypto exchanges have suspended XRP trading due to regulatory concerns. However, XRP believers can still buy the cryptocurrency on other, less-regulated exchanges, or on Asia-oriented venues.      Two of the top five XRP exchanges, as per the 24-hour trading volume – VCC and HBTC – are based in Singapore, while Bidesk is based in Australia. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, does not fall under the purview of U.S. regulations.      It's quite clear the buying pressure is coming from outside the U.S. It validates cryptocurrencies' appeal of being censorship resistant – one that governments cannot control.      However, the XRP community's tenacity and the price rally do not necessarily mean the cryptocurrency's adoption as a payments mechanism will continue to grow.      ""The XRP army is not going to be dissuaded by an SEC enforcement, even if it means that Ripple and XRP could ultimately get iced out of a major financial market,"" CoinDesk reporter Danny Nelson said on the panel. ""That would presumably have a big impact on its usefulness to other businesses around the world.""",NEUTRAL,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/06/xrp-rises-above-1-for-first-time-since-march-2018-despite-sec-shadow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f3869510e9050c7c907c4f073cb23b35e518677-1200x782.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But selling pressure was limited near $57,900 support. Momentum signals are neutral over the short-term as BTC continues to consolidate.

The filing with the State of Delaware indicated that a company named ""Grayscale"" had filed for a trust in a way that was identical to how Grayscale Investments had done for multiple other trusts.  ""We did not make that filing,"" the spokeswoman said.  As such, the filing may have been an attempt to pump the price of the project's native token NII.  According to CoinGecko, the price of NII has more than doubled in the last 24 hours to $0.01, with a 24-hour trading volume of $20.2 million.  It appears at least one other trust filing with the name ""Grayscale"" may also be fraudulent.  Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.

42386398,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSq6n,1617703200,"During Market Boom, Monero Cryptojacking Fell for First Time Since 2018","New research has found that cryptojacking, or the illegal use of someone else’s computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies, has quietly decreased for the first time since 2018.      Unit 42, the global threat intelligence team at Palo Alto Networks, which conducted and published the research as part of a larger “Cloud Threat Report,” first started tracking cryptojacking in 2018.      The report focuses specifically on the illicit mining of privacy coin monero, given its popularity with hackers, the authors say. The research was conducted from September 2020 through February 2021.      “Globally, 23% of organizations with cloud workloads experienced cryptojacking from July through September 2020, compared to only 17% from December 2020 through February 2021, according to our findings,” the report states.    Monero and cryptojacking    According to Unit 42 researcher Nathaniel Quist, cryptojacking is both an issue and appealing to attackers for two reasons.      First, the cloud has lots of CPUs and lots of virtual machines, said Quist, which can translate to big mining profits. Second, the cloud is hard to monitor. Quist said miners can run undetected for a long time, and without any detection mechanisms in place, they may run until the user finds an inflated cloud usage bill and realizes that something is wrong.      “There is currently a heightened awareness by cloud security teams towards the significance, impact and risks of cryptomining operations and we believe the initial steps are being taken to better secure cloud environments,” Quist said.      Researchers saw that the lowest number of network connections took place at the highest market price points, which may indicate that mining operators were performing the majority of their mining during bear markets before selling during high price runs.    Read more: Scams and Fraud Bubble Up as NFT Mania Takes Hold    While XMR is the most popular coin for cloud mining, Unit 42 also looked at the network connections for ether, bitcoin, litecoin and dash. In each case, XMR mining connections significantly outperformed the other mining operations.    Vulnerabilities galore    While cryptojacking itself was down, that doesn’t mean there wasn’t an increase in other kinds of cybercrime associated with increased demand for cloud computing products.      Looking from October 2019 to February 2021, Unit 42’s research indicates that cloud security incidents exploded by 188% in the second quarter of 2020 (April to June) as nationwide lockdowns went into effect.      The team also found that while organizations and businesses were quickly able to move their workflow to the cloud, automated security measures lagged behind.    Read more: We Went Hunting for Crypto Scams in Google and Apple App Stores. Here’s What We Found    And these kinds of security incidents didn’t discriminate by industry. The retail industry saw incidents increase by 402% while manufacturing and government increased by 230% and 205%, respectively.      It wasn’t just security incidents that increased either, but also the risk to sensitive data.      Surprisingly, the Unit 42 research found that 35% of businesses globally let their cloud storage resources be publicly accessible from the internet. Thirty percent of those organizations exposed some form of sensitive data to the internet, making it potentially vulnerable. This data included personally identifiable information, intellectual property and healthcare and financial data.      “This finding was shocking, given that anyone who knows the right URLs can access the data without passwords or other authentication,” the researchers wrote.

On Monday, the Mumbai-based WazirX exchange, the largest in India, launched a non-fungible tokens (NFT) platform through which creators can auction their digital assets and earn royalties.  ""The development has paved the way for seamless exchange of digital assets and intellectual properties including art pieces, audio files, videos, programs and even tweets apart from other digital goods and services,"" the Binance-owned exchange said in a press release shared with CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  NFTs are a class of cryptocurrencies representing a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers, as discussed by CoinDesk last month.  In plain English, an NFT is not replaceable by any another item and acts as proof of ownership over a piece of a digital asset.  ""We are delighted to launch one of India's first NFT marketplace,"" Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, said. ""Both digital creators and collectors stand to benefit from the WazirX NFT marketplace.""  WazirX does not charge customers for creating and listing NFTs on its platform and is working toward making its marketplace more lucrative by eliminating costs associated with verifying NFT transactions on the blockchain, according to the press release.  Because NFTs run on blockchain, most trading platforms charge users for the computing power required to process and validate transactions on the blockchain.  Film actor/producer and adviser to NFT market place Vishakha Singh said she's confident the launch will be a success and help ""erase the myth of the starving artist.""  ""From the creative industry perspective, we believe this is a great opportunity for artists and [intellectual property rights] owners to monetize their existing assets via a new revenue stream,"" Singh said. ""We are confident that this would be a beautiful marriage of arts, technology and commerce.""  Also read: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?

National Football League player Russell Okung made headlines late last year for becoming the first NFL player to convert some of his $13 million salary into bitcoin. Okung used Zap's Strike product to convert dollars to BTC.      A representative for the Kings did not pick up the phone.      When reached by email Tuesday night, fellow NBA team owner Mark Cuban scoffed at the Kings' plan.      ""Any player can convert their income to any crypto they choose,"" Cuban told CoinDesk. ""Paying in BTC or any crypto doesn’t really do anything. I would rather keep my BTC.""
