42403437,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfz91,1572033332,Ethereum Targets Dec. 4 for Istanbul Mainnet Activation,"Ethereum’s next system-wide upgrade, Istanbul, is scheduled to arrive on mainnet the week of Dec. 4.  The decision was made during an ethereum core developer call on Oct. 25. Later on Friday, Danno Ferrin, blockchain protocol engineer at ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, proposed activating Istanbul at block number 9,056,000 in accordance with the targeted date of Dec. 4.  “From when I calculated … at 14-second block times its 245,544.5 blocks, which puts noon UTC at block 9,055,928.5. So I would propose 9,056,000 as the Istanbul mainnet block target. Please check my math,” Ferrin wrote after the meeting in an ethereum core developers chat room.  Update (Oct. 30, 13:09 UTC):  During the call, devs also agreed that in the case of any unexpected issues with the upgrade software between now and the week of Dec. 4, Istanbul’s mainnet activation would be delayed one month to Jan. 8.  “The thing about the [Jan.8] backstop date is that if we’re going to ship and change the time, we have to build a new client … and get everyone to install the client,” Ferrin said during the call. “At least four weeks for a re-spin is necessary.”  During the last system-wide upgrade, Constantinople, ethereum developers did indeed need to delay mainnet activation of the upgrade for a month due to a critical code vulnerability discovered just 48 hours before Constantinople’s scheduled roll-out.  This time, ethereum core developers are covering all their bases with pre-determined backstop dates in the event of any unforeseen circumstances.  Said Ethereum Foundation developer Piper Merriam:  “There’s nothing here that says [we can’t launch] the first week of December. We’re just setting some easy backstop dates now and we can always change our mind later if needed.”  What’s going into Istanbul?  Come December, Istanbul is expected to introduce six backwards-incompatible code changes to the world’s second-largest blockchain network.  The most controversial among them, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1884, will increase the computational costs of recalling data about the ethereum blockchain for application developers. At the same time, the increased fees will better safeguard the $18 billion platform from potential denial-of-service, or spam, attacks.  The other code changes introduce more pricing adjustments to the ethereum platform, as well as new code operations that application developers can leverage to verify and authenticate blockchain data more quickly.  Last month, Istanbul was activated on ethereum test network Ropsten. Due to its premature timing, however, miners on the network initially faced difficulty rolling out the upgrade.  To prevent further confusion over which version of ethereum software to run for miners (the users who validate transactions and process new blocks on the network), ethereum core developers approved today a new code change called EIP 2124.  Fork IDs and fork coordinators  Originally proposed in May by ethereum core developers Péter Szilágyi and Felix Lange, EIP 2124 introduces a mechanism for users to easily identify what version of software a computer server, also called a node, in the ethereum network is running.  “Generally, clients have a hard time following a non-majority chain so usually you have to tweak the clients [manually] … to make sure they’re on the right chain.” said Szilágyi, adding:  “All these issues can be fixed by including the fork ID.”  Called the “fork identifier,” Szilágyi explained on the call that EIP 2124 is a “tiny and beyond trivial change.” It can be rolled out by any ethereum software client without the need for coordination with other actors.  Outside of this, James Hancock, project lead at ethereum startup ETHSignals who most notably tried to initiate a fork of the ethereum blockchain in June, announced that he was joining the Ethereum Foundation to help coordinate ethereum system-wide upgrades, also called hard forks.  “I’m joining the [Ethereum Foundation] to help with hard fork coordination,” said Hancock. “For me, I want to focus on getting EIPs ready rather than focus on when are we going to release [an upgrade]. … It’s about changing the attitude from how many forks are we going to have this year to getting EIPs ready [for a fork].”  Ethereum image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/25/ethereum-targets-dec-4-for-istanbul-mainnet-activation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/700764f2571e76b5448bd66d3c0cbfaf1de17ff2-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403446,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzGt,1572024613,WATCH: Where Is the Crypto Market Headed Next Week?,"Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman joined CoinDesk's Brad Keoun on Thursday, Oct. 24, to talk about the current downward trend in crypto pricing and why things may be looking up. (On Friday, bitcoin's price shot up 13 percent to more than $8,400.)  ""It's always difficult real-time to understand what's causing a price decline or a price appreciation. After the fact, you can piece together pieces of news that may have caused it,"" said Dorman, adding:  ""I think over the last months, not just yesterday, you're definitely seeing some miners selling, which is causing some downward pressure. But the reality is, I think these selloffs are more about lack of money in the system right now. There's just not new money coming in at the moment.""  His take? There is no ""buyer of last resort"" in crypto, which means that ""distressed"" assets don't get scooped up.  Dorman also commented on the Libra hearings, saying he's not certain they had much effect.  ""Well, you know, I think retail investors probably aren't spending a lot of time watching C-SPAN,"" he said.  You can watch the rest of the interview above or read the transcript below.  Brad Keoun: We're here today with Jeff Dorman. He's the chief investment officer of Arca. We're very lucky to have him. He has a long resume of experience. He's a former high-yield bond trader with big firms like Citadel, Merrill Lynch and Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, and lately he's been bringing that experience to bear in the crypto space. Jeff, thank you so much for your time today.  Jeff Dorman: Absolutely. Thanks for having me.  BK: Yesterday we had a very big move down in bitcoin, and I'd love to get your thoughts there on what happened.  JD: Sure, it is always difficult to understand what's causing a price decline or price appreciation. After the fact, you can piece together pieces of news that may have caused it. I think over the last months, not just yesterday, you're definitely seeing some miners selling, which is causing some downward pressure. But the reality is, I think these selloffs are more about lack of money in the system right now. There's just not new money coming in at the moment, and, more importantly, there's no buyer of last resort. In traditional asset classes, you see rotation when equities go to cheap. The distressed bond guys start to buy if distressed bonds or companies by that their own bonds and equities. In crypto, right now, there really is just no buyer of last resort. You're not seeing that rotation yet, so until that until that starts to happen, I think moves up and down are always going to be exacerbated.  BK: What's it gonna take for that to happen?  JD: It's a good question. I think a lot of it is still the education. I think people are definitely learning. Education is number one. We need to get reputable companies in here who help traditional investors get in here and part of it is simply getting traditional investors to recognize that this really is an asset class that they can you can use for a variety of different purposes, whether that's for hedging with speculation, whether it's for growth.  BK: Just sort of anecdotally looking at bitcoin market, and it seems like we'll have these big stair-step moves and then we'll go along in a range, and then we'll have another very large move. I'm curious for people who are kind of kicking the tires on this market. What out of the how did they look at that?  JD: I think for the most part, traditional investors are not scared off by volatility as long as there's upside volatility as well right now, but volatility can be managed. There are certainly times when you'll get all sides. There are certainly times where you don't see something coming and you're not hedged or wedged appropriately. For the most part, traditional investors are very good at managing risk, and they're very good at managing volatility so that that's to me, not something that's going to scare people away from this market. I think what will scare them away is not understanding where the volatility is coming from, and I think that's where a lot of the due diligence is going through right now, trying to figure out how it's happening, how they can prevent against it what kind of managers or that they can trust to actually manage that risk for them.  BK: What were your thoughts on Mark Zuckerberg's testimony yesterday? And I'm curious if there's any way that sort of maps back to how people think about bitcoin?  JD: I think retail investors probably aren't spending a lot of time watching C-SPAN. Certainly traditional institutional investors have that out in the background. So I think it'll certainly shape some narratives in terms of what people take out of it. But me personally, I felt uncomfortable watching it. I don't like when six hours of time is being used and accomplishing very little. I don't think the questions were very good, and as a result, the answers couldn't be very good either. I think it's a good thing that regulation is going to happen, and I think it is a good thing that for good or for bad, the Libra and Facebook project is forcing this into the public narrative faster than maybe it would have otherwise.  But in terms of price action, I think a lot of people were excited about Facebook and Libra, which probably contributed to the run-up earlier in the year. And now that that's stalling and not going as well, it's certainly contributing to the downside. But I don't think in a vacuum that that one testimony or anything else that's going on with Libra is really the main driver of crypto.  BK: Just looking ahead, a big event next week in traditional finance: The Federal Reserve is gonna have its meeting. And they're expected to cut rates for the third time this year. I don't know if you have any thoughts specifically on what that means for bitcoin in the short term? But maybe long term, any thoughts on on what the Fed is doing?  JD: Yeah, the Fed actions to date haven't had much of an impact real time in the price of bitcoin already on any other digital assets except for the July 31 cut. The first cut really did spark a 25 percent rally over the next five days, August 1- August 6, just because it is such a reversal of what had been happening over the last four or five years of going the other way with tighter monetary policy rather than looser long term. So I don't expect next week's cuts to really have an impact. However, you couldn't ask for a better long-term backdrop for bitcoin right now, with anything from what's happening with the QE and all in the repo markets and just constant injections of liquidity, which obviously is going to lead to inflation at some point or just raising the debt ceiling. The political unrest that we're seeing everywhere, from Chile, Argentina, to Lebanon to Hong Kong, low rates everywhere, which is just spurring aggressive investing and obviously creating further bubbles. So long term, I think this is absolutely part of the bitcoin bull thesis. But I wouldn't expect too much of a reaction at all, just based on the rate cut itself.  BK: Just a last question here. I was just reading this editorial board piece from Bloomberg earlier this week, and they said that the world economy is quote ""stumbling toward disaster."" And of course you know Michael Bloomberg potentially in the wings of, you know, as a presidential candidate, jumping in. But aside from that, Bloomberg has a lot of credibility and you're a former high-yield bond trader, and one of the things they talked about was how bad it could get in a credit-cycle turn. And I'm just curious, What would that mean for bitcoin if if the U.S. really went into a full-blown downturn?  JD: In debt, we're trained to look at downside, not upside, whereas equity guys usually look through rose-colored glasses and look at the upside first.  So certainly the people in the debt circles are more concerned about this right now than the equity guys. I think it's a real concern. There are people who, nine years ago, eight years ago were calling for the same demise as people are calling for now and truthfully, nothing has really changed, except for this giant band-aid of liquidity that the Fed and other central banks have put over the problem.  So it certainly could get that bad. I don't think the world going into a deep recession or a massive systemic banking failure is going to be good in the beginning for bitcoin. I think correlation goes to one across all risk assets as soon as things get bad. However, long term, it really would be the reminder of why bitcoin exists in the first place. And, you know, a lot of people, especially in the United States, when you're not affected by the issues that are going on elsewhere, with real restrictive government regimes and real currency depreciation, you're just not going to appreciate how important bitcoin really is to the future success of money.  But if we go through here in the U.S. because of a global recession, it will wake people up to how important this is that you do need to start thinking about safeguarding your assets again, right? The last time this happened in 2008 there wasn't an alternative. Most of the smartest investors in the world were either shorting equities, and we know that was a disaster. Or they were buying gold, which has been a bad trade for 10 years, or they were shorting sovereign bonds. You know, anything from Italy to Spain to Greece. And that was a disaster because the ECB bailed everyone out. Bitcoin was just getting going. Then it wasn't the viable option it is now. And if you do have a shake-up like that, like I said, near term it's going to be bad for bitcoin. Long term, it will certainly make many more investors and many more people aware that bitcoin is a solution to these problems.  BK: Jeff, that is fascinating. And I really appreciate your time and your joining us today  JD: Absolutely. Fun to be here. It's always good talking to you.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"John Biggs, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/25/watch-where-is-the-crypto-market-headed-next-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97575b5978e46caf229d15fc2e6a26659ed670cf-1468x734.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403420,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfwiU,1572023715,"Bitcoin Jumps 12% as China's Xi Embraces Blockchain, Boosting Crypto Sentiment","View  Bitcoin prices are rebounding from a five-month low touched earlier this week.  Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country should seize opportunities afforded by blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin.  Despite China's ban on cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017, the comments from the leader of the world's second-largest economy could boost sentiment toward digital assets in general, providing a positive market backdrop for bitcoin, says eToro's Mati Greenspan.      Bitcoin prices shot up 12 percent Friday, climbing off a five-month low touched earlier this week, after Chinese President Xi Jinping said his countrymen should ""seize the opportunity"" afforded by blockchain technology.  Although China's central bank ordered mainland-based coin exchanges to close in 2017, Xi's comments in support of enterprise blockchain, which share the distributed-ledger technology underpinning bitcoin, is good for sentiment around the crypto industry, said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at exchange eToro.  And that in turn could be boosting sentiment toward bitcoin, the original blockchain-based digital asset invented a decade ago, Greenspan said.  ""It's bullish for the entire crypto industry, in general, when you have the leader of one of the world's largest economies coming to embrace blockchain technology like this,"" Greenspan said in a phone interview from Tel Aviv. ""Bitcoin, as we know, is a central player in the blockchain industry.""  Bitcoin jumped 12 percent in the past 24 hours, reaching $8,392 as of 16:02 UTC (12:02 p.m. New York time). Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency touched $7,363, the lowest since May 18.  Friday's price jump-started right around 10:15 UTC, right after Xi's favorable blockchain comments were published in Chinese media.  The Chinese president’s statements on blockchain are believed to be his first in-depth remarks on the technology. Chinese officials are developing a digital version of the country's own currency, but have forbidden other coins from being traded.  President Xi said on Thursday:  “We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.”  eToro's Greenspan said that the price jump appeared to be directly correlated with the Chinese leader's comments.  ""It seems like this is what investors were reacting to,"" Greenspan said. ""There's only so much amount of good news that can be ignored. Xi is one of the most important people in the world.""  Bitcoin remains well off its 2019 high of $12,920 reached in June, though prices are still more than double where they started the year.

The crypto exchange and sister company of Tether claimed Friday that it was the “victim of a fraud” at the hands of Crypto Capital, a payment processor that allegedly lost $880 million of Bitfinex’s money.

Speaking as part of the 18th collective study of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee on Thursday in Beijing, Xi said blockchain technology has a wide array of applications within China, listing topics ranging from financing businesses to mass transit and poverty alleviation.  “We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies,” Xi told committee members.  “[We must] clarify the main direction, increase investment, focus on a number of key core technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain technology and industrial innovation.”  The Chinese president’s statements on blockchain are believed to be his first in-depth remarks on the technology.  Xi further said it would be “necessary to implement the rule of law network” into existing and future blockchain systems. To this end, Xi argued for a top-down approach concerning implementation, calling for guidance and regulation. Xi said testing of the tech should be widespread, including the investments in training platforms and ""innovation teams"" before implementation.

42403435,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfwuI,1572001216,Bitcoin Charts 'Death Cross' After 47% Price Drop From 2019 High,"View  Bitcoin has charted a so-called death cross with recent the drop to $7,400. The bearish cross comes as a result of the 47 percent slide from the 2019 high of $13,800, and as such is a lagging indicator.  Historical data shows BTC tends to bottom out after a death cross.  The cryptocurrency has picked up a bid at press time, but is yet to invalidate the bearish case with a move above the Sept. 30 low of$7,714.      A long-term bitcoin price indicator has turned bearish, courtesy of the cryptocurrency's sharp drop in the last four months.  The 50-day moving price average (MA) crossed below the 200-day MA today, confirming a ""death cross"" for the first time since March 31, 2018, according to Bitstamp data.  The long-term bearish cross was preceded by a sharp drop from the 2019 high of $13,880 (June 26) to the low of $7,293 (Oct. 23).  To put it another way, the death cross is the product of the 47 percent slide from the high of $13,880. After all, the 50-day MA responds to the data that is at least 2.5-months old and the 200-day MA is sensitive to 6.5-month old data.  Daily chart  BTC topped out at $13,880 on June 26 and fell back to $9,000 in mid-July. The 50-day MA, however, continued to rise and topped out in mid-August, 6 weeks after BTC topped out above $13,800.  Meanwhile, the 200-day MA maintained an upward trajectory throughout the sell-off from $13,880 to recent lows below $7,300.  Currently, the 200-day MA is sidelined near $8,895 and the 50-day MA is trending south and is now around $8,890.  All-in-all, it seems safe to conclude that the death cross is a lagging indicator and happens when most of the correction has already taken place, as tweeted by popular trader @CryptoTutor following the confirmation of the bearish cross on March 31, 2018.  As seen above, the April 2014 death cross marked a major bottom in BTC from where the cryptocurrency rallied 100 percent.  It's worth noting the bearish crossovers seen in September 2015 and April 2018 trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market, as discussed last Friday.  The latest bear cross poses the same threat, as prices have already dropped more than 45 percent. In fact, BTC is showing signs of life on confirmation of the death cross.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,600 on Bitstamp, having picked up a bid near $7,393 earlier today. That said, it is still too early to call a bullish reversal.  Daily chart  The range breakdown confirmed on Wednesday is intact. Further, 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The relative strength index's (RSI) downside break of the ascending trendline is also a bearish development.  BTC, therefore, remains on the hunt for a drop to key support levels at $7,200 (three-day chart 100-candle MA) and $7,000 (three-day chart 200-candle MA).  The bearish setup on the daily chart will remain valid as long as prices are holding below the former support-turned-resistance of $7,714.  The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices rise above $8,314 (Oct. 21 high). That would also validate the argument that the death cross is a contrary indicator.

Announced Friday  by Bittrex, the extension is the second since the Seattle-based exchange was denied a regulatory license to operate in the state in early April, colloquially called the BitLicense.  Originally, Bittrex customers were given until June 8 to withdraw deposits on the exchange which was bumped to Oct. 24 with permission from the DFS  The state regulator had withheld licensing from Bittrex due to poor customer and transaction monitoring along with a lack of qualified staff, the executive deputy superintendent of banking for the NYDFS, Shirin Emami, said in an April CoinDesk opinion article.  New York’s BitLicense – largely considered the most rigorous state regulatory framework in the U.S. – has recently come under revision from the regulator itself.  Speaking at DC Fintech Week Oct 22, NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell said the body is reviewing its standards in light of the industry's evolution.  “This is a good time to take a look, a responsible look and see how our regime is fitting the current market and … what if any adjustments should we think about making to continue to adapt to ... a changing industry,” she said at the time.

Dorsey replied with a conclusive “Hell no” on the question of his firm's potential membership of the Facebook-led crypto payments scheme at a New York City-based Twitter event.  As The Verge reported Thursday, he explained that Libra is not based on an open standard, ""born on the internet,"" and as such:  “It was born out of a company’s intention, and it’s not consistent with what I personally believe and what I want our company to stand for.”  Dorsey  further argued that Libra didn't have to be built around a cryptocurrency to fulfill its purpose.  A noted bitcoin and lightning network advocate, Dorsey launched Square Crypto earlier this year for open development on the bitcoin network. In August, Square Crypto hired bitcoin developer Matt Corallo followed by three other dev hires in September from Facebook, Lightning Labs, and Google.  At the New York event, Dorsey also responded to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before the U.S. House Financial Service Committee on Wednesday, according to tweets from The Hollywood Reporter journalist Alex Weprin.  “A lot of it seemed to be based in American tradition,” Dorsey said. “I fear that if we base too much in this one concept, we take away the ability to experiment and expand.”  Dorsey added:  “We are not just serving an American audience, we are serving a global audience ... The internet is somewhat of an emerging nation-state.""  In his hearing, Zuckerberg notably said Facebook would be compelled to leave the Libra Association if the project went live before meeting regulatory requirements. The Libra Association is still seeking some 80 additional members before the expected mid-to-late 2020 launch, according to a Libra representative speaking with CoinDesk earlier this month.
