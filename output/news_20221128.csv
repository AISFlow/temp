42413567,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9sha,1669677553,Aave Supporters Say Lending Freeze Will Help Transition the Network,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave is freezing borrowing and lending of assets in its Ethereum liquidity pool after a vote by its community of token holders aimed at mitigating risk – and in preparation for upgrading its protocol.  The Ethereum liquidity pool is the largest on Aave, which has $5.6 billion in liquidity locked across six chains on the protocol. It will sunset trading on 17 assets, including curve (CRV), 1inch (1INCH), yearn finance (YFI) and several stablecoins.  The proposal, written by decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure company Gauntlet Network, is meant to avoid the risk of Aave accruing bad debt. It will help the protocol move from its version (v)2 to v3 version by giving users the option to migrate their assets to the upgraded network, according to the company.  Nick Cannon, vice president of growth at Gauntlet, told CoinDesk the proposal was also prompted by insolvency issues with the curve token. Aave held $1.5 million in bad debt after a trader borrowed 20 million CRV from Aave to crypto exchange OKX, shorting the coin and tanking its price.  Cannon said that while returning these tokens online is up to the Aave community, they will likely return to the protocol operable on its v3 chain. He also noted that these tokens comprise about 5% of Aave's total value locked (TVL).  Additionally, two separate additional proposals to pause borrowing on Uniswap and Chainlink passed on Sunday. Cannon noted that these tokens, a part of the Ethereum liquidity pool, were added to ensure the “robust tokens” were included in their effort to keep the assets safe.  The protocol has been slow and steady in its move to deploy more assets on its v3 network over the past year. In January, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the protocol would begin to deploy its v3 upgrade across seven chains, including Ethereum.  On Monday, the Aave community voted in an off-chain poll to allow users to migrate 26 assets in the Ethereum liquidity pool to the v3 network.  Currently, the upgraded versions of Aave runs atop layer 1 blockchain networks Avalanche, Fantom, and Harmony, as well as Ethereum-based layer 2 networks Arbitrum, Polygon and Optimism.",NEUTRAL,CRV | YFI,1INCH | BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | ETH | YFI,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/28/aave-supporters-say-lending-freeze-will-help-transition-the-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b63dea5f1777a825569ecd1e4695fac2b2a11f6e-1456x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Generally, lenders were unwilling to engage with crypto firms including FTX given their high risk profiles. In an effort to circumvent that issue, FTX and Alameda shared a tangled relationship, in which some FTX customers were told to send wire transfers through Alameda, which was allowed to have accounts at digital asset-focused bank Silvergate Capital ( SI ), Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge on the matter. Silvergate ( SI ) stock, meanwhile, slid 8.8% in after-hours trading. The Federal Reserve member bank, which allows its customers to transfer fiat currency such as U.S. dollars into crypto exchanges, recently disclosed that its exposure to FTX was less than 10% of its digital asset customer deposits totaling $11.9B as of September 30. The people added that some FTX customers kept sending wire transfers as recently as 2022. FTX, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier in November, did not immediately respond to Seeking Alpha's request for comment. The FTX-Alameda relationship was one of the first and primary triggers that ended up imploding SBF's crypto empire, so this news further spotlights their financial arrangement amid concerns about the misuse of client funds. “It’s very bad practice and risk management in any book to mingle your customer funds with counterparty funds and other funds,” Alma Angotti, a partner at consulting firm Guidehouse, told Bloomberg. “This is a complicated set of facts and it’s hard to say at this point what was violated.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  BlockFi has about $257 million in cash on hand and a Bermuda-based affiliate is also filing for liquidation in a similar process, according to a press release.  According to the company's petition, BlockFi's executives estimate the company has more than 100,000 creditors, and checked off the ranges. Executives estimate the company has between $1 billion and $10 billion in both assets and liabilities.  The company's largest creditors include West Realm Shires Inc., the legal name for FTX US, which has a $275 million unsecured claim, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has a $30 million unsecured claim. The majority of the other top 50 creditors' names were not shared.  A rocky year: BlockFi, which suspended withdrawals a few weeks ago due to the ongoing confusion about FTX's assets, has faced a lot of setbacks. The company liquidated a large client earlier this year, and it needed a line of credit from FTX to survive.  The lender was set to raise funding at a $1 billion down round valuation in June, after raising $350 million at a $3 billion valuation in March 2021. As recently as July 2021, the company was looking to go public within the next 18 months, with a potential $500 million fundraise coming soon.  Other News  Bitcoin (BTC) slid around 2% amid news that crypto lender BlockFi had filed for bankruptcy protection earlier in the day. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading around $16,200, down 1.9% in the past 24 hours.  The MakerDAO community rejected a proposal to use up to $500 million of the stablecoin USDC to invest in bonds with crypto investment firm CoinShares. As CoinDesk's Krisztian Sandor reported, CoinShares had proposed managing between 100 million and 500 million USDC and actively investing the money in a portfolio of corporate debt securities and government-backed bonds with the aim of returning a yield matching the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. On Monday, some 72% of votes were cast against the proposal.  Equity markets fell amid widespread protests against Covid lockdowns in China. The S&P 500 index dropped by 1.5% at closing.

Investors typically transfer coins to centralized exchanges when they intend to sell or use the coins as a margin in derivatives trading.

4894953,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560921-coinbase-beware-massive-risks?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1669674091,Coinbase: Beware The Massive Risks,"Summary Coinbase stock is excessively risky by just about every metric. It's risky going by reported fundamentals, as well as recent developments in the crypto industry. I consider the stock a sell, in the sense of 'get rid of your exposure to it.' I do not mean you should short it, because that's a very risky bet too. The company is subject to immense uncertainty, and is best avoided. Coinbase Global ( COIN ) stock took a dip last week when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices crashed along with the FTX crypto exchange. An exchange itself, Coinbase shares similarities with FTX, making it a natural target for contagion worries. FTT crash shown on Bitcoin chart (Seeking Alpha Quant (annotations by author)) Coinbase, like FTX, is subject to minimal regulations when compared to conventional financial services companies. Regulations like required capital ratios are required to prevent banks from failing , but they do not apply to crypto exchanges. Coinbase, as a listed stock, is subject to SEC requirements like reporting its financial position and disclosing corporate/manager holdings, but it is not subject to the Basel III capital adequacy rules which govern conventional banks. In other words, it isn't required by law or treaty to hold certain amounts of cash, to weight its assets by risk, and all of the other things that are commonplace in non-crypto finance. Given this, you can't fault investors for pulling out of COIN when FTX went under. The two exchanges are subject to the same risk factors. The FTX situation has been summarized on Seeking Alpha many times before. In case you missed it, the basic rundown is: FTX was an exchange that let people buy and sell cryptocurrencies. It transferred $10 billion to its investment arm, Alameda Capital. Alameda held a lot of FTT (FTT-USD), FTX's own token. Alameda's balance sheet leaked, revealing that it would become insolvent if FTT declined sufficiently. Upon hearing news of the solvency issue, Changpeng ""CZ'' Zhao, the CEO of Binance, publicly announced he would sell all of his FTT. That resulted in more people trying to sell their FTT, and remove their cash balances from FTX. But because $10 billion had been transferred to Alameda, which lost the money, the withdrawals could not be processed. Shortly afterward, FTX filed for bankruptcy . At this point, the FTX situation is in the past. The company is finding assets in its bankruptcy proceedings , so some users may be partially compensated, but it's unlikely that all will be made whole. Coinbase is another matter entirely. The company's stock has been selling off on the perceived risk of FTX contagion, but the exact nature of Coinbase's exposure to FTX is unclear. Brian Armstrong, the company's CEO, has said that Coinbase has no exposure at all , but the exchange still has a 'buy FTT' button on its website. At any rate, direct exposure isn't required for a contagion effect to kick in. ""Financial contagion"" refers to the tendency of weakness in a small part of a system to affect the whole-you don't need a direct connection to the source to be affected by it. If FTX's collapse causes people to leave the cryptocurrency space altogether, then Coinbase will likely see an increase in withdrawals, and lower trading volume after the dust settles. That will take a bite out of its earnings; therefore, it is a risk factor for COIN shareholders. Furthermore, Coinbase is exposed to two separate types of regulatory risk. It is at risk of increased regulations, which many think are coming, as they will increase compliance costs. It is also at risk of inadequate regulations, in that it's not required to keep certain amounts of cash like banks are. A March article in Australia's Financial Review stated that a senate committee explored capital adequacy rules for crypto exchanges , which implies they weren't governed by them at the time of publication (earlier this year). Furthermore, Financial Review posted no follow-up to the story, which it likely would have had the rules passed. Extensive searching by the author found no evidence of regulators in other countries even considering capital adequacy rules for crypto exchanges, but did find evidence of capital adequacy rules for broker-dealers and custodians. In other words, banks, brokers, and custodians are all operating under capital adequacy rules to one extent or another, only crypto exchanges are exempt! COIN's balance sheet reveals the kinds of things one might expect of a company un-bound by capital adequacy rules. As of November 2022 Coinbase lists USDC Coin as part of its ' cash and equivalents ' in its balance sheet, which suggests that its capital position may be shaky. Treating crypto as cash is exactly what got FTX into trouble; the $10 billion transfer to Alameda wouldn't have been a problem had FTT held its value. Now, in Coinbase's case, the real cash vastly outstrips the stablecoin ""cash""; USDC is only 6.5% of COIN's cash balance. But in principle, the risk is there. Earlier this year, the world witnessed the stablecoin LUNA (LUNC-USD) lose its peg to the dollar , demonstrating that stablecoins aren't always as stable as they purport to be. Coinbase is similar to other crypto companies in that it counts crypto among its assets, which can lead to liquidity issues if various 'coins' lose their value. My Thesis Defined My investment thesis on Coinbase is quite simple: The stock is too risky to own. For investors with typical risk tolerance and time horizons, it entails too great a probability of permanently losing capital. Coinbase's recent 10-Q says it holds $95 billion in crypto assets for customers, yet it only has about $5.5 billion in cash and equivalents. Would this company be able to process all of its customers' withdrawals were they to suddenly head for the exits and demand conversion of Bitcoin to cash? It's hard to say. What we know is that Coinbase is now liable for any losses customers incur as per SEC guidelines. According to Seeking Alpha Contributor Frances Coppola , the SEC recently decided to force crypto exchanges to count customer assets as their own. As a result, exchanges like COIN are liable should customer assets go missing, so if Coinbase has an FTX moment, shareholders stand to lose it all. The risk of Coinbase declining further is substantial; therefore, a person identical to me in risk tolerance and time horizon, who invests based on the 'margin of safety' principle, should sell it. By this, I do not mean to say that anybody should short COIN, or speculate on its short-term price swings. By 'sell,' I mean: if you have exposure, you'd be better off reducing it -assuming that you are identical to me in every way. For me, if an asset is subject to immense risks, it's not a buy. I'll admit there's a non-zero chance of cryptocurrencies rallying and causing COIN to rally alongside them, but for me, the risks (including the regulatory factors discussed above along with quantitative factors I'll explore below) make the risk/reward tradeoff not worth it. A highly risk-seeking individual might have legitimate reasons for disagreeing. If you don't factor risk into your decision process at all, viewing each investment in terms of the 'best case scenario,' COIN could be worth it. Next Quarter Likely to be Weak I'm pretty skeptical of COIN as a long-term bet, but I'm even more skeptical of its upcoming quarterly release. Cointelegraph recently reported that crypto trading volumes fell 24% in the Month of October. The article framed the low volume as a positive (""not that many people are selling OR buying,"") and perhaps it is bullish for crypto as a whole. Nevertheless, the low volume is bearish for Coinbase. If Cointelegraph is right that crypto volumes declined 24% in October, then COIN's revenue is likely to be soft for the whole fourth quarter. The FTX collapse might have triggered a sudden spike in trading, but COIN's fees are a function of transaction size as well as volume. So, a panic-induced trading spike might not even increase COIN's revenue. Indeed, Coinbase's revenue growth has been negative for some time now. According to Seeking Alpha Quant , the company's trailing 12-month (""TTM"") growth rates were: -14.9% in revenue. -97% in EBITDA. -5.6% in book value. Not a pretty picture. And if you look at COIN's most recent 10-Q, you'll see that it covered the period ending September 30. The company shrank, and the FTX fiasco plus the October volume decline hadn't even occurred yet! The upcoming release will include the impacts of these events, so it could miss by a wide margin. Valuation All of the above has bearing on COIN's valuation. One of the points Coinbase bulls tout about the company is the fact that it's ""cheap."" Indeed, by the standards of recently listed tech stocks, it appears to be that way. At today's prices, it trades at : 1.98 times sales. 1.8 times book value. A 1.79 EV/sales ratio. These metrics aren't too bad. The problem is that Coinbase's revenues and earnings are shrinking. When revenue and earnings are trending downward, trailing multiples mean nothing, because they don't reflect the likely future outcome. Seeking Alpha quant already has a 3.25 forward price/book estimate on Coinbase, and that could go higher if cryptocurrencies fall further on lower volume (assuming the stock price doesn't fall more). Shorting is Risky As I explained earlier, Coinbase is-for me personally-a stock to avoid. If I had any I'd sell it. It's for this reason that you see a 'sell' rating next to this article. I do not have that rating there to encourage anybody to short Coinbase, for reasons I'll explain below. One problem with betting on a stock like COIN is the fact that so many variables that go into its valuation are unknowable. Its financial performance is basically a function of crypto prices and trading volume. But as I wrote in my recent article "" Bitcoin is Basically a Coin Flip ,"" you can't value cryptocurrencies using any conventional valuation techniques. Crypto doesn't produce cash flows that you can discount back to the present. The closest thing to fundamentals it has-real world transactional use-is impossible to know. A blockchain doesn't record whether a crypto is being exchanged for cash or a product, it just tells you when a token exchanges hands. So, we can't accurately measure the ""Bitcoin economy"" that would have to exist for BTC to be other than a bubble. We know it exists, based on stores accepting Bitcoin, but its size is impossible to gauge. Therefore, cryptocurrencies-COIN's bread and butter-can't be valued The Bottom Line The bottom line on Coinbase is that it's one of the riskiest stocks out there right now. Interest rates are rising, crypto exchanges are going bust, stablecoins are losing their dollar pegs, and nobody knows when it will end. Given its utility to people who have drawn the ire of the government, crypto will likely retain some positive value for the foreseeable future. But the exchanges it trades on rarely prove to be good investments. Whether you're a bull, a bear, or something in between, you can find better opportunities than Coinbase.",NEGATIVE,BTC | FTT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560921-coinbase-beware-massive-risks?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4894953.jpeg

42413568,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9siW,1669673092,Israel’s Ministry of Finance Proposes New Guidelines for Regulating Digital Assets,"Israel's Ministry of Finance published a set of recommendations Monday for the regulation of digital assets, advancing the country’s foray into the world of cryptocurrencies.  The recommendations call for the creation of a new regulatory infrastructure, legislating licensing powers and supervision over the issuance of backed digital assets, including stablecoins, and the provision of financial services through them. The recommendations also call for legislation to be passed that would transfer supervision over digital assets “that have a significant stability or monetary effect” to the Bank of Israel.  The guidelines also include a proposal for allowing the payment of taxes on crypto held abroad through the Bank of Israel. In addition, the proposal would establish an inter-ministerial committee to oversee the regulation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  The taxation of cryptocurrencies comprises a major part of the proposal. According to Israel’s tax authority, uncollected crypto taxes from 2019 to 2022 could amount to several billion shekels (one shekel is worth about US29 cents).  Israeli officials have been dipping their toes into the digital asset industry in recent months. In October, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) revealed it was looking into establishing a blockchain-based digital asset trading platform.

42420782,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYGtR,1669672613,Ukrainian Government Puts Binance Payment Service Integration on Hold,"Ukraine has paused its planned integration of Binance's crypto payment service into the government's official app after backlash by the embattled nation’s crypto community.  That integration is now on hold to “clarify a few moments” first, according to a government minister.  The outrage was prompted by the government’s plans to integrate the service from the world’s largest exchange by volume at a time when Binance continues to do business with Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February. The nation's crypto exchanges don't want a foreign company to provide a service they can do as well. They showed their displeasure by blocking trades of Binance's BNB token on their platforms.  Binance had integrated its know-your-customer (KYC) process into Ukraine's Diia mobile app in late October, local crypto news media Forklog reported. Diia allows Ukrainians to make digital copies of their state-issued documents and government services online.  The article included no official comment from the Ministry of Digital Transformation, the government body responsible for the IT development of Ukraine that spearheaded the development and adoption of Diia.  Using the Binance system would allow Ukrainians to register on the crypto exchange faster by using their Diia profile, said Kyrylo Khomyakov, Binance’s general manager in Ukraine, to Forklog.  Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister of digital transformation, told CoinDesk the integration could, in principle, go further and include crypto payments in Diia via Binance.  “Diia already has some functionality for payments, and building in a crypto on-ramp is generally a good idea,” he said. But not for now.  Bornyakov added that Ukraine’s government can only use services that only services that satisfy the requirements of the law, which is currently only being developed. “After those criteria are ready, they will be published and everyone interested will be able to apply for potential integrations,” he said.  A Binance spokesperson said in a written statement to CoinDesk that ""it’s early to discuss the initiative.""  Binance “suggested our expertise and technology for integrating blockchain into the government services when the government is ready and choses preferred areas for that,” said the spokesperson.  Public protest  One of those ""moments"" that need clarification might be the immediate negative feedback from the local crypto community. Exchanges Kuna, WhiteBit and crypto lending service Trustee Plus filed a petition to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky asking him to block the move. They also froze trading of BNB, Binance’s token, on their platforms.  “All the attention now is on Binance, and local exchanges are upset,” said a Ukrainian crypto entrepreneur who asked not to be named.  The head of Trustee Plus, Vadym Hrusha, told CoinDesk that it’s simply wrong to integrate a government service with a foreign company. Ukraine has its own local crypto exchanges and payment services, “with a product no worse than Binance,” he said, referring to Kuna and WhiteBit, both of which have their own payment services.  While Kuna, WhiteBit and Trustee are all officially registered outside Ukraine, the founders and teams are Ukrainian, and all three used to be based in the country before relocating after the invasion of Ukraine.  “It’s not patriotic and not safe for the government,” Hrusha said. “Plus, Binance is a Chinese company, and China is not Ukraine’s friend. We don’t know what data they are sending and to whom. Any moment, we (Ukrainians) can get banned.”  Binance does not advertise itself as a Chinese company, and the exchange's founder and CEO, Changeng Zhao, while born in China, grew up in Canada. He has long insisted that Binance is not a Chinese firm.  Sanctions issue  Hrusha said that Binance “does not have a straightforward position on Ukraine” because the exchange did not exclude Russian users, as some European and U.S. exchanges did after the latest round of European Union sanctions against Russia. Zhao has said that Binance’s EU entities won’t serve Russians, but other company branches don’t necessarily have to expel Russian users.  This stance did not satisfy the Ukrainian crypto community. Michael Chobanyan, CEO of Kuna exchange, told CoinDesk the community effectively blocked the integration project. Chobanyan also wants Binance to remove trading pairs with the Russian ruble, which, he believes, helps Russians evade sanctions.  Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February and started a full-scale war, relations between the two countries’ crypto communities have deteriorated. For Chobanyan the final straw was this fall’s Blockchain Life conference in Moscow, which went ahead as scheduled despite Russia’s assault on its neighbor.  “There is a war in my country, houses are ruined, all my childhood memories destroyed, and at the same time they are doing a conference, talking about how great everything is,” Chobanyan said. He added after being against crypto sanctions at first, he has now become more radical.  “Either you work in Russia, or you work in the civilized world,” he said.  A Ukrainian crypto entrepreneur, who asked not to be quoted by name, told CoinDesk that Ukrainian startups are reaching out to him and asking to remove support for Binance Smart Chain, in protest against Binance.  He admitted he would be glad if Binance would remove Russian ruble trading pairs to inflict additional pressure on Russians and encourage them to do something about their political regime waging war in Ukraine.

42413275,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8HpM,1669671322,DeFi Giant MakerDAO Voting on Hiking DAI Stablecoin Rewards,"Decentralized finance giant MakerDAO's community is voting on increasing the annual reward for its DAI stablecoin up to 1%.  Community members are casting their ranked-choice vote through Dec. 1 to hike the so-called DAI Savings Rate to either 1%, 0.75%, 0.5%, 0.25% or leave it unchanged from its current 0.01% rate. MakerDAO initiated the vote on Monday.  At the time of publication, all votes favored raising the rate to 1%. This may change as more voters cast their preference.  The voting is occurring as yields in decentralized finance (DeFi) have plummeted amid lower appetite for crypto lending. Meanwhile, yields in traditional markets have increased dramatically due to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to raise interest rates, which has exacerbated the capital flight from DeFi.  For example, investors of the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, may earn slightly more than 1% annually by lending their holdings. This is a significantly lower annual rate than investing in U.S. Treasury bonds, which yield around 4% and are considered the least risky investments.  MakerDAO’s revenue boon  Increasing the reward is possible as Maker boosted its revenue by putting a part of its $7.7 billion in reserves to work. The strategy consists of teaming up with institutional investors such as Coinbase and allocating in multiple yield-generating investment strategies, including investing in traditional assets like government bonds.  A part of that new-found revenue should be redistributed to DAI holders to make the stablecoin more attractive for crypto investors, prominent MakerDAO contributors Sebastien Derivaux and Sam MacPherson said earlier this month.  As Maker increasingly invests in assets outside digital assets, it may offer a way to capture the rising yields in traditional markets while simultaneously mitigating capital outflows from crypto, MacPherson argued in a tweet.  “Banks are offering 4%+ in risk-free yield. We should do the same,” he wrote in a tweet.  In a forum discussion earlier this month, Derivaux said that raising the reward would also make DAI more competitive compared to rival stablecoins.  “We could expect that such a move would incentivize USDC holders to migrate to lend DAI instead,” Derivaux wrote in his proposal. “On the other hand, this would be a significant cost for MakerDAO.”",POSITIVE,DAI,BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | MKR | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/28/defi-giant-makerdao-holds-voting-on-hiking-dai-stablecoin-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97680ac486719a8a5b760015e03428c85845dcce-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX contagion hampers sentiment,"Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) tokens dipped 9.4% in Monday afternoon trading as the dominoes continue to fall from the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX thus hurting investor sentiment. The FTX aftermath has come to the point where crypto lender BlockFi, which has deep ties to Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and reportedly warned of mass layoffs. The news extended the bearish trend seen in major cryptos, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) testing its $16K technical support level during late morning trading. The token, though, has since eased some of those losses, now down 2.2% to $16.20K as of shortly before 4:30 p.m. ET. Doge ( DOGE-USD ), the world's largest meme coin by market cap, saw similar price action throughout the session, having slid as much as 12.9% before slightly trimming those losses, now changing hands at $0.09. Overall, the crypto market cap stood at $820.9B, off 2.6% over the past day, according to CoinMarketCap data . It's worth noting that all three major U.S. stock indices finished Monday's session in the red due to concerns about interest rates , shutdowns in China and ongoing instability in the crypto ecosystem.

In the high timeframe, the price of Solana (SOL) looks weak, with a probable result of a downtrend movement compared to an upside. Despite the relief bounce and uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, the FTX fiasco continues to act as a catalyst for the market to bottom out. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other large investors has stalled the market, as it has yet to make a significant move, raising concerns about the market’s direction.

Many altcoins are struggling for survival, trying to stay afloat as the prices of altcoins continue a downward price movement. With so much news of a capitulation imminent for all crypto assets coupled with the FTX and other crypto projects suffering from bankruptcy, the bottom could be in soon. SOL’s price had a weekly close below a crucial area of $20 after showing so much strength rallying from a weekly low of $11 to a high of $14.5 as the price was unable to break above $20. The price of $20 remains the key area of interest for SOL to resume a relief bounce; trading below this range isn’t good enough for bulls. Weekly resistance for the price of SOL – $20. Weekly support for the price of SOL – $10. Price Analysis Of SOL On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of SOL remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe after closing below $20. With SOL’s price unable to break and close above $20, there are growing chances of price retesting the regions of $5. SOL’s price currently trades at $13.5 below the 50 and 200 EMA, acting as resistance for the price of SOL from trading higher. The price of SOL needs to break above $21 and $40 for the price of SOL to kickstart the price recovery plan. Daily resistance for the SOL price – $15. Daily support for the SOL price – $10.

Former CFTC Commissioner Timothy Massad recently suggested the agency and the SEC work together on a self-regulatory organization (SRO) to set clear guidelines about which agency should oversee crypto.  “‘Are there regulatory gaps?”’ Mersinger asked. “We have identified that they do exist.

42413572,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9smG,1669666531,Wrapped Bitcoin Trades at Discount Amid Market Contagion,"The market contagion from crypto exchange FTX’s swift collapse has spread to a key digital asset: wrapped bitcoin, a widely traded clone of the largest cryptocurrency.  According to a new report from crypto analysis firm Kaiko, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, has traded at a discount to bitcoin’s price since Sam Bankman-Fried's embattled FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11.  Kaiko said WBTC’s discount dropped to as low as 1.5% Friday after investors reacted to questions posed on Twitter about whether WBTC is fully backed. The rumor was based on data from Messari's dashboard on Dune Analysis that says FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research, was a top WBTC merchant by the number of tokens minted.  Chen Fang, chief operating officer for BitGo, WBTC's official custodian, quickly clarified that every WBTC is “1:1 backed and verifiable on-chain.”  Friday’s rumors “appear to be unfounded” as Alameda would have needed to send all BTC to BitGo, meaning that the now-defunct exchange “never actually took custody of the BTC themselves,” the Kaiko report stated.  “Alameda was a ‘WBTC merchant,’ which means they’d accept BTC from customers and send it to BitGo to mint WBTC,” crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer tweeted. “Alameda NEVER custodied BTC themselves!”  Despite the clarification, WBTC’s discount is still at 0.5%, according to Kaiko.  Wrapped assets like WBTC are meant to be pegged to the value of the original asset. They are often used for trading, lending and borrowing on decentralized-finance (DeFi) platforms.  Bitcoin (BTC)’s price was recently trading at $16,143 Monday, while WBTC was changing hands at $16,112.  Altcoin liquidity worsens  FTX’s fallout gave birth to a phenomenon that Kaiko analysts previously have termed the “Alameda Gap” – a drop in liquidity across various crypto assets in the market, and altcoins’ liquidity took the hits more.  Kaiko said market makers are providing liquidity “asymmetrically, with spreads widening a lot more for higher-beta altcoins.”  By comparing the average daily spreads for the top altcoins by market cap on the Binance and Coinbase exchanges in the weeks before and after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, Kaiko found that Solana’s SOL token had seen its spreads widen the most, “tripling from 2.1bps (basis points) to 7.4bps on Binance.”  SOL’s price has been falling sharply given its close ties with FTX/Alameda – plunging 59% in the past month. CoinDesk first reported on Alameda's balance sheet on Nov. 2 that the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.”  “Alameda was one of the most important market makers for some small-cap altcoins, while other major market makers registered losses and are likely to review their risk controls, which could impact liquidity in the short term,” the report from Kaiko said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/28/wrapped-bitcoin-trades-at-discount-amid-market-contagion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c155db4cae860f57b6574afbb5ec4a56543d0b0-1288x694.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptocurrencies were also in focus after lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy. Markets are coming off a holiday-shortened Thanksgiving week which saw all three major indices make muted gains amid a lull in trading. Going into the last hour of trading, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP.IND ) was down 1.50% at 11,057.65 points. The benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) was 1.52 % lower at 3,965.07 points, while the blue-chip Dow ( DJI ) f ell 1.41% to 33,863.58 points. All 11 S&P sectors were in the red, with Real Estate and Energy the top losers. Crude prices ( CL1:COM ) rallied after initially being weighed down by worries over Chinese demand. Reports of protests against China's tough COVID measures in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have rattled overall global sentiment. ""China stocks have tumbled today, largely as a result of the COVID-19 protests,"" David Townsend, managing director of EMEA Business at Value Partners Group, said. ""However, there has recently been a dramatic change in market sentiment, with policymakers in China unleashing different sets of policy support for private property developers. In addition, while the country is still maintaining its rhetoric on the 'dynamic zero-Covid policy', it also released measures to fine-tune the policy. These, together with the lower-than-expected CPI figures in the US last month (which ignited renewed expectations of monetary policy pivoting in the US), have stimulated a strong 'risk on' momentum in the China stock market,"" Townsend added. U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks such as Alibaba ( BABA ), JD.com ( JD ) and Bilibili ( BILI ) made modest gains . Comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who warned that markets could be underpricing the risk that the Fed may be more aggressive with rate hikes next year, also weighed on investors. On the other hand, New York Fed President John Williams in an online speech said that the rapid pace of rate hikes have started to lower demand in the U.S. economy and that a number of factors are improving in regard to inflation. Crypto lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy on Monday, putting pressure on crypto markets. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was down about 2%. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) fell ~4% following a large ETH transfer to Binance. Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) slipped nearly 3% after a Bloomberg report said production of iPhones could face a shortfall by as many as 6M units due to unrest at the tech giant's Chinese manufacturing hub. Turning to the bond markets, rates were mixed. The 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) was flat at 3.70%. The 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was down 1 basis point to 4.47%. In economic data, the calendar is very light. The November Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey came in at -14.4 versus a prior reading of -19.4. Consumer and retails stocks were also in focus as shoppers transition from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. Foot traffic on Black Friday fell sharply , according to a report.

Many institutions will now likely view crypto as toxic until it is brought onshore and regulated. New regulations will surely emerge but may not be the ones people have been hoping for. We don’t see this bringing on the demise of Bitcoin and crypto but we do see it significantly altering their trajectory. Co-authored by Steven Moffitt, PhD “ It’s really important that the industry is able to get through this in one piece. It’s not going to be good for anyone long-term if we have real pain, if we have real blowouts. It’s not fair to customers. ” Sam Bankman-Fried in an interview with CNBC explaining why he previously gave millions in loans to help struggling crypto firms Intro In a stunningly quick upheaval, the financial empire and multi-billion-dollar personal fortune of Sam Bankman-Fried (aka SBF) collapsed. FTX, formerly the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, its sister company Alameda Research, and some 130 related entities all filed for bankruptcy on November 11th. The native crypto token FTT ( FTT-USD ), issued by FTX and selling at more than $20 each just days prior, became essentially worthless. Billions in corporate value, token value, crypto, and real money either disappeared or evaporated within hours. Hundreds of employees dispersed, and an array of lawsuits & investigations are already underway. Complicating matters for US customers and investors hoping to recover any of their assets is the fact that the tragedy played out almost entirely beyond US shores in Hong Kong, Antigua & Barbuda, and the Bahamas. An appointed bankruptcy expert has taken over as CEO and will take on the responsibility of assessing the damage, sorting out the mess, overseeing the liquidation, and determining whether customers, debtors, employees, or any others will recover any of their assets. They can expect to wait months, if not years to find out. In the bankruptcy filing for FTX, the newly appointed CEO remarked ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented."" While giving Hollywood a gift of one of the best made-for-tv scripts since Bernie Madoff, the FTX saga represents yet another major shock to the digital asset world, already suffering from one of its worst declines ever. While media outlets are jumping on the story to reveal the juicy tidbits of SBFs unusual lifestyle, this article aims to go past the headlines and offer perspectives on what investors might expect. Astute investors understand that flameouts in financial markets will occur from time to time and recognize that superior investing opportunities can often emerge from market crises. In addition, they understand that some of the largest upsides in financial assets have occurred following large downward moves. But they can also focus on the risks. We examine this situation in this context. Riskless vs. Reckless Sam Bankman-Fried’s initial foray into crypto trading (after only a few years of post-college work experience at a trading firm) was to exploit anomalies in global crypto prices through his own trading operation at Alameda Research. The arbitrage he engaged in was a form of price arbitrage that is performed every day by banks, trading houses, brokers, hedge funds, and others in the US. It is a golden opportunity for a computer geek with a knowledge of international exchanges and access to a great deal of capital, especially in nascent, unregulated markets like cryptos that are globally dispersed and in 2017-18 still somewhat inefficient. In an interview with CNBC , SBF explained that in 2018 there was a rapidly growing interest in cryptos from Japan and Korea, creating prices that were higher than those in the US by as much as 10% or more. He reasoned that he could throw $10 million at an arbitrage strategy whereby he purchased on a US exchange, and then sold in Japan, he could walk away with a million in profit for each transaction. Supposedly, he was able to execute this technique to the tune of $20 million or more in profit. (Where he got the original $10 million bankroll is unknown.) Buying assets on one exchange and selling them on another can essentially be riskless, assuming it is done simultaneously and that there are no counterparty or settlement risks to contend with. There would, however, be a cost for the necessary currency conversions. This can work for a while in inefficient markets, but other traders would ultimately figure that out as well and once they did, the trade would essentially become “arbbed out”, driving the profits down to pennies on the dollar. The fact that Alameda started having big trading losses when crypto prices began falling suggests that it moved on from riskless arbitrage to higher-risk trading with heavy leverage. The details of how SBF's initial trading operation at Alameda Research blossomed into billions have not yet been fully revealed. Nonetheless, it reportedly did, and in just a few years. The capital necessary to support all that trading would have been immense. It’s understood that SBF created the FTX exchange, at least in part, to generate capital to feed Alameda’s trading machine and probably also to give his trading company a captive venue through which to trade. In return, Alameda produced the lion’s share of trading activity on FTX. This cozy relationship all but assured that the fate of both FTX and Alameda trading would be completely entwined – something US regulations would never have allowed. In addition, Alameda Research held most of the FTT tokens – the native crypto one needs to have in order to trade on the FTX exchange. This is where value gets created out of thin air throughout the crypto world (and elsewhere!). The token costs almost nothing to create but is required for trading on the FTX exchange. Think of it as a membership cost for an exclusive club. As trading expands, club membership increases in value. Alameda Research does most of the trading on FTX and holds most of the tokens. As they increase in value, it then uses those tokens as collateral for loans to conduct more highly leveraged trades. Bear in mind that “ Owners of FTT were promised lower trading costs and the ability to earn interest and rewards like waived blockchain fees. While investors can profit when FTT and other coins increase in value, they’re largely unregulated and are particularly susceptible to market downturns”. In other words, the FTT token is created by FTX and its value is not backed by any real assets. FTX tokens vs. seats on the NYSE While it would sound to anyone like a house of cards, it is not at all unprecedented, even in the traditional asset world. To trade on the New York Stock Exchange before it was bought out in 2006, one needed to own a “seat”. A seat on the NYSE was roughly the equivalent of a token on the FTX, endowing its owner with the right to trade on the exchange. NYSE seats were initiated in 1869 at a price of $4000. In 2005, seats peaked at $3.57 million. It’s very likely that one could have financed a seat through a bank or other institution, given that it provided you with a venue that enabled you to make a great deal of money. Taxi medallions in key US cities worked the same way and became worth hundreds of thousands each. Banks provided loans against those as well. How do these membership schemes end? Great for some – terrible for others. NYSE seat owners were very fortunate. In 2006, the NYSE went public in an IPO. The seat owners received 80,177 shares in the new public company, $300,000 cash, and $70,571 in dividends. On the other hand, taxi medallions crashed as a result of Uber and Lyft. In Boston, medallions went from $700k in 2014 to $40k in 2018. In Chicago, they went from $385k to 30k. And in New York, they went from a peak of over a million dollars each to as low as $136k. Many taxi companies in NY went bankrupt and one lender had to write off $70 million in bad loans against medallions. A similar practice in the crypto-corporate world is playing out now in the court system for Ripple Labs. The SEC is claiming that Ripple’s token ( XRP-USD ) is essentially equity in the company and merely a contrivance to avoid securities regulation. The result of this case will have major implications on the use of crypto tokens and FTX did not help Ripple’s case. There is more to the story. To spice things up for FTX, rival exchange Binance (BNB-USD) (the largest crypto exchange in the world) became entangled with FTX and Alameda as well. Despite being FTX’s largest competitor, Binance apparently also lent money (at least half a billion) to Alameda Research and was given FTT tokens as collateral.) When the value of the tokens become questionable to Binance, they tried to sell them back to Alameda and it was the resulting liquidity crunch on Alameda that proved its undoing. What happened to SBF’s two firms seems to have been a classic run on FTX’s assets. In addition, SBF was said to have used customer deposits from FTX accounts to fund activities at Alameda Research. The customers thus became hapless victims as both Alameda and FTX began to fail. Reasons for the Collapse At some point, Binance got a whiff that the value of the FTT token was potentially inflated and tried to protect its interests by selling it back to Alameda. This alerted others who immediately jumped in on the selling action, resulting in a cascade failure that may have taken just hours to bring FTX and Alameda crashing down. What brought down SBF and the house of FTX was therefore a combination of malfeasance, ignorance, incompetence, and overconfidence, coupled with speculation on an asset with questionable underlying value, heavily leveraged trading, competitive rivalry, and the illicit use of customer funds. The investigations are expected to center on “ a complete failure of corporate controls and…a complete absence of trustworthy financial information,” in the words of the new CEO from his court filing. As he put it “If the underlying instrument is a crypto asset with no firm assets behind it, and the markets on which it trades are in different countries and largely unregulated, riskless can become reckless very quickly.” To throw billions at it was folly. To throw unauthorized customer money at it is at best irresponsible and at worst fraud, at least by US legal standards. FTX was really acting as a broker-dealer rather than an exchange, but outside the US, that distinction escapes regulatory scrutiny as well. The impact for Bitcoin and other digital assets Crypto hardcores will no doubt try to convince themselves that the demise of FTX was an isolated event that represents a natural consequence of FTX’s dubious structure and practices. That may be wishful thinking. There will certainly be collateral damage to other players in the crypto game. Crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital has already put investors on alert that it has to raise capital as a result of losses to FTX and that could also affect their parent company DCG (Digital Currency Group), which also owns the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). Word of other losses is also trickling in. Financial Advisor Magazine reports that “Kevin Zhou, co-founder of hedge fund Galois Capital, said roughly half of its capital was stuck on FTX, according to the Financial Times. Travis Kling, who managed money for Point72 Asset Management before starting a crypto fund, said a large majority of his firm Ikigai’s assets are on the bankrupt platform. Wintermute, one of the largest market makers, said it has $55 million on FTX.” Even if the FTX contagion is manageable, the bigger issue here is the loss of crypto credibility. FTX just adds to a long line of crypto hacks, missteps, frauds, and other painful events. When added to the massive price declines of 2022, the uncertain future of Ethereum’s ( ETH-USD ) change to proof-of-stake, and the vacuum in regulation, this could very well be a watershed moment in the fabled crypto story. Investors must keep in mind that while blockchain and cryptographic technology are real and practical, specific tokens, coins, and cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) are simply applications built on that technology and are driven purely by their acceptance in the marketplace. It is no different in that regard from the inception of the Internet, where there were notable flameouts in the early days. Bitcoin’s future is by no means assured and with numerous potential CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) under development around the world, it could become just one of many digital currencies or could fade out entirely. We also know that when a market crashes, the safest investments are generally ones that had solid performance before the crash and that BTC and ETH may hold the most promise of remaining alive and regaining their upward momentum. Therefore, we expect the FTX affair to put downward pressure on market valuations for all cryptos. FTX also demonstrates how rapidly a token can drop to zero value. That will impress upon many people that they may not be able to get out with even partial loss in the event of a collapse and this may portend smaller investments by those inclined to speculate. A major issue is that many institutions, who were finally warming to the idea of a crypto allocation, will now likely walk away. Without institutional players, the prices are likely to languish at best. Moreover, since institutional adoption was assumed to have increased the price correlation between equities and Bitcoin, that trend may weaken as cryptos decouple somewhat from equities. Institutions that are preoccupied with inflation and a possible upcoming recession are going to be a lot less likely to add more risk to their portfolios. Our prognosis (and it is just our educated opinion of course) is that Bitcoin will likely survive for some time out of sheer momentum and determination but will not reach the vaunted heights many adopters have long hoped for and will entertain a new trajectory going forward. Hardcore crypto adherents will not likely sell at current prices, but those who ventured in during the last year will likely consider taking their tax losses and moving on. In the near term, we would expect continued consolidation well into 2023. More importantly, we see the FTX disaster as a watershed moment in the evolution of digital assets that will change the general public’s approach to digital assets. On top of yet another price decline of well more than 50% from its previous high, the loss of credibility here is exacerbated by several factors: Sam Bankman-Fried was not a member of the financial “establishment”– he was a Gen-Z crypto fan who lobbied extensively on behalf of the crypto community. “Once bitten – twice shy”. A great many crypto fans will now have been burned, some quite heavily. Few of those will blindly jump on the bandwagon again, even if cryptos take off again. Mass loss aversion will cause many to be looking just to get even and get out. The number of hacks and other crypto disasters is now too large to ignore. It should be clear to many now that crypto without regulation is simply too dangerous. Without the momentum behind institutional acceptance, crypto will need to find new supporters. Where will they come from? The existential question is now whether crypto can thrive in a regulated environment because the evidence against its ability to thrive in unregulated environments is now becoming overwhelming. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that crypto and blockchain technologies are still considered both valid and valuable. We expect that safe and legitimate applications for the technology can now take on a higher profile. The impact on regulation Calls for increased regulation are expectedly spewing from the usual sources. Elizabeth Warren is already saying that tougher rules are needed to deal with the “smoke and mirrors” prevalent in the crypto space. For that matter, even SBF, himself, was lobbying for increased regulation. That, however, may backfire to a degree as SBF's credibility is now shot to pieces and Congress might now view more liberal rules in the US as simply legitimizing some of the bad practices in the crypto industry. Nonetheless, the system begs to be fixed. Jason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal said “SBF may be at the center of what went wrong, but he didn’t act alone. Behind him lies a vast ecosystem of fantasy and fakery. It’s called the investing business. If we’re going to point fingers, let’s be sure we aim at all the right targets.” We believe new crypto regulations will come out of this but that they will not be what the industry is hoping for in terms of new approvals. If anything, it will be an overreaction to tighten regulations and audit requirements on existing vehicles while abandoning any further approvals of any kind until they truly get to the bottom of FTX first, which will take a while. It’s going to be more difficult for the industry to get past that image now. The impact on the crypto ecosystem VCs came away with lots of egg on their faces after losing money on FTX investments. Money to back the FTX exchange came in from the biggest names among US venture capital firms, who apparently had so many dollar signs in their eyes, they couldn’t see the FTX balance sheet very clearly. “ Dozens of the world’s leading investment firms , including Sequoia Capital, Singapore’s state-owned investment company Temasek, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, SoftBank Group Corp., and hedge funds Third Point and Tiger Global, showered SBF with money.” But in the scheme of things, it was still a relatively small hit to their massive investments in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, it was mostly investor money, not theirs, and to make money in the future from lucrative fees, they will keep investing. Sequoia had the presence of mind to apologize to investors and promise better due diligence in the future (though at the same time passing the blame off on SBF for misrepresenting FTX.) (Sorry, but that should be one of those things that good due diligence is supposed to uncover.) Meanwhile, Sequoia told its investors that it would focus more on public equities in the crypto space and offered to swap FTX losers into a new fund with less FTX-style exposure. Apparently, 95% took the deal. Investors in crypto-related ventures and private equity are likely to be a bit more gun-shy but the space will still likely continue to see new money pour into crypto and blockchain ventures that show promise, have more viable business models, and are run by more established players. The qualifications of being domiciled in the US and having reputable auditors should also take on more weight now. Institutions, however, that had bought crypto (or worse, invested in FTX) won’t likely be as willing to touch another coin or token and those who were considering crypto will now very likely enter a moratorium on investing further until the dust settles on FTX. We suspect many will walk away from crypto altogether now. What pension fund manager would want to risk their job by bringing up the idea of investing in crypto right now? Let’s face it. The parts of the crypto ecosystem that are not based on actual business models are based almost entirely on blind trust and a storied narrative. That trust has taken numerous hits to date and survived but just took another one with FTX and that will take a while to recover from. Bitcoin was built on a narrative that it was to become a worldwide currency. That hasn’t happened yet. So, it has maintained what value it still has based on its identity as a store of value – and a highly volatile and speculative one at that. It’s difficult to find a silver lining in the FTX saga for Bitcoin other than the fact that it hasn’t crashed. That isn’t exactly a lasting testimonial. Parts of the crypto ecosystem will certainly suffer from the loss of credibility that resulted from the fall of FTX. Crypto brokers and exchanges will suffer. Miners are already in the doldrums. Institutions will likely shelve any plans to add crypto for a while. We wouldn’t be surprised to see some crypto players fail or consolidate if the prolonged price weakness continues into next year. Aspects of the ecosystem that relate to viable products and services should weather this better. This may be where the crypto world seriously separates the wheat from the chaff on digital coins and tokens. Chart perspective For a long-term perspective, we include a chart below of $BTC:USD from inception through November 2022, as shown below. We do not see any major clues to future price based on Bitcoin’s volatile price history but we do note that it could fall below $7500 and still essentially be considered in a long-term uptrend. Unfortunately, that leaves the crypto vulnerable to another 50% drop from here before enabling technicians to conclude that the trend has finally broken. $BTC:USD (StockCharts.com) Meanwhile, shares of Bitcoin miners are showing abandonment as shown here on Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ). RIOT (Stockcharts.com) Optimists might say that this suggests capitulation on the part of investors, which may be somewhat true. But capitulation on companies with solid business models and fundamentals is different than capitulation on companies built on highly questionable fundamentals. Some might argue that cryptos are in something of a death spiral, and it would be hard to argue that. Our feeling is that while not a death spiral for Bitcoin or crypto just yet, it may prove to be one for entities that are incurring costs and realizing insufficient revenue or asset appreciation to justify those costs. How long can miners continue to mint Bitcoin at current prices and what is their threshold for throwing in the towel? We do believe that crypto and blockchain technology will survive the latest carnage, but that many frivolous coins and tokens will not. We see a strong parallel between crypto today and the Internet of the early 2000s. In the same way that the Internet had its watershed moment and came out stronger in the end, we see similar possibilities for crypto. But trying to pick the bottom and the right vehicle may require as much luck as skill. The impact on alternative investing We’ve been studying the greater field of alternatives for some time and we define alternatives as pretty much any type of formal investment outside of regulated securities as well as some regulated securities that actually are alternatives. We see the major categories of alternatives as real estate, collectibles, cryptos, other digitals (NFTs), crowdsourcing, private debt and equity, and venture capital. The first five of these categories are the ones most broadly available to individual investors and they are already huge. We all know the growth story behind cryptos and NFTs (despite the currently weak environment). Spurred on by the JOBS Act of 2016, collectibles and crowdsourcing have really picked up steam. Fractional investing is expanding rapidly for high-ticket items and the minimums on private equity and venture capital are dropping to where many more investors can take part in those areas as well. In short, the alternatives markets still have enormous growth potential and are held back primarily due to the lack of regulation and the absence of available education & resources. In addition, investment advisors cannot get paid on many alternatives and they can have considerable legal & compliance risks if they offer them. Consequently, the advisor world avoids alternatives. This, however, will change over time. The FTX fiasco, coupled with the severe weakness in cryptos and NFTs right now, may push more investors toward other alternatives like real estate and collectibles. If anything, we see FTX providing constructive lessons for other alternatives and for the SEC in terms of bringing them under the regulatory umbrella.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560897-ftx-may-have-delivered-watershed-moment-to-digital-assets?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4890631.jpeg

Outflows for crypto investment products totaled $23 million, the highest amount in 12 weeks and a reversal from a two-week streak of inflows, according to a report by CoinShares on Monday.  Investors had scooped up shares in digital-asset funds as crypto prices tanked in the weeks after FTX’s meltdown, but as prices stabilized last week the trend appears to have reversed.  The headline figure for outflows is even more bearish than it looks because the week included some $9.2 million of inflows into “short bitcoin” funds, or those designed to profit from further price declines in the largest cryptocurrency by market value.

42394093,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWPL,1669659997,The Bitcoin Obituary Obituary,"According to 99 Bitcoins, a website that tracks crypto obituaries, there have been 466 times someone has declared “game over” for blockchain. That’s almost certainly an undercount, if looking across financial publications, social media and interviews with experts on TV and podcasts. Even amid crypto’s bleakest winter yet, crypto boosters still seem more connected to reality than these forecasters.  There’s been a modest uptick in bitcoin obits since the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange. Indian columnist Chetan Bhagat, for instance, wrote that “crypto is now dead” in the Times of India last week. How declarative! Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who has been calling the end of bitcoin since 2013, recently wrote that the crypto industry is “heading for oblivion.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The Economist took a smarter route, couching its prediction in a question: How will crypto unravel? “If everyone stopped using it,” the vaunted financial magazine wrote. Although its argument is simple (and credulous), it’s worth taking a closer look at because it gets to the heart of why crypto isn’t going to disappear: diminishing trust.  According to The Economist, decreasing trust in crypto companies will lead to decreasing use in blockchains thereby opening these decentralized platforms to attack. The bylineless article notes 51% attacks as a particular risk, arguing that blockchain security is a direct output of a cryptocurrency’s price.  “The value of on-chain activity and tokens is self-reinforcing … The more people shy away from crypto out of fear, the less secure it becomes,” they write. The more expensive an asset, the harder it is to accumulate the necessary share needed to reverse a transaction on a decentralized network.  Astute readers will know that while a 51% attack is an embarrassment for a blockchain (and may diminish trust in the underlying asset), it doesn’t spell the end for the network. Bitcoin Cash, the fork of Bitcoin, for instance experienced two chain attacks in 2021 – it’s still chugging along. (After Ghash.io acquired more than 51% of BTC’s hashpower in 2014, no single entity has had such a large share.)  However, the larger idea is more important: Will people ever simply get fed up with crypto and stop using or building on blockchains? The reason this might seem like a salient question to The Economist is the same reason it seems ridiculous to any understanding of crypto. Starting with Bitcoin, decentralized networks are attempts at creating alternative systems where the key distinction is whether you have to trust anyone else to use them.  Blockchains live up to the promise of trustlessness with varying degrees of success. It’s also true that the industry has in large part recreated the problem of centralized institutions by relying heavily on corporate exchanges and on-ramps. But when some like Paul Krugman says it’s “never been clear exactly why anyone other than criminals would want” to send payments peer-to-peer, it seems like an acute failure of imagination.  Crypto is forward-looking – its key innovations involve long-term societal changes (learning how to self-custody assets, reimagining what money is, creating new ways of collective action). And while today we’re confronted with all the ways crypto can fail, there are still many time lines where it can succeed.  Earlier this month, Harvard economist Matthew Ferranti published a research paper looking at the situations under which it makes sense for central banks to hold bitcoin. Likely the product of months of research, Ferranti’s case study was published at a time when its conclusions likely would never seem more ridiculous to his peers.  Will bitcoin survive at all, let alone partially replace so-called risk free assets like U.S. Treasurys or dollars? Ferranti’s wager isn’t ideological, but it does presume that even nation-states could have a use for a “sanction-proof” asset like BTC. This case doesn’t even need to play out for bitcoin to succeed – but it would validate the idea that money doesn’t have to have a centralized backer.  Crypto doesn’t have to replace finance, bitcoin doesn’t have to become the only money and decentralized protocols don’t need to eliminate companies – but they exist as alternatives.

These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Central banks? Yes. While we do not yet have clear examples of central banks embracing crypto, it’s not far off. And the U.S. dollar only has itself to blame.  It’s tragically ironic that after a period of the sharpest increase of U.S. money supply in history, nations around the world are suffering an acute shortage of dollars. A couple of days ago, Ghana moved to start paying for oil imports in gold due to a lack of greenbacks. Earlier this month, credit ratings agency Fitch downgraded Nigeria due largely to the central bank’s policy of rationing the supply of U.S. dollars, which has led to fuel scarcity, suspended flights and accelerating inflation.  Last month, reports emerged from Egypt of a chronic wheat shortage due to a lack of dollars with which to pay for large shipments of the grain sitting on ships in Egyptian ports. This summer, Sri Lanka found itself unable to pay for fuel, had to close schools and offices and prioritized allocations to counterparties who could pay in dollars. Earlier this year, dollar rationing by Kenyan banks led to food shortages and soaring prices. The list goes on – dollar shortage stress around the globe is triggering hunger, accelerating price spirals and, in some cases, toppling governments.  A large part of this is political. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a system of swap lines that dispense dollars to foreign central banks in case of need. But not to all central banks – only Canada, England, Japan, the European Union and Switzerland have access to standing swap lines. In theory, others can get temporary ones in times of crisis, but even during the height of the pandemic, the Fed only provided swap lines to two emerging economies: Brazil and Mexico.  See also: Steps to Crypto Recovery: Where 'We' Go From Here | Opinion  The worsening credit profiles of would-be dollar borrowers are a factor in this lack of generosity, as is the concern that U.S. loans might go to repay Chinese debt or finance imports from Russia. And while the U.S. can come to the rescue when total implosion is imminent, as it did for Sri Lanka earlier this year, that intervention can carry conditions that many nations are unable to meet – greater distance from China, for instance.  Even holding liquid dollar assets as reserves is not what it used to be. The seizure of Russian reserves at the start of the war in Ukraine has shown central banks that the world’s “safe asset” is not as safe as everyone thought (as for price volatility, well …)  Now, what if there were a seizure-resistant monetary asset that was not subject to the economic priorities of third parties and that could be sold for dollars 24/7/365? Oh wait, there is.  Attention to the idea of central banks holding bitcoin is growing. In May, the Alliance for Financial Inclusion organized a conference in El Salvador that convened central bankers and financial regulators from 44 countries to discuss small business financing, financial inclusion and bitcoin. Most were from small countries, but not all: representatives from Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Egypt – each in the top 50 countries ranked by GDP – were present; beyond Africa and Asia, coverage included nations from the Middle East, Latin America and at least one former Soviet republic.  Even academia is getting involved. Last week, Matthew Ferranti of Harvard University’s economics department published a paper on, you guessed it, central banks and bitcoin. Technically the paper is about the risk of sanctions on central bank reserves and is one of the first to focus on the impact of sanctions before they happen, via hedging and the resulting effect on the reserves composition. Ferranti concludes that the shifting global landscape makes a case for the inclusion of cryptocurrency in that mix, and produces a whole lot of formulas and numbers to back that up. The renminbi gets a shout-out, too.  Read more: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto's Founding Mission | Opinion  Central banks do seem to be re-evaluating their allocations. A recent report by the World Gold Council revealed that third-quarter gold purchases had jumped 18% year on year, with central banks accounting for a quarterly record of 400 tonnes (the previous record was 241 tonnes in Q3 2018). Central bank purchases for the year to date reached 673 tonnes at the end of September, higher than any other full year total since 1967.  But it is no secret that even gold reserves are vulnerable. The New York Federal Reserve building holds the world’s largest known monetary gold reserve, much of which belongs to foreign central banks. Access to gold reserves, whether physical or paper, is not 100% guaranteed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a bearer asset that is not expensive or complicated to store securely on national territory, a few clicks away from a market.  It’s even possible the embrace of bitcoin by emerging economy central banks could be with U.S. support. The alternative is U.S. lending to high-risk countries, which carries a domestic political cost; the expansion of non-dollar swap agreements, such as with China; or the collapse of some emerging and frontier economies. Apart from the human tragedy, many are key commodity exporters.  See also: Bitcoin Is Macro, but Not 'Correlated' in the Way You Think | Opinion  I used to think the adoption of bitcoin by central banks for their reserves would happen soon, given the urgent need in some pockets of the global economy – now I realize that getting regulators comfortable with the idea, especially after the high level of misunderstanding of what the FTX collapse is actually about (i.e., fraud, not crypto), could take some time. But it is becoming increasingly clear to me that it will happen, because it needs to happen. The doubt and distrust sown by recent crypto drama will recede, and the desperate need to shore up economic resilience – combined with a growing understanding of the relative simplicity of an asset that can be converted into dollars or any other currency at any time – will incentivize greater acceptance and experimentation.  We are also likely to see a domino effect: Where one goes, so will others. And with this, the world will witness an asset that started retail-first, from the ground up, ending up as a support for not just central banks but also the resilience of entire nations.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/28/central-banks-and-bitcoin-closer-than-you-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0219c3a5a248a8306333f2406288288529fe132d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After the dramatic fall from $69,000 in late 2021 to current levels, sentiment has taken a beating. It isn’t unusual to see targets on crypto Twitter for $1,000 BTC in the days ahead.

The level proved to be significant at the time, with BTCUSD trading above $1,000 for less than ten days before the 2014-2015 bear market started.

It was a large, rounded number in US dollars, but 1 BTC was almost exactly the same price of an ounce of gold at the time. After breaching above $1,000 a second time, Bitcoin went on to climb just under 2,000% to nearly $20,000 per coin. Today, five years later, BTC is below the 2017 bull market peak.

Williams said Monday in an online speech hosted by the Economic Club of New York. And while housing activity has dropped and consumer and business spending have slowed, ""the labor market remains remarkably tight,"" as hiring remains robust and wage gains continue, he said. With economic growth slowing, though, he expects the unemployment rate to increase from its current rate of 3.7% to between 4.5% and 5% by the end of 2023. A number of factors are improving in regard to inflation, he said, including easing of supply chain bottlenecks and other central banks tightening policy. ""Because many of the sources of inflation are global, these policy actions from around the world should alleviate supply-chain issues, speed the process of restoring balance to global supply and demand, and reduce global inflationary pressures,"" Williams said, according to prepared text for the speech. He expects inflation to slow from its current rate of over 6% to between 5% and 5.5% at the end of this year and to between 3% to 3.5% next year. It will take longer to bring underlying inflation, what he refers to as the ""inner layer of the inflation onion,"" to come down, he said. That part includes wages, services inflation, and inflation expectations. ""Tighter monetary policy has begun to cool demand and reduce inflationary pressures. It will take some time, but I am fully confident we will return to a sustained period of price stability,"" he concluded. (Updated at 12:02 PM ET). In the Fed's latest policy statement , on Nov. 2, the U.S. central bankers hinted they may be open to smaller rate hikes at future meetings as it takes into account rate increases already taken, shrinking of its balance sheet, policy at other central banks, and monetary policy lags. Since March, the Fed has raised its key rate by 375 basis points to 3.75%-4.0%. Update at 12:19 PM ET: In the post-speech moderated conversation, Williams said, ""my baseline outlook does not foresee a recession occurring,"" though there are a number of downside risks. But he also noted that economists do not have a good record of forecasting recessions. He expects that the Federal Reserve will need to raise rates further and that policy will need to stay restrictive through 2023. 12:23 PM ET: In addition, he sees a path where the central bank reduces the nominal policy rate in 2024. 12:48 PM ET: Regarding cryptocurrencies, Williams still questions its use to serve the basic purposes of money. While the technology may improve efficiency and speed of payments, he doesn't see crypto being used for store of value or basis of exchange. He repeated his view that stablecoins need a ""strong regulatory framework,"" and that should be done ""sooner"" rather than later. In addition, the Fed is studying the potential for a central digital bank currency, but is nowhere near making a decision on that. He comes back to ""what problem are we trying to solve with CBDCs.""

Based on MAS’ minimum total capital adequacy requirement of 10% for systemically important banks incorporated in Singapore, this means that Singapore-incorporated banks are required to hold $125 of capital against an exposure of $100 to a cryptoasset like Bitcoin.""  Singapore's lawmakers are facing tough question about crypto during the ongoing parliamentary session, which kicked off Monday. Most questions involve the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX, with some scrutinizing the investment made by state fund Temasek in the fallen enterprise.  Since the collapse, the country's financial regulator, the MAS, has also had to answer questions about how it decides which crypto exchanges are safe for use by investors.  In August, the MAS said that it was working with other regulators on setting up a prudential framework for banks' exposure to crypto. Shanmugaratnam said on Monday that Singapore is following the requirements recommended by international standard-setter the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). BCBS is set to finalize capital requirements for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether by the end of the year.  Until that framework is finalized, the MAS is going with the ""highest risk weight under the BCBS’ capital framework,"" according to Shanmugaratnam.  ""For less risky crypto assets, such as tokenized corporate bonds that meet a set of conditions to ensure that they pose the same level of financial risks as traditional corporate bonds, the prudential treatment is similar to that applied to the traditional non-tokenized asset,"" Shanmugaratnam said.

42413557,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9sXI,1669653141,MakerDAO Community Rejects CoinShares Proposal to Invest Up to $500M in Bonds,"The MakerDAO community rejected a proposal to use up to $500 million of the stablecoin USDC to invest in bonds with crypto investment firm CoinShares.  CoinShares had proposed to manage between 100 million and 500 million USDC and actively invest the money in a portfolio of corporate debt securities and government-backed bonds, aiming to return a yield matching the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). SOFR currently stands at 3.8%.  Some 72% of votes were cast against the proposal. The voting concluded Monday.  The rejection came as MakerDAO is in the process of investing billions of dollars from its reserve and optimizing its balance sheet to earn revenue from yields.  Read more: MakerDAO Members Support Founder's 'Endgame' Plan to Break Up into MetaDAOs, $2.1B of Transfers  MakerDAO is one of the largest decentralized crypto lending protocols and it holds $7.7 billion of assets in its reserve called Peg Stability Module (PSM).  A web of collaborating teams called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) manages the protocol through public discussions in its forum, and holders of MKR, the protocol’s governance token, vote on proposals.  Starting earlier this year, multiple institutional fund managers such Coinbase and Gemini pitched to MakerDAO their plans to allocate a part of its reserve in yield-generating rewards programs, including investing in treasuries.  The community approved last month a plan to allocate $1.6 billion to Coinbase Prime, the crypto exchange’s custody arm, for a 1.5% annual reward and another $500 million to a consortium of hedge fund Appaloosa and crypto broker Monetalis to provide crypto-backed loans for a 4.5-6% expected annual yield.  Monetalis also won approval to allocate up to $500 million in U.S. Treasury bonds. It has invested some $200 million in Treasurys through exchange-traded funds, according to a dashboard on Dune Analytics.  In September, crypto exchange and custody service Gemini offered MakerDAO a 1.25% annual reward for staking GUSD, Gemini’s stablecoin, on its platform. MakerDAO now holds almost $500 million in GUSD.  BlockTower Capital, a digital asset investment firm, pitched last month to acquire up to 600 million USDC from MakerDAO and invest the funds in structured credit and money market funds. The community is yet to vote on the proposal.  ""We have plenty of proposals and only a few billions of capital,"" Sebastien Derivaux, an asset-liability manager for MakerDAO, told CoinDesk.  CoinShares cited the recent turmoil in crypto markets as the primary reason for the rejection.  ""Several delegates have recently told us that they are reluctant to vote for our proposal and the other PSM management proposals in light of market conditions (FTX implosion and Genesis insolvency) as they want to see a cooling down of the industry,"" according to a statement by CoinShares sent to CoinDesk in an email.  A spokesperson to the firm said that CoinShares intends to improve its pitch and propose it again in the coming months.

4884331,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510348,1669653003,Why The Bitcoin Miners’ Revenue Hit Lowest Point Since 2020,"Many crypto investors are still skeptical about the profitability of Bitcoin mining. This is not surprising considering the growing rate of energy prices in recent times. Moreover, the Bitcoin miners’ revenue has been on a downtrend since November 2020. Related Reading: Ethereum Tries To Keep Luster As ETH Moves To Narrower Trading Range Current Bitcoin Miners’ Revenue Meanwhile, BTC miners are experiencing some downturn in their revenue lately. This situation results from reduced prices and the present bearish state of the crypto market. It’s not overly surprising to miners, seeing that the token’s value against the dollar is going down the drain. As of November 2021, Bitcoin miners recorded the highest revenue ever had. But information from Blockchain.com showed that these BTC miners’ revenue had dropped significantly since its peak surge. The Bitcoin miners’ revenue is now down to its lowest value since November 2020. At the time of writing, the figure stands at a little over $11.67 million. Related Reading: BCH Price: Investors May Not Want To Go Long Yet On BCH – Here’s Why While this downtrend is primarily due to the plummeting price of the BTC token, other metrics also contribute to the occurrence. A noteworthy example is the growing energy prices. Another instance is the decline in the profitable days of Bitcoin. Around 83.40% decline in the profitable days has already been recorded. BTC holders have witnessed approximately 3,738 days of profits since 2015. On the opposite side, Bitcoin holders would have gained little or nothing for about 747 days in the same period. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $16,146 showing a 24-hour change of -1.72%. Working System Of Bitcoin Mining The working process of BTC mining is simpler than it sounds. However, it demands the right understanding from intending and existing miners. Primarily, Bitcoin miners guess a 64-digit number called a hash. In most cases, it’s termed hash mining. Miners depend on powerful computers to quickly guess this 64-digit number (hash). There are about 16 possibilities for every digit in the number. They consist of digits 1 to 10 and letters A to F. Generating a guess involves rolling a die having 16 sides 64 times. This action alone only generates one guess. Miners still have many more possible answers, and this is where they need their mining systems. These computers roll the 16-sided die at a very high speed with lots of computer energy. The reward for mining goes to the miner who first arrives at the right hash – adding a block to the Bitcoin blockchain. The continuity of this process and the price of BTC add up to the revenue of these BTC miners.

4883970,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510343,1669652208,Genesis Bankruptcy by EOY Now At 59% – Sentiment Of Bitcoin Investors Pivots,"A possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Genesis Trading and parent company DCG is still depressing the sentiment on the Bitcoin market. Genesis last commented on Twitter on November 16. Parent company DCG last spoke out on November 18 via the social media platform. Investors, however, seem to take a rather positive view of the silence. As recent data from the world’s largest decentralized prediction market Polymarket shows market participants now estimate the probability of a Genesis insolvency at only 59% by the end of year (EOY). The peak value was 81%. Thus, the narrative appears to have pivoted to the extent that the problem is fixable for Genesis and DCG. Expert opinions currently suggest that it is more of a liquidity shortage than a solvency problem for DCG. Bitcoin Experts Warn Against False Panic Bitcoin OG Samson Mow explained that the DCG group has real assets and income-generating businesses, and the problem is primarily a liquidity shortage. According to Mow, Genesis and DCG have enough assets to pay debts, they’re just not available in cash. The worst-case scenario, a bankruptcy of Genesis and DCG “seems unlikely” for him. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seen Dropping To $10,000, This Asset Management Co-Founder Predicts Since DCG has high revenues and assets, insolvency of Genesis would not be the end of the parent company. To that extent, Mow considers the theory that Grayscale could be liquidated and the 634,000 BTC could hit the open market also “an unlikely outcome.” DCG still has a number of good assets, including Grayscale, which generates around $500 to $800 million a year in management fees. According to Mow, the likely outcome is a restructuring or an outright buyout by a bigger player. Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, currently strikes a similar tone. He also warns against scaremongering that DCG can simply “dump” its GBTC shares. “That’s part of their liquidity crisis, but also net good news for GBTC shareholders and FUD fighting,” Selkis said. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Is Near, But A Drop To This Level Is Possible, Renowned Analyst Says The reason is that Grayscale has to follow strict rules. Thus, DCG cannot simply sell its nearly $800 million worth of GBTC shares because it is not an ETF as desired but a listed vehicle that falls under Rule 144. Because of this, there are two important restrictions. DCG must make public a notice of proposed sales. Furthermore, there are caps on sales of 1% of outstanding shares or weekly trading volume. Given GBTC has a daily volume of ~4.5mm shares that works out to quarterly cap on sales of 2.5mm shares ($23mm / quarter) under the trading test and 6.9mm shares ($62mm / quarter) under the asset test. If Grayscale were to start forced sales, it would send the price of GBTC further down, and the discount would continue to grow. According to Selkis, this liquidity problem makes it much more likely that DCG-Genesis will refinance using GBTC as collateral. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $16,157. Thus, the next important resistance is currently at $16,310, while the support at $16,050 is of major concern.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/genesis-bankruptcy-by-eoy-at-59-bitcoin-investors-pivot/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/4883970.jpeg

Major digital tokens, in turn, extended their losses as the ripple effect from FTX's fallout drags on. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dipped 2.6% to $16.09K at 11:13 a.m. ET, and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) slid 4.4% to $1.15K. The company, which is still operating its business, said it will focus on recovering all obligations by its counterparties, though recoveries from FTX are expected to be delayed given its ongoing bankruptcy process, according to a release . An internal plan was also started to ""considerably reduce"" BlockFi's expenses such as labor costs, the release said, while noting it has $256.9M in cash on hand. Bloomberg reported that the lender sent a layoff warning to two-thirds of its employees as it seeks to better manage costs. BlockFi did not immediately respond to Seeking Alpha's request for comment. BlockFi, meanwhile, is estimated to have over 100K creditors, its petition showed. One of its largest creditors included FTX US's business name, West Realm Shires, with a $275M unsecured claim. Ankura Trust Company was BlockFi's largest creditor by a wide margin with a $730M unsecured claim. The move comes after BlockFi, which received an outsized credit line from FTX earlier in 2022, was forced to suspend client withdrawals earlier in November due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire at the time. But even before the collapse of FTX, BlockFi was struggling to keep afloat following regulatory troubles and a broader market downturn. FTX US reached an agreement with BlockFi in July that gave FTX the option to bail out the embattled crypto lender for up to $240M, though the deal never went through due to FTX's recent liquidity crisis. Crypto lender rival Nexo reportedly offered to buy BlockFi for $850M in July, too, but BlockFi turned down that offer and moved forward with FTX US. “It is unfortunate for BlockFi that the white knight [FTX] that had offered them a lifeline back in June, hasn’t managed to stay solvent themselves, in part because of the massive losses accumulated at Alameda Research stemming from the same event - the collapse of Terra Luna and Three Arrow Capital,"" said Bradley Duke, founder and co-CEO at ETC Group.

The world's largest altcoin by market cap ( ETH-USD ) changed hands at $1.16K as of shortly before 11 a.m. ET, trading near last week's lows of $1.08K amid the aftermath of crypto exchange FTX's implosion. Most of the major tokens, meanwhile, stood in negative territory in the wake of broader risk-off sentiment, including bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) -2.4% , binance coin ( BNB-USD ) -6.3% , ripple ( XRP-USD ) -6.1% and cardano ( ADA-USD ) -4.4% . Apparently a whale address transferred 73,224 ether ( ETH-USD ) (US$85.67M) to Binance earlier in the session, on-chain researcher Lookonchain wrote in a Twitter post . That address initially withdrew 84,131 ETH from the decentralized exchange Curve's staked ETH (stETH) liquidity pool on November 24, resulting in stETH/ETH de-pegging to $0.9682 at the time. Generally speaking, a rise in exchange inflows bodes poorly for crypto prices since market participants usually move coins to centralized exchanges with the intention of selling them. ""Watch out for the selling pressure of ETH,"" Lookonchain warned. The selling pressure also comes as ether ( ETH-USD ) saw minor outflows totaling $6.1M for the week ending November 25, according to a report by CoinShares. On a brighter note, large inflows into short ETH products seen in the prior week were completely reversed with an outflow of $15.2M, but it's ""still too early to say this is a positive change in sentiment,"" it said.

42413561,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9sby,1669648833,BlockFi Files for Bankruptcy as FTX Contagion Spreads,"Crypto lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, days after suspending withdrawals amid the ongoing fallout from exchange FTX's bankruptcy filing.  The company said it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, indicating it hoped to restructure, continuing operations in the meantime. According to a press release, BlockFi has about $257 million in cash on hand. A Bermuda-based affiliate is also filing for liquidation, a similar process.  According to the company's petition, BlockFi's executives estimate the company has more than 100,000 creditors, and checked off the ranges. Executives estimate the company has between $1 billion and $10 billion in both assets and liabilities.  The company's largest creditors include West Realm Shires Inc., the legal name for FTX US, which has a $275 million unsecured claim, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has a $30 million unsecured claim. The majority of the other top 50 creditors' names were not shared.  BlockFi's largest creditor is Ankura Trust Company, which the lender appears to have hired in February and now has a $730 million unsecured claim.  BlockFi, which suspended withdrawals a few weeks ago due to the ongoing confusion about FTX's assets, has had a rocky year. The company liquidated a large client earlier this year, and needed a line of credit from FTX to survive earlier this year. In announcing the suspension of withdrawals, BlockFi warned clients not to deposit any funds to its wallet or interest accounts.  The lender was set to raise funding at a $1 billion down round valuation in June, after raising $350 million at a $3 billion valuation in March 2021. As recently as last July, the company was looking to go public within the next year and a half, with a potential $500 million fundraise coming soon.  However, the company had to pay $100 million in February as part of a settlement with the SEC and several state regulators over allegations its high-yield crypto lending product violated state and federal securities laws. As part of the settlement, BlockFi also had to register its BlockFi Yield product with the SEC.  The company cut around a fifth of its workforce in June as the broader cryptocurrency market declined. The market capitalization – one measure of the overall value of the market – fell from over $3 trillion a year ago to $1 trillion by June.  After the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince announced that the company had to liquidate a large client, though he did not confirm whether it was Three Arrows or not. Shortly thereafter, crypto exchange FTX extended a $250 million credit facility to the lender, which later morphed into a $400 million credit facility that also gave FTX US the ability to acquire the lender.  However, FTX itself filed for bankruptcy in the second week of November, after days of speculation about whether it was fully liquid. The questions were sparked by a CoinDesk report revealing that much of FTX sister company Alameda's balance sheet was composed of an exchange token, FTT, issued by FTX, which later prompted Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao to announce he would liquidate his company's entire set of FTT holdings. FTX later suspended withdrawals.  Amid the confusion, BlockFi announced it would suspend withdrawals, saying it had some number of assets deposited on FTX and was still owed some of the credit FTX had extended.

Bitcoin Can Crash To Its 2020 Levels Amid FTX’s Collapse A report from Bloomberg claims some institutional investors are bearish on Bitcoin. Mark Mobius, experienced fund manager and founder of Mobius Capital, believes Bitcoin might drop to $10,000 in the medium term. The fund manager claims the crypto industry might suffer from more contagion. Since the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy, several companies halted operations. The Digital Currency Group (DCG) company, Genesis, is a prominent case. The company stopped accepting withdrawal requests from its customers and is rushing to raise capital to prevent bankruptcy. The situation has led many to speculate about the solvency of DCG. The rumors are contributing to the uncertainty in the crypto market. In this context, the price of Bitcoin and other assets is trending sideways. BTC will likely follow this trend for the coming weeks. Mobius classified the current environment as “too dangerous” to invest any of his clients’ money. Despite the current market conditions and FTX’s collapse, the fund manager believes crypto will have a permanent role in global finances, hinting at a long-term bullish bias: But crypto is here to stay as there are several investors who still have faith in it. It’s amazing how Bitcoin prices have held up. Bitcoin Options Players Expect Doom For December Further data provided by Bloomberg, based on the options platform Deribit, indicates a significant open interest leaning toward the put side (sell contracts) for December. By the end of 2022, many investors are expecting Bitcoin to gravitate around $10,000. However, this data can also be interpreted as many investors hedging their spot-long positions. Investors buy Bitcoin on exchanges, and to protect against potential downside pressure, they purchase put contracts.

4881764,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510316,1669645809,BCH Price: Investors May Not Want To Go Long Yet On BCH – Here’s Why,"BCH (Bitcoin Cash) saw its chance to recover as the crypto market’s capitalization still hasn’t made that much recovery. After stalling for a few candles at or near its pre-FTX collapse price level, the Bitcoin hard fork continued its descent. CoinGecko reports that Bitcoin Cash has greens on the weekly and biweekly timelines, but reds on the daily and monthly charts. Here’s a quick glance at BCH movement: When dealing with BCH, caution is advised There are conflicting signs coming from bitcoin cash Bulls must keep an eye on the 50 Fib retracement line This may indicate that trading BCH in the long term is not a good idea. At least, not yet. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Must Maintain $77 Level To Sustain Enthusiasm Come December The Bitcoin Correlation As was said, the correlation between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash was exceptionally high during the aforementioned market correction. Its pullback showed considerable significance as it fluctuated in the 0.90s. It’s possible that BCH will experience more losses in the near and medium term as it breaches the rising triangle pattern. When this was written, the coin’s value was trading at around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level. There are additional breaks in the lower part of the regression channel. It suggests the downward trend could be more pronounced than initially thought. Chart: TradingView Volatility is reflected in the Bollinger band’s expansion, but it’s also providing dynamic resistance. As the band widens, the orange middle band, currently at $112.7, acts as a downward pressure on the price. First, bulls must keep an eye on the 50 Fib retracement line, as this will be the bears’ immediate objective. Currently, the bears lack sufficient momentum to advance. This might change, though, if the RSI moves into oversold area, so boosting BCH’s downward momentum. This is within the 4-hour window. Price Movement Suggests Reversal On a daily time scale, the MFI clearly contradicts the price movement and indicates a reversal. Currently, a reversal could target the 38.20 Fib level to recoup lost ground. On shorter timelines, the reversal is currently taking shape. If BCH can close the daily candle with a green candle, it will have a greater possibility of experiencing a well-supported relief rally. Even when a reversal is in the process of forming, one cannot reject the other technical indicators that paint a different image. As the RSI continues to decline, the price would follow suit. The regression channel is positive on a daily basis, suggesting the probability of a rally. If the bullishness persists, BCH may hit the 23.60 Fibonacci barrier in an attempt to recoup pre-FTX levels. However, if bears outnumber bulls, BCH may breach the 61.80 Fib level.

In March, FTX’s U.S. arm proposed to merge traditionally separate roles of trading and clearing in directly settling certain crypto derivatives contracts, but the empire of then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried now lies in tatters after CoinDesk revealed an unusually tight relationship between FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research.  “There are elements of the application that I think have merit, but ultimately we didn't come up with a decision,” Behnam said at an event in London hosted by the Financial Times. “We were actually not even close, because there were more questions,” he added, citing issues of law, policy and risk.  FTX said it wanted to allow customers to assess and respond to derivatives risks in real time, but withdrew its plans on the same day it filed for bankruptcy, Nov. 11. In October, Behnam, after pushback from the traditional-financial sector, called the idea “unique” and potentially another phase in financial market innovation.  Behnam defended the close contacts between FTX staff and his own officials as they discussed the ideas.  “FTX and its management team came in quite frequently,” Behnam said. “As the chairman of the agency, I wanted to be squarely involved to make sure that I was seeing what was happening in terms of the process,” with all parties able to participate, he said.  “We at the CFTC had a legal responsibility to respond to the application,” he said. “We can't just rubber-stamp yes or no, we have to have a legal basis. It has to be anchored in the law.”  Read more: With FTX Bloodied, Rival in US Regulatory Fight Adds Another Knife",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/28/ftx-direct-clearing-plan-was-not-even-close-to-decision-cftc-chief-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03c18d4ae157a3086ff440ab66b16c8f632fc1ba-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin lost 2% of its market value. In the past week, BTC has hovered around the same price region. The King Coin has not touched the $17,000 price resistance band in more than two weeks. At the moment, Bitcoin has a bearish bias. The technical outlook pointed towards the buying strength losing steam. It is, however, too early to predict when BTC will bottom out, which could mean that this consolidation phase will be extended. The price of Bitcoin has been extremely volatile throughout November. BTC witnessed a fall from $21,000 to $15,500 during the first week of this month. The coin had again visited these lows in the past week. After touching the lows again, BTC regained some of its lost value and traded at $16,500. BTC is yet to breach two vital price levels for the bulls to take charge in the market. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Registers Bearish Divergence, What’s Incoming? Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $16,200 at the time of writing. The bulls have tried to break past the $17k mark but have met with rejection each time. The constant rejection has halted the further upward movement of the coin as it ascended from $15,500 to $16,800. The immediate resistance mark for Bitcoin remained at $16,600. In a shorter time frame, Bitcoin has been forming a constriction pattern. If Bitcoin continues to face rejection at the $17,000 mark, it will fall through the $15,500 level and trade close to the $14,000 price. The two important levels for Bitcoin stand at $16,600 and $17,000, respectively. Technical Analysis BTC has depicted a fall in buyers on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark, indicating that the coin was in the grasp of the bears. It indicated that sellers were more than buyers. The Bitcoin price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average, which highlighted selling strength and showed that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. If BTC breaches the $17,000 level, it remains important for the coin to trade above the $17,200 level; failing to do that, the price action can quickly reverse. BTC has slowly started to form a buy signal on its one-day chart. This indicates that Bitcoin might try to reclaim the $17,000 mark if buyers act on it. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence underwent a bullish crossover and formed green signal bars corresponding to the buy signal. Bollinger Bands depict price fluctuation and volatility, the bands were narrowed in anticipation of further price movement constriction in the shorter-time frame.

Grossman announced via Twitter that he is to become MoonPay's president of enterprise following a three-plus year tenure as TIME's president.  The move had been reported previously by CNBC.  Under his presidency, TIME embraced digital asset adoption, accepting crypto as a method of payment for subscriptions and holding ether (ETH) on its balance sheet as part of a deal with investment firm Galaxy Digital. The firm also launched its TIMEPieces Initiatve, a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) showcasing original artwork.  MoonPay is a crypto payments infrastructure firm which allows users to exchange traditional fiat currencies and crypto using mainstream methods of payment such as debit cards, credit cards Apple Pay and Google Pay.  It has also acted as a dealer for NFT purchases by celebrities such as Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. These two celebs, along with a slew of others including Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Drake, Ashton Kutcher and Gal Gadot, joined MoonPay's $555 million Series A funding round a year ago.  Grossman's move may demonstrate that despite the uncertain circumstances currently surrounding the digital asset industry, crypto and blockchain enthusiasm enthusiasm remains strong among many in established mainstream industries.  ""I'm a contrarian by nature,"" Grossman told CoinDesk TV's First Mover on Monday morning.  ""At the moment, while prices might be down, there's a lot of exciting things happening. In the last three months alone, you've seen Starbucks, Nike and Universal Studios enter the space, many of which have been done with MoonPay.""

42413558,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9sYE,1669640955,Centralized Crypto Exchanges Will Remain Dominant Despite FTX Collapse: JPMorgan,"Centralized exchanges will continue to control the majority of global digital-asset trading volumes, JPMorgan said, contradicting some crypto-native experts who expect a shift toward decentralized platforms in the wake of FTX's collapse.  Decentralized exchanges' (DEX) slower transaction speeds, pooling of assets and order-traceability features are likely to limit institutional participation, the bank's strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.  The analysts also cited the absence of a limit order/stop loss feature on DEXs, their dependency on price oracles that source data from centralized exchanges, vulnerability to hacks, exploits, the need for over-collateralization and systemic risks from the cascade of automated liquidations as hindrances to widespread adoption.  ""Risk/return trade-off more difficult to assess in DeFi (decentralized finance) given the use of different tokens in terms of assets borrowed or lent/collateral posted/received interest payments and given the general absence of limit order/stop loss functionality,"" the team noted. ""The management, governance and auditing of DeFi protocols without compromising too much on security and centralization is a big challenge.""  Since Sam Bankman-Fried's centralized exchange FTX went bust, activity on decentralized exchanges has picked up, with DefiLlama data showing trading volumes on decentralized platforms up 68% to $97.22 billion this month from October, the highest since May.  Many observers read that as a sign of waning confidence in centralized exchanges and the beginning of a long-lasting shift to democratized finance.  ""With users' confidence in [centralized exchanges] shaken following the collapse of FTX, and the resilience DEXs have shown to the contagion in the market, we expect increased adoption of DEXs in the coming months among market participants,"" CryptoCompare's Hosam Mahmoud said in a report published on Nov. 23.  While acknowledging the recent uptick in DEX trading volume, JPMorgan doesn't think it's the start of any kind of sizable long-term trend.  ""While there has been some increase in the share of DEX in overall crypto trading activity in recent weeks, this is more likely to reflect the collapse in crypto prices and the deleveraging/automatic liquidations that followed the FTX collapse,"" the bank's analyst team said.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/28/centralized-crypto-exchanges-will-remain-dominant-despite-ftx-collapse-jpmorgan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9549c2488244cbc40b3e32bdf00368e88e668232-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

4878365,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510288,1669640149,"Litecoin Price Registers Bearish Divergence, What’s Incoming?","After the FTX crash on November 9, Litecoin’s price began a significant upward price movement. Investors continue to remain in profit. However, a downswing could be on the way. This might not necessarily be the end of the bulls just yet. Although LTC is moving south after registering a 7.1% fall on the daily chart, regarding weekly gains, the Litecoin price has held onto its 16% appreciation. The bears have now entered the market and halted the uptrend. A jump above the immediate resistance mark over the next trading session will pause the bears again. On the daily chart, the Litecoin price has formed a bearish divergence. This often signals an incoming sell-off in the market. Since buyers continue to overpower sellers on the chart, a recovery from the sell-off should not be difficult. A move above the $75 mark can also fuel another rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Is Near, But A Drop To This Level Is Possible, Renowned Analyst Says Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LTC was auctioning for $71 at press time. Over the last 24 hours, LTC displayed that its week-old bullish momentum was waning. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $73. If buyers remain present, the coin might revisit the aforementioned level. It remains to be seen if LTC can stay above $73. On the other hand, a fall from the $73 price mark can drag the altcoin to $65. Since investors are still optimistic about LTC, recovery should be swift. In that event, Litecoin can fall to $61 and then to $58. A quick recovery could propel the altcoin’s price to $93, and then LTC could reach the psychological price ceiling of $100. Technical Analysis The technical outlook of LTC has remained optimistic and is yet to capture the recent bearish sentiments. LTC, however, has formed a bearish divergence on the chart. Bearish divergence is followed by a sell-off. The Relative Strength Index noted a downtick and was below the 60-mark, indicating that buyers are decreasing in number but are still outnumbering sellers. The price of Litecoin was pictured above the 20-Simple Moving Average as the coin still remains profitable. Buyers were driving the price momentum. This also pointed out that Litecoin should be able to bounce back soon in case of a sell-off. Litecoin’s indicators depicted the same outlook in correspondence with more buyers than sellers. The Chaikin Money Flow, which indicates capital inflows, was above the half-line, which meant that investors were accumulating the altcoin. The Average Directional Index also sided with the buyers; it depicts the strength of the price momentum. ADX was slightly above the 20-mark, which meant that the price momentum was gaining strength at the time of writing.

42413564,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9sem,1669639909,JPMorgan: Push to Regulate Crypto to Accelerate After FTX’s Collapse,"Crypto market regulatory initiatives that are already underway are likely to be accelerated in the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and sister company Alameda Research, JPMorgan said in a research report Thursday.  For example, after the European Parliament gives final approval to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill, it will take 18 months before the regulation takes effect but FTX's collapse could shorten the timeline, the report said.  The bank notes that U.S. regulatory initiatives garnered more interest after the Terra network collapsed in May because of a “perceived need for increased oversight and consumer protections.” The collapse of crypto exchange FTX this month is also likely to lead to a greater sense of urgency.  Regulatory initiatives are likely to emerge focusing on custody and protection of customers’ digital assets, the unbundling of broker/trading/lending/clearing/custody activities, and transparency and the reporting of reserves, assets and liabilities, the note said.  JPMorgan says crypto derivatives trading will probably shift to regulated venues, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will likely to benefit from that change.  The bank says it is “skeptical of a structural shift” away from centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges (DEXes). DEXes wouldn't work for the size of orders coming from larger institutions because of slower transaction speeds or because the institutions’ trading strategies and order size would be traceable on the blockchain, the note said.

To date, the exchange rate has reached $1,170.49. Data from CoinGecko shows that the coin has been trading at a loss on a weekly basis. Related Reading: Tron Latest Update Seen Giving TRX Price A Boost – Here’s Why Here’s a quick glance at how ETH has been performing: The price of ether is currently below the $1.2k range Investors are preparing to sell, as shown by the high exchange netflows If the bears manage to push beyond the $1,152 support level, the next important support is located at the $906 level After initially plunging as rumors of an impending FTX collapse hit the market, the price eventually settled into a sideways trend and has remained there since. However, the trading range for this sideways movement is beginning to contract. The formation of a relief rally is being jeopardized by the current trading range. More losses are on the way for the Ethereum market, therefore would-be buyers and sellers of ETH should proceed with caution. Ethereum Relief Rally In The Offing? As the Bollinger band constricts around the $1,199 price range, the chance of a relief rally increases. ETH has been trading between $1,306 and $1,092.85 as of this writing. As the Bollinger band shrank, so would this. In addition, CryptoQuant observes a high exchange netflow, which indicates an increase in exchange reserves. This signifies that traders and dealers are preparing to sell their ETH. The RSI statistics provide support for the bears. Currently, the data are crossing each other bearishly and going towards the oversold region. However, when the RSI recovers over the next few days or weeks, investors and traders could use this to their advantage for a little price increase. In contrast, the MFI indicator swings in opposition to the downward trend, indicating a possible turnaround. Steering Clear Of The Ascending Triangle Previous price fluctuations have produced an ascending triangle with a narrow base. This is followed by a bearish breakout, which in this case might occur around $1,152. ETH bulls should then keep an eye on the $1,152 support, as a breach here might portend further losses. A bearish breach below the indicated support level will likely bring the price below ETH’s important support at $906. Despite the fact that such a decline would be catastrophic for ETH investors, short positions would profit substantially in an otherwise unfriendly crypto market.

In the high timeframe, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) looks heavy toward a downtrend movement compared to an upside. Despite the relief bounce and uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, the FTX fiasco continues to act as a catalyst for the market to bottom out. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other large investors has stalled the market, as it has yet to make a significant move, raising concerns about the market’s direction. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Avoid a Major Drop if it Closes Above $1,250 Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart Despite the relief bounce across the market, with the price of BTC rallying from a weekly low of $15,500 to a high of $17,000, the crypto market remains in an uncertain and turbulent state that has affected the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Many altcoins are struggling for survival, trying to stay afloat as the prices of altcoins continue a downward price movement. BTC’s price had a weekly close below a crucial area of $16,500 after showing so much strength rallying to a high of $17,000, where its price was rejected from trending higher. After BTC’s price declined from a weekly high of $17,000 to a region of $16,200, the price has struggled to regain such strength it has rallying to this high with more speculation of price retesting the region of $14,000 if the price of BTC closes below its previous monthly close of $19,000. Weekly resistance for the price of BTC – $16,500. Weekly support for the price of BTC – $15,000-$14,000. Price Analysis Of BTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BTC remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe after closing below $16,500. With BTC’s price unable to break above $17,000, there are high chances of price retesting the regions of $15,500, where the price was bought up instantly from going lower. BTC’s price currently trades at $16,200 below the 50 and 200 EMA, acting as resistance for the price of BTC from trading higher. The price of BTC needs to break above $18,500 and $24,000 for the price of BTC to kickstart the price recovery plan. If the price of BTC fails to flip the region of $18,500 and $24,000 corresponds to 50 and 200 EMA and gets rejected below $15,000, we could see more rejections for BTC price to a region of $14,000 and even lower. Daily resistance for the BTC price – $17,000. Daily support for the BTC price – $15,500.

The memecoin’s price reached the $0.0945 on Monday, in the midst of the shockwave brought about by FTX’s implosion. Despite the strain, DOGE still proved its resilience at it soared 25 percent in the last week, data from Coingecko show, Monday. Here’s a quick rundown as DOGE fights back against the bear market: There is a chance that by 2023, DOGE will be worth $1 The technical indicators are quite optimistic, displaying many strong levels of support In order to break through to $0.1265, bulls should look to $0.1076 and $0.1186. DOGE is trading at $0.0955 on a red candle. Bulls are optimistic that 2023 will be the year DOGE reaches the magical $1 level, thanks to the announcement by ETH co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk that they are working on an update for the memecoin. Related Reading: Polkadot Soars 8% In Last 24 Hours Courtesy Of Its Dev’t Activity, NFT Ecosystem Growth Can Dogecoin Sustain Its Positive Pace? Since DOGE has been performing better than Bitcoin and Ethereum in the market rebound, the coin’s technicals are looking highly positive. The bulls have the backing of the Bollinger band, and the expansion of the band’s middle band provides dynamic support at $0.0848. Increased volatility from a wider Bollinger band increases the probability of a price rally. Chart: TradingView The EMA ribbon supports the rally throughout all significant time scales. Currently, the price action indicates the overbought side of the RSI, which bulls must monitor. However, bulls might position themselves at $0.0890, which is the current price movement’s support. The money flow indicator validates the recent price action, strengthening the positive feeling. Long-term bullish strength is demonstrated by the regression channel’s output of 0.14. If this uptrend persists, bulls should aim for $0.1076, the major level of resistance that, if breached, would finally support the bull run. Secondary objective would be $0.1186, resulting in a final objective of $0.1265 This would inevitably recover lost ground from the DOGE catastrophe earlier this month. DOGE & The Challenging Path To $1 Current market activity will inevitably increase investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. Not to mention reports of DOGE being utilized in Twitter payments, which, if this momentum continues, will eventually bring the price near or above $1.

4873995,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510250,1669630609,"Bitcoin Bottom Is Near, But A Drop To This Level Is Possible, Renowned Analyst Says","After Bitcoin failed to sustainably overcome the important resistance at $16,600 within the last five days, the price saw a renewed pullback a few hours ago. A week ago, on November 21, the BTC price fell to a new bear market low of $15,480, after which the price saw a spike, which, however, came to an abrupt end, questioning the strength of the bulls. At press time, BTC was trading at $16.195 and initially found support at $16.050. If the closest resistance at $16.310 does not turn back into support, a retest of the current bear market low could be on the cards. Bitcoin Bottom Still Not In? Meanwhile, well-known on-chain analyst Willy Woo has told his 1 million followers that a Bitcoin bottom could be near. The analyst is using three on-chain data models to come to this conclusion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: This Scenario Will Trigger A Fresh Drop As Woo writes, the CVDD floor price is currently being tested. The model examines alternatives to the market price. Dashed lines mean the model is purely technical, meaning it uses only the market price as an input. Solid lines include metrics that come from the blockchain, meaning they include investor, network, and user behavior fundamentals. Ultimately, the model created by Woo in April 2019 uses the age and value of Bitcoin moving to new investors to create a floor. Woo’s theory: “When significantly old coins (say bought at $100) pass to new investors (say at $16k), the market perceives a higher floor.” Currently, the model with a proven track record is showing a second retest. The max pain model also signals that the Bitcoin bottom is coming closer. Historically, the Bitcoin price reaches its bottom of a macro cycle when 58%-61% of the coins are in the loss zone. Whenever the price has fallen into the green zone, it marked a floor. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rallies As Price Breaks Major Resistance; Here Is Why $0.15 Is Possible “The upper limit of the shaded area is at 13k and rising rapidly,” Woo said. Thus, another price drop could be possible, although the analyst also stressed that not all lows were reached, with “those that weren’t were close.” Third, Woo looked at the MVRV ratio. This represents the ratio between the market cap and realized cap. Its purpose is to show when the exchange-traded price is below “fair value” and to identify the highs and lows of the market. Analyzing the MVRV ratio, Woo states: MVRV ratio is deep inside the value zone. Under this signal we were in already bottoming (1) until the latest FTX white swan debacle brought us back into a buy zone (2). Overall, Woo sees the possibility that the bottom could mean a little more pain for Bitcoin investors. He also points out that the market is in an “unprecedented deleveraging scenario,” putting all models to the test. Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Causing Max Pain? As Glassnode’s senior on-chain analyst Checkmate noted via Twitter, Bitcoin miners could be a reason for more pain as they have run into serious trouble in recent months.

The price is now trading below $1,180 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bearish momentum if there is no clear move above $1,230 and $1,250. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price attempted an upside break above the $1,230 resistance. However, ETH failed to gain pace and stayed below the $1,250 resistance. There was a fresh bearish reaction from the $1,235 high, similar to bitcoin. There was a move below the $1,210 and $1,200 support levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The bears pushed the pair towards the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,073 swing low to $1,235 high. Ether price is now trading below $1,180 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems to be consolidating near the $1,170 level. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,200 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $1,230 level. The main hurdle sits near the $1,250 level. To start a decent increase and avoid more losses, the price must settle above $1,250. In the stated case, ether price may perhaps rise towards the $1,320 resistance zone. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1,400 resistance zone. More Losses in ETH? If ethereum fails to climb above the $1,200 resistance, it could continue to move down. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,155 level. The next major support is near the $1,135 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,073 swing low to $1,235 high, below which ether price may perhaps gain bearish momentum.

42413587,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9vuq,1669602687,Bahamas' Attorney General Defends Country's Regulatory Regime Amid FTX 'Debacle',"The Bahamas ""is a nation of laws,"" the country's attorney general said, defending the nation's actions in the wake of crypto exchange FTX's collapse.  During a 23 minute pre-taped speech, Ryan Pinder, who is also a senator and the minister for legal affairs, summarized FTX's collapse and alluded to the Bahamas' government's actions, while also seeking to reassure investors and tourists that the country was a safe place to visit and operate a business.  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried liked and retweeted the Office of the Prime Minister of the Bahamas' tweet on the speech. Bankman-Fried moved FTX's headquarters to the Bahamas last year.  The Securities Commission of the Bahamas moved ""swiftly"" by suspending FTX Digital Markets' license, appointing provisional liquidators and later on, securing FTX Digital Markets' assets ""to be held on behalf of and for the benefit and restitution of clients and creditors of FTX,"" Pinder said.  ""It is important for me to share this summary of what took place, because over the last few weeks, the basic facts have been obscured by guessing games and rumors,"" Pinder said. ""We understand the enormous interest in this story, but as a government, we decided right away that what was most important was not to engage with speculation or gossip, but instead to proceed methodically and deliberately in accordance with the exercise of due process and the rule of law.""  Pinder reiterated that the Bahamas won't share further information about ongoing civil and criminal investigations of FTX for fear of compromising the probes.  The official also echoed the commission's previous remarks complaining that new FTX CEO John Ray III ""misrepresented"" the government's actions. In a court filing, Ray and FTX's attorneys accused the Bahamas' government of ordering ""unauthorized"" transactions. The commission claimed that the actions were taken to protect FTX's funds.  ""We urge all authorities here and abroad at a minimum to exercise at least the same amount of prudence and restraint in their public commentary as we do so as not to prejudice any of the proceedings that are ongoing,"" Pinder said.  ""It is extremely regrettable that in chapter 11 filings for bankruptcy protection made in New York last week that the new chief executive of FTX Trading Limited – not the Bahamas-based FTX Digital Markets, but an affiliate company incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda – misrepresented the timely action taken by the Securities Commission and used inaccurate allegations lodged in the transfer motion they had filed to do so.""  ""It is possible that the prospect of multimillion dollar legal and consultancy fees is driving both their legal strategy and their intemperate statements.""  The bulk of Pinder's speech focused on arguing that the Bahamas' regulatory regime was sufficient to oversee crypto businesses. He claimed that no other regulator could move as quickly as the Securities Commission had and said there are no global standards for crypto regulation.  Pinder also appeared to take a dig at the turf war in the U.S. between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by referring to countries that lack regulators with statutory authority to oversee crypto markets. He asserted that the Bahamas maintains ""global leadership"" as a tourism destination and jurisdiction for startups.  Ratings agency Standard and Poor's has forecast a ""stable outlook"" for the country's economy, anticipating ""no material adverse impact"" from FTX's collapse, Pinder said  ""Any attempt to lay the entirety of this debacle at the feet of the Bahamas, because FTX is headquartered here would be a gross oversimplification of reality,"" he said. ""We have been shocked at the ignorance of those who have said that FTX came to the Bahamas because they did not want to submit to regulatory scrutiny.""  FTX filed for bankruptcy earlier this month after the exchange imploded. Its collapse was triggered by a CoinDesk report that called into question the stability of Alameda Research, a trading firm affiliated with FTX.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/28/the-bahamas-attorney-general-defends-countrys-regulatory-regime-amid-ftx-debacle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a4cbc0b1a80d54eec814f772458fc4be3069c57-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
